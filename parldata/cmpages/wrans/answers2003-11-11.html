<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what discussions he has had with <i>(a)</i> BA and <i>(b)</i> other carriers operating from UK airports concerning lost and misrouted luggage; and if he will make a statement.  [137852]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Government have not been involved in any recent discussions with airlines regarding lost or misrouted luggage. However, all the major full service UK airlines have signed up to the European Voluntary Commitments on Air Passenger Rights, which were launched in February 2002. These contain non-legally binding commitments to deliver defined standards of service to air travellers.
<P>

<a name="31111w01.html_para0">Signatory airlines agree to make every reasonable effort to deliver mishandled bags to the passenger within 24 hours of their arrival at the final destination, free of charge. In addition, airlines undertake to offer immediate assistance sufficient to meet the reasonable short-term needs of passengers faced with missing baggage.
<P>

<a name="31111w01.html_para1">Where luggage has been lost, the 1929 Warsaw Convention places a general liability on the airline, although this liability is limited in respect of compensatory rights. The 1999 Montreal Convention will update the maximum level of damages payable for lost or damaged baggage to approximately &#163;850 per passenger.

<a name="31111w01.html_sbhd1"><H3 align=center>Bechtel</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w01.html_wqn1"><B> Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will list the contracts for consultancy and other work carried out by Bechtel in each year since 1997 by his Department's predecessors in areas relating to transport, stating in each case <i>(a)</i> the nature of the work, <i>(b)</i> the value of the contract and <i>(c)</i> the duration of the contract; and if he will make a statement.  [137737]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Neither the Department for Transport nor its predecessors has awarded any contracts to Bechtel since 1997 in areas relating to Transport.

<a name="31111w01.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>London Underground</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w01.html_wqn2"><B> Harry Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport whether the sharing of windfall profits was the subject of negotiations with the infrastructure companies in the London Underground Public Private Partnership contracts; whether provision is made for windfall profits in the contracts; and if he will make a statement.  [137521]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Windfall profits were considered in the negotiations between London Underground and the PPP consortia.
<P>

<a name="31111w01.html_para2">The contracts provide the infrastructure companies reasonable certainty that they will receive a level of payment sufficient to earn an agreed rate of return if they are economic and efficient in delivering the services. The periodic reviews, every 7&#189; years, by the independent PPP Arbiter will, among other things, aim to enable the infrastructure companies to earn an agreed rate of return for the next period, while providing efficient and economic delivery of their services and take account of the rate of return earned in previous period.
<P>

<a name="31111w01.html_para3">The contracts specify that in the event of the infrastructure company re-financing its debt, London Underground Ltd. would receive a share of any benefit.

<a name="31111w01.html_sbhd3"><H3 align=center>Performance Monitoring</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Flight: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the total cost was of <i>(a)</i> setting, <i>(b)</i> monitoring and <i>(c)</i> measuring the performance targets for his Department in 2002&#150;03; and how many and what grades of civil servants monitor these targets.  [137958]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Performance targets for the department were agreed as part of Spending Review 2002. The monitoring and measurement of PSA targets forms part of departmental performance management. Performance management is an integral part of the day to day running of the department, and as such it is not possible to separate out the specific costs. The monitoring of progress towards, and performance against, the department's PSA targets is undertaken by a wide variety of staff at all levels of the organisation.

<a name="31111w01.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Railway Violence</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Lazarowicz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many incidents of violence on railway trains have been reported to British Transport Police in the last three years for which figures are available, broken down by operating company.  [137190]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The British Transport Police (BTP) does not record crime statistics broken down by train operating company. However, the BTP have provided information regarding incidents of violence on trains for the last four years. Table 1 shows the total number of offences reported in England and Wales and Table 2 shows the total number of offences reported in Scotland.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your recent questions asking: what action will be taken in response to the recent report by the Statistics Commission on the accuracy of the 2001 census for the Westminster City Council area (136989), whether the Statistics Commission will be asked to investigate the accuracy of the 2001 census count in Blackpool (136990) and what assessment has been made of the implications for the reliability of the census population statistics for Blackpool of the recent Statistics Commission report on the accuracy of the 2001 census for Westminster. (136991)</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to take forward the recommendations from the report by the Statistics Commission on the accuracy of the 2002 census for Westminster. ONS has welcomed this report and is considering what action is required. The Statistics Commission has made several recommendations about how ONS should proceed with Westminster, and recognised that this work was already underway. A report on the Westminster and Manchester exercise is planned for Spring 2004.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Statistics Commission report on the Census in Westminster concluded that no alternative approach would have produced more reliable results overall and that it seems likely that the 2001 Census was significantly better than any of its recent predecessors. The Statistics Commission's report does make a number of recommendations for further work that should be carried out by ONS but the Commission made no proposals about which ONS had not already published our intention to act or to carry out further research.</FONT></UL>

<a name="31111w02.html_para3">The Council endorsed the Economic Policy Committee (EPC) report on the impact of ageing populations on public finances and confirmed the mandate to EPC to produce new common budgetary projections by mid-2005 on the basis of approach outlined in the EPC report. The Council also invited the EPC to produce a study on economic incentives affecting retirement. I led the orientation debate on the Transparency Directive and expressed strong concerns about the regulatory burden of introducing mandatory quarterly reporting across the EU. I supported the principle of transparency but stressed the importance of balance between it and burdensome reporting requirements.

 Public bodies are required to operate financial controls that ensure public monies are properly accounted for and that the risks of systematic and systemic overcharging, financial abuse and fraud are minimized and that value for money is secured. A key requirement of this financial control is that there should be a clear audit trail with sufficient supporting documentation at all key stages.
<P>

<a name="31111w03.html_para7">The National Audit Office's role is to enable the Comptroller and Auditor General to certify my Department's financial statements and to examine and report to Parliament on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of my Department's resources. As such they enabled the C&AG to certify and report on the expenditure incurred by my Department in respect of the (i) 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease and (ii) subsequent clear-up operations as recorded in my Department's resource accounts for the years 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02. The National Audit Office also enabled the C&AG to examine and report on whether the Department acted in a cost-effective manner and whether there were adequate controls against irregularity. Their recommendations are contained in their report "The 2001 Outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease" published by The Stationery Office and available also on the NAO website&#151;www.nao.gov.uk. The House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts published on 14 March 2003 its Fifth Report of Session 2002- 03&#151;the 2001 Outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease&#151;covering the report, together with Proceedings of the Committee, Minutes of Evidence and an Appendix.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="31111w04.html_para0">The Food Labelling Regulations 1996 (as amended) require potatoes sold in shops and supermarkets to be labelled with the potato variety. Enforcement of these labelling requirements is the responsibility of local authorities. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has funded the development of a robust DNA method to check whether potato variety information is accurate. In a United Kingdom-wide survey published in October, the FSA found that 96 out of 294 (33 per cent.) samples were not labelled correctly. These results have been passed to the relevant local authorities, which are taking appropriate action.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the risks of market distortion if Scotland or Wales were to apply a different policy from England in respect of the decoupling of livestock support payments.  [132632]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w04.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Full decoupling of livestock subsidies frees producers to farm in response to market demands. It ensures that resources may be released to undertake more profitable activities rather than being constrained to activities which generate low value added, in order to be eligible for subsidy. The removal of the constraint on producers' choice allows them to alter their activities in order to generate increased incomes or, if they wish, to continue with their current production patterns.
<P>

<a name="31111w04.html_para1">These benefits to producers are independent of any action in other parts of the UK because full decoupling removes the constraints on their business decisions but does not force them to change their activities. It is in producers' best interests in one part of the UK to benefit from full decoupling irrespective of the choices made in other parts. However, if the whole of the UK does not opt for full decoupling then the overall benefits to the economy will be diminished.

A further 350 potential projects have been identified and it is estimated that up to ten times that number of companies in the region could benefit from DDA assistance.

 The range of specialisms provided by reservists to support Operation Telic broadly reflects those possessed by the Regular Forces plus a number of specialist areas unique to the Reserves.

<a name="31111w04.html_para5">The individual reservist who has served longest in Iraq is an Army military intelligence specialist who was called-out for service on 2 February 2003 and who has volunteered to extend his period of service to 2 August 2004.

<P>
<a name="31111w05.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Peter Duncan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence to what type of radiation <i>(a)</i> submariners and <i>(b)</i> radiation workers are exposed when they leave radiation-controlled areas on board submarines.  [137697]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 Both submariners and radiation workers leaving radiation-controlled areas may be exposed to very low levels of gamma and neutron radiation on board the submarine, if the reactor is operating. The construction of the submarine, and controls on occupancy of all areas, ensure that the amount of such radiation received by personnel is below Ministry of Defence's self-imposed limits, which are themselves well below all legal limits. If the reactor is shut down, the gamma and neutron radiation falls to natural background radiation levels.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="31111w05.html_para5">Work with depleted uranium is governed by the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 (IRR99) enforced by the Health and Safety Executive and any employer working with depleted uranium has duties under those regulations.
<P>

<a name="31111w05.html_para6">The use of depleted uranium as a counter weight installed in aircraft wings presents little radiological risk and so few, if any health protection measures are required by the IRR99. It is only when the depleted uranium is machined or in some way dispersed as a dust that, because it can be inhaled or ingested, it presents any significant radiological risk. The IRR99 would then require protection measures such as adequate local ventilation and/or the use of appropriate respiratory protection and protective clothing to minimise those risks.

 The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 are enforced by local Trading Standards Offices who work closely with the packaging industry and producers to advise them on best practice in packaging design and to resolve complaints of excessive packaging. A recent study commissioned by the DTI highlights the extensive changes brought about since the introduction of the Essential Requirements. These relate to improvements in packaging design, including minimisation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the future of the Government's textile strategy after the end of import quotas in 2005.  [137349]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The UK textiles and clothing industry faces tough challenges. The way for this vibrant and innovative industry to secure the future, despite the very real competition faced from China and other low cost suppliers, is through investment, continual innovation, diversifying into new markets or products, more efficient production methods and continually raising its game to remain competitive.
<P>

<a name="31111w06.html_para5">My Department is working with the industry-led Textiles and Clothing Strategy Group, which aims to build a sustainable future for the UK industry by increasing its competitiveness to meet the challenges of globalisation and the impact of the final stage in the phasing out of import quotas in 2005. This work is underpinned by my Department's Manufacturing Strategy, which is helping to ensure that UK manufacturers have the right conditions for growth and sustainability to enable them to improve productivity and to move up the value chain to high skilled, knowledge intensive operations.

<a name="31111w06.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The European Union currently imposes import quotas on imports of certain textiles and clothing products from 19 supplier countries. Under the terms of the GATT/WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) a ten-year quota phase-out from 1995 is underway and will be completed on 31 December 2004. From 1 January 2005 quotas will only remain on textiles and clothing imports from a small number of non-WTO member countries (e.g. Vietnam, north Korea, Belorus). No assessment of the effects of quota removal specifically on the UK has been made, though an EU-wide assessment is due to be released early in 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what tariffs are in place on the import of textiles; what assessment she has made of the future of the tariff system after 2005; and what tariffs are imposed on the import of textiles outside the EU.  [137351]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w06.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 As a result of the GATT/WTO Uruguay Trade Agreement, maximum EU tariffs on imports of textiles and clothing from 1 January 2004 will be 0 per cent. for textile raw materials, 4 per cent. for yarns, 8 per cent. for fabrics and 12 per cent. for clothing and other made-up items (such as blankets). This represents a small reduction on current rates: a maximum 4.6 per cent. for yarns, 8.2 per cent. for clothing and 12.2. per cent for clothing and made-up items. No further change in the tariff system is expected until the results of the Doha Development Agenda are implemented when we hope to see a significant reduction in global industrial tariffs. EU tariffs are among the lowest in the world in the textile and clothing sector in which tariffs of over 30 per cent. are not uncommon.

<P>

<a name="31111w07.html_para0">We are working closely with other international donors to consolidate the peace in Angola and prevent future conflicts; help secure a political system which allows people to influence state policy and practice; and working to influence a basic change in the Government of Angola's approach in the areas of transparency, economic governance and the development of policies to tackle poverty.
<P>

<a name="31111w07.html_para1">In the short term, we will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to meet the immediate needs of destitute people and to contribute towards de-mining to facilitate resettlement and economic and social recovery.

<a name="31111w07.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 So long as the transition process remains on track, DFID is planning a significant increase in support to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) over the period 2003&#150;06, with a view to helping DRC make progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.
<P>

<a name="31111w07.html_para2">We have recently informed the Transitional National Government (TNG) of the DRC, and made public, a significant increase in our programme for DRC to &#163;23 million for 2003&#150;04, following the installation of the TNG this summer. The UK is working with other bilateral donors and multi-lateral agencies to ensure a coordinated response to the needs of the DRC. In 2002&#150;03, in addition to &#163;16 million in bilateral assistance, the UK contributed approximately &#163;9 million through the EU, &#163;26 million through the World Bank and &#163;36 million through the UN agencies (including the United Nations Mission to DRC).
<P>

<a name="31111w07.html_para3">Ensuring a successful transition process, including the successful embedding of the TNG, is crucial to our overall goal of ensuring peace and poverty reduction in the DRC and through that, the region as a whole. As a member of the Kinshasa-based International Committee for Support to the Transition, we are pressing for a well developed and shared understanding between donors and government of the transition process, as well as strong day-to-day co-ordination of donor support.
<P>

<a name="31111w07.html_para4">We are providing direct support for the basic infrastructure needs of the Transition Institutions, which include the Offices of the President and the four Vice Presidents, Government, Parliament, Senate, Supreme Court and the five Democracy Support Commissions (Elections, Human Rights, Truth and Reconciliation, Anti-Corruption and Media). We have provided technical assistance for the drawing up of a national

We are also looking at providing some civil service capacity building support to the Government with UNDP and other donors.
<P>

<a name="31111w07.html_para5">It is crucial for DRC and the wider Great Lakes region that the transition process remains on track. We are therefore making continued efforts to strengthen and consolidate peace, which include humanitarian support, disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of ex-combatants, army, police and justice sector reform, and grassroots peace-building.

 The UK is seeking to help resolve conflict and establish conditions for genuine development in the whole of the Great Lakes region. We have maintained a close dialogue with the former Government and now the Transitional National Government (TNG) in Kinshasa and with the Governments of Rwanda and Uganda on the need for good neighbourly relations as the basis for national and regional stability. We continue to do so.
<P>

<a name="31111w07.html_para6">Both Rwanda and Uganda have taken positive steps recently to normalise their relations with the TNG in DRC, including mutual ministerial visits and the signing in New York on 25 September 2003 of a Good Neighbourly Pact, which included commitments that all support for armed groups should end and that there should be no illegal exploitation of natural resources of the DRC.

 Today there are over 40,000 police on duty in Iraq, the first battalion of the new Iraqi Army has graduated and is on active duty, a major police recruitment and training exercise is under way, and a new police academy has opened in Basra. Over 30 countries (in addition to the UK and US) have a total of 16,000 troops on the ground in Iraq, as part of the international stabilisation effort.
<P>

<a name="31111w07.html_para8">Although the security situation has restricted the activities of the international staff of aid agencies, politicians, coalition officials and Iraqi citizens are able to go about their business. Progress is being made in promoting democracy and undertaking reconstruction. Political parties are forming, the Iraqi media is now free and many newspapers are appearing, and civil society organisations are emerging. Ministries are functioning and plans are being formed to modernise the civil service. In addition, Iraqi business is beginning to grow, infrastructure is being restored and service delivery is improving. Donors have also been undertaking needs assessments and are making arrangements for funding following the successful Madrid Conference.

 Worldwide, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimated that 840 million people were undernourished in 1998&#150;2000. These figures include 11 million in the industrialised countries, 30 million in countries in transition and 799 million in the developing world. There is no single measure of nutrition levels: different indicators measure different aspects of nutrition. The attached table, based on data in the World Bank's 2003 World Development Indicators, gives figures for three of these indicators where they are available.

<a name="31111w07.html_para9">Recent reports from West Darfur, Sudan, using rapid assessment techniques indicate very high levels of malnutrition among people displaced by conflict. Relief agencies are seeking, as a matter of urgency, to investigate further using standard assessment methodologies.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how many tourists he estimates will visit St. Helena in each year once <i>(a)</i> the breakwater and <i>(b)</i> the airport is completed.  [137227]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 No decisions have been made on whether to build a breakwater or an airport in St. Helena. The possibility of a breakwater, which the island authorities believe would provide safer and assured disembarkation and embarkation at all or most times from and to ships, is to be investigated further for technical and economic viability. For the latest position on possible establishment of air access, I would refer the hon. Gentleman to my Written Statement to this House on 16 September 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 43WS. Last year, 7,692 arrivals were recorded by St. Helena's Immigration Department. This figure included 5,362 persons landed from cruise ships. The rest included other tourists, business visitors and those visiting friends and families. Consultants estimated in 2001 that total arrival numbers could increase to 14,850 within five years of establishing access by air. The St. Helena Government estimates that largely assured disembarkation and embarkation of passengers from and to ships could alone more than double the number of cruise ship visitors to the island.

 The review will be wide-ranging, with full industry and public consultation, and I hope, be characterised by vigorous and open debate.

It will take into account Ofcom's review of public service broadcasting, Philip Graf's review of the on-line services, the forthcoming review of the BBC's digital TV and radio services, and numerous other strands of work. We will engage directly with the general public throughout the process on an unprecedented scale. I have appointed Lord Burns to give me independent advice throughout.

 As part of the Coalition Provisional Authority the UK regularly discusses security with the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) in a weekly committee. This often focuses on security for IGC members themselves. The CPA takes appropriate practical steps to meet requests made by Council members. The UK is unilaterally providing a protected vehicle to the IGC. However in the interests of security it would be inappropriate to give further details.

Hitherto, Indonesia has not permitted questioning of any of those indicted by the Serious Crimes Unit who are currently resident in Indonesia.

 We remain deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Uzbekistan and continue to raise our concerns both bilaterally and with EU partners. In addition, there are two particular ways in which we can monitor reform and exert pressure. The first is a set of benchmarks against which political and economic reforms will be measured, agreed in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's (EBRD) strategy for Uzbekistan. These will be reviewed by the EBRD later in the year. The second is the UN Special Rapporteur's Report on Torture in Uzbekistan, which referred to torture as "systematic". We shall continue to press the Uzbek authorities to implement his recommendations.
<P>

<a name="31111w11.html_para4">The UK is willing to provide assistance in the area of judicial reform and to assist Uzbekistan with broadening the investigative capacity of its police. Testing the Uzbek authorities' willingness to work with others to reform their behaviour is crucial. In Tashkent we are currently working with Human Rights organisations, the OSCE, UNDP and other embassies to push Uzbekistan to develop and implement a National Action Plan to Combat Torture.

 In the vast majority of cases, there is no tax requirement for occupational schemes to purchase an annuity, unlike personal pension plans. Just as the funding of the scheme is stipulated by the scheme rules, so the purchase of annuities is a matter for the administrators. They retain the flexibility of deciding how, when or if this should happen, and do so in consultation with members via the member-nominated trustees.

</TABLE>

<BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1><P>

<sup>(10)</sup> The table refers to the number of individuals whose stakeholder pension has received a contribution during the year.<P>

<P>

<sup>(11)</sup> Status is largely based on what is reported by an individual when making their opening application, or for existing business by the provider.<P>

<P>

<sup>(12)</sup> Earned income is derived from the Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) and consists of all income chargeable under Schedule E (mainly pay, private and occupational pensions, retirement annuities and state retirement pensions), Schedule D Cases I and II (self-employment income), and miscellaneous other earnings.<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The information in the table is taken from IR website statistics (Table T7.10.) It shows individuals contributing to a stakeholder pension, by status and earnings. The data are derived from a sample of annual returns of information submitted to the Inland Revenue by stakeholder pension providers. Numbers are rounded to nearest 10,000. Totals may not sum, due to rounding.<P>

2. The data are collected primarily for compliance purposes and contains details of contributions made by or on behalf of individuals.<P>

3. As well as containing individual details, such as name and date of birth, the data also contains their national insurance number. Using this it possible to aggregate across those who have arrangements with one or more providers. Therefore, unlike tables 7.4 and 7.5 which are based on aggregate returns from providers and are therefore at arrangement level, IR are able to present these results at an individual level. In addition the providers have to report the status of the individual<P>

in the following categories:<P>

Employee<P>

Pensioner<P>

Self-employed<P>

Child<P>

Carer of a child aged less than 16<P>

Carer of a person aged 16 or over<P>

In full-time education<P>

Unemployed<P>

Other<P>





4. Any individual making a gross contribution of &#163;3,600 or less to a stakeholder pension from 6 April 2001 does not have to present evidence of earnings to the provider to whom they are making the contribution. Therefore in order to assess the earned income of contributors IR has matched the individual details provided where possible with the Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) 2000&#150;01.<P>

5. The SPI is a representative sample of nearly 200,000 individuals, drawn from the Revenue's Self Assessment, Pay As You Earn and Claims systems. Where IR has been able to match these individuals to the SPI, primarily those with earned income, the 



totals in the tables are based on this sample. For other groups that are unlikely to be in the SPI, such as children, IR has used the whole database directly to derive counts and amounts. For this latter group further analysis is limited to the data that providers have to submit.<P>

6. The table relates to the number of individuals who have a recorded contribution in the year&#151;either individual, employer or minimum. While in theory the data should give details of all individuals, in practice due to incorrect or missing data less than 100 per cent. of records are available for analysis. To account for this the results in the tables have been scaled to known administrative totals.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans he has to reduce bullying in schools.  [136590]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Bullying is a serious issue which can affect young people's educational achievement and emotional well-being. The range of measures we are implementing reflects our determination to help schools tackle the problem.
<P>

<a name="31111w13.html_para3">Tackling bullying is covered in the behaviour audit and training materials that we are making available to all secondary and middle schools through our Key Stage 3 strategy. These reinforce and extend the good practice guidance in our anti-bullying pack 'Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence' and our anti-bullying website (www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying).
<P>

<a name="31111w13.html_para4">I recently launched a new public information film aimed at children and young people. The film is entitled "Tell Someone". It encourages pupils experiencing bullying to tell someone who can help rather than suffering in silence.




<P>
<P><I>11 Nov 2003 : Column 216W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31111w13.html_para5">Later this month I will be launching an anti-bullying charter which I hope as many schools as possible will sign and use. The charter is being drawn up in consultation with the professional associations and voluntary sector partners. It will be accompanied by a summary of effective practice to help schools review and enhance their anti-bullying policies.
<P>

<a name="31111w13.html_para6">The charter will be launched at the first of a series of regional conferences. These conferences will involve schools, local education authorities and voluntary organisations. As well as raising awareness, they will celebrate and share good practice in tackling bullying.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the expenditure was as a share of GDP on <i>(a)</i> early years and childcare, <i>(b)</i> schools, including sixth forms, <i>(c)</i> support for young people, <i>(d)</i> higher education and <i>(e)</i> further education, adult learning and skills and lifelong learning in each financial year from 1992&#150;93 to the end of the public expenditure planning cycle.

<P>
<a name="31111w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The information requested is only readily available from 1993&#150;94. The figures in the following table show Central Government and local authority expenditure for England only while the GDP figures used are for the UK. The figures exclude expenditure on Children's Social Services, the resources for which were recently transferred to DfES. For 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06, the local authority expenditure element for each category has been estimated.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what representations he has received from <i>(a)</i> schools, <i>(b)</i> parents and <i>(c)</i> pupils about the intentions of Year 12 or lower 6th students expecting to complete 'A' levels in summer 2005 and considering whether to take a gap year in 2005&#150;06.  [135447]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 5 November 2003]:</i> The Department for Education and Skills has not received any direct representations from schools, parents or pupils about young people's gap year intentions for 2005/06 although we are aware of some concerns from education and voluntary organisations about the possible impact of changes to tuition fees in 2006 on gap year take-up. We have no plans to introduce any special arrangements for those young people deferring entry to higher education in 2005 in order to take a gap year since students will have had three years' notice of the funding changes. We will abolish upfront payment of fees and introduce loans for fees which students repay after graduation only when they are earning a reasonable salary. We will introduce a &#163;1,000 Higher Education Grant from 2004, to be paid to the poorest 30 per cent. of students. We will also continue to pay the standard fee (currently &#163;1,125) for students from poorer backgrounds.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what criteria are used to allocate funding for gifted pupils.  [136710]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Funding for gifted and talented education is used to support area-based programmes in disadvantaged areas, regional support through the London Challenge and a range of national resources that are universally available, notably the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth.
<P>

<a name="31111w15.html_para1">The area-based programmes&#151; provided through Excellence in Cities, Excellence Clusters and Aim Higher&#151;benefit urban LEAs and smaller pockets of disadvantage, some in suburban and rural areas. Each school uses this funding to support their most able 5&#150;10 per cent. of pupils, so the measure of ability is relative to the school.
<P>

<a name="31111w15.html_para2">In addition to benefiting from national resources, LEAs and schools outside these areas are encouraged to use generic funding to support gifted and talented education.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Local education authorities are free to contract out a wide range of their statutory functions to private companies.

It highlights the social and economic value of education and skills, from a basic skills level to first degree, in terms of earnings, employment and social benefits.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what has been spent since 1997 on projects to improve behaviour in schools.  [133696]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Funding for behaviour improvement in schools comes from a wide variety of sources and is aggregated to varying degrees with funding for other activities. It is therefore impossible to give a discrete total. The School Inclusion: Pupil Support grant provided about &#163;560 million in Government grant and LEA contributions between 1999 and 2003. But this gave schools funding to tackle pupil disaffection more widely and was not just for behaviour improvement initiatives.
<P>

<a name="31111w16.html_para0">In 2003&#150;04 the Government will be allocating over &#163;90 million to schools as part of its national behaviour and attendance strategy. This builds on the &#163;50 million provided to targeted schools and LEAs through the Behaviour Improvement Programme in 2002&#150;03.

<a name="31111w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 There are nearly 4,000 qualifications currently accredited by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) in to the National Qualifications Framework (NQF). Awarding bodies are currently able to accept evidence from diverse sources of learning and achievement in assessing individual candidates, irrespective of the size of organisation within which they might work. For learning that does not lead to qualifications, and following the commitment given in "21st Century Skills Realising Our Potential" to develop a credit framework for adults, we have written to both the QCA and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) on 9 September 2003. The LSC has been asked to review the credit systems currently operating outside the NQF and to identify how the application of credit to this provision might bring incremental award for learning achievement, drive quality and flexibility in further education and how such credit might be developed to provide progression into the NQF and higher education.

<a name="31111w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The National Qualifications Framework is currently capable of responding to a variety of needs of employers and it already contains qualifications that are directly relevant to the needs of small businesses. I have, however, asked the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) to lead on joint work with the Learning and Skills Council and the Sector Skills Development Agency to develop a system of vocational qualifications which has the flexibility to meet individual and employer needs. The QCA will also continue with their work to develop a fully unitised qualifications system. This will provide a flexible framework of qualifications that will enable employers of all sizes to identify packages of learning appropriate to their needs. Units will be capable of certification and individuals will be able to build their achievements over time.

If OFFA remains unsatisfied, the sanctions available will include withholding approval for an institution to charge variable fees, when the access agreement comes up for renewal or, where urgent action is needed, informing the institution that it intends to impose a financial penalty.

 It will be for higher education institutions themselves to decide what level of fees they set for each of their courses from 2006/07 onwards, subject to a maximum fee of &#163;3,000. I would expect them to consider a range of factors in doing so, including the likely impact of their decisions. The Office for Fair Access must approve an access agreement, including arrangements for bursaries and outreach, before an institution can charge higher fees. It will also monitor the agreements and, if necessary, take proportionate sanctions in the unlikely event of a serious breach. Since decisions on fee levels have yet to be taken, it is not feasible to assess their impact, either on individual universities or subjects. However, the additional income from variable fees will boost universities' power to develop high-quality, greater and more flexible provision and to widen access to higher education.

 The Home Department has not undertaken or commissioned specific comparative research on the causes of anti-social behaviour, its prevention, rate of occurrence, or rehabilitation of perpetrators. However, it takes part in the International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS), which provides two relevant indicators: car vandalism, and feelings of unsafety on the streets. The ICVS is a fully standardised survey that has been conducted most recently in 2000. It provided comparable data for 17 industrialised countries. Results are in "Criminal Victimisation in Seventeen Countries", by Kesteren J V, Mayhew P and Nieuwbeerta P, The Hague: Ministry of Justice (2000). A copy is in the Library.

England and Wales had the third highest rate of victimisation of car vandalism of the 17 countries. On feelings of safety after dark, the 2000 ICVS showed that 27 per cent. of those in England and Wales felt 'a bit or very unsafe', compared to the average of 23 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he is taking to prevent overcrowding in prisons.  [136249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w21.html_spnew0"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Levels of overcrowding are determined by Prison Service Area Managers and monitored carefully on the basis of operational judgment and experience.
<P>

<a name="31111w21.html_para0">As part of the Prison Service building programme, the Government are investing &#163;1.3 billion in the three years up to 2005&#150;06 on building and operating additional capacity. The Prison Service will provide around 3,000 additional places in existing prisons by 2006. A further 1,290 places will be provided through the new prisons currently under construction at Ashford (near Heathrow) and at Peterborough. In addition, a new unit at Birmingham prison has opened recently, six months ahead of schedule, and provides an additional 452 places.
<P>

<a name="31111w21.html_para1">We are further managing the prison population through the use of the Home Detention Curfew (HOC) through reforms to the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="31111w21.html_para2">An amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill will make foreign national prisoners who are serving determinate sentences of more than three months liable to deportation up to four and a half months early. The measure brings the foreign nationals in line with UK prisoners who are eligible to apply for HOC. The same risk assessment procedures will apply.

<a name="31111w21.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many vacancies there were at each <i>(a)</i> prison and <i>(b)</i> young offenders' institution on 30 June; and if he will make a statement.  [136862]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w21.html_spnew1"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Information on staff vacancies against planned posts at 30 June 2003, for each public sector prison and young offender institute is contained in the following table. The figures represent a snapshot of staffing at establishment level and do not take into account new staff who were still in the recruitment process on 30 June.
<P>

<a name="31111w21.html_para3">During 2002, recruitment in the Prison Service reached record levels with a total of 6,645 new staff joining the Service. 2,240 prison officers began initial officer training in the 12 months to 30 June 2003. This high level of recruitment activity is predicted to continue into next year due in part to the rising prison population and new accommodation coming on stream.
<P>

<a name="31111w21.html_para4">To assist in the retention of staff in particular areas, local pay allowances have been introduced. In addition, to cover vacancies in the short-term certain establishments are allowing officers to work additional hours as part of the 'Contracted Supplementary Hours Scheme'.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w23.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 We have introduced a range of measures across England and Wales many of which place particular emphasis on reparation, education and training.
<P>

<a name="31111w23.html_para1">These include Referral Orders, which were introduced nationally in April 2002 and are now the main disposal for young defendants pleading guilty for the first time. Youth offender panels, made up of representatives of the local community, agree an intervention programme with the young offender designed to tackle his/her offending behaviour. Victims are encouraged to participate in this process which can further enhance the impact of the panel on the young offender. The programme must include an element of reparation to the victim.
<P>

<a name="31111w23.html_para2">The Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme (ISSP) was introduced in July 2001 as an alternative to custodial sentences for persistent young offenders. The programme aims to bring some structure to offenders' often chaotic lifestyles by addressing the risk factors contributing to their offending behaviour, such as educational deficits, weaknesses in thinking skills or drug misuse.
<P>

<a name="31111w23.html_para3">Where a custodial sentence is necessary, the Detention and Training Order is now the main sentence for 12&#150;17 year olds. This includes individual training plans designed to address offending behaviour and associated risk factors and to provide young offenders with the necessary skills to avoid getting into trouble again.

programme is to support multi-agency partnerships that tackle arson locally by funding community-based projects.
<P>

<a name="31111w23.html_para4">To date, the forum has invested some &#163;2.25 million of Government money in 50 local arson reduction projects in England and Wales. The Government have set aside an additional &#163;4 million in 2003&#150;04, rising to &#163;4.5 million in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;4.8 million in 2005&#150;06, for further arson reduction work.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what estimate he has made of the effect on the rating income of each local authority of the reduced rate of business rates paid by private schools because of their charitable status.  [137469]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 There is no reliable basis on which to make such an estimate, as the information collected from local authorities on business rates relief does not distinguish private schools from other charities.
<P>

<a name="31111w23.html_para5">The Local Government Finance Act 1988 provides mandatory rate relief to any ratepayer that is a charity or a non-profit making body operating as a charity and uses the property they occupy wholly or mainly for charitable purposes. A private school which is not run for profit counts as a charity and therefore qualifies for mandatory rate relief.
<P>

<a name="31111w23.html_para6">Mandatory relief is available at 80 per cent. of the full rates bill and is fully centrally funded but can be increased to 100 per cent. at the discretion of local authorities. The discretionary increase is 25 per cent. centrally funded, and local authorities are required to meet the remaining 75 per cent. of any increase.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 For each year's Revenue Support Grant calculations, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister need to use the most up to date data that are available on a consistent basis for all local authorities. For population, this is the mid-year population estimates provided by the Office for National Statistics. If subsequent revisions are made to population estimates following the recommendations made in the Statistics Commission report or on the basis of other studies, such as the Westminster address matching exercise, then the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will consider whether to make an amending report. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have already announced that an amending report will be made for the 2003&#150;04 settlement in respect of revisions made to population estimates by the Office for National Statistics.

<P>
<a name="31111w23.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what estimate he has made of the total area of the properties in low lying areas that will be affected by an increased risk of flooding from the consequences of climate change by 2050.  [137389]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w23.html_spnew5"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Office of Science and Technology's Foresight project on flood and coastal defence is examining the factors that drive change in flood risk, their impacts and the effect of various responses under the range of foresight socio-economic futures scenarios. The Phase 2 report on risk drivers and their impacts is available in draft on the internet at www.foresight.gov.uk. It is currently subject to peer review.
<P>

<a name="31111w23.html_para7">The results so far suggest that, on the assumption that there is no change in current flood management policies, there will be a low to moderate increase in the probability of inland flooding in the north and west of England and a negligible or low change either way in central and south-eastern parts. There will be a high increase in coastal flood risk in the south-east (from Essex to the Solent), particularly in the Thames estuary with moderate increases in the north Norfolk and Humber estuary areas.
<P>

<a name="31111w23.html_para8">While there is a great deal of uncertainty, the analysis suggests that the number of people at high risk (i.e. within the Environment Agency's indicative flood plain) will increase from its present level of 1.56 million to a range of between 2.26 and 3.55 million by the 2080s, depending on which foresight socio-economic scenario is applied. Expected annual economic damage to residential and commercial property could increase in the same period from the current level of &#163;1,000 million to between &#163;1,600 million and &#163;21,000 million, again depending on the foresight socio-economic scenario. The resulting areas of highest risk of damage, would appear to be the Thames valley and estuary, the Mersey&#150;Humber corridor and areas around the Bristol Channel.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w23.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the responsibilities of local authorities are in relation to preparations for the consequences of climate change on coastal areas; and if he will make a statement.  [137390]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w23.html_spnew6"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 In July 2003, the Local Government Association and UK Climate Impacts Programme published advice to local authorities on "Climate change and local communities&#151;how prepared are you?" This is available in the Library of the House and on the internet at www.ukcip.org.uk. It advises on local authority activities affected by climate change and how it can be taken into account. There is potential for climate change to impact on a wide range of local authority responsibilities, the principal ones in coastal areas being in relation to coastal defence, shoreline management and land-use planning.
<P>

<a name="31111w23.html_para9">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Environment (Defra) Agency have jointly sponsored research on coastal evolution over the next 30&#150;100 years, taking account of climate change scenarios. This provides the basis for consideration of climate change impacts in the second generation of 



<P>
<P><I>11 Nov 2003 : Column 253W</I><P>
shoreline management plans being prepared by the coastal groups of local authorities and Environment Agency.
<P>

<a name="31111w23.html_para10">Planning policy guidance note 25 "Development and flood risk" issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in 2001 already contains guidance on how climate change can be taken into account when considering both inland and coastal flood risk. This is based on the guidance on sea-level rise and likely increase in river flows in Defra's project appraisal guidance for flood and coastal defence, which was published in 1999 and confirmed this year in the light of the UKCIP 2002 climate- change scenarios. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be publishing shortly further advice on the consideration of climate change in land-use planning.

 Current policy on providing for rural exception housing is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: "Housing", Annex B. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recently published the consultation document "Influencing The Size, Type And Affordability Of Housing", which proposes that the current policy is replaced by a policy that enables local planning authorities to identify sites solely for affordable housing, on land within or adjoining existing villages, which would not otherwise be released for housing. The consultation period officially closed on 31 October 2003, but responses after that date have been considered because of the postal dispute. It is too early to say how many responses have been received or their nature.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The data relates to the Pathfinder intervention areas that are smaller than the boundaries of the pathfinder local authorities. It uses the most consistent, robust and up-to-date data available for population and households, that being the Census 2001 data. 'Empty and abandoned properties' is not directly available within the Census 2001 dataset nor through other datasets for the intervention area. Therefore the closest equivalent Census 2001 data&#151;'vacant household spaces'&#151;has been provided. This figure approximates to what we would expect from 'empty and abandoned' property statistics if these were available.<P>

2. Data for 2002 on empty properties for the districts involved in the Pathfinders is available at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister website thorough the Housing Investment Programme, Index of Data list under Housing Statistics.<P>

3. The data was derived from the published Census 2001 data as of June 2003 and does not reflect any subsequent revisions. The intervention area boundaries are those agreed between the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Pathfinders as of June 2003.<P>

4. Each Pathfinder 'intervention area' in the table above consists of all Census small areas (2001 Output Areas) whose centroids fall within the Pathfinder boundary. This means that in a few cases the boundary is an approximation that includes small areas outside 



the Pathfinder or excludes small areas actually within it. For 2001 Census Output Areas, the centroids are supplied on the boundary file by Office for National Statistics. This is the most detailed level of analysis available through Census.<P>

<i>Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)</i><P>

An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<P>

<i>Grossing</i><P>

Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2001&#150;02 which is not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<P>

The latest edition, "Statistics for General Medical Practitioners in England: 1992&#150;2002, is available at: http://www. doh.gov.uk/public/sb0303.pdf and shows that the average list is 1,838, four per cent. lower in 2002 than it was in 1992.

 Before granting leave to take children abroad, the courts will consider all the relevant issues and, as required by the Children Act 1989, have the best interests of the child as their paramount concern. Therefore, children will only be taken abroad with the leave of the court where it judges such a step to be in their best interests. Such children will be living in many parts of the world and it would not be appropriate or practical for the UK Government to exercise a monitoring role. There are, therefore, no current plans to commission research or to introduce a monitoring role in this area.

 The independent Electoral Commission has evaluated every all-postal electoral pilot scheme undertaken since April 2002.

<P>
<P>

 There are a number of offences relating to electoral fraud which carry a variety of penalties including a minimum fine of &#163;200 (in some circumstances no maximum is specified) and custodial sentences ranging from 6 months to 2 years. In addition, these offences may be classified as either illegal or corrupt practices, which carry different sanctions, depending on the offence.

Following such discussions, and recommendations made by the Commission, consideration is currently being given to a number of changes to electoral procedures, some of which are aimed at fraud prevention. Meanwhile, we have included in the current European Parliamentary and Local Elections (Pilots) Bill, an extension of the offence of 'personation' (to cover remote voting) and a power to extend the time limit by which a prosecution for such an offence must begin.

 I would refer my hon. Friend to the written ministerial statement on 6 November 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 43WS concerning the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellors' National Strategy for the Recruitment of Lay Magistrates. That records the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor's decision that there need be no lower age limit for applicants to the magistracy who can show that they have the key qualities needed for appointment. This is intended to help in achieving a more diverse and better-balanced bench. The upper age limit for recruitment of magistrates is 65. The training to serve as a magistrate takes approximately two years to complete, and at least two&#151;three years on the bench is needed to recoup the cost of training before a magistrate reaches the statutory retirement age of 70.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31111w30.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy </B> 
: The Draft Mental Incapacity Bill establishes a framework under which decisions can be made on behalf of adults who lack capacity. The Bill contains a requirement that all decisions must be made in the best interests of the person. The current law is that, in certain circumstances, care that involves the provision of medical treatment may be withheld by medical staff if this is in the best interests of the person because the continuation of such care would serve no beneficial purpose and would be burdensome. The Bill would not change this. However the Bill adds a new safeguard of a criminal offence of ill-treatment and neglect. This would mean that wilfully neglecting someone by withholding care could lead to prosecution.
