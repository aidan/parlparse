<i> [holding answer 11 June 2007]:</i> The draft regional spatial strategy does not contain site specific proposals. It will be for the local planning authorities to identify specific site allocations sites in their local development documents to accommodate the housing provision in the final RSS. However, the draft RSS identifies two broad &#145;Areas of Search&#146; for sustainable urban extensions, to the north of Gloucester and to the north west of Cheltenham. Both &#145;Areas of Search&#146; extend into the neighbouring Tewkesbury district and both would require changes to be made to the general extent of the green belt.

 We have no plans to introduce penalties for failure to comply with a completion notice. Completion notices are rare, but effective in most cases.

Where a discontinuance order has not been complied with, section 190 of the 1990 Act enables the local planning authority to take the steps required under the order (such as removal of buildings, works or any plant or machinery, or steps to protect the environment), and to recover any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so from the owner of the land.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 March 2007]:</i> English Partnerships are running the Design for Manufacture competition on behalf of the Department for Communities and Local Government. All English Partnerships' costs are expected to be balanced out by receipts of more than &#163;50 million from the sale of the land. This exceeds the reserve price across this portfolio of sites by more than &#163;3 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="70615w0004.htm_para0"><a name="07061543000752">The competition involved additional costs compared to ordinary site disposals. These costs are for specialist technical advice to ensure the quality of these innovative homes (&#163;470,000), for monitoring and evaluation to learn lessons from the construction phase (&#163;70,000) and for research and information (&#163;136,400). This latter category includes holding a public exhibition attended by over 5,000 people and circulating some 30,000 copies of the document setting out the lessons learnt so far from the competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="70615w0004.htm_para1"><a name="07061543000753">Part of the competition involved a target construction cost of &#163;60,000 for a high-quality 76.5 sq metre home, with larger and smaller homes being built at a similar cost-efficiency. The competition is creating 10 new mixed communities developments with homes of different sizes and tenures to suit families and single people. Overall, 50 per cent. of the homes being provided will be affordable, including shared ownership/equity, social housing, low cost home ownership and other supported housing such as for the elderly.</p>

The prices of the units for sale will reflect the land value, the local market at the time they go on sale and the equity share as well as the construction cost.

 Parents may exercise their right to educate their children at home on a temporary or permanent basis. We do not collect information about the numbers of children whose parents provide education at home, and it would be impractical to do so given the transient nature of some of this type of provision. A recent study on the prevalence of home education in England, conducted by York Consulting estimated that there were around 16,000 children being educated at home that were known to the local authority. We have not made any estimate of the number of home educated children that are not known to their local authority.</p>

 It is not possible to establish such data other than as part of a research programme where all animals are slaughtered and the disease status of each animal can be irrefutably established. No such technique is available but immunological tests are considered the best indicator of infected status.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="70615w0007.htm_para6"><a name="07061543001102">There are two immunologically based diagnostic tests used in the Great Britain (GB) bovine tuberculosis (bTB) testing programme. The primary screening test for bTB in cattle in the UK (and Ireland) is the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test, which is commonly known as the tuberculin &#147;skin test&#148;. In October 2006, the Government extended the use of the gamma interferon (g-IFN) diagnostic blood test, alongside the skin test (as permitted by EU legislation), in certain prescribed circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="70615w0007.htm_para7"><a name="07061543001103">Research shows that when the skin test is applied to cattle in bTB-free herds in GB there is a one in 1,000 chance that a non-infected animal will be wrongly classified as a reactor. This is known as the test's false positive rate. An alternative way of defining this is to say that the skin test has a specificity of 99.9 per cent. Although the probability of getting at least one false positive result increases with the size of the herd being tested, it would be extremely rare to find more than one false positive in any herd. The skin test is designed to detect an immune response at a relatively early stage in the infection process. Therefore, the percentage of test reactors without visible tuberculous lesions is not an indicator of the false positive rate for this test.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="70615w0007.htm_para8"><a name="07061543001104">Various studies have shown that the sensitivity of the skin test (i.e. its ability to identify infected animals as positives) varies between 77 per cent. and 95 per cent., i.e. it can be expected to miss about one or two in every 10 infected cattle on a single round of testing (10-20 per cent. false negative rate).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="70615w0007.htm_para9"><a name="07061543001105">For all diagnostic tests there is a trade off between sensitivity and specificity, so different interpretations of the test can be used under different disease situations.  <br>

Sensitivity is enhanced in herds with post-mortem or culture-confirmed infection by application of severe interpretation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="70615w0007.htm_para10"><a name="07061543001106">With regard to the g-IFN blood test, performance evaluation carried out in a number of countries shows that at the laboratory cut offs used in GB, it has a sensitivity comparable to or marginally better than that of the SICCT (between 73 and 100 per cent., with a median value of about 87 per cent.). Because the two tests detect slightly different sub-groups of infected cattle, by combining the two tests a higher overall sensitivity can be achieved. A trial in GB, established to evaluate the specificity of the blood test, confirmed the findings of previous studies by concluding that the commercially available blood test had a specificity of between 95-97 per cent. (i.e. there is a likelihood that slightly more false positive reactors are identified when the gamma test is applied, as opposed to the skin test). It is for these reasons that the g-IFN blood test cannot be used for routine surveillance and is best used in parallel in infected herds to maximise the detection of infected animals.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps the Government have taken to date to try to reach the UK target of a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon emissions by 2010 compared with 1990; and what further steps it intends to take. [142112]</p>

<p><a name="st_86"><a name="07061543001108"><a name="70615w0008.htm_spnew0"><a name="07061543002995"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>
 The UK Climate Change programme, revised in 2006, sets out the Government&#146;s policies and measures to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions up to 2010. The target to reduce emissions to 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010 was always designed to be stretching and as we have acknowledged, it looks increasingly difficult to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="70615w0008.htm_para0"><a name="07061543001109">Our latest projections, published in the recent Energy White Paper, suggest that our CO2 emissions, including the impact of the EU Emissions Trading scheme, could fall to about 16 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. This would represent definite progress towards the domestic target. It would also mean that we had reduced our emissions of the basket of greenhouse gases to more than 23 per cent. below base year levels, a percentage reduction almost double what we are required to achieve under the Kyoto protocol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="70615w0008.htm_para1"><a name="07061543001110">However, it does show why we need to do much more to reduce emissions. The long-term framework that the Climate Change Bill will provide, and the new measures announced in the Energy White Paper, which will further reduce emissions up to 2020, are therefore essential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="70615w0008.htm_para2"><a name="07061543001111">If every household, business and community took measures to reduce their CO2 emissions by reducing energy used in the home and in buildings, and by changing how journeys are made, we could still  make further progress towards our 2010 target. The Government are continuing to encourage and enable those choices and changes in behaviour through initiatives such as the &#147;Act on CO2&#148; campaign, and by funding the work of the Carbon Trust and Energy Saving Trust.</p>

 No such meetings were held by the Secretary of State. However, as stated in his announcement of 25 October, the independent environment and nuclear safety regulators believe that this proposal to nominate the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) as the geological disposal facility implementing body provides a framework that they can regulate in a strong and effective manner. They are content that the NDA will be responsible for implementing the geological disposal programme, within the constitutional arrangements described.

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="70615w0010.htm_para3"><a name="07061543001296">As part of its Waste Minimisation Programme, WRAP is working with 13 major retailers to reduce the amount of waste from supermarkets. This includes looking at ways to redesign packaging, as well as providing support for research and development into waste minimisation. It is also working with LAs to establish greater participation in recycling and home composting. This is achieved by WRAP through a variety of means, for example through LA advice and training; food waste collection trials with selected authorities; funding support for campaigns to boost recycling participation in local areas; and a targeted National Home Composting Programme.</p>

A greater focus on waste prevention has been recognised through a new target to reduce the amount of household waste not reused, recycled or composted, from over 22.2 million tonnes in 2000 by 29 per cent. to 15.8 million tonnes in 2010, with an aspiration to reduce it to 12.2 million tonnes in 2020&#151;a reduction of 45 per cent. This is equivalent to a fall of 50 per cent. per person (from 450 kilograms per person in 2000 to 225 kilograms in 2020). The strategy also sets higher national targets for household waste recycling and composting to reach at least 40 per cent. by 2010, 45 per cent. by 2015 and 50 per cent. by 2020.</p>

 We are concerned about the deterioration in security over recent months in South Kordofan. This appears to be caused by the lack of progress in implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in the region, exacerbated by local problems over land use and migratory routes.

 The situation in Zimbabwe continues to deteriorate with economic, political and social indicators worsening by the week. On behalf of the EU the presidency, through its Ambassadors or local representatives, has engaged directly with governments in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region to express the EU&#146;s concern at human rights abuses within Zimbabwe, which many African Governments share. The EU troika held a formal dialogue with South Africa on 14 May at which Ministers discussed Zimbabwe. Both sides agreed that meaningful internal dialogue in Zimbabwe is crucial to the resolution of the crisis. The EU troika met with the African Union (AU) delegation at ministerial level on 15 May. The AU noted its continuing support for the SADC initiative and President Mbeki&#146;s role. The EU awaits the outcome of this initiative with interest and will return to the situation in Zimbabwe at the UN Human Rights Council in September, following the EU statement in March condemning state-sponsored violence. The UK will continue to ensure that opportunities available at EU level are taken to raise the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe and to highlight the EU's condemnation of ongoing political violence and human rights abuses.</p>

 The Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (CJD) incidents panel advises on the assessment and management of risk to patients who may potentially have been exposed to CJD following medical interventions. In December 2003, following the first suspected case of variant Creutzfeld-Jakob Diseases (vCJD) transmission through whole blood transfusion, the first patient notification exercise was undertaken to notify recipients of blood components donated by people who later developed vCJD. There are currently around 24 people in this group who are still alive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="70615w0012.htm_para1"><a name="07061543001602">Since then, three other notification exercises have been implemented in respect of recipients of certain plasma products. There are approximately 5,000 people in this group, which includes patients with haemophilia A and B and Von Willebrand&#146;s Disease to whom it was indicated that they had received United Kingdom sourced plasma derived vCJD implicated products during the period 1980-2001, and would therefore be considered at risk of vCJD for public health purposes. Additionally notification has been given to about 100 blood donors to patients who later developed vCJD.</p>

 Mobile phone theft is a key driver for robbery. The Government, police and industry have developed a strong partnership working together to tackle mobile phone theft. The Mobile Phone Crime Reduction Charter was launched by industry leaders in July 2006 and successfully achieved its target of blocking over 80 per cent. of stolen handsets within 48 hours. The Government and Metropolitan police fund a National Mobile Phone Crime Unit to provide a national centre of excellence and operational support around the country. We have robust legislation in place to target criminals who re-programme stolen handsets. The Government are continuing to engage industry on the issue of better crime proofing handsets as they become increasingly multi-functional in the future.</p>

 The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan is regularly assessed by the Afghan Government and the UN.

Statistics indicate that Kabul, Nangahar and Kunduz are absorbing the largest number of returnees at 51 per cent. UNHCR state they are coping well with the influx of returnees and are facilitating safe returns, which includes addressing any problems returnees may face on their journey back to Afghanistan, and providing any support once they have arrived at their final destination.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 June 2007]:</i><i> </i>The heading &#147;grants and other aid in kind&#148; is used for statistical purposes to classify DFID bilateral assistance which is not covered by the main aid-type categories such as financial aid (including budget support), technical co-operation and humanitarian assistance. In addition to funding for partnership programme agreements and other civil society organisations this category will include, amongst other things, a growing proportion of DFID bilateral support which is disbursed through international institutions and multilateral organisations. This funding is additional to core contributions to these organisations which are reported separately. For example in Sudan, DFID has committed &#163;47 million over three years to two multi-donor trust funds administered through the World Bank. But, in general, projects and programmes coded under this heading are too diverse to provide a meaningful summary or an isolated cause for the overall increase. However, DFID is in the process of reassessing the way it categorises this element of its aid programme to provide a more useful breakdown for users in future reports.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 May 2007]:</i><i> </i>The most recent estimates are based on the Maternity and Paternity rights and benefits in Britain: Survey of Parents, conducted in 2005. The survey is based on a random sample of mothers who had a baby in December 2003 and their partners. Of mothers in paid work, all took at least some of their entitlement to maternity leave, and 98 per cent. received some form of maternity pay; approximately 2 per cent. of mothers in paid work did not receive maternity pay.</p>

Of these, around 80 per cent. said they had used at least some of their statutory paid paternity leave entitlement which was brought in 2003. The remainder took other forms of leave. No estimate has been made of the take-up of unpaid paternity, although almost all fathers who qualify for paternity leave will also qualify for Statutory Paternity leave.</p>

<i> [holding answer</i><i> s</i><i>  14 June 2007]</i>: DTI has not identified any locations for new nuclear power stations. Any new nuclear power stations would be built by the private sector but no decisions would be taken on any potential location for a new nuclear power station pending the carrying out of a full strategic siting assessment (SSA).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="70615w0018.htm_para3"><a name="07061543002530">DTI is consulting on a proposed process for carrying out an SSA.

Such criteria would include demographic considerations, including with regard to population density and distribution. In addition to the SSA, any proposed new nuclear sites would need to comply with the rigorous site-specific safety and environmental requirements of the independent regulators.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 June 2007]:</i> Following consultation with the hon. Member, the question will be answered with respect to nuclear material unaccounted for (MUF). MUF is the inventory difference that occurs when the result of a physical inventory of nuclear material is compared with the book inventory. The difference may be negative (an apparent loss) or positive (an apparent gain). MUF is a recognised feature of accounting for nuclear material at processing plants and is caused primarily by the uncertainties inherent in the techniques used to measure nuclear material. An explanation of MUF is available at:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="70615w0018.htm_para7"><a name="07061543002540">There should be no such MUF for nuclear power stations. Nuclear material in the form of discrete items (fuel elements) is added to the inventory on receipt at the power station site and subtracted from that inventory when fuel is shipped from the site.</p>

For figures since 1974, I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) on 15 June 2004, <i> Official Report</i>, column 820W. More recent figures are available at the UK Safeguards Office website at:</p>
