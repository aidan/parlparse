 The lack of access to essential medicines in the developing world is one of the most pressing global health issues. Tackling this could save millions of lives a year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w01.html_para0">
The UK Government is committed to significantly improving access to essential medicines in developing countries. The factors recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) that can improve poor people&#039;s access to medicines are: affordable pricing, sustainable financing, reliable health and supply systems, and the rational selection and use of essential drugs. Research and development for new products is also critical, particularly if access is to be sustained over the longer term.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w01.html_para1">
The Prime Minister established a high level UK Working Group on Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in the Developing World in 2001, chaired by Clare Short. There were representatives on the Group from developing countries, pharmaceutical companies, charitable foundations, the European Union (EU), WHO, DFID and other UK Government departments. The Group reported to the Prime Minister in late 2002 with recommendations focusing on widespread differential pricing of medicines for developing countries and increased research and development to meet the health needs of poor people in those countries. Seven Government departments have been working together to take forward these recommendations and related areas of activity.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of the implications of the spread of AIDS in India.  [183376]</p>








<p><a name="40713w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 India has a total population of 1.07 billion people, of which half are in the 15 to 49 year old age group. Data from the most recent HIV surveillance exercise undertaken by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has just been released. It is considered the most reliable of various data sources, and estimates that 5.1 million people were infected with HIV at the end of 2003. This represents an HIV prevalence rate in the adult population of 0.9 per cent. India therefore remains a low prevalence country. Of the estimated 5.1 million cases, 59 per cent. are rural, while 41 per cent. are urban. Women account for 36 per cent. of infections. Six high prevalence states account for over 84 per cent. of the AIDS cases reported in India since the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1011W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
beginning of the epidemic. These are Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and the two North-Eastern States of Nagaland and Manipur.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w01.html_para5">
The recent surveillance data highlights the following:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">There is a fall in the rate of growth of HIV infections in India.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">No moderate or low prevalence state has moved into a higher category.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Early signs of stabilisation of HIV infections in the high prevalence states.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w01.html_para6">
This is encouraging, but challenges remain. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in India is still considered to be &quot;concentrated&quot;, with injecting drug users, commercial sex workers and men who have sex with men recording much higher HIV infection rates than the general population. However, NACO is aware of the risk of the epidemic moving into the general population.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w01.html_para7">
In 2001, DFID India committed support of &#163;123 million to the Government of India&#039;s National AIDS Control Programme, to be disbursed over five years. The main aim of the programme is to reach out to the communities at high risk (sex workers, men having sex with men, injectable drug users etc.) with innovative programmes to contain the spread of the disease. Targeted interventions are specifically designed to reach out to these hard to reach vulnerable groups where the prevalence of disease is highest.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w01.html_para8">
The programme also includes support to the BBC World Service Trust for media campaigns to raise awareness in the general public. In addition, DFID supports the UN theme group coordinated by UNAIDS to strengthen its role in prevention of HIV/AIDS in India. UNAIDS benefits from DFID support to strengthen its capacity as secretariat for all United Nations HIV initiatives in India.

<a name="40713w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Reproductive Health</h3>





<p><a name="40713w01.html_wqn3"><b> Sandra Gidley: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what progress the Government have made towards meeting the Millennium Development Goal on reproductive health by 2015; and if he will make a statement.  [183663]</p>









<p><a name="40713w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 While there is not a Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for reproductive health, we remain firmly committed to the target agreed at the 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and Development of achieving access to reproductive health for all by 2015. DFID believes that population and reproductive health issues are fundamental to efforts to tackle poverty and achieve the MDGs. Reproductive health especially embraces three health related MDGs&#151;those to reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, and to combat and prevent HIV/AIDS as well as tackling income poverty and gender inequality. Without progress in improving access to reproductive health it is unlikely that these MDGs will be met.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w01.html_para9">
There is much progress since 1994 to celebrate&#151;countries have turned ICPD commitments into policies and action, increased access to a range of family planning options, and in some countries cut maternal deaths. But still too many poor women, men and young people in developing countries are denied their right to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1012W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
sexual and reproductive health. 120 million couples do not have access to the family planning services and contraception they need. Every year, 529,000 women die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth and three million children die in the first week of life. Millions live with HIV and sexually transmitted bacterial infections that are mainly preventable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w01.html_para10">
On Tuesday 6 June, the Secretary of State launched DFID&#039;s Position Paper on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights. It describes progress to date and sets out what remains to be done. It will form the basis for planning our future investment and activities and our work with partners. The same day the Secretary of State announced increased funding for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The UK will be providing &#163;80 million over four years (2004&#150;07) in core funding to UNFPA to support its work on sexual and reproductive health and rights, population and development, and gender. UNFPA&#039;s work is also a critical part of HIV/AIDS prevention efforts within the framework of the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).

 The original target date for opening the Mary Lyon Centre was the end of 2002 (as given in the MRC 2001&#150;02 Annual Review). The building was completed in December 2003 and officially opened by my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Science and Innovation in June 2004. It is a purpose-designed building incorporating the latest air handling and environmental engineering and will meet the highest possible standards for animal welfare.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w05.html_para9">
The delay and increase in costs were, in part, due to: more space being required for individually-ventilated cages, incorporation of the quarantine area in the new building, Home Office requirements for a larger than anticipated quarantine area, and provision of specialised support facilities in each holding area rather than a centralised support facility. During this period, there were continuing negotiations with the contractor to keep the increase in costs to a minimum, which also added to the delay.

 There are no plans to change the clear plastic carrier bags used in the Debate, which are practical for their purpose. The bags help to reduce queues by allowing cashiers to see the contents without the need for them to be unpacked at the tills, and are sturdy enough to allow customers to carry hot drinks safely to their offices in Portcullis House and the other parliamentary buildings. Indeed, the bags are so sturdy that many of our customers re-use them and we encourage them to do this.

<p><a name="40713w05.html_spnew7"><b> Sir Archy Kirkwood: </b> 
 The Central Procurement Office requires an initial examination of suppliers&#039; environmental performance at bidder selection stage. Questions about breaches of environmental law, and bidders&#039; environmental policies, are asked as a matter of routine for all procurements conducted under UK contracts regulations. Any breach of the law is grounds for rejection. Weighting given to environmental policies will vary and be appropriate to the potential environmental impact of performing the contract. This standard approach is followed regardless of other award criteria.

Weighting given to environmental factors in the evaluation of tenders will also depend on the potential impact of performance of the contract. Advantage to the environment is taken into account as part of the overall value for money assessment.

There was widespread appreciation of the vital role the industry has to play and a determination on all sides to drive up standards.

1. The figure for total administration and overheads includes staffing, premises, travel and subsistence, legal and company costs. It excludes everything which may be considered to be direct arts spend.<br>

2. All figures are taken from RAB audited accounts<br>

3. From 2001&#150;02 onwards RABs were set up as delegate bodies for distribution of NLDF funds hence their increase in total expenditure in 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The figures relating to the number of settlements and compensation paid includes cases settled at employment tribunals and prior to such hearings. Claims relating to disability discrimination are not recorded separately.<br>

2. The expenditure on sex discrimination/harassment cases excludes payments made to those service personnel dismissed from the armed forces on the grounds of their homosexuality and who brought claims at the employment tribunal and/or the European Court of Human Rights.<br>

3. We cannot provide figures for the Department&#039;s legal costs in handling employment tribunal applications for 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99. Likewise due to changes in internal accounting procedures it is not possible to separate legal costs in relation to employment tribunal cases from the overall legal costs incurred by MOD during financial year 2002&#150;03.<br>

4. Costs awards in employment tribunal are not common. Normally each party bears its own costs. However, where in the opinion of the tribunal, a party has in bringing the proceedings, or a party or a party&#039;s representatives has in conducting the proceedings, acted vexatiously, abusively, disruptively or otherwise unreasonably, or the bringing or conducting of the proceedings by a party has been misconceived, the tribunal may make an order in respect of all or part of the other party&#039;s costs. <br>

<p><a name="40713w11.html_spnew10"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy was published on 15 March. It makes a wide variety of recommendations and those specifically focused on antisocial behaviour include the need for greater use of exclusion orders to ban those causing trouble from pubs and clubs or entire town centres; encouraging the full use of acceptable behaviour contracts and antisocial behaviour orders to tackle unacceptable behaviour and greater use of the new fixed penalty notices to clamp down on drunk and disorderly behaviour. Additionally, the Home Office Police Standards Unit, working in partnership with the Association of Chief Police Officers, have invited forces and other partners from across the country to take part in a co-ordinated programme of enforcement and initiatives to tackle alcohol fuelled violence. The campaign will target the irresponsible few who encourage underage and binge drinking and will also focus on tackling drunken behaviour.

1. Caseload figures have been rounded to the nearest hundred and expressed in thousands. Percentages are given to one decimal place.<br>

5. Incapacity benefit figures are based on persons receiving either long-term or short-term incapacity benefit, and exclude credits only cases.<br>

6. Incapacity benefit and severe disablement allowance terminations shown are those recorded as &quot;returning to work&quot; and therefore figures may not directly correspond to those finding work.<br>

8. A person is counted only once in each period, regardless of the number of times they claim and subsequently leave each benefit.<br>

Possession of a NINO does not constitute proof of the right to work, and the onus for establishing right to work rests with employers.

The NINO is only acceptable as evidence of entitlement to work if produced in combination with other specified documents.

This process protects the benefit systems from undue loss when a person&#039;s immigration status excludes the right to access public funds and provides the Immigration Service with up to date information on the individual.

We have made no estimate of the current number of inaccurate NINOs held on the Departmental Central Index (DCI). In 2001, the Department completed an analysis of the DCI database to improve its integrity and, as a result, over 200,000 duplicate NINOs were removed from the system. The process of analysing our databases to identify and remove inaccurate, duplicate and fraudulent NINOs has continued as part of our commitment to reduce fraud and error.

 Information on numbers of households eligible for pension credit is not available at county or constituency level. However, we estimate that approximately 3.75 million households in Great Britain and approximately 500,000 households in the north west region (rounded to the nearest 50,000) are likely to be eligible for pension credit in 2004&#150;05. Information on the numbers of pension credit recipients and people gaining as a result of pension credit is given in the following table. Those gaining are defined as recipients of the savings element of pension credit, plus those recipients of the guarantee element only who were not previously claiming minimum income guarantee and who were aged 60 prior to 6 October 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w18.html_para0">
We have now published a review of the pension credit campaign to the end of May 2004. This shows that pension credit is playing a vital role in helping to give more money to the people who need it most. Over three million pensioners are now benefiting, with over 2.2 million individuals receiving more money than they did before. The review has been placed in the Library.

<p><a name="40713w19.html_spnew4"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Land that may possess a possible industrial or commercial use is primarily identified through its allocation in a development plan. Local planning authorities have a duty to produce a development plan for their area, allocating sites for a range of land uses. Planning applications should be decided in accordance with the development plan, unless material considerations indicate otherwise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w19.html_para2">
The allocation of sites for such uses will often match the location of existing development, or sites that have previously been in this use, but are currently vacant. New sites may also be identified and allocated where it is apparent that there is market demand, ideally in consultation with the private sector.
</p>


<p>

There are no statistics held centrally for how much land has been allocated, and developed accordingly, for specific land uses. This could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 The only legislation that deals specifically with the protection of green belts is the Green Belt (London and Home Counties) Act 1938.

There has been no subsequent legislation which specifically protects land within the green belt although, within the planning system, there are measures in place which are intended to protect all green belt land. Planning Policy Guidance note (PPG)2 sets out the policies to achieve this. It contains a general presumption against inappropriate development in the green belt, which is reflected in Structure Plans and Local Plans, and carried through in decisions on planning applications.

<p><a name="40713w20.html_spnew1"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 There is a complex interplay between a number of factors that cause homelessness (including the supply of housing and personal problems such as relationship breakdown, debt or drug misuse). This was set out in the March 2002 report &quot;More than a roof&quot; which emphasises the importance of concentrating as much on people and the problems they face as on places in which they live.

<p>
<a name="40713w20.html_para0">
The Homelessness and Housing Support Directorate, within the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, is taking forward the approaches set out in &quot;More than a roof&quot;. The directorate works closely with local authorities, voluntary sector agencies (including housing associations), and other Government Departments to improve our understanding of the relationship between all the factors that influence homelessness and to test and promote new ways to tackle homelessness more effectively.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w20.html_para1">
Information reported quarterly by local authorities on their activities under homelessness legislation includes the number of households that, during the quarter, left temporary accommodation provided by the authority, or who were no longer registered as &quot;homeless at home&quot;, by the length of stay (in broad time bands).

<p>
<a name="40713w20.html_para2">
Projections of the expected average length of stay for households currently being accepted as owed a main homelessness duty are not made. In the March quarter of 1997 the average length of stay for homeless households prior to leaving temporary accommodation in England was around 100 days; the equivalent figure for 2004 was around 270 days.

Under section 4 of the Defective Premises Act 1972 a landlord is under an obligation to ensure that the tenants of premises (for which he has a duty to repair) are reasonably safe from personal injury arising from relevant defects. This duty applies to all landlords who let under tenancies and, therefore, extends to landlords of HMOs.Paragraph 13 of the Housing (Management of Houses In Multiple Occupation) Regulations 1990 places a duty on managers of HMOs to ensure that adequate precautions are taken to prevent injury to residents arising from the design and structural conditions of the HMO. Whilst it is intended to revoke these regulations on the coming into force of the Housing Bill, the Government intends to re- enact this regulation in new regulations provided for in the Bill. Those new regulations will ensure that acceptable management standards are in place in all HMOs and a failure to comply with any of those regulations will be a criminal offence, prosecutable by a local authority.

A local authority can use its powers under Part 1 of the Bill to enforce improvements made necessary by management failures.

 A woman living in a women&#039;s refuge in order to escape violence or abuse would be statutorily homeless if it was not reasonable for her to continue to live in the refuge and she had no other suitable accommodation available for her occupation which she had a legal right to occupy.

<a name="40713w20.html_para5">
The &quot;Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities&quot;, to which local housing authorities in England must have regard by law, states that women&#039;s refuges are intended to provide very short term accommodation and should not be regarded as reasonable to continue to occupy in the medium and longer term. Housing authorities should recognise that placing an applicant in a refuge will generally be a temporary expedient only, and a prolonged stay could block a bed space that was urgently needed by someone else at risk. Refuges should be used to provide accommodation for the minimum period necessary before alternative suitable accommodation is secured elsewhere.

She would be entitled to make an application for an allocation of accommodation to any housing authority and if she was considered to be homeless by that authority should be given reasonable preference for an allocation under the authority&#039;s allocation scheme.

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is taking action to reduce the incidence of empty homes. We have established a &#163;500 million Market Renewal Fund for investment in nine pathfinder areas to tackle low demand and abandonment across the North and Midlands. Local authorities have been given the discretion to reduce, or remove completely, council tax discounts on long-term empty homes. We are proposing to introduce new powers in the Housing Bill for local authorities to manage privately owned empty homes where the vacancy cannot be justified. We are consulting on a proposal to re-introduce a Best Value Performance Indicator to measure local authority performance in re-letting their empty council dwellings. This is in addition to an existing performance indicator that measures the performance of local authorities at returning private sector vacant dwellings to use.

<p><a name="40713w25.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Frank Field: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps are taken to ascertain whether Staff and Associate Specialist doctors are invited to apply for NHS posts which go to overseas consultants recruited to work in the UK.  [183208]</p>








<p><a name="40713w25.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton </b> 
<i>[holding answer 12 July 2004]:</i> The appointment procedure for consultants working in the national health service is set out in the National Health Service (Appointment of Consultants) Regulations 1996 and also the Good Practice Guidance 1996. These require an open and competitive process that should ensure consistent procedures are observed and that all candidates have an equal opportunity when applying and being interviewed for a consultant post.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w25.html_para0">
The only consultant posts which are exclusively available for international candidates, which is done after attempts have been made to fill them in the United Kingdom, are posts advertised under the NHS international fellowships scheme, which aims to recruit eminent consultants from abroad for two year placements in hard-to-fill specialities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w25.html_para1">
In order to be eligible to apply for consultant posts, doctors must be on the specialist register held by the General Medical Council. If doctors in the staff and associate specialist grades are on the specialist register, they are therefore eligible to apply for consultant posts. Most staff and associate specialist grade doctors are not on the specialist register and are therefore not eligible to apply for such posts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w25.html_para2">
However, two initiatives are currently being taken forward that will increase the opportunities for these doctors to progress to the specialist register. These are the establishment of the postgraduate medical education training board and the proposals for reform set out in the consultation document, &quot;Choice and Opportunity&quot;.
</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what change in temporary staffing costs he expects for individual NHS trusts which sign up to NHS Professionals;  [182655]

</p>



<p>(2) on what basis the budget for NHS Professionals for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 was agreed;  [182658]

</p>



<p>(3) what representations he has received from NHS trusts raising concerns about working with NHS Professionals;  [182659]

</p>



<p>(5) whether it is his policy that NHS trusts should work with NHS Professionals on a mandatory basis; and if he will make a statement;  [182661]

</p>



<p>(6) what representations he has received from NHS trusts who lost bank staff to private agencies when the bank was transferred to NHS Professionals; and if he will make a statement.  [182663]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Jul 2004 : Column 1102W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40713w25.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 In April 2004, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State established the NHS Professionals special health authority to provide, in partnership with national health service bodies, a national service managing the supply of temporary staff for the NHS in England.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w25.html_para3">
While NHS bodies are not required to use NHS Professionals&#039; services, they have been encouraged by the Department to engage with the special health authority to understand the benefits it can offer for the cost effective management of temporary staffing. It is hoped and anticipated, therefore, that the number of NHS bodies using NHS Professionals will steadily expand.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w25.html_para4">
NHS Professionals is a not-for-profit organisation that brings value to local health economies through two routes; firstly, by working with trusts to help reduce demand for temporary staff and secondly, through commission rates for the supply of temporary staff.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w25.html_para5">
Rates charged by NHS Professionals currently stand at an average of 7.5 per cent. This is at least 13 per cent., less than the average cost of employing staff through a commercial agency operating within agency framework agreements. Trusts should therefore save money by using the NHS Professionals service. The majority of trusts which have implemented the NHS Professionals service report a reduction in their use of temporary staffing by private agencies. I am not aware of any representations from NHS trusts with concerns about working with the special health authority.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w25.html_para6">
The Department has provided financial support of &#163;26.6 million in 2004&#150;05 on the basis of a rigorous review of NHS Professionals&#039; business plan, recognising that NHS Professionals expects to grow the business to a point where it is self funding in the near future. Further information on NHS Professionals&#039; objectives and targets are contained within the business plan, copies of which are available in the Library.

 The available information on sunbed use is provided as follows.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w27.html_para1">
A Health Education Authority survey in 1999 found that sunbed use is most common in the 16 to 24-year-old age group with around 15 per cent. of this age group having had at least one sunbed session in the previous year.

</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w27.html_para3">
There is no conclusive direct evidence that sunbed exposure causes skin cancer from either of the recent reports on the effects of ultra violet radiation (UVR) from the National Radiological Protection Board and from the International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection. The greatest source of UVR exposure is from the sun.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w27.html_para4">
The Health and Safety Executive has recommended that people under 16 should not use sunbeds. This recommendation was made based on expert medical advice.

Monitoring of Health and Safety Executive guidelines is the responsibility of local authority environmental health officers.

 The SEN and Disability Act 2001 gave all pupils with SEN including those with Down&#039;s syndrome, the right to be educated in mainstream schools where that is what their parents want and it would not jeopardise the learning and safety of others. That Act also made it unlawful for educational providers to discriminate against those pupils with a disability by, treating them less favourably than non-disabled pupils on the grounds of their disability, without justification.

Building on the existing statutory framework, the Governments Strategy for SEN&#151;Removing barriers to achievement, launched February this year, sets out our vision for giving all children with SEN and disabilities, including those with Down&#039;s syndrome, the opportunity to succeed. This strategy builds on proposals for the reform of the children&#039;s services in &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;. It sets a new agenda for improvement and action at a national and local level, in four key areas: early intervention; removing barriers to learning; raising expectations and achievement and delivering improvements in partnership. The Department has invited partners, including colleagues from the Down&#039;s Syndrome Association to collaborate on the planning, management and delivery of its Inclusion Development Programme being developed as part of removing barriers to achievement.

The Children&#039;s NSF will develop new national standards for the NHS, social services and their interface with education. It will build on current Government programmes to develop an integrated approach to supporting children with SEN and disabilities, including those pupils with Down&#039;s syndrome, ensuring that care is designed around the needs of the individual child and their families.

<p>
<a name="40713w29.html_para3">
Within this overall framework, it is a matter for primary care trusts in partnership with strategic health authorities and other local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health and services. They have the resources to commission services, and to identify the number of professional staff they need to deliver those services. This process provides the means for addressing local needs within the health community including the provision of speech and language therapy.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what measures are in place to regulate schools&#039; admissions policy in relation to children with special educational needs.  [182323]</p>








<p><a name="40713w31.html_spnew6"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 School admission policies must have regard to the School Admissions Code of Practice. The code makes clear that children with special educational needs (SEN), but without a statement, must be treated as fairly as other applicants. Where a child has a statement of SEN that names the school, the governors of the school are under a duty to admit the child. If, however, a school is named in a child&#039;s statement and the governors refuse to admit the child, the child&#039;s parents or the local education authority maintaining the child&#039;s statement can make a complaint to the Secretary of State.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the proportion of appeals against admissions decisions which are made in relation to children with special educational needs.  [182326]</p>








<p><a name="40713w31.html_spnew7"><b> Margaret Hodge </b> 
<i>[holding answer 5 July 2004]:</i> Admission appeals on behalf of children who have special educational needs (SEN) but do not have statements are considered in the same way as admission appeals on behalf of children who do not have SEN. In 2002/03, for all maintained primary and secondary schools, parents lodged 91,430 appeals against non-admission of their children. There is no separate assessment of the number of appeals made in relation to children with SEN.

<p>
<a name="40713w31.html_para6">
Parents of children who have statements of SEN can appeal to the SEN and Disability Tribunal about the school named in their child&#039;s statement. In 2002/03, there were:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">339 appeals solely against the school/type of school named in children&#039;s statements (11.2 per cent. of the total number of appeals);</p>

 The document &quot;Transforming Youth Service: Resourcing Excellent Youth Services&quot; (2002) outlines our vision for the Youth Service and the unique contribution it should make to the personal and social development of young people. This includes working with young people to help prevent them becoming engaged in anti-social behaviour, and working with those who are already engaged in it. Youth Services work closely with the police and YOTs to do this.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40713w32.html_para1">
Youth Services are run by local authorities and we do not collect statistics centrally about Youth Service activity in this area. However research findings from a range of sources illustrate the impact the service is having. The majority of Youth Service plans show that Youth Services have existing partnerships with the police or Young Offending Partnerships. These include targeting groups of young people reported to be engaged in anti-social behaviour. Partnership working with police and youth offending agencies will be one of the aspects covered in an evaluation study on the Youth Service due to be published later this year.
