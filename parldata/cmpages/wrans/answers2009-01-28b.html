<p><a name="qnpa_4"><a name="09012859001199">(5) what steps were taken to protect against the GM-contamination of the oilseed rape seeds found to be contaminated with GM material grown in Somerset in 2008 <i> (a)</i> during cultivation and <i> (b)</i> post-harvest; [250051]</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_5"><a name="09012859001200">(6) whether the areas immediately surrounding the GM-contaminated oilseed rape seeds grown in Somerset in 2008 have been examined for potential GM-contamination. [250155]</p>

<p><a name="st_158"><a name="09012859001201"><a name="90128w0005.htm_spnew0"><a name="09012859001968"><b>Huw Irranca-Davies:</b>
 The affected trial grown in Somerset was of a new variety of conventionally bred, open-pollinated oilseed rape. The seed was imported from the USA with a view to being grown in various trials in the UK. This included national list trials, for which an application was made a year after the Somerset trial was sown. However, these did not take place and the variety has been withdrawn from the national list process. The trial in Somerset was carried out privately on behalf of the company that owns and imported the seed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="90128w0005.htm_para0"><a name="09012859001202">The conventional seed had a low level of GM seed mixed within it (0.05 per cent. or one in every 2,000 seeds), of a type approved by the European Union for food and animal feed use, but not for cultivation. It did not become known that the seed planted in Somerset had this GM content until after the trial had been harvested. As such, no measures were applied during cultivation to limit the potential dispersal of GM material. After harvest the farmer contracted to grow the trial left the ground fallow and let his livestock graze on emerging oilseed rape &#145;volunteer&#146; plants (those that grow from seed shed at harvest). The farmer is being advised by the GM Inspectorate on the best way to further manage and reduce any volunteers. Given the low level of GM seed originally sown and the farmer's action post-harvest, it is not expected that GM volunteers will be a significant issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_402"><a name="90128w0005.htm_para1"><a name="09012859001203">A separate trial of a different variety of conventional oilseed rape was grown immediately adjacent to the affected trial crop by the same farmer. Testing indicates that as a result of cross-pollination this adjacent crop acquired a very low adventitious GM presence (less than 0.01 per cent.). No other crops were grown in the vicinity of the affected trial, including on neighbouring farms, that might have been subject to GM cross-pollination. In this situation, it is not proposed to monitor the local area for potential contamination. The accidental sowing of the GM seed has not posed any risk to human health and the environment, and nor should there be any economic prejudice to neighbouring farmers through possible cross-pollination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_403"><a name="90128w0005.htm_para2"><a name="09012859001204">The affected trial took place within the south Somerset district council area. We do not think it would be appropriate to disclose the precise location, in part because it might deter people from coming forward with information about potential unauthorised GM releases, which would not be in the public interest. However, we are currently considering requests to release the exact location under the Environmental Information Regulations.</p>

 The UK&#146;s negotiating position on the proposed authorisation regulation for plant protection products was adopted in consultation with other Departments and the devolved administrations through the Committee on National Security, International Relations and Development&#146;s sub-committee on Europe. Ministers worked extremely hard throughout the negotiations to secure a balanced outcome, and held bilateral meetings with Commissioner Vassiliou, Ministers of other member states, and key stakeholders on the proposals and its potential impacts. It remains unclear how the introduction of the regulation will affect the import of produce from outside the EU.</p>

These helped to achieve an increased focus on environmental benefits across Europe, by increasing the rate of compulsory modulation to 10 per cent. by 2012, and therefore the share of CAP funding that goes towards environment and rural development schemes. As part of this, the Secretary of State met Ministers from other member states, including France, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Ireland, Denmark and Hungary, as well as Commissioner Fischer-Boel. In their approach to the health check negotiations, the Government worked closely with the devolved Administrations, both through ministerial meetings and technical discussions between officials, and with stakeholders, including through ministerial meetings and a public consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"><a name="90128w0005.htm_para4"><a name="09012859001216">In their plans, water companies must take into account the implications of climate change in their supply and demand forecasts, and include an assessment of the impact of each water resource supply option in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_406"><a name="90128w0005.htm_para5"><a name="09012859001217">The Environment Agency has responsibility for managing water resources. The Agency&#146;s forthcoming Water Resources Strategy will include the actions that will need to be taken to ensure enough water for people and the environment. It has been informed by research into future river flows to 2050 and groundwater resources to the 2020s and 2030s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_407"><a name="90128w0005.htm_para6"><a name="09012859001218">The Environment Agency is the statutory body with a duty to manage water resources in England and Wales and is taking forward the Restoring Sustainable Abstraction (RSA) programme. To date, the RSA has been limited to identifying the sites where abstraction is at unsustainable levels. It has carried out investigations to identify where changes to abstraction regimes are necessary. In many cases those investigations have concluded that the licensed abstractions are having no adverse effect on the environment. Therefore no action to alter licensed abstractions is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="90128w0005.htm_para7"><a name="09012859001219">Of the 2,970 Water Resources licences that have been assessed under the habitats regulations review of consents because they were likely to cause a significant effect on high priority Natura 2000 sites (that is special areas of conservation (SAC) and special protection areas (SPA)), 274 have been found to require an options appraisal to remove a possible adverse effect. In 2,696 cases it could be shown that there was no adverse effect on site integrity and therefore no action was required. Further work is required on medium and low priority sites but to date this relates to less than 10 per cent. of the abstraction licences in England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="90128w0005.htm_para8"><a name="09012859001220">It may also be necessary to take action on other sites not designated under the Habitats and Birds Directives or as SSSIs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="90128w0005.htm_para10"><a name="09012859001222">RSA will also contribute to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) by providing a framework to restore unsustainable abstraction and work towards achieving the WFD target of meeting good ecological status by 2015.</p>

 The heating in 1 Parliament street is controlled by means of a computerised building management system (BMS). This allows the heating and cooling in each office to be individually monitored and controlled. The original system, installed in 1990, had become obsolete and was replaced by a modern system. The hardware was installed in the 2008 summer recess and the installation of a new control network was completed in November 2008. The arrival of the cold weather in the autumn highlighted a number of software problems which took longer than anticipated to resolve due to the lack of a network, which meant revisiting every office. At the same time, the opportunity was taken to replace any faulty heating or cooling valves and as a result some 50 cooling and 20 heating controls were replaced.</p>

On the other two occasions, operation of a manual call point and the interruption of a beam detector in the atrium automatically triggered an evacuation. In order to minimise the number of unwanted alarms, a full fire incident investigation is carried out by the parliamentary fire section, fire safety manager and London fire brigade after every incident to establish the cause of the incident and to identify the person(s) responsible. Key personnel involved in the alarm activation are interviewed and remedial action taken.

A third offence will result in arrest and consideration of likely further action including caution, conditional caution or prosecution. All subsequent offences are likely to result in arrest. If any aggravating factors are present the police will escalate the response accordingly.

The number of children who receive maintenance has also increased under the plan to a total of 778,200 children in the three months to the end of September, 155,200 more children than received maintenance in the three months to March 2006. In addition, the Agency collected and arranged &#163;1.08 billion in child maintenance in the year to September 2008, which is a considerable increase from the &#163;836 million that was collected in the year to March 2006.</p>

 Any change to extend entitlement of the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance to people with severe sight impairments or who are registered blind would necessitate a change to the primary and secondary legislation. Further time will be needed to design, test and implement the administrative processes, which will require changes such as new guidance and training for staff.

 Since 2005, HMRC have reduced their overall headcount from 105,000 staff to 88,000 staff. HMRC have committed to reducing staff numbers further over the coming years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_569"><a name="90128w0019.htm_para5"><a name="09012884000175">My hon. Friend&#146;s answer of 21 January 2009, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1473W described how the pre-surplus arrangements work. Pre-surplus status is a term used by HMRC as part of their arrangements for managing workforce changes. When work volumes reduce or it is planned to move work to another location, HMRC use pre-surplus arrangements to help manage the consequent change in staffing requirements. HMRC use this scheme to help re-deploy staff to new roles ahead of any change in staffing requirements in a particular location or business unit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_570"><a name="90128w0019.htm_para6"><a name="09012884000176">Potentially surplus staff are given pre-surplus status and then have priority for any vacancies that arise that they apply for. This allows HMRC to address proactively any potential staffing surplus as a result of a change in the business. Pre-surplus staff continue to carry out essential work for the Department as they await new jobs. This is a sensible way to make best use of the skills of people during a period of radical reconstruction to improve service to customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_571"><a name="90128w0019.htm_para7"><a name="09012884000177">If pre-surplus measures do not resolve the situation, staff can be declared &#145;surplus&#146; after which the Department can start to move to redundancy. The pre-surplus arrangements are a key part of our strategy for managing surpluses, and the Department remains committed to avoiding compulsory redundancies as far as this is reasonably practicable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_572"><a name="90128w0019.htm_para8"><a name="09012884000178">Information on pre-surplus information was only retained from the quarter ended September 2007. The figures provided as follows provide a snapshot of the position at each date. The position changes on a daily basis.</p>

 The Secretary of State established when he finalised this policy in January 2008 that the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) should conduct an annual review on its impact. I wrote to HEFCE earlier this month setting out the terms of reference for the review. I told HEFCE that they should consider whether there is evidence that any changes to the current approach will help universities respond more effectively to the challenges of the economic downturn. I also instructed that a review should not lead to a significant net increase in the overall number of ELQ students studying exempt or protected subjects because we will continue to give priority for public funding to those who have not yet obtained a first higher education qualification. HEFCE has started work on the review and plan to report later in the year.</p>

 The Government remain concerned at the continuing high level of violence and instability in the Niger Delta. The key to resolving the crisis is domestic political will within Nigeria, and a systematic approach to security, governance and development. We support the Nigerian Government on Delta issues, for example through a &#163;2 million project to promote transparency and accountability of state and local government expenditure in the Delta and through support on maritime training. My noble Friend the Minister for Africa, Asia and the UN, Lord Malloch-Brown, has discussed these issues several times with the Nigerian authorities in follow-up to discussions between my right hon.

The PRT combines the efforts of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), Department for International Development (DFID) and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) in a comprehensive approach to development. Accordingly, the PRT delivers reconstruction and development projects from a tri-departmental budget managed jointly by FCO, DFID and MOD. &#163;7.04 million was spent in 2006-07 and &#163;9.99 million in 2007-08 from the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP). To date, &#163;14.08 million (of a Stabilisation Aid Fund budget of &#163;34.41 million) has been spent in 2008-09. Prior to the establishment of the PRT in 2006, there was no specific allocation of funding to Helmand province.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_631"><a name="90128w0024.htm_para1"><a name="09012884000520">The tri-departmental funding facilitates a range of projects in Counter Narcotics, Rule of Law, Strategic Communications, Governance, Political activities and Area Based Stabilisation. These projects are administered in Lashkar Gah or London, dependent on the implementing agent. Projects are managed through a range of partners including the Afghan Government, local community organisations, international or local non-governmental organisations or external contractors. Programmes are reviewed and updated monthly by an official in the embassy in Kabul and the PRT in Lashkar Gah. Projects are evaluated at six-monthly intervals.</p>

 The delivery of UK aid in Zimbabwe, alongside that of UN and other international agencies, is rigorously monitored and subject to regular reporting, independent evaluation and financial audit. Our estimation has been that UK assistance reaches its intended recipients. When we do hear of any attempt to divert aid, the programme in question is halted immediately while an investigation takes place. However, from 4 June to 29 August 2008, as a cynical and damaging electoral ploy, Robert Mugabe&#146;s regime instituted a ban on the operations of NGOs across the country. During this period, large amounts of international food-aid (including UK contributions) were obstructed; none of this aid was diverted, it was simply not distributed. Other non-food aid&#151;including essential medicines and support to people with HIV and AIDS&#151;was distributed where delivery to intended recipients could be assured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_638"><a name="90128w0024.htm_para8"><a name="09012884000622">Since the lifting of the ban, the international community has scaled up its response rapidly to provide vital food assistance to over five million Zimbabweans. Despite this massive operation, rigorous monitoring has been maintained, with few reports of obstruction or diversion of aid, and we are confident that UK contributions are being delivered to intended recipients.</p>

 Section 206 of the Planning Act 2008 sets out which bodies will be charging authorities for the Community Infrastructure Levy. As part of the consultation on draft CIL regulations, the Government will consult on the use of the section 206(4). Executive agencies and regional development agencies cannot be charging authorities. However such bodies could receive CIL revenue from CIL charging authorities in order to provide infrastructure identified as necessary, through the development plan process, to support development. No estimate has been made of the level of CIL revenue that these specific bodies would receive as this will depend on the infrastructure planning and local decisions about funding priorities made by each CIL charging authority.</p>

Every child should grow up eating well and enjoying being active and we want parents to have the knowledge and confidence to make this happen. There is no single, simple solution to reducing rates of overweight and obesity and therefore the Government are taking action on a number of fronts.</p>

The updated Child Health Promotion Programme was published in March 2008. It prioritises obesity prevention and physical activity by promoting positive parenting during pregnancy and the early years of children&#146;s lives. We are working to support as many mothers as possible to breast feed and to continue to breast feed for longer&#151;helped by children&#146;s centres, health and other services, all promoting healthy weight. The Healthy Start initiative provides free vitamin supplements, vouchers for milk, fruit and vegetables for low income pregnant women and children up to age four.</p>

The Play Strategy, launched in December 2008, sets out how Government will invest &#163;235 million over 2008-09 to 2010-11 to develop play facilities for children of all ages. Ofcom have introduced restrictions on advertising foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) to children.</p>

 The Government recognise the additional difficulties disabled parents face in effectively engaging at school-parent communication events such as parent evenings. The provisions in the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) and the advice to schools and local authorities are primarily around how schools provide services for disabled pupils. Through practice guidance for schools on parent evenings the Department encourages schools to use a number of ways to enhance the relationship with parents and carers, including asking parents what they want and what would encourage them to come into the school.</p>

 The early years foundation stage includes an early learning goal that a child should use a pencil and hold it effectively to form recognisable letters, most of which are correctly formed. Supporting practice guidance suggests a range of activities, appropriate to their age that children can do to develop both the large and fine motor skills needed to hold a pencil and write. The guidance indicates that most children would be able to achieve this goal between 40-60 months of age.</p>

 The Government have no plans to develop a statutory national curriculum for Religious Education (RE). There is a non-statutory National Framework for Religious Education that all major faith groups have endorsed in 2004. Religious Education is already a statutory subject and every maintained school must provide religious education (RE) for all its pupils. It is the responsibility of the head teacher, governing body and the local authority (LA) to ensure that this is done. Local Standing Councils for Religious Education (SACREs), established by the LA, have the responsibility to ensure that local RE syllabuses, taking account of national guidance, reflect the make up of the local community.</p>

authorities to ensure that their preferences are met to the fullest possible extent are enshrined in section 86 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. The requirement to offer a place, where one is available and where such an offer would not prejudice the provision of efficient education or the use of resources, at the school that is the parents highest preference is fundamental to the system and is reflected throughout the code and regulations, for example at paragraphs 1.37, 1.42 and 3.15(d).</p>

 Guidance to local authorities on how to respond appropriately to the needs of young people who run away was published by the Department of Health, the Department which then had responsibility for children&#146;s services, in 2002. As part of the commitments made in the Young Runaways Action Plan, this guidance is currently being updated, and a draft version is out for formal consultation, in advance of publication later this year.</p>

Many children who run away from home are likely to be children in need requiring support and services provided by local authorities or by voluntary organisations acting on their behalf. Most runaways will return home; where it is inappropriate for them to do so, it is for the local authority to ensure that they are appropriately cared for.</p>

It will reflect the emerging findings of the current review into the provision of emergency accommodation for young people. This review will help local authorities identify successful and cost effective forms of provision, and young people&#146;s perceptions of different types of emergency accommodation.</p>
