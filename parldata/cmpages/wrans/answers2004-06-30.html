<a name="40630w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Age Discrimination</h3>





<p><a name="40630w01.html_wqn0"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what progress has been made towards implementing into domestic law the provisions of the EU Directive on age discrimination in employment; and if she will make a statement.  [181042]</p>








<p><a name="40630w01.html_spnew0"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 We are on course for legislation coming into force on 1 October 2006 to outlaw age discrimination in employment and vocational training under the European Employment Directive. Our Age Matters consultation last year sought views on options for the implementing legislation. We are reviewing the timetable for further consultation in the light of our clear commitment to give those with responsibilities and with rights as much time as possible to prepare, and to do so with regulations that are clear and effective. We shall announce the new timetable as soon as possible.

<a name="40630w01.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Business Support</h3>





<p><a name="40630w01.html_wqn1"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much has been allocated to support business in each of the last 10 years, broken down by <i>(a)</i> sector and <i>(b)</i> region.  [177177]</p>








<p><a name="40630w01.html_spnew1"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 Information on the allocation of business support is not readily available in aggregate at sectoral and regional level, and could be compiled only at disproportionate cost.

<a name="40630w01.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Employment Tribunals</h3>





<p><a name="40630w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Hancock: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry pursuant to the answer of 23 June 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1452W, on employment tribunals&#039; reinstatement orders, if she will introduce legislation to ensure that employment tribunals have the power to require employers who are found to have reasonably not complied with reinstatement orders to pay compensation in default.  [181400]</p>








<p><a name="40630w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 All employers who fail to comply with a reinstatement order, whether reasonably or otherwise, are required to pay compensation instead. If the failure to comply was unreasonable they are also required to pay an additional award.

<a name="40630w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Equal Opportunities</h3>





<p><a name="40630w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what measures the Department has put in place to ensure the promotion of science, engineering and technology as a career to women in educational establishments; and what indicators are used to measure the success of these schemes.  [180071]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>30 Jun 2004 : Column 276W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40630w01.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 The contract for the new Resource Centre for Women in Science, Engineering and Technology (SET) encompasses all SET occupations including careers in educational establishments. The Resource Centre contractors have established a dedicated HE Advisory Group and intend to work closely with the Athena project which has already done excellent work in identifying the barriers to women reaching senior positions in HE occupations and providing good practice advice to employers in this area. Over the first three years of the contract I would expect to see an encouraging upward trend in the number of women reaching the most senior positions. However, it is obviously important that my Department and that of Education and Skills work closely on this since there are issues about getting girls and women to study appropriate subjects at school and university in order that a critical mass in the HE work force can be achieved. We are working together on this through the 10 year framework for Science and Innovation. DfES has contributed &#163;200,000 to the Resource Centre to support HEIs to put measures in place that aid retention and progression of female undergraduates on SET courses into the SET labour force, including: grants to assist HEIs in running mentoring schemes; placements in industry and research; focused tutor and peer support systems; and work with employers.

<a name="40630w01.html_sbhd4"><h3 align=center>Export Credits Guarantee Department</h3>





<p><a name="40630w01.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Moore: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry pursuant to the answer to the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) of 15 June 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 817W, on the Export Credits Guarantee Department, what the value of unrecovered ECGD claims were relating to <i>(a)</i> the current financial year, <i>(b)</i> the previous financial year, <i>(c)</i> financial years 2000&#150;01 to 2002&#150;03 inclusive and <i>(d)</i> financial years prior to 2000&#150;01, broken down by country; and if she will make a statement.  [180733]</p>








<p><a name="40630w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien </b> 
<i>[holding answer 28 June 2004]:</i> The following table lists ECGD&#039;s net unrecovered claims for each of the last five financial years on a market-by-market basis. These figures are calculated by subtracting claims paid from recoveries of debt that ECGD has made in each of the five years (i.e. a figure of one million represents the net amount received by ECGD after any claims paid; likewise, a figure of one million represents an overall debit, after any recoveries received). These claims and recoveries could be made in respect of a number of different guarantees and insurance policies issued by ECGD.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40630w01.html_para0">
The information provided in my previous answer to the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) of 15 June concerned ECGD&#039;s total unrecovered claims, which include the substantial historical debts incurred prior to the Department&#039;s financial restructuring in 1991. As a result many of the figures given in the table involve recoveries on pre-1991 debt. The hon. Member will be aware that ECGD has made a return to the Exchequer in 12 of the last 13 years and has made a return overall in the years since the 1991 restructuring.

 The Countryside Agency Research Note summarised the findings of a study into the feasibility of improving access to inland waters for canoeing by voluntary agreement. Case studies were conducted on four rivers in England and involved extensive negotiation with landowners as well as national and local stakeholders. The study concluded that, for voluntary access agreements to succeed, a champion or group of champions was required who would take the lead in drawing together all of the interest groups and oversee the negotiation process and any resulting agreement. Without a motivated champion, it was considered unlikely that any sort of agreement would be reached. The champion might be a user, a local landowner or possibly a project officer supported by national or local government. The study

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s Sustainable Communities Plan, published in February 2003, established Regional Housing Boards (RHBs) in each of the nine English regions. The Communities Plan set out that RHBs would ensure regional housing strategies are co-ordinated with economic and planning strategies, allowing sub-regional approaches to housing problems extending beyond individual local authority boundaries. Another key task for RHBs is the preparation of regional housing strategies as the basis for advice to Ministers on the strategic housing investment priorities in the region.

Affordable housing is the South West Housing Body&#039;s number one priority.

In 1997 the Government inherited a &#163;19 billion backlog of renovation and improvement work to local authority housing stock, caused by years of under-investment. Since then local authorities are estimated to have invested &#163;14 billion in their existing stock, the majority of which has come from central Government funding. Another &#163;9 billion has been invested in affordable housing. In total, housing capital investment has tripled since 1997, with approaching &#163;10 billion

<p><a name="40630w07.html_spnew0"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The current edition of Approved Document A, &quot;Structure&quot;, advising on how to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations does not give any guidance on the minimum depth for foundations, but a revised document published on 29 June 2004 on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s website does give some guidance on these. This will come into force on 1 December 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40630w07.html_para0">
The guidance recommends that strip foundations to dwellings up to three storeys in height should be founded at a minimum depth of 450mm to avoid the action of frost on the ground, increasing to 750mm minimum in the case of clay soils. For such buildings the number of storeys will have little influence on the depth of foundation, but may affect their width. The guidance also recommends that consideration should also be taken of anticipated ground movement caused by the presence of nearby trees and vegetation on the stability of the building.

<p><a name="40630w09.html_spnew6"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The Lancashire Neighbourhood Watch Association (LNWA) is an excellent organisation which deserves much credit for its co-ordination of Neighbourhood Watch schemes in the county and its good working relationship with Lancashire Constabulary.

LNWA&#039;s plans for the future include increasing Neighbourhood Watch representation at district level. They are also creating a website due to be launched later in the year, which will improve communication between community beat managers and Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinators.

The range of community safety schemes in Chorley is impressive. It includes a Good Citizenship Football tournament for young people, Help the Aged 24-hour response system and the Tatton Community Project.

I particularly commend CADNWA&#039;s partnership with the British Transport Police in setting up Watch schemes for railway stations in the area. These are the first of their kind in the country and provide a model that could be successfully replicated elsewhere.

Assistance has also included protection, health, shelter and water, education, legal assistance, food distribution and household support. UNHCR are participating actively in efforts by Governments and regional organisations such as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the United Nations to identify and implement political solutions to the problems. They are also co-ordinating with the Chadian Government counterpart, CNAR, and other humanitarian actors to ensure a co-ordinated response to the needs of the Sudanese refugees.

 The Government of Zimbabwe have informally announced that the next parliamentary elections will be held in March 2005. Responsibility for ensuring that those elections are fair and open rests with the Government of Zimbabwe. Following the 2002 presidential election, international election observers, including the Commonwealth Election Observer Group, the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) Parliamentary Forum on Norms and Standards for Elections and other bilateral observer missions, concluded that the legal framework for preparing and conducting elections in Zimbabwe was not conducive to conducting a free and open election.

The Zimbabwe state press earlier this week reported ZANU(PF) proposals for changes in the procedures for Zimbabwean elections. It is too early to say if these proposals will be enacted, and if so, what difference they will make. But it is important to note that the freedom and fairness of elections is a function not only of voting and counting procedures, but also of whether they take place in a climate which permits democratic debate, with a functioning independent media and civil society, and freedom from violence and intimidation.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what criteria are used to decide whether Royal Navy ships use <i>(a)</i> a Spanish port and <i>(b)</i> Gibraltar. [181089]</p>








<p><a name="40630w21.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The programming of Royal Navy ships (and Royal Fleet Auxiliary or Ministry of Defence owned/chartered vessels) to Gibraltar or to Spanish ports is dependent on a number of criteria including any specific requirements of the ship, available port facilities, logistical requirements, maintenance requirements or the need of the ship&#039;s company to undertake a period of rest and recuperation. The goodwill generated from visiting foreign ports makes a significant contribution to defence diplomacy, the continuing development of bilateral relations and support to UK Industry. A balanced approach is, therefore, taken to ensure that Gibraltar and other ports in the region, including Spanish ports, are visited on a regular basis. In addition, Royal Navy ships en route to or returning from deployments east of Suez and Atlantic Patrol Tasks are routinely programmed to visit Gibraltar.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what recruitment targets were established for each of the six Scottish infantry regiments for each month since January 2003; what the level of recruitment was in each case; and if he will make a statement. [180541]</p>









<p><a name="40630w22.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 The number of other rank enlistments for each of the six Scottish Infantry Regiments for each month since January 2003 are detailed in the following tables. The marked increase during the months of August-September and December- January are due to the fact that during these months there are additional Junior Entry Courses running, allowing a greater number of recruits to be enlisted. No monthly recruitment targets are set, therefore, the annual Financial Year targets are included in the tables. However, no target was set for individual Infantry Regiments in Financial Year 2002&#150;03.

<p><a name="40630w22.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 As stated in my previous answer, decisions on whether to replace Trident are likely to be needed in the next Parliament. We have also made clear that appropriate steps to keep options open will continue to be taken, and that we routinely undertake studies into the optimum operational life of key defence capabilities, including the Trident system. These included concept studies on options for platforms to carry the Trident missile in the longer term, which began in May 2002 and finished in May 2003, and involved extra-mural costs of around &#163;560,000.

<p><a name="40630w22.html_spnew6"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 Through the New Deal we have introduced a wide range of initiatives to help lone parents improve their employment prospects by giving them the skills, support and confidence they need to move into work. Since its introduction in October 1998, over 485,000 lone parents have participated in the New Deal for Lone Parents and over 260,000 lone parents have been helped into work.

The New Deal is a long-term investment to make a real difference to lone parents and their children. New Deal for Lone Parents more than doubles lone parents&#039; chances of moving off income support. Those who do return to benefits after finding a job through New Deal have still added to their skills, confidence and experience, making it easier for them to find a job in the future.
