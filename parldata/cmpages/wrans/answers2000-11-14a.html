<a name="01114w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what procedures exist in his Department for a civil servant to report actions which <i>(a)</i> are illegal, improper, or unethical, <i>(b)</i> are in breach of constitutional convention or a professional code, <i>(c)</i> may involve possible maladministration and <i>(d)</i> are otherwise inconsistent with the Civil Service Code.  [135452]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01114w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 A copy of the Civil Service Code was issued to every MOD civil servant in May 1999. The Department's procedures require staff to report any matters of concern within the scope of the Code to their third line manager in the first instance. If the matter cannot be resolved at this level staff have a right of appeal to their Top Level Budget Holder and, ultimately, to the Permanent Under Secretary of State. The procedures also make provision for staff to be able to discuss concerns in confidence with a senior officer outside of their management area if they wish. If, having raised a matter of concern to them within the Department, a member of staff considers that he or she has not received a reasonable response there is a right of appeal to the Civil Service Commissioners.
<P>

<a name="01114w01.html_para0">These procedures are set out in the Department's Personnel Manual and reiterated in departmental instructions regularly circulated to all staff.

 There have been no significant effects on the Gorton constituency or the surrounding area. Gorton's Territorial Army centres were retained as a result of the 1998 restructuring review.

<a name="01114w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We are currently engaged in a study, announced in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, to evaluate the impact on combat effectiveness since opening 70 per cent. of posts in the Army to women and of allowing them to serve in specialist billets "attached" to the Royal Marines. The study, which is due to report to Ministers in 2001, will also make an assessment on the armed forces' combat effectiveness of removing the present exclusion of women from the Royal Marines General Service, Royal Armoured Corps (including the Household Cavalry), Infantry and RAF Regiment. As part of this study we have drawn upon other countries' experiences in respect of women in combat roles.

<P>
<a name="01114w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The primary occupier of the former RAF Dishforth (now Dishforth Airfield) is 9 Regiment Army Corps (9 Reg AAC), a Joint Helicopter Command (JHC) unit. The JHC is currently engaged in carrying out an estates rationalisation study and one of the options is to re-deploy all helicopters and manpower from Dishforth Airfield to Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton. The study is due to report in autumn 2001 and no decisions on the redeployment of manpower currently based at Dishforth or the disposal or re-use of Dishforth Airfield will be made until then. In the meantime, no representations have been received on the future of Dishforth, except for the hon. Member's own letter to me of 6 November.

<P>

<a name="01114w01.html_para1">Good progress is being made on our ongoing 10 years programme to identify safe non-asbestos alternatives and introduce them into service at every opportunity including planned maintenance and refit periods. For example, we are currently trialling replacements in two particularly challenging areas: the ship propeller shaft brakes and high pressure steam system joints. If the trials are successful we shall fit replacements in a much earlier timescale than originally expected.

<P>
<a name="01114w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 When first introduced by the Army in 1995, the Compulsory Drug Testing (CDT) programme routinely tested for: Cannabis, Cocaine, Amphetamines (including Ecstasy) and one of Opiates, Benzodiazepines or LSD. Since 15 October 1999, the tri-Service programme has tested routinely for: Cannabis, Cocaine, Amphetamines (including Ecstasy), Benzodiazepines and one of other Opiates or LSD.
<P>

<a name="01114w02.html_para2">If prevailing drug trends change, or a particular risk exists that is not covered by the routine testing programme and where appropriate analytical technology is available, other drugs of misuse can be added, exceptionally, to the testing programmes, e.g. performance enhancing drugs.
<P>

<a name="01114w02.html_para3">Increasing the frequency of CDT enhances deterrence but a balance must be established between deterrence and minimising disruption to the services operational and training commitments. A recent amendment to the random rolling drug testing strategy has increased the probability of higher risk groups being tested on a more frequent basis, without having a significant impact on the services' ability to meet their operational liability.
<P>

<a name="01114w02.html_para4">It continues to be service policy that, save in exceptional cases, a positive random test result, or the refusal to provide a specimen, will lead to Army and RAF officers being required to resign and to administrative discharge in the case of an RN officer. Soldiers, ratings and airmen will normally be administratively discharged. Personnel of the rank of lance corporal (and equivalent in the other services) and below may be retained in exceptional circumstances at the discretion of their Commanding Officer.

 The Army aims to test all personnel annually for drugs. Units that are deemed to be at higher risk by nature of their location or their previous Compulsory Drug Testing (CDT) record may be subject to more frequent testing. The Naval Service aims to conduct random testing in every ship and establishment at least annually, with some establishments subject to more regular testing, and this year plans to test approximately 30 per cent. of its personnel. The RAF aims to test 25 per cent. of its personnel annually. The services conduct their random CDT agenda as part of a rolling programme.

 <i>[holding answer 2 November 2000]:</i> I assume the hon. Member means "nitrogen oxides", often referred to as "nox" (NOx), of which nitrogen dioxide forms a large proportion and which is regarded as the main pollutant of health concern within NOx.
<P>

<a name="01114w02.html_para7">At relatively high concentrations, nitrogen dioxide causes inflammation of the airways. There is evidence to show that long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide may affect lung function and that nitrogen dioxide may enhance the response of sensitised individuals to allergens. Studies have reported associations between respiratory hospital admissions and nitrogen dioxide levels but it is unclear whether this effect is due to nitrogen dioxide itself or to particles which often increase at the same time as nitrogen dioxide. The source of the nitrogen dioxide is not relevant.
<P>

<a name="01114w02.html_para8">The Government have not estimated deaths caused by NOx emissions. The 1998 report of the Department of Health's Committee on Medical Effects of Air Pollutants "Quantification of the Effects of Air Pollution on Health in the United Kingdom" (copies of which are in the House Libraries) considered that, although there was some evidence of an effect of nitrogen dioxide on mortality, this was too uncertain to use to quantify numbers of deaths. However, nitrogen oxides contribute to the formation of secondary particles (nitrates) and ozone. Deaths brought forward by ozone and particles were quantified by COMEAP. COMEAP did not ascribe proportions of these deaths to particular ozone precursors such as nitrogen oxides or to particular types of particles such as nitrates.




<P>
<P><I>14 Nov 2000 : Column: 580W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01114w02.html_para9">The assessment of the costs and benefits of the proposed waste incineration directive commissioned by the Department from Entec UK Ltd. (copies of which are in the House Libraries) on the basis of COMEAP data used an assumption about the proportion of ozone attributable to NOx to calculate the marginal health benefits of the NOx limits in the proposal. It concluded that the proposed NOx limit would prevent 46 deaths being brought forward and prevent or delay 91 respiratory hospital admissions as a result of the formation of ozone. Entec UK have very recently recognised a mathematical error in the original calculation, such that the figures given for the marginal health benefits of the proposed NOx limits were overstated. The correct figures for health effects of NOx are in fact significantly lower--0.7 deaths not brought forward and 0.9 respiratory hospital admissions not brought forward as a result of the formation of ozone.

<a name="01114w02.html_para10">The National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory holds data for estimated total UK NOx emissions from three incineration sectors--sewage sludge incineration, poultry litter incineration and municipal waste incineration. This data have been extrapolated to give projected NOx emissions for 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020, using assumptions about changes in capacity, but without taking into account the NOx limits in the proposed waste incineration directive. The figures are set out in the table. On the basis of the projected 2000 total NOx figure from all three sectors, the incineration sectors covered contribute only 0.3 per cent. of the UK total NOx emissions.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01114w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The UK already prohibits most imports of waste for final disposal. Under the legally binding United Kingdom Management Plan for Exports and Imports of Waste, which came into effect in June 1996, the UK accepts wastes only from those countries which cannot reasonably be expected to deal with specific wastes in an environmentally sound manner. This is because we have the necessary treatment facilities which meet tough environmental standards. This policy is designed to encourage countries to become as self- sufficient as possible in waste disposal.
<P>

<a name="01114w04.html_para1">Consistent with European law, however, the UK cannot prohibit imports of wastes for recovery, which could include shipments of municipal wastes for incineration with energy recovery. However, shipments of municipal waste still require the prior consent of the UK enforcement authorities and would have to meet specific criteria set out in the UK Plan. There may be grounds for objecting to individual shipments if the primary purpose of the importing facility is to treat local wastes and those wastes will be displaced by the proposed imports. Available data show that no imports of municipal waste have taken place since the existing UK Plan came into effect in 1996.

 None. Local planning authorities can already invite a retrospective planning application in respect of unauthorised development where they judge that there are no planning objections to it. Otherwise, authorities already have wide ranging enforcement powers to control development undertaken without planning permission. We have no current plans to strengthen these powers further.

<a name="01114w05.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 It is the Government's policy that local authorities should accept greater responsibility for setting their own budget and council tax increases. That is why we abolished crude and universal capping. However, we retain reserve powers to protect council tax payers from excessive increases. We identified three authorities whose council tax and budget increases in 1999-2000 and 2000-01 were at the top end of the range of increases for all authorities in England. I met those authorities in July. I have considered carefully the points they put to me. I have also taken account of the fact that the average council tax increases in England fell in 2000 for the second year running. On balance, I have decided not to use the new reserve powers this year. Against a background in which the Government have announced a significant increase in funding for local authorities for the next three years, all local authorities should budget responsibly.

 The reason for debt relief is to assist on poverty reduction. The country-led approach to development embodied in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Programmes (PRSP) process provides a framework for allocating all Government resources, including savings from debt relief and development assistance, so that they make maximum impact on poverty. Investing in education is vitally important for development and poverty reduction. Achieving universal primary education by 2015 is one of the International Development Targets. We and others have repeatedly made it clear that real progress will only be achieved and sustained if education, and basic education in particular, is given the priority it deserves within PRSPs. Since May 1997 we have committed over &#163;400 million to helping Governments in developing countries to put in place sustainable education systems able to provide high-quality primary education to all their children. We will do more.

<a name="01114w06.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Contention ratio is one of a number of fundamental quality of service parameters used to specify ADSL service products, as are other parameters such as data rates and throughput. It is generally accepted that service quality and cost are related and this is certainly true for ADSL services.
<P>

<a name="01114w06.html_para6">It is likely that contention ratio information will be provided by ADSL service suppliers as part of their service contract with the customers and indeed customers may well request this information if it is not readily available. It is also expected that ADSL service suppliers will offer customers a choice of throughput offerings so that customers will be able to choose which quality performance offering best meets their needs.
<P>

 The statement to which I now understand this and the previous question refers is that "Government continues to reduce the burdens caused by too much regulation." It appears in two publications published by the Small Business Service--"Setting up in Business: A Guide to Regulatory Requirements" and "Employing Staff: A Guide to Regulatory Requirements." It also appears on the Small Business Service website.
<P>

<a name="01114w07.html_para3">There is considerable evidence for the statement. For example, the Government have increased the threshold below which small companies may opt to dispense with having their annual accounts audited from a turnover of &#163;350,000 to a turnover of &#163;1,000,000. This measure alone will produce annual savings of around &#163;90 million for about 75,000 companies. In addition, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his pre-budget statement has proposed a major overhaul of the VAT system to reduce the administrative burden on small firms. The Federation of Small Businesses said it was

<a name="01114w07.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> delighted with the proposals outlined by the Chancellor on VAT, saying reforms would provide greater simplicity and ease cash flow problems for small firms.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01114w07.html_para5">A number of other measures to reduce burdens are in the pipeline, including reform of the liquor licensing and gambling laws. Further evidence for the statement is the report by the OECD last year that the UK had the lowest level of product market regulation while the CBI has reported that the UK has more flexible labour market regulation than other European countries.

<BR>
As the Employment Service is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has asked Leigh Lewis to reply to your question concerning the steps being taken to inform small and medium sized enterprises of the Access to Work scheme. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to Mr Lewis as Chief Executive of the Agency. I am replying on his behalf.
<BR>
In answer to your specific question, it is encouraging to know that half of the employees who apply for support from the Access to Work scheme work for organisations which employ fewer than 500 people. The Employment Service already invests around &#163;300,000 per year in marketing and publicising its disability services and programmes, through a variety of media including external advertising, exhibitions and marketing events, video and information leaflets, which are available through all Jobcentres. This includes leaflets specifically aimed at employers. Our own promotion is reinforced by a wide range of other organisations, particularly in the

<P><I>14 Nov 2000 : Column: 597W</I><P>
voluntary sector, who represent disabled people. We collaborate with them to help publicise Access to Work and our other support for disabled people and employers seeking to employ people with disabilities.
<BR>
I am also pleased to be able to tell you that the Employment Service is relaunching its website this autumn. This relaunch will include fuller information about disability services, including much more information about Access to Work for employers and individuals.
<BR>
Our promotion of the Access to Work scheme is reflected in growing demand for it. In round figures, 13,000 disabled people were supported in 97-98, 16,000 in 98-99, and 21,000 in 99-2000.

 We are aware of variations in out-patient waiting times and are working to improve matters.

At the same time Trusts were instructed to introduce partial booking systems into clinics with waits in excess of 13 weeks. These systems improve the efficiency of out-patient clinics and reduce long waiting times. We have also recently announced further details of our "Action On" programme, with funding targeted at specialties with the longest waits--orthopaedics, ear nose and throat, dermatology and ophthalmology (cataracts).

 The Governor of St. Helena has used his reserved power under Section 34(1) of the St. Helena Constitution Order on two occasions in the past two years; 31 March 1998 and 31 March 1999. On each occasion he used his powers, on the advice of the Executive Council, to implement the budget after the Legislative Council had refused to pass it. He acted properly in line with the Constitution and with the full support of the Department on each occasion.

<P>
<a name="01114w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The total revenue available under the Oil for Food programme since its inception in 1996 is over US$37 billion. This year alone, Oil for Food revenue is expected to reach more than US$16 billion. The current value of Oil for Food contracts on hold because of concerns over dual use is approximately US$2.3 billion. The UK accounts for about US$0.3 billion of this, which is less than 1 per cent. of the total value of Oil for Food revenue. The UK, as a responsible member of the UN Iraq Sanctions Committee, scrutinises contracts very carefully to ensure that goods are not supplied to Iraq in violation of Security Council resolutions. Holds are normally lifted after assurances have been received about the end-use or in-country monitoring of these goods. It is noteworthy that at the end of October Iraq's bureaucracy was holding back the delivery of US$1.1 billion worth of goods already approved by the Sanctions Committee.

 While there has been some improvement in economic and social rights in China, the overall situation continues to be a matter of serious concern. Over the last two years there has been a marked deterioration in the respect for key civil and political rights including freedoms of assembly, conscience and expression. Fair treatment in the legal process is routinely abused through the use of arbitrary detention, "re-education through Labour" and excessive sentences against democracy activists, Falun Gong Leaders, Tibetan and other activists. We address these concerns through a policy of critical dialogue including Ministerial exchanges and regular bilateral human rights talks with the Chinese.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data set which is derived from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS does not include Northern Ireland, and 1998-99 is the latest year for which data is available.<P>

2. The estimates are sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that control for region, Council Tax band and a number of other demographic variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error and to variability in non-response. All percentages are rounded to the nearest per cent.<P>

3. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household). While the proportion of individuals below various income thresholds may be sensitive to the precise way in which incomes are equivalised, changes shown over time generally are not.<P>

4. The estimates are presented on both a Before Housing Costs (BHC) and an After Housing Costs (AHC) basis in line with HBAI conventions. Figures are also provided including and excluding the self-employed, as research suggests that, for self-employed people, income as reported in surveys is often a poor indicator of living standards.<P>

 The New Deal for Disabled People, a joint initiative of the Department of Social Security and the Department for Education and Employment, has been testing a range of approaches to help recipients of incapacity benefits return to or take up work. These include a personal adviser service, innovative schemes and pilot benefit changes. By the end of September 2000, over 5,100 people have been helped into work by the New Deal for Disabled People pilots.
<P>

<a name="01114w12.html_para0">On 13 November the two Departments launched a prospectus for the extension of the New Deal for Disabled People. This will involve the establishment of a network of providers, known as job brokers, to offer long-term sick and disabled people on incapacity benefits the support, guidance, and preparation they need to find work; and to match the needs of employers with the skills and potential of long-term sick and disabled people.

 Digital terrestrial television (DTT) can already be received in parts of High Peak. DTT is broadcast from the Winter Hill, Sheffield, Chesterfield and Emley Moor transmitters and maps showing the predicted coverage from each of these sites have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses on CD-ROM. The BBC and Independent Television Commission are now considering ways of improving DTT coverage across the UK. The provision of cable services is a commercial matter for the cable operators. I understand from the ITC that no operator has plans to supply cable to the High Peak Area. Terrestrial Channel 5 services are not universally available in the area but are carried free-to-air on DTT and satellite platforms.

 The Broadcasting Act 1996 sets out a target of 50 per cent. of subtitling of digital terrestrial television programmes by the 10th anniversary of the start of the service. This will give viewers access to additional free-to-air and subscription channels with subtitles if they switch to digital terrestrial television. More generally, we are working with the broadcasting industry and consumer groups to ensure that viewers get accurate and sensible information about digital television. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced an agreed set of clear and simple messages on 31 October. We are keeping the rate of take-up of digital television under review to assess what further action might be needed to encourage take-up by all viewers.

<P>

<a name="01114w15.html_para3">The ACMSF report included recommendations for further research to characterise the origins of resistance in foodborne pathogens and commensal micro-organisms so as to improve the identification of the sources and routes of transfer of resistant organisms from the farm through food to humans. The ACMSF also recommended research into the use of microbiological risk assessment to quantify the magnitude of the key pathways by which microbial antibiotic resistance can transfer from food animals to humans via the food chain and the environment.

<a name="01114w15.html_para4">The Government are committed to a co-ordinated research programme to investigate problems associated with resistance to antimicrobials in the context of public health.

<a name="01114w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 From 1 January 1999 all British registered fishing vessels over 10 metres catching more than two tonnes of quota stocks have had to demonstrate an economic link with fisheries dependent communities in the United Kingdom. This link can be demonstrated in a number of ways, for example, by vessels landing at least 50 per cent. by weight of their quota catch into the UK or by employing a crew of whom at least 50 per cent. are normally resident in a UK coastal area.
<P>

<a name="01114w15.html_para5">In the first year of operation over 1,750 vessels caught more than two tonnes of quota stocks and in almost every case achieved a satisfactory economic link, primarily

through landings into the UK. Where a small number have failed to make the full list in 1999 they will be expected to make this up in 2000 and future years. The new arrangements have resulted in a significant increase both in the volume of landings made by foreign owned UK flagged vessels and in local expenditure on goods and services in the UK. They have also led to over 300 tonnes of additional quota being made available to fishermen in the under 10 metre fleet and non sector.

<a name="01114w17.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 I have frequent discussions with my right hon. Friends the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Social Security on a wide range of issues.
<P>

<a name="01114w17.html_para4">The Government announced in the pre-Budget report that the level of the basic state retirement pension would be increased by &#163;5 a week for single people in April 2001 and by &#163;8 for married couples. The Government also

<P><I>14 Nov 2000 : Column: 632W</I><P>
announced that in April 2002 the pension for single people will be further increased by &#163;3 with the pension for couples going up then by &#163;4.80. These increases are excellent news for the around 900,000 pensioners in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="01114w17.html_para5">The Government have taken major steps to combat pensioner poverty in Scotland. In the pre-Budget report, we announced that the Minimum Income Guarantee would be increased, from April 2001, to &#163;92.15 a week for a single pensioner and &#163;140.55 a week for couples. We also indicated that the Minimum Income Guarantee would be at least &#163;100 a week for a single pensioner and &#163;154 for a pensioner couple by 2003. The Winter Fuel Allowance will be set at &#163;200 per eligible household this winter, which helps around one million people in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="01114w17.html_para6">Finally, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security has announced details of the proposed pensions credit which will benefit single pensioners with incomes below &#163;135 and pensioner couples with incomes below &#163;200.

 The National Asylum Support Service is aware of two hostels in Leeds used for housing asylum seekers: Angel Hall and Angel House. Angel Group Ltd., a contracted provider of accommodation to the National Asylum Support Service (NASS), operates both of these hostels. Neither of these hostels is currently under contract to the National Asylum Support Service.
<P>

<a name="01114w17.html_para8">However, Angel Group Ltd. has occasionally used Angel Hall as a drop-off point and reception centre for asylum seekers dispersed to Leeds by NASS. These asylum seekers have then been moved to other addresses within the Leeds area.
<P>

<a name="01114w17.html_para9">One asylum seeker supported by NASS was temporarily housed for a short period in one of the Angel hostels in Leeds. NASS does use a hostel in Newcastle upon Tyne operated by Angel Group Ltd. called Angel Heights.

 The United Kingdom is a signatory to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) now given effect in domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998. In accordance with our obligations under Article 3 of the ECHR, exceptional leave to remain may be granted where credible medical evidence exists that return to the country of origin, due to a lack of medical facilities in the country concerned, would substantially reduce an applicant's life expectancy and subject them to acute physical and mental suffering, in circumstances where the United Kingdom can be regarded as having assumed responsibility for their care.

 I laid before Parliament, yesterday, regulations amending the Asylum Support Regulations 2000 to enable an increased rate of voucher support to be provided to under 16-year-old dependants of asylum seekers supported by the National Asylum Support Service with effect from 4 December. The rate will rise from &#163;26.60 to &#163;30.95 per week.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the outcome was of the consultation on the appointment of a joint Chief Inspector for Prisons and Probation.  [138537]
<P>

<P>
<a name="01114w19.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 As I announced on 9 June 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 392-93W, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons Sir David Ramsbotham's appointment was extended until the end of July 2001 when Sir Graham Smith, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Probation, is also due to retire.
<P>

<a name="01114w19.html_para5">In response to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for the Forest of Dean (Mrs. Organ) on 27 July 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 879W, I told the House that I had established a consultation exercise to gauge public opinion on proposals, including the option of a joint Chief Inspector, designed to ensure that the Inspectorates of prisons and probation support closer working between the two services while maintaining the independence and rigour of the inspection process. The consultation exercise ended on 31 October. Copies of the responses to the consultation exercise will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01114w19.html_para6">A majority of those consulted favoured some change--establishing terms of reference for the inspection of joint working between the criminal justice agencies and the sharing of inspectors between the Inspectorates. In contrast, only small minorities were in favour of the status quo, or of the appointment of a joint Chief Inspector for prisons and probation.
<P>

<a name="01114w19.html_para7">During the consultation exercise a helpful scheme was put forward by Her Majesty's Chief Inspectors of Constabulary, the Crown Prosecution Service, Magistrates' Courts, Probation, and Prisons to inspect practice across their boundaries systematically. This scheme has much to recommend it and the consultation exercise also suggests that it will command broad support. It is therefore the option which I propose to pursue, along with the arrangements canvassed in the consultation exercise for bringing the work of the Inspectorates closer together.
<P>

<a name="01114w19.html_para8">Both Sir David and Sir Graham have made significant contributions to raising standards in the prison and probation services respectively, and I am grateful to them for their work. In view of the retirements in July next year I shall be advertising both Chief Inspector posts in the New Year.

 Training for lay magistrates is organised and delivered locally but is based on the advice and syllabuses prepared by the Judicial Studies Board. In addition to the training pack and handout on anti-social behaviour orders (ASBO) which were sent out by the Board last year, we have issued two booklets to the relevant agencies including the magistrates' courts service: "Anti-Social Behaviour Orders--Guidance", produced by the Home Office in March 1999; and "Anti-Social Behaviour Orders--Guidance on drawing up

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many <i>(a)</i> violent crimes and <i>(b)</i> total recorded crimes there were in each police force area in (i) 1979, (ii) 1987, (iii) 1992, (iv) 1997 and (v) in each following year up to the latest date for which figures are available.  [137858]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01114w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The requested data are shown in the following tables. The violent crime figures are the total of violence against the person offences, sexual offences and robbery.
<P>

<a name="01114w20.html_para4">The figures before and after 1 April 1998 cannot be directly compared. This is because the Counting Rules for recorded crime were changed on 1 April 1998, with an expanded coverage of offences and the emphasis more on measurement of one crime per victim. All offences that are triable on indictment and triable either-way have been counted since this date, as are some summary offences which are closely linked to more serious offences. The change increased the overall count in England and Wales of the offence groups of violence against the person, sexual offences and robbery by 118 per cent., 4 per cent. and 1 per cent. respectively. More details of the change in counting rules can be found in Home Office Statistical Bulletin 18/99, entitled "Recorded Crime Statistics England and Wales April 1998 to March 1999", which is in the Library.

 The most recently published study of imprisoned mothers was "Imprisoned Women and Mothers" by Caddle and Crisp. It was commissioned by the Prison Service and published in 1997 (Home Office Research Study 162). The entire female prisoner population at the end of 1994, comprising 1,766 women, were surveyed. In-depth interviews were conducted with the 61 per cent. of that population who were either pregnant or mothers of children under 18.

<a name="01114w21.html_para0">In the report of a "Review of Principles, Policies and Procedures on Mothers and Babies/Children in Prison" (Her Majesty's Prison Service July 1999) and the Prison Service's Response and Action Plan (December 1999), a number of areas of research concerning the children of women prisoners was recommended. The Prison Service is giving consideration to these recommendations. Copies of both documents were placed in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many women were remanded in custody in each of the past five years; what proportion of these women later received a custodial sentence; and how many of them were mothers of children under 18 years.  [137352]

<a name="01114w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Information on the number of females remanded to custody is given in the tables. This information is published in successive volumes of "Prison statistics England and Wales" (Tables 2.2 and 2.6 of the 1999 edition, column 4805), copies of which are in the Library. Survey research suggests that about 60 per cent. of women in prison are pregnant or have children under 18 years. Separate figures are not available for those on remand.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many women's prisons provide facilities for extended day visits for children; and if he will make it his policy that all women's prisons should provide such facilities.  [137355]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01114w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Nine women's prisons offer extended visits, two have recently considered the feasibility of providing them, and the other two have open conditions. Our policy is to encourage establishments to provide such facilities wherever possible, although the extent to which each establishment is able to deliver this will depend upon individual operational and resource considerations. For this reason, I do not plan to make mandatory the provision of such facilities, either in women's prisons or the prison estate as a whole.
