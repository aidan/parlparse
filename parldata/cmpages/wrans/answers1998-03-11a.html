To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will instruct OPRAF to carry out an urgent investigation into the recent performance of Great Western Trains, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> punctuality and <i>(b)</i> overcrowding. [33145]<P>

<P>
<a name="80311w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Franchising Director monitors the performance of train operating companies under the terms of the franchise agreement, and he has wide ranging powers under the franchise agreement and the Railways Act 1993 where performance fails to meet the required standards. These powers have been increased following the offer by First Group PLC, a shareholder in the Great Western franchisee, Great Western Holdings Ltd, to buy out the other share holders.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) how many hectares of green-field land, not classified as Green Belt but currently available for building, there are in England;  [33477]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many hectares of green field land not classified as Green Belt, but available for building, there were in England on 1 May.  [33482]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80311w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 There is no specific definition of 'green-field' land, but it could be interpreted as 'land not previously developed'. This would include land under rural uses (e.g. agriculture, forestry) and also vacant land in urban areas that was not previously developed. Information on the amount of such land available for housing is not held centrally. My Department is currently working with the Local Government Management Board, local authorities, English Partnerships, and others to provide, by early 1999, a consistent assessment of previously developed land available for housing. This will be the first stage of a comprehensive Land Use Database for England, which will in due course provide a basis for assessing other types of land available for development.

<a name="80311w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 There is no specific definition of 'green-field' land, but it could be interpreted as 'land not previously developed'. This includes land under rural uses (e.g. agriculture, forestry) and also vacant land in urban areas that was not previously developed. The Department's Land Use Change Statistics provide information on the amount of land not previously developed that has changed to developed uses. Current developments of these statistics will enable separate identification of land inside and outside adopted green belt; estimates for changes that happened in 1994 should be available by mid-1998 and will be updated annually thereafter.

<a name="80311w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Information in the form requested is not collected centrally. I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave to the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman) on 11 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>234</i>; the information relating to the period before 1 May 1997 could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when the next figures will be published for the amount of Green Belt land in England.  [33479]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80311w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 There is no specific definition of 'green' land, but it could be interpreted as 'land not previously developed'. This would include land under rural uses (e.g. agriculture, forestry) and also vacant land in urban areas that was not previously developed. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has recently commissioned a major new survey of the British countryside. Countryside Survey 2000, as it is known, will provide figures on the amount of different rural land types and habitats. Results will be published in the year 2000.
<P>

<a name="80311w01.html_para2">Some land under rural uses is protected against development, as designated Green Belts. The most recent authoritative figures for the amount of land designated as Green Belt were for 1993. More up to date information will be available by summer 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what account he takes of expenditure by local education authorities on the cost of home-to-school transport in determining the standard spending assessment for those authorities;  [33492]
<P>
<UL>(2) what account he takes of expenditure by local authorities on the additional costs of educating pupils in village schools with below average pupil numbers in determining the standard spending assessment for those authorities.  [33493]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80311w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 In determining the total amount of education standard spending assessments, account is taken of the national costs of schooling including those costs related to home-to-school transport.
<P>

<a name="80311w01.html_para3">In setting the weight to be given to the sparsity factor in allocating the total of education standard spending assessments between authorities, account is taken of small schools with below average numbers of pupils for each teacher and of the costs of transport between home and school.

 The household projections are not an estimate of the number of new homes that are required. However, it is possible to identify how much of the projected change in household numbers for each region is due to migration of households into or out of the region.
<P>

<a name="80311w02.html_para0">The latest household projections show that between 1991 and 2016 the number of households in England is projected to increase by 4.4 million. The table shows the projected change in households for each Government Office Region, together with the amount of change that is due to net migration of households into and out of the region (including migration to and from the rest of the world). Equivalent estimates for the period 1991 to 2011 are not available.

 A number of individuals and organisations have expressed concern about the decision taken by a large majority at the CITES Conference in June 1997 to open the way for a limited resumption of trade in ivory. Many have also acknowledged the role played by the UK and other EU Member States in securing a deferral of commercial trade until essential safeguards are in place, including the establishment of systems for monitoring poaching and illegal trade. The EU abstained in the final vote but Member States have agreed to respect the majority will of the CITES Parties on a matter which is central to the basis of cooperation on which the future of CITES depends. Conservation of the elephant requires maximum effort to implement the full package agreed by the Conference which goes wider than commercial trade in ivory.
<P>

<a name="80311w02.html_para3">At its meeting in London last week, the CITES Standing Committee, under the UK's chair, reviewed progress. The Committee agreed proposals to allow audited ivory stockpiles to be sold for non-commercial purposes, and the proceeds used for conservation and related work in Africa. CITES representatives also endorsed proposals for two new systems for monitoring elephant poaching and trade. To assist further work, my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment

<P>
<P>
<a name="80311w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I intend to make regulations further amending the Building (Approved Inspectors etc.) Regulations 1985. These amendment regulations will provide that, with effect from a date later this year, applications from corporate bodies seeking approved inspector status shall be made to a designated body, not, as now, to the Secretary of State. I intend that the Construction Industry Council will be designated for this purpose. The CIC is already the designated body for applications from individuals seeking approved inspector status.
<P>

<a name="80311w03.html_para1">In preparation for this change, I am arranging for the CIC to undertake assessment of all new applications from corporate bodies received by my Department from now on. I will decide such applications in the light of the CIC's advice, in cases where the CIC's assessment is complete before the coming into effect of the amendment regulations. In cases where assessment is not complete when the amendment regulations take effect the decision will become the responsibility of the CIC.
<P>

<a name="80311w03.html_para2">There are a number of applications currently with the Department from companies seeking approved inspector status. I have decided to approve an application from RBC Ltd. This approval will take effect from 1 April 1998. My Department is notifying local authorities of this approval, in accordance with the Approved Inspectors Regulations. Subject to consultation with the applicants, the Department will arrange for the CIC to take forward the assessment of some of the remaining applications currently with the Department on the same sort of basis as for new applications.
<P>

<a name="80311w03.html_para3">Wider competition between approved inspectors and local authority building control should be a stimulus to greater efficiency and higher standards of service to the customer. To help bring about this result, I am working to devolve the setting of charges for local authority building control to individual local authorities. I also wish to see arrangements put in place for setting and monitoring compliance with common standards of building control applicable across the public and private sectors. I therefore welcome the establishment by the Local Government Association, the Construction Industry Council and the Association of Corporate Approved Inspectors of a Steering Group to draw up recommended standards and monitoring arrangements. The Steering Group will be holding its first meeting shortly.

The NDPBs with expenditure were ACLEC, Legal Aid Board, Law Commission, Court Service Tribunals and the Legal Aid Department for Northern Ireland. In many cases consultants are employed to contribute particular skills to an element of a much larger process. As a result their work will be only one of several factors leading to the eventual outcome. There is therefore no ready way of apportioning their particular contribution to savings achieved.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80311w05.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Circular Instruction 7/91 gives guidance to governors and staff in order to alleviate anxieties about the experience of appearing as a witness in court, and to avoid possibly prejudicing the outcome of a trial due to inappropriate behaviour. It was issued following the serious disturbances during April 1990 which resulted in unprecedented numbers of prison staff and prisoners being called as prosecution witnesses in criminal trials. Part 1 deals with prison staff appearing as prosecution witnesses

<P>
<P>
<a name="80311w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 In 1996, 232 offenders were sentenced at the Crown Court for manslaughter offences--an offence under Common Law or the Offences against the Person Act 1861, sections 5, 9 and 10. Of these, 13 were given hospital or restriction orders under the Mental Health Act 1983, sections 37(1) and 41, five a community sentence, three a fully suspended sentence and six were detained under section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. The remaining 205 were given a custodial sentence, of which 13 were life sentences. The average sentence length (excluding life) was 61.2 months.
<P>

<a name="80311w05.html_para1">Manslaughter due to diminished responsibility is an offence under the Homicide Act 1957, section 2.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80311w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The maximum penalty for manslaughter is life imprisonment and under section 2 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 the courts must impose a life sentence on offenders convicted of manslaughter committed after 1 October 1997 who have a previous conviction for a serious offence (as defined in the 1997 Act), unless there are exceptional circumstances.
<P>

<a name="80311w05.html_para3">Subject to the requirements of the 1997 Act, sentences in individual cases are a matter for the courts to decide from the full range of sentences available, taking into account the seriousness of the offence, including whether the offence is so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified. The range of sentences available to the courts include: absolute or conditional discharges; fines; community sentences; hospital orders; suspended sentences; or immediate custody.

Metropolitan Police officers do work jointly with other control authorities, including the Immigration Service. On occasions when Metropolitan Police officers operate on board trains without an immigration officer the police officers are asked that they clearly show their police warrants to ensure passengers identify them as police officers.

 I have received two such representations. The Government recognise the difficulties for exporters and manufacturers affected by the strong pound. The effect on exchange rates and exports is a factor that the Bank of England takes into account in determining interest rates.

<a name="80311w06.html_para5">The economic effects of exchange rate and interest rate changes are difficult to isolate, especially at the regional level. The claimant unemployment rate in Wales fell from 6.6% to 5.7% between May 1997 and January 1998. Low inflation and responsible wage bargaining will be key factors in securing healthy longer term job prospects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80311w06.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 Final decisions have not yet been reached on this matter. The categories of classified documents and other information extend beyond those dealing with subjects covered by the Official Secrets Act 1989. It will be important for those charged with making decisions on behalf of the Assembly to have available to them such documents or information as are necessary for the proper discharge of their functions.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what assessment (i) he has made and (ii) his Department has made, of the practical effects of making members of an elected assembly Crown servants for the purposes of the Official Secrets Act 1989.  [33930]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80311w06.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 The practical effects are likely to be limited, given that the Official Secrets Act 1989 is concerned with the unauthorised disclosure of information on matters which generally will not relate to the Assembly's functions. Ministers of the Crown, who are members of an elected Parliament, are Crown servants for the purposes of the Official Secrets Act 1989.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80311w06.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 The effect of clause 79 of the Government of Wales Bill is that a member of the National Assembly for Wales would automatically be a Crown servant for the purposes of the 1989 Act. There would therefore be no question of a member being disqualified for refusing to accept such a status.

 The Exchequer cost of tax relief for PEPs for 1997-98 of &#163;800 million includes a cost of &#163;300 million for capital gains tax, and &#163;500 million for income tax, of which basic rate repayments are &#163;400 million (including some &#163;300 million relating to the payment of tax credits on dividends on shares of UK companies) and &#163;100 million is higher rate relief.

 <i>[holding answer 19 January 1998]:</i> Chapelcross site, like all other nuclear sites in the UK, is licensed by the Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII). Regular and frequent inspections are a condition of the site licence and other statutory requirements. Since 1968 a total of 240 inspections have been carried out by the NII, who will continue the programme of inspections during the remaining operating life of the reactors on the site.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland (1) what account he took, in his recent appointment of new trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland, of the individual views of those appointed towards the establishment of a National Gallery of Scottish Art in Glasgow; if he will assess the financial implications of the policy of establishing such a gallery for the outreach programme involving municipal galleries; and if he will make a statement;  [31930]

<P>
<a name="80311w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Galbraith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 March 1998]:</i> In making appointments to the Board of Trustees, my right hon. Friend is obliged by the National Galleries of Scotland Act 1906 to have regard to the desirability of appointing people with knowledge or experience of Fine Arts, or of management, industrial relations,

administration or of any other subject which would be of use to the Board in exercising their functions. He also takes into account other factors such as the gender and geographic balance of the Board as a whole. He does not take account of the views of candidates on any particular aspect of the Board's business.
<P>

<a name="80311w08.html_para3">It is a matter for the Board of Trustees to consider in the first instance the financial implications of any policies which they are contemplating or are pursuing. Where firm, and costed, proposals are presented to my right hon. Friend which require adjustment of existing levels of grant-in-aid he would, first of all, have to be convinced of the merits of the proposals in policy and other relevant terms and, thereafter, to be in a position to provide any additional funding required--taking account of available resources and other competing bids for public funds.
<P>

<a name="80311w08.html_para4">As far as the proposed National Gallery of Scottish Art and Design is concerned, the Board of Trustees are aware of the Government's view that the capital costs of the project would need to be met from non-Government sources and that half of the running costs for at least the first four years of operation would have to be met from private sources. They are also aware that the provision of the balance of the running costs from public funds would be a matter for consideration in future public expenditure rounds.
<P>

<a name="80311w08.html_para5">The Board of Trustees at the invitation of the then Secretary of State agreed in May 1997 to consider a scheme for lending works of art to municipal and other suitable galleries. My right hon. Friend understands that the Trustees are giving consideration to a possible scheme taking account of resource requirements and he awaits their proposals.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment (1) what estimate he has made of the combined cumulative savings in the financial years 1998-99 to 2000-2001 at 1995-96 prices from the abolition of student grants and the introduction of tuition fees under the Government's preferred approach to the future funding of higher education;  [33266]

<P>
<P>
<a name="80311w10.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 March 1998]:</i> We said in July 1997 that our estimate of the cumulative combined savings from the Government's new higher education funding policy is &#163;250 million by 2000-01. The

<P><I>11 Mar 1998 : Column: 221</I><P>
estimated cumulative additional loans expenditure of &#163;2,250 million by 2000-01 is offset by savings of &#163;2,500 million resulting from the effect of the new fees and grants policy. These figures are for the United Kingdom and in 1995-96 prices. They do not reflect our decision to pay out loans on a termly basis, which released money in 1998-99. Further information will be available following the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will give the definition of permanently unfit to work used when determining whether a teacher is eligible to retire on the ground of ill health.  [33366]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80311w10.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Teachers' Pensions Regulations 1997 define incapacitated in the case of a teacher as unfit by reason of illness or injury to serve as such and likely permanently to be so despite appropriate medical treatment. Permanently is interpreted as including any teaching, full or part-time, up to the scheme's normal retirement age of 60.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80311w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Effective local partnerships are essential to the success of the New Deal. Local authorities clearly have an important part to play in this. We have encouraged them to become involved fully in local New Deal arrangements and they have done so very successfully.
<P>

<a name="80311w10.html_para2">In addition, I have met on a number of occasions with the Local Government Association (LGA), whose Chairman, Sir John Harman, is a member of the New Deal

[33849]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80311w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 15,190 service providers registered under Section 71(1)b of the Children Act 1989 and 488 local authority day nurseries and family centres registered under Section 18 of that Act are in receipt of nursery grant and are subject to Ofsted inspection.
<P>

<a name="80311w10.html_para3">Between September 1996 and March 1997, Ofsted carried out 2,187 inspections of providers registered under the Children Act and in receipt of nursery grant. From April 1997 to 6 March 1998, Ofsted completed a further 10,589 inspections of these providers, and I expect around 2,000 more to have been completed by the end of this month.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what representations the voluntary sector have made to his Department concerning the aims of the New Deal programme since the publication of the NCVO/NACVS information pack. [32887]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80311w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 We have carried out a wide range of consultations with the voluntary sector to encourage them to contribute to the New Deal, and have worked with NCVO and NACVS as part of this process. We are very grateful to both organisations for providing an information pack to enhance that effort. The process of consultation continues, and Ministers and officials are continuing to meet with representatives of the voluntary sector to discuss their potential involvement in New Deal. Given the wide scope of contact, it is not possible to identify specific representations in response to the information pack, but we welcome any feedback--positive or negative--that the voluntary sector may have.

<P>
<a name="80311w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The New Deal will provide employment, training and education opportunities for 18 to 24 year olds who have been unemployed for six months or more. The latest estimate of the cost to the Department for Education and Employment of the New Deal for Young People during this Parliament is &#163;2.7 billion. The actual cost will depend upon the level of unemployment and experience of running the New Deal.

<P>
<a name="80311w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 March 1998]:</i> In January 1998 twenty seven 18-24 year olds were recorded as having claimed Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) for six months or more in Christchurch. The New Deal for 18-24 year olds will benefit all young people who have been claimant unemployed for six months or more and remain unemployed, and all those who reach six months' claimant unemployment.
<P>

<a name="80311w11.html_para0">I have placed in the Library a list showing the indicative planning assumptions for participation in the New Deal for 18-24 year olds in 1998-99 in each local unit of delivery. These planning assumptions are based on current unemployment levels. They are not forecasts of the actual numbers who will participate in the New Deal for 18-24 year olds.
<P>

<a name="80311w11.html_para1">The planning assumption for the Dorset unit of delivery, which includes Christchurch, is that some 2,400 18-24 year olds may be eligible for the New Deal in 1998-99.

 Government support for education spending is provided mainly through the education SSA system but these are not recommended levels of expenditure. Information derived from the authority's General Fund Revenue Account returns suggests that Essex has spent above the level of its education SSA in recent years. For 1998-99, we believe that Essex County Council should use all of the &#163;27 million increase in the education SSA to raise standards in schools.

 The information is not available in the form requested. Different people in different places have recognised a variety of outbreaks of "related" conditions of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS)/(ME) over the last 35 years. However, there is no general agreement about which term should be used. There are advantages and disadvantages in using either the term CFS or the term ME and we will continue to use both.
<P>

<a name="80311w15.html_para0">The main agency through which the Government support medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC), an independent body which receives its grant-in-aid from the Office of Science and Technology, which is part of the Department of Trade and Industry. Priorities for funding research in the Department are set very carefully, based on the burden of disease and other criteria, and, as such, bids for conducting research into CFS/ME will always be considered.
<P>

<a name="80311w15.html_para1">The MRC currently provides support for one small project grant in the area of CFS/ME. This is being undertaken by Dr. R. K. Morriss at the University of Manchester and is entitled "The role of noradrenaline in the neuropsychological pathogenesis of the chronic

<P>

<a name="80311w15.html_para2">Another research project funded by the Department is entitled "Rehabilitation in the chronic fatigue syndrome--a controlled trial of cognitive-behavioural therapy". This study is complete and considered the question of whether cognitive behaviour therapy can reduce disability in CFS/ME. It was funded by South Thames Regional Office. Funding was for &#163;59,034.
<P>

<a name="80311w15.html_para3">The Department has been funding a research project through the National Health Service research and development programme called "Should General Practitioners manage chronic fatigue syndrome?

 Regulations to be laid in the near future will allow the development of more efficient administrative procedures for collection of the levies; that will reduce paperwork and be less burdensome for schemes, particularly small ones. The regulations will also simplify the calculation of levy liability, so that new schemes will have to pay only in their third year.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and play an important part in helping lone parents return to work. It may help to explain some details of our current organisation to show how we can improve substantially the accessibility to the public.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency currently has approximately 2900 staff working in Field offices throughout the country. However, in excess of 95% of those staff concentrate on backroom paper processing work so they do not have any face to face contact at all and are no more accessible to the public than those in the major processing centres. The number of staff years which are devoted to face-to-face contact is only currently 120 and in many locations there is fewer than one interview per day. We fully accept that this is not sufficient and restructuring will allow us to offer significantly more face to face contact on a peripatetic basis in a greater range of locations and in conjunction with the Benefits Agency (with whom many of our clients are also concerned). At the same time, we need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of other forms of contact with customers, and to improve our overall cost-efficiency sufficiently to help keep pace with increases of 50% on our workloads over the next 3 years.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We also know that many of our customers who are working prefer to deal with us by 'phone and do not need to be visited or interviewed but prefer to deal with us in the privacy of their own home outside normal working office hours. We are therefore currently developing proposals on how we might re-focus our resources to cope with an increasing workload which is responsive to our customers needs, while at the same time increase and improve significantly on face to face contact. Our current thinking is that we can move processing work into the Child Support Agency Centres and larger local centres which provide economies of scale and much better value for money for the taxpayer by allowing us to re-focus approximately &#163;5 million on clearing the backlogs of work and rising workloads. Processing paper in small offices is significantly more expensive and the restructuring will allow us to both improve our overall range of customer contact and our overall processing.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>So while we may not retain a permanent presence at our 218 sites we will still provide interview facilities where appropriate. We know a proportion of our customers will need to have face to face contact for a number of reasons but not necessarily at a DSS office. We are therefore exploring other options which could include for example Citizens Advice Bureaux or other Government facilities to increase our accessibility to the public.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Ministers have announced, part of our strategy to improve face to face contact with our customers is by working more closely with our colleagues in the Benefits Agency. From April 1998, Benefit Agency staff will interview and assist new Income Support parents with care to complete their maintenance application form where appropriate. Pilot studies have shown this to be both very cost effective and welcomed by individual customers. 75% of our parents with care will be interviewed; customers will have to provide 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>11 Mar 1998 : Column: 241</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>information only once, thus reducing overlap and repetition of work and it will reduce the incidence of fraud.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have also recently completed an evaluation on positive customer contact on the use of the 'phone. This has shown that early telephone contact with absent parents increases compliance and helps to speed up the assessment process which is a major concern to both individuals and their representative groups. Parents with care should therefore receive maintenance more quickly and it should help prevent arrears building-up for absent parents. We have also piloted a new approach in the way we deal with self employed cases which includes use of the 'phone and where appropriate or necessary, face to face contact, and this has been found to improve compliance significantly.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>With regard to consultation, we have presented our initial thoughts to the Agency's National stakeholder group which includes some 20 organisations such as National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, the Child Poverty Action Group, the National Stepfamily Association and Families Need Fathers. The Agency also produces a quarterly newsletter "Open Door" which is issued to all of its registered stakeholders. The October 1997 and January 1998 editions contain articles about the Agency's four year modernisation programme which will involve transferring processing work from small local offices to its main centres and a number of other large processing sites. The Agency Trade Union Side have also had the opportunity to participate in our planning and will be consulted as our plans are developed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am conscious, however that moving the backroom paper processing work which does not require face to face contact has to be done in conjunction with improvements to our telephone service and increase in staff resources in the Centres. This will allow us to open our 'phone lines for much longer and help to reduce the delays customers currently experience and is part of the review for the plans covering a four year period. I have asked for some further work to be done to examine how we can improve and increase face to face contact to deliver the Active Modern Service which our customers have every right to expect.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our objective in reorganising the way the Agency does its business is to provide an efficient accurate service which is more responsive to the variety of needs of our customers, and which offers them access and information in a range of customer-friendly forms to suit their variety of needs. This will increase the flow of maintenance and, where appropriate, enable parents with care to move from welfare to work.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The child maintenance formula can require the Agency to enquire, look at and consider over 100 pieces of information before an assessment can be made and it is inevitable that some time will

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>elapse before the maintenance assessment is made and the absent parent notified of his liability. The period between the date the child support maintenance liability begins and the date the maintenance assessment is made is referred to as the Initial Payment Period. Information on Initial Payment Periods is collected by the Agency's Financial Management System, and is only available at the current date and not for a retrospective period.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The average amount of maintenance outstanding relating to the initial payment period, as at 16th February 1998, was &#163;1,077.41. However, once maintenance liability has been established, there are several major factors which may quickly reduce this amount.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The child maintenance enquiry pack advises absent parents to continue making court order payments in the usual way until a maintenance assessment has been made. It also states that other payments presently being made for the children may be offset against any maintenance the Agency calculates; when these are reported and verified as child support maintenance, the amount of arrears is reduced accordingly. Either or both parents may ask for the assessment to be reviewed at this stage, which can lead to an adjustment in the original amount.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency addresses the issue of debt accumulating in the initial pay period by establishing contact with the absent parent as early in the process as possible and has also a facility to defer the effective date of an application for 8 weeks if an absent parent quickly returns his or her maintenance enquiry form. Encouraging the absent parent to cooperate with the Agency shortens the time between application and assessment, thus minimising the build up of arrears.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>These policies have proved to be effective as, from April 1997 to the 31 January 1998, the Agency has recorded over &#163;29m in voluntary payments made during the initial payment period in cases subsequently using the collection service.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where it is possible to identify from DLA records people who are in the exempt categories, these people are not visited or sent postal enquiry forms. The Benefits Agency has, however, acknowledged from the outset that some people in exempt categories will not be identified. That is because the main disabling condition which leads to an award is recorded using a numerical code, input at the time DLA is awarded. There are instances where the code alone will not always identify exempt groups. Paper files are also scrutinised by clerical staff in case there is further information available. Sometimes, especially where people have more than one disabling condition, it may not be clear that they are in one of the exempt groups and they may, therefore, be contacted.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If the customer does not bring relevant information to the attention of the visiting officer the Agency does not expect visiting officers to judge if a customer is in one of the categories we agreed not to contact directly. Many disabled people are helped by the use of aids which can disguise the extent of their disability and some conditions require clinical diagnosis. Visiting officers are clerical staff trained to gather data from customers in a sensitive way. They have no medical training.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Visits are terminated if the interview is causing distress to the customer. The Agency may need to re-visit or, alternatively, obtain the information another way. The visiting officer would also terminate enquiries if it appears clear that the person really needs someone to act for them. If the person refused to participate because they claimed to be in a category we have agreed not to contact directly, the visiting officer would withdraw from the interview and make further enquiries.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If BIP enquiries are abandoned before any information has been gathered on a case involving someone in an exempt category, no further action is taken on the case.

 The Government have made it clear that they wish to see a fully inclusive talks process but that participation in the negotiations is dependent upon total and absolute commitment to the Mitchell principles of democracy and non-violence.

Careful consideration will be given to any local proposals for change which have the support of parents and meet the objectives of improved standards and better value for money.

 The Chief Electoral Officer conducted a comparative analysis of a wide sample of absent vote applications across Northern Ireland for 1 May 1996 Elections, 1 May 1997 General Election and 21 May 1997 Local Government Elections. Applications were sorted alphabetically within wards. This enabled a comparison of forms from each applicant which highlighted any trends in handwriting, conflicting reasons or attestations over the same and adjoining geographical areas and from one election to the next.
<P>

<a name="80311w19.html_para12">The comparative study carried out by the CEO was on a Northern Ireland wide basis and only a sample of wards were investigated, with some Mid-Ulster wards among them. It is therefore impossible to state how many applications were considered fraudulent for the Mid-Ulster constituency. The examination did indicate irregularities in applications for Northern Ireland as a whole.

Oxtail soup can continue to be manufactured and sold in Great Britain because the processes involved in commercial production of such soup comply with the requirements of the Beef Bones Regulations and are considered not to involve any risk of BSE infectivity. Preparation of oxtail soup by restaurateurs and others for sale direct to the ultimate consumer is, however, prohibited under Regulation 3(2).

 <i>[holding answer 10 March 1998]:</i> We do not consider that the Early Marketing Scheme is achieving its objective of reducing beef production by encouraging slaughter at lower weights, or that the scheme is cost-effective. Moreover, the small scale of our veal industry would make the burden of administration disproportionate.

 <i>[holding answer 10 March 1998]:</i> Although the use of the narrow veal crate has been banned in the UK since 1990, the system is still used in many other member states, under EU legislation which permits this until 31 December 2006. Our legal advice is that Article 36 of the Treaty of Rome cannot be used to ban imports of veal that have been legally produced in these member states. We are currently awaiting a judgment of the European Court of Justice as to whether Article 36 would allow us to ban the export of calves to be reared in crates. When this judgment is available we shall need to consider whether it enables us to change our view of what action is open to us under Article 36.

Ensuring that other member states properly enforce EU requirements is a matter for the European Commission. We will pass on, for their attention, any evidence submitted to us on non-compliance in other Member States.

 The Department maintains an extensive programme of surveys for many types of chemical contaminants in food. Inevitably, it is necessary to undertake investigations into specific incidents when elevated levels of contaminants are found. These investigations are carried out at a number of public and private laboratories, including the Central Science Laboratory (CSL), York for pesticide residues and the CSL, Norwich for other chemicals such as dioxins and PCBs. The information is not held in the form requested and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, details on an annual basis are contained in the Annual Report on Food Chemical Surveillance; the second Annual Report is due to be published in early summer.
