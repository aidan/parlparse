Friend the Member for South West Surrey (Mr Hunt), recently announced that around £3 million from the public sector funding package for the Olympic and Paralympic Games would be made available to support a domestic tourism campaign to maximise the economic benefits from the Torch Relay and the Cultural Olympiad. This does not constitute the reallocation of unspent Olympic funds, but rather an investment in a key objective of the Olympic programme: to ensure that the benefits from the Games are felt throughout the UK. We hope to include the devolved nations in this campaign and the Secretary of State is in discussions with ministerial colleagues with regard to this possibility.

 The marginal cost of this year’s additional sitting has been relatively low as most operating costs are fixed costs and are therefore unaffected by the number and distribution of sittings, and there was sufficient notice to take the September sitting into account when planning the works programme. We estimate a marginal cost of around £200,000 will be incurred as the direct result of the two-week sitting in September. To avoid an accumulating backlog of works, further September sittings would be likely to have a marginal cost of some £1.5 million.</p>

 Paraguay's constitution gives legal recognition to its indigenous people. Paraguay has ratified the indigenous and tribal people’s convention of the International Labour Organisation and voted in favour for the adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. However, Paraguay's institutional framework could more effectively protect and promote the rights of indigenous people. During the recent Universal Periodic Review of Paraguay's human rights record at the UN, the UK pushed for Paraguay to ensure land disputes involving indigenous people are resolved effectively. Paraguay accepted this recommendation and committed to establishing a proper process to do so. UK relations with Paraguay are conducted through our embassy in Buenos Aires. The UK will continue to monitor this situation from there and through the EU Delegation in Asuncion.</p>

 As set out in the Tobacco Control Plan for England, the Department will launch a marketing campaign to remind smokers of the harms of secondhand smoke and to encourage smokers to make their homes and cars smokefree. This campaign is in the early stages of development and is expected to launch in March 2012. The tobacco marketing strategy, to be published later this year, will set out further details of how we will support efforts by local areas to encourage smokefree homes and cars ahead of the smokefree campaign.</p>

The results indicated that children are more likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke in their home or other people's homes, than in vehicles. However, 19% of children reported that they are still often exposed to secondhand smoke in cars (compared to 26% at home and 32% in other people's homes).</p>

 Bullying and harassment are not tolerated in the armed forces. All service and civilian personnel, regardless of rank or grade, have a right to be treated with dignity. All MOD employees have a responsibility to do all they can to ensure that the working environment is free from all forms of bullying and harassment and that the dignity of others is respected. This is clearly laid down, along with the procedures to be followed if a complaint is made, in the Joint Service Publication 763.</p>

               <a name="11101197000158"> The policy has not changed since April 2004. Its implementation has, however, been reinforced following criticism from the then Equal Opportunities Commission and recommendations made by Nicholas Blake QC in his review of the deaths at Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut. We have, for example, reviewed equality and diversity training to ensure it is delivered to all levels of personnel, and ensured that sanctions are brought against those found culpable of bullying or harassment. In response to the Deepcut review, we established the post of Service Complaints Commissioner in the Armed Forces Act 2006.</p>

In addition, independent scrutiny of our training environment is now provided through inspections carried out by Ofsted.</p>

 It is too early to provide an estimate of the projected savings accruing from training efficiencies as we continue to explore how best to prepare our armed forces to undertake the tasks that will be expected of them. We plan to introduce more modern and cost-effective methods of training and to deliver further efficiencies through estate rationalisation and improvements in the delivery of tri-service technical training.

 There are no plans to carry out such research. There are several pieces of research which have been commissioned about electoral registration to inform the move to Individual Electoral Registration (IER). We are funding the Electoral Commission this year to carry out a study into the completeness and accuracy of the electoral register which should be published before the end of the year. We have carried out a literature review to consider all the currently available evidence on registration, including which groups are most likely to be missing from the register such as young people or Black and Minority Ethnic groups. Further qualitative research will be carried out into these groups which will inform decisions on the transition to IER.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">Failure to pay child maintenance is not a criminal offence, so parents can not be prosecuted. However, where a non-resident parent fails to pay maintenance, there are a number of enforcement actions available. Money can be taken directly from a non-resident parent's earnings if the non-resident parent is employed, money can be taken directly from a non-resident parent's bank or building society account, or action can be taken to recover money through the courts.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">The most serious forms of enforcement are commitment to prison or disqualification from driving. The decision whether to impose these, and the length of any order made, is at the discretion of a Magistrates' Court (or Sheriff in Scotland) where they are satisfied that a non-resident parent has “wilfully refused or culpably neglected” to pay child maintenance—but these are not criminal sanctions.</p>

To ensure an equitable distribution of the benefits, the scheme requires a proportion of the carbon savings be achieved in the homes of 'priority' lower income households (aged 70 and over or on certain means tested benefits). In the first two years of the scheme, between April 2008 and March 2010, 3,861 Priority Group households in York benefited from subsidised loft and/or cavity wall insulation under the scheme. CERT runs to December 2012.</p>

This extension will be one of the routes that will help to maximise the number of young people moving off benefits into the 40,000 extra apprenticeships, targeted at unemployed young people, that were announced in the Budget.</p>

Further efficiencies are being sought by applying new ways of delivering this investment that will maximise value for money, as set out in Sebastian James's review of schools capital. The benefits of this innovative approach to driving out greater efficiencies is already evident in the Campsmount project in Doncaster, which is being built at significantly lower cost than BSF schemes of the same size.</p>

While a number of these groups would have raised admissions in the margins of those meetings, there were no meetings specifically to discuss just the admissions and appeals codes.

 The consultation closed on 19 August and we received a significant number of responses, particularly from parents. We are now finalising the draft School Admissions and Appeals Codes, taking account of the results of the consultation and the views expressed. It remains our intention to bring the new Codes into force in early 2012 in time for the September 2013 intake process. We shall publish a revised draft, as soon as possible, to assist schools and local authorities that are their own admission authorities develop their local arrangements in good time.

 Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make a very significant contribution to the UK economy. Statistics released by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills show that at the start of 2010, there were an estimated 4.5 million SMEs, accounting for 99.9% of all UK private sector enterprises. SMEs also contributed more than half of all private sector employment (13.3 million or 59.1%) and almost half of all private sector turnover (£1,600 billion or 48.6%). Other data produced by the Office for National Statistics estimate that in 2009, SMEs contributed almost half (48.3%) of all UK private sector output as measured by gross value added (GVA).</p>

 There are no robust data about the impact of late payment upon the productivity of small and medium-sized businesses but we do know that late payment creates a climate of uncertainty in the supply chain, inhibiting investment and innovation and stifling growth.</p>
