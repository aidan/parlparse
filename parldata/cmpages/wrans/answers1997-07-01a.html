<P>
<a name="70701w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Rowlands: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many claims by British nuclear test veterans have been made; and how many have been settled. [5447]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 It is not possible to say precisely how many claims for compensation from the Ministry of Defence have ever been made by British nuclear test veterans. However, my Department's computer records show that since 29 June 1976 109 claims for compensation for radiation linked illnesses have been made by ex-Service personnel who were involved in the British nuclear test programme. All of these cases have been repudiated because independent studies of the health of the test veterans showed that participation in the nuclear testing programme had had no detectable effect on the veterans' life expectation, or on their risk of developing cancer. However, nuclear test veterans may receive a War Pension, which is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security (Mrs. Harman).

<P>
<a name="70701w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. O'Hara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment his Department has made of the risks of damage to the environment through British military exercises in the Akamas peninsula in Cyprus; and what measures <i>(a)</i> are being taken and <i>(b)</i> are planned to minimise such damage. [6255]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Every effort is made to minimise the environmental impact of military training on the Akamas peninsula. Particular care is taken to avoid starting fires, the most important potential cause of damage from training. Exercises involving live ammunition are undertaken in the wetter and cooler months to minimise the risk. Use of the area is kept to the minimum required to meet essential training requirements and we have offered to discontinue training on the Akamas altogether if the Government of the Republic of Cyprus can provide a suitable alternative site.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Rapson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement about Defence Agency status for the Army's Recruiting Organisation. [6439]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 On 1 July the Army's recruiting function will be amalgamated with the Army Individual Training Organisation (AITO) which is an existing Defence Agency. As a result of its expanded responsibilities the AITO will be retitled the Army Training and Recruiting Agency (ATRA). The ATRA's Chief Executive, a Major General, will be known as the Director General Army Training and Recruiting (DGATR). The ATRA's headquarters will continue to be based at Upavon, Wiltshire; alongside the Headquarters of the Adjutant General who will continue as the Agency's owner. The Agency will assume responsibility for an additional 598 military and 337 civilian staff employed at various recruiting units, including the Armed Forces Careers Offices and Army Careers Information Offices throughout the country. Altogether the ATRA will employ 11,153 personnel at 178 locations.
<P>

<a name="70701w01.html_para0">The integration of the recruiting and individual training functions into a single Defence Agency will further improve efficiency and effectiveness in the provision of trained manpower to the Army. The ATRA's mission will be "to recruit and train young people to become the best soldiers in the world". The Chief Executive has been set the following Key Targets for the first year of operation:

<P>

<P>
<a name="70701w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Sedgemore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 19 June, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>263</i>, what factors underlie the differences of policy between Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary and his Department in respect of the disclosure of the name of the company whose baton gun is authorised for police use in the United Kingdom. [6296]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 There is no difference in policy between my Department and Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary in this respect. My Answer of 19 June to my hon. Friend, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>263</i>, related to the manufacturer of the baton rounds rather than the baton gun.<i></i><i></i>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Sedgemore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to the answer of 19 June, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>262</i>, what happened on or before 24 March to prompt his Department to advise the RUC that some 1994 plastic baton rounds were outside agreed specification when earlier tests carried out in 1995 were not considered conclusive. [6107]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 June 1997]:</i> Following a meeting of MOD technical staff in February 1997 to discuss the baton round development programme, the MOD decided that rounds manufactured in 1994 should be withdrawn from operational use. This decision was taken in the light of the tests carried out in 1995 and 



<P>
<P><I>1 Jul 1997 : Column: 74</I><P>
further tests which had been conducted in 1996. The 1996 tests showed that batches of rounds manufactured in that year did not exceed the specification and were therefore to be preferred to the 1994 rounds.

<P>
<UL>(2) what help his Department will make available to employees of Marconi Communications in Chelmsford who have been made redundant to help them retrain and get back into work; and if he will make a statement. [3786]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 June 1997]:</i> I have met with the hon. Member to discuss this matter. I understand that he has also raised with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Small Business, Trade and Industry the question of what help can be made available in the fields of retraining and assistance. The Ministry of Defence does not currently have a role in such measures. However, I hope that in the future our developing policy towards defence diversification will offer some help in similar situations. As I told the House on 16 June, the Government will be making proposals in the autumn on how best to give effect to the objectives for defence diversification as outlined in our manifesto.

The issue of possible European Court of Justice jurisdiction has yet to be discussed.
<BR>
<i>The Government's views</i><i></i>
<BR>
As all conventions agreed under the third pillar require unanimity, it may be taken that Her Majesty's Government were content with any role established for the Court in respect of the concluded conventions. As regards draft conventions still under discussion, the Government's general approach is to consider the possible need for European Court of Justice jurisdiction in each case on its merits.

This will then be forwarded to Brazil where Her Majesty's ambassador will exchange instruments with a representative of the Brazilian Government. The treaty will come into force on the date of the exchange of instruments of ratification. Only then could any request for extradition be made. In line with normal practice, I would not disclose the existence of any request until proceedings had been instituted in the requested state.

 Guidance is issued regularly to electoral registration officers on all aspects of electoral registration as this is required. Written guidance was last issued to electoral registration officers and acting returning officers in England and Wales on 19 June.

 We are examining this issue carefully and will look at the points mentioned by my hon. Friend.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he plans to take to ensure that persons requiring a postal vote at elections are properly informed about the availability of postal votes and proxy voting and have time to complete the relevant forms. [5049]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Absent voting facilities were publicised at the general election through a television campaign and advertisements in the national press. We are currently reviewing the effectiveness of this publicity. The closing dates for absent vote applications were recently relaxed as set out in the Representation of the People (Amendment) Regulations 1997.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w03.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Hinchliffe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reasons forms for infirm elderly and disabled persons requiring a postal or proxy vote were not available at some electoral registration offices prior to the 1997 general election. [5050]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 I understand that in the Wakefield area, just before the general election, application forms for an absent vote for an indefinite period were not available. Electors affected by this were provided with alternative application forms so that they could obtain an absent vote for the elections on 1 May. They were subsequently supplied with application forms to give them absent votes for an indefinite period.

<a name="70701w03.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Barnes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will estimate the numbers of disabled people who failed to vote at the last general election due to their inability to gain access to polling stations; and if he will make a statement. [6014]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Information on the number of disabled people who could not vote in person at the general election because they could not gain access to a polling station is not collected centrally. District and London borough councils are statutorily required to designate as polling places, so far as is reasonable and practicable, only places which are accessible to the disabled. Acting returning officers may apply to the Home Office for grants towards the cost of providing temporary ramps where it is not possible for them to use a building for the purpose of a polling place which affords easy access for the disabled. Grants are also available for specially adapted polling screens for use by the disabled.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="70701w03.html_para1">Information on the number of people arrested for specific offences is not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="70701w03.html_para2">Available court proceedings data, by police force area, are given in the table. 1996 information will be available in the autumn.

 Subject to final agreement on their salaries, three special advisers are being appointed in the Privy Council Office: Mr. Ian McKenzie, Mr. Damien Welfare and Miss Marianne Morris. Special advisers are employed on terms and conditions based on a model contract, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House. Mr. McKenzie is to advise me, and Mr. Welfare and Miss Morris are to advise my noble Friend the Lord Privy Seal, in his capacity as Leader of the House of Lords, on a range of matters concerning parliamentary business and, in particular legislation, in accordance with schedule 1 (part 1) of the Model Contract. The number of special advisers to Ministers in the Privy Council Office during the financial year 1996-97 was two.

 Responsibility for this subject has been delegated to the Planning Service under its chief executive Mr. T. W. Stewart. I have asked him to arrange for a reply to be given.
<i>Letter from T. W. Stewart to Mr. Eddie McGrady, dated 26 June 1997:</i>

<P>

<BR>
The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your Question about the Down and Newry and Mourne area plans.
<BR>
As I explained in my recent letter of 20 June 1997 on this issue, the review of the Down and Newry and Mourne area plans is not included in the Agency's Business Plan for 1997-98, a copy of which is enclosed. I explained that the programming of work on both plans will be taken into account in accordance with competing priorities and available resources. At present, there is no agreed time-scale for the commencement and execution of the work.
<BR>
I do hope this further clarifies the position.

<a name="70701w04.html_para2">These figures show there has been a significant increase in the overall numbers of absent votes in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="70701w04.html_para3">It is also the case however that in almost half of the local government areas the number of voting papers issued in 1997 were down on the 1993 figures. In Antrim by 24 per cent., in Moyle by 21 per cent. and in Down by 20 per cent. In areas where there has been an increase it has been less than 12 per cent. in over a quarter and less than 20 per cent. in over half. Nevertheless in 1997 in four local government areas (Strabane, Magherafelt, Omagh and Ards) voting papers issued increased by more than 25 per cent.

 Communications about political matters from Heads of State to the Sovereign are referred to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and therefore come within the ambit of the Public Records Acts. The forthcoming White Paper on Freedom of Information will address the issue of public access to all types of government records.

The Voting procedure for directives on either of these issues would be Qualified Majority Voting.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what will be the United Kingdom's approach to the negotiations on a successor to the fourth Asian, Caribbean, Pacific/European Union Convention of Lome. [6144]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The Lome Convention is the main cooperation agreement between the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states, covering political dialogue, development assistance and preferential trade access for ACP goods to the EU. It is one of the mainstays of the UK's relations with the ACP states. We will play a leading role in formulating the EU's mandate for a successor to Lome IV, especially during our Presidency in 1998. We will work for a coherent outcome which increases poverty focus and improves effectiveness, promotes an outward-looking EU and strengthen links with the Commonwealth, 38 of whose members belong to the ACP group.

 We aim to build a new, broad and forward-looking relationship with China. We want Hong Kong to be a bridge not a barrier between us, but that will depend on China honouring its undertakings in the Joint Declaration. Britain and China have substantial common interests. We look forward to dialogue and cooperation across a full range of issues.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w07.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will review the charging to policyholder funds of the costs of mis-selling of pensions by insurance companies. [3304]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 June 1997]:</i> The Department has been in regular contact with all life insurance companies on a number of issues arising from pensions mis-selling, including the attribution of costs.
<P>

<a name="70701w07.html_para0">In October 1994, in the light of SIB's publication of criteria and procedures for assessing whether compensation should be paid to individual pension policyholders, the Department made clear that each company would need to consider where the costs should fall on its funds; and indicated that, while the precise arrangements would vary according to the circumstances of each office, the Department considered the following general principles to be relevant:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) With profits funds which, in normal circumstances, stand to profit from the sale of pensions business can reasonably be expected to bear a corresponding share of the costs associated with that business.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70701w07.html_para1">However,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) Compensation costs should not be regarded as a normal expense of the business for the purpose of assessing bonus rates; and
<P>
<BR>
(iii) The Department would expect proprietary offices to consider whether it is appropriate that some part of the compensation cost be met from outside the long-term fund, to enable the reasonable expectations of policyholders to be fulfilled.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70701w07.html_para2">The overall objective of this guidance was to minimise the risk that the costs of compensation would have an adverse effect on the levels of bonus paid to policyholders.
<P>

<a name="70701w07.html_para3">The Insurance Companies Act 1982 gives the Secretary of State powers to intervene in individual companies' affairs, to protect policyholders against the risk that the company may be unable to meet its liabilities, or --in the case of life and pensions business--fulfil the reasonable expectation of policyholders. The Department stands ready to use these powers, though on current evidence it 



<P>
<P><I>1 Jul 1997 : Column: 95</I><P>
believes that their use to impose a particular attribution of the costs of pensions mis-selling is likely to be justified only in exceptional cases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w07.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Paice: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she intends to abandon the use of the CE mark as an indicator of the safety of imported toys. [5168]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The CE marking is not a European mark of safety or quality intended for consumers. Its purpose is to indicate to enforcement authorities that the toys bearing it are intended for sale in the European Community and signifies a declaration by the manufacturer or his authorised representative that the toys have been designed and manufactured in accordance with the requirements of the relevant European directives. All toys supplied in the United Kingdom, whether manufactured here or imported, must comply with the Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995 which implement the European requirements and trading standards officers have the necessary powers to remove non-complying toys from the market.

<P>
<a name="70701w07.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Corbyn: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade what estimate she has made of the annual cost to the Government of subsidies to the defence industry per person employed on defence-related work in each of the last three years. [4751]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 June 1997]:</i> It is not possible to answer the question in the way posed because the Government do not provide subsidies to the defence industry. However, the Department and others, through our on-going sponsorship activities, support and encourage the competitiveness of the industry as it does to a whole range of sectors.

<P>
<a name="70701w07.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will assess the advantages of requiring auditors criticised in her Department's inspectors' reports to bear part of the costs. [4826]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 June 1997]:</i> The role of Companies Act inspectors is to investigate rather than to perform a judicial function of apportioning blame. It would therefore not be possible to recover costs from any party criticised by Companies Act inspectors. Inspectors' reports can be and often are the basis of subsequent action by the Department or by other prosecutors and/or regulators. Under section 439(2) of the Companies Act 1985 a person who is convicted on a prosecution initiated as a result of the investigation may be ordered to pay all or some of the costs of that investigation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 June 1997]:</i> The regulation of auditors is a matter for their recognised supervisory body to whom any complaints should be made. The Department's powers of investigation are broadly directed towards limited liability companies and to persons carrying on investment business, rather than the affairs of auditors.

<P>
<a name="70701w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 June 1997]:</i> As the hon. Member will be aware, a working party has been established to consider whether there are ways in which regulation of the insolvency profession might be made more effective in the public interest. The working party intends to issue a draft report by way of a consultation document in the autumn and will clearly welcome responses from all those with an interest in insolvency. I shall give careful consideration to any recommendations the working party may make in its final report.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade has no plans to do so.
<P>

<a name="70701w07.html_para4">Guidance on the rights and duties of auditors required to report to regulators in the financial sector was set out in the Auditing Practices Board's (APB) "Statement of Auditing Standards" (SAS) 620, issued in March 1994 and revised in March 1995. The APB has published two further SASs that clarify the rights and duties of auditors when reporting fraud or any other non-compliance with regulations. These are SAS 110: Fraud and Error and SAS 120: Consideration of Law and Regulations. Copies of these documents are available for inspection in the Library of the House.

 The draft EC directive on the application of open network provision to voice telephony and on universal service for telecommunications is scheduled to come into force on 1 January 1998. The directive defines

universal service as a defined minimum set of services of specified quality which is available to all users independent of their geographical location and, in the light of specific national conditions, at an affordable price. The Government are keen to ensure that EC universal service obligations guarantee consumers a good quality service at an affordable price, whilst not imposing unreasonable burdens on new entrants to the EC telecommunications market.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what discussions she has had with the European Space Agency on the rescue of the Ariane 5 Cluster Mission of June 1996; and if she will make a statement.[4636]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 June 1997]:</i> I took the opportunity of my visit to the Paris air show on 17 June to hold an introductory discussion with the senior management of the European Space Agency. I was very encouraged by the approach being taken by the agency in maintaining excellence in space research and development, while focusing on the competitiveness of European industry and increasing further the value the UK and other member states gain from their investment in ESA. I look forward to working with the new Director General of ESA, Mr. Rodota.
<P>

<a name="70701w08.html_para0">The failure of the first Ariane 5 launch in June 1996 was a severe blow to the European space community and to scientists, many of whom are in the UK, planning to work on data from the four Cluster satellites. I am therefore very pleased that ESA has been able to gain approval for a recovery mission in the year 2000, this time using a Soyuz launch.
<P>

<a name="70701w08.html_para1">ESA and its member states have also made a splendid effort in reorganising their space programmes to cover the cost of the launch failure. The successful launch of Ariane 502, now planned for September, will clearly be of the utmost importance for Europe's space capability.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade (1) what assessment she has made of the risk of extra industrial pollution elsewhere in the world as a result of tighter emission controls in the United Kingdom; [5841]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment she has made of the impact of tighter controls on industrial emissions than elsewhere in the world on the numbers of <i>(a)</i> job losses, <i>(b)</i> factory closures and <i>(c)</i> bankruptcies in the United Kingdom. [5842]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 In recognition of this risk, the UK seeks the greatest possible international participation in environmental agreements, both to maximise the potential environmental benefits and to minimise any risks to our competitiveness that might arise. Studies by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have not so far identified evidence of significant industrial migration to countries with lower environmental standards.

 <i>[holding answer 27 June 1997]:</i> The targets are the responsibility of the Department. The TTA has not in the past been invited to submit advice to the Department on the whole range of issues involved, but on occasion we have discussed particular aspects--such as the necessary assumptions on course length and wastage--with Agency staff. The Select Committee on Education and Employment, in its sixth report, recommended that TTA be given a greater role in advising the Department on the staffing model and training targets and that its advice about them should be made public. The Government's response will be published shortly.

It is not possible to give an unemployment rate for particular age groups. I can confirm that the unemployment rate for all age groups for the North West, based on May 1997 information, is 5.3 per cent.

 Our Welfare to Work objectives are to provide work incentives, to reduce poverty and welfare dependency and to strike a new balance between rights and responsibilities. A programme of monitoring and evaluation is under way to enable us to ensure that Jobseeker's Allowance contributes to achieving our objectives. In addition to this major evaluation exercise, we shall also keep the individual benefit rules under active consideration as we develop our plans.

 The Government is supporting candidates from LEA-maintained schools taking the National Professional Qualification for Headship with &#163;4.5 million in 1997-98 through the Grants for Education Support and Training programme. This funding is allocated to LEAs on the basis of the number of schools in their area; central support for candidates is not dependent on the financial ability of their school to make contributions.

 About &#163;100 million will have been saved from the phasing out of the assisted places scheme by the year 2000, and annually thereafter the savings will be in excess of &#163;100 million a year. That is adequate funding to fulfil our pledge to reduce class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds by the end of this Parliament.

<a name="70701w09.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Over the last four years over &#163;6 million has been made available to Wakefield Training and Enterprise Council (TEC) as part of the agreed "Coal Plan" to assist in areas affected by the closures of collieries. Of this over &#163;4.5 million has been paid directly to the TEC, and the balance has been available to fund allowances to support unemployed adults attending additional Training for Work provision organised by the TEC. Other Government funding available to the TEC will also have benefited former mining areas. Wakefield TEC commissioned PRISM Research to undertake a full independent evaluation of its activities under Coal Plan Funding. The findings were published in a series of reports published in April and May 1997 and copies have been received by Government Office York and Humberside officials. Conclusions were generally positive.

 Wakefield TEC's record of working with local bodies has been formally evaluated within the context of the TEC Licensing process, and more generally within the TEC annual planning and contracting round. Wakefield TEC was awarded a Licence to run from three years from April 1995, and as part of this was found to be fully competent in its ability to work with local partners to develop and implement a shared agenda, which is a key element of the licensing process. The TEC annual re-contracting evaluation process covers all aspects of the TEC's capacity to work with partners. Wakefield TEC is a founder member of and plays a key role in the Wakefield Economic Alliance and also plays a key role in the Wakefield Partnership which includes representatives from the business, voluntary and education sectors.

 Wakefield TEC's annual budget for 1996-97 was &#163;8,602,358. A total of 3,643 young people/adults secured training placements as part of Youth Programmes (YP) and Training for Work (TFW) in 1996-97. Information is not available about the total number of employment placements, although all young people within the YP will undertake work experience, and work placements also form an integral part of TFW. There were 302 Modern Apprenticeship starts during 1996-97, and a total of 1,069 NVQs were gained by Youth Trainees (60 NVQs per 100 leavers). One thousand and forty two adults leaving TFW secured employment, resulting in Wakefield TEC achieving an average of 50 jobs per 100 leavers.

 The budget provided by this Department for Training and Enterprise Councils in England in 1996-97 is provisionally estimated to be &#163;1.2 billion.
<P>

<a name="70701w09.html_para0">A range of mechanisms are in place to monitor efficiency and promote value for money. Government Offices negotiate and monitor key performance targets. They also assess the effectiveness of each TEC's financial control environment to ensure public money is properly protected. In addition, the TEC Quality Assurance: Supplier Management (TQA: ASM) framework sets out the quality requirements which the Department places on TECs and which it requires TECs to make of their suppliers. The Department is also considering proposals to establish an inspectorate that would assess the quality of Government funded training provision.

 The Government's contract with Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) sets eligibility conditions that TEC directors must meet. However, TECs are private companies and the appointment of directors to TEC boards is determined by the members of the company acting in accordance with the company's Articles of Association. It is for each TEC to decide on its own membership in accordance with its contract with government and the TEC National Council's "Framework for local Accountability of TECs" which has as its first principle clarity and openness in the selection of well qualified and trained board members.

 Most university museums are funded by their parent universities. In addition the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) provides "non-formula funding" in support of a number of university museums of national importance. These are listed in HEFCE Circular 9/95, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="70701w09.html_para1">The HEFCE reviewed its non-formula funding of museums in 1993 and 1994 and announced its decisions in March 1995. The criteria for funding were published in HEFCE Circulars 5/93, 46/93 and 9/95, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="70701w09.html_para2">Circular 9/95 listed the amounts that each museum would receive in 1995-96 and announced the Council's decision that, on the recommendation of its Museums, Galleries and Collections Review Group, the distribution of non-formula funding in respect of university museums would not be reviewed for at least five years. Funding allocations in support of university museums before 1995-96 could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="70701w09.html_para3">The Department for Education and Employment, the other Education Departments and the Department of National Heritage work together closely on policy for funding university museums. Funding of university museums in Scotland and Wales is the responsibility of the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales respectively.

 The estimated full-year cost, in 1997-98, of reducing VAT on domestic fuel and power from 8 per cent. to 5 per cent. is around &#163;450 million; estimates for the other options can be approximated pro rata.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what stamp duty is on share transactions in <i>(a)</i> Germany, <i>(b)</i> France and <i>(c)</i> The United Kingdom; and what assessment he has made of the impact of differential stamp duties on share transactions on the competitiveness of the City of London.

 UK stamp duty on share transfers is generally charged at 0.5 per cent. In certain circumstances--for example, a transfer of shares into a depositary receipt scheme--the rate of duty is 1.5 per cent.
<P>

<a name="70701w10.html_para0">In France a stock exchange turnover tax is charged on both purchases and sales of shares. The tax is charged at 0.3 per cent. of the price up to FF 1 million, and 0.15 per cent., on any excess of over FF 21 million. The amount of tax is then reduced by FF 150. The maximum tax on a transaction is FF 4,000. There is also a 1 per cent. registration tax on deeds relating to the transfer of company shares, up to a FF 20,000 maximum.
<P>

<a name="70701w10.html_para1">There is no share transfer tax in Germany.

The original table provided was regretfully incorrect due to miscalculation. I now attach a table providing the corrected nominal and real interest rates which I hope rectifies any confusion ONS caused.
<BR>
As stated in my original letter, the real rate of interest is calculated as the nominal rate of interest adjusted by removing the growth in inflation over the 12 month period. The basis of the calculation is the base interest rate of retail banks adjusted for the change in the retail price index excluding mortgage interest payments.
<BR>
The annual rate of interest is a weighted average of the retail banks' base rate over the year. The weights are the number of days a particular interest rate is in operation.
<BR>
Real interest rates are calculated by adjusting the annual nominal rates by the change in the rate of inflation over the previous year (refer to footnote). The Bank of England also calculate real interest rates, but use indicators of future inflation rather than recorded price changes in the previous year. Latest movements are detailed in their <i>Inflation Report.</i><i></i>
<BR>
Once again I apologise for the inconvenience this error has caused you.

<i>Letter from Tim Holt to Mr. Edward Rowlands, dated 1 July 1997:</i>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply as Director of the Office for National Statistics to your recent question on what the effects are of the introduction of Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) on unemployment figures for a) the UK and b) Wales.
<BR>
The measure of unemployment, derived from the quarterly Labour Force Survey (LFS), is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and counts as unemployed people who are: a) without a paid job; b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained. However, largely because it is a sample survey, information is not available from the LFS in as much geographical detail as from the claimant count measure described below.
<BR>
ONS also publishes the monthly claimant count, which is based on the administrative system and includes all people claiming unemployment-related benefits (i.e. Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support or National Insurance credits) at Employment Service offices on the day of the monthly count, who on that day had signed 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>1 Jul 1997 : Column: 121</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on as unemployed and available to do any suitable work. Essentially, all people who attend an Employment Service office to sign are counted, irrespective of whether they are actually receiving benefit.
<BR>
There have been two main types of JSA effect on the claimant count figures:
<BR>
1. Changes to rules - the effect of the main change in the rules under JSA, to means test after 6 months rather than twelve months, is proving very difficult to disentangle from other JSA and real economy effects. The best estimate that can be provided is that this has led to around 30,000 extra claimants leaving the count in the UK since the introduction of JSA. A breakdown of this estimate by country is not available.
<BR>
2. Behavioural - it is likely that the introduction of JSA has had an effect on claimant behaviour, such as deterring fraudulent claims, but it is impossible to quantify this using available data.
<BR>
The estimates of ILO unemployment properly reflect people's behaviour in the labour market, as reported in LFS interviews, and are not dependent on the receipt of unemployment-related benefits. It is, however, possible that labour market behaviour could have been influenced to some extent by the introduction of Jobseekers' Allowance, although this cannot be quantified.

 From 1997-98 onwards the same payment rules will apply to all self-employed taxpayers, whether individuals or partners. But in 1996-97 special transitional rules apply. For certain partnerships--broadly, those with businesses which commenced prior to April 1994--the transitional arrangements mean that the existing rules are retained for one final year. As in previous years therefore the tax due for 1996-97 is payable in two instalments, on 1 January 1997 and 1 July 1997. Normally interest will only arise on any additional tax for the year, over and above the amount originally assessed, which remains unpaid after 1 July 1997.

 The estimated full year yield at 1997-98 income levels of increasing the top rate of income tax from 40 per cent. to 50 per cent. is &#163;5.3 billion. The yield includes the consequential effects on the yield of capital gains tax after allowing for likely changes in the volume of disposals. It does not take account of any behavioural effects which might result from the introduction of the new rate.

 Good local government should be a partnership between local people, businesses and voluntary groups and our mandate is to give authorities the powers necessary to develop these partnerships.

<P>

<a name="70701w15.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The powers to limit an authority's budget requirement are set out in sections 57 to 59 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992. Where these powers have been exercised, the authority is required to make substitute calculations by virtue of section 60, which applies to billing authorities, and section 61, which applies to precepting authorities. Under section 31 a billing authority which makes substitute calculations is required to set substitute amounts of council tax and there is an equivalent requirement for a precepting authority in section 42. Costs of rebilling fall to the billing authority except where they result from a substitute precept issued by a precepting authority. In such cases, section 31 allows the billing authority to recover its administrative expenses from the precepting authority.

 Existing national policy (PPG12) provides advice to local authorities on the content of structure plans, including the need to ensure that interactions between land use policies for housing and economic development are fully considered.

 A cross-Government group is reviewing existing travel policies and identifying what measures can be taken to reduce the environmental impact of travel. Departments are being encouraged to draw up green transport plans to address issues such as staff commuting and official business travel. Guidance on green transport plans is being developed by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to assist other Departments. The Government has also been encouraging public and private sector organisations to look at ways of minimising staff commuting by car and cutting down on environmental impacts of car fleets. The Government's general transport policies to encourage use of public transport and reduce car dependency, will also affect public servants' travel decisions.

The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking if she will increase the discretion of local managers of benefit offices to allow those who may be currently required to appear in person to collect benefit, to be paid their benefit by post.
<BR>
The manner in which benefit is paid is determined by a Benefits Agency officer acting on behalf of the Secretary of State. These officials have a duty to safeguard public funds and to ensure that the customer receives the benefit to which they are entitled. There are circumstances where officials may consider it necessary for a customer to collect their benefit in person. These may be where the customer has an unsafe postal address or is homeless.
<BR>
A customer's individual circumstances are always considered when the payment method is determined. There are no plans to change the level of discretion an officer acting on behalf of the Secretary of State has in determining whether a customer is required to collect their benefit in person.

I hope you find this reply helpful.

<a name="70701w19.html_para5">On Monday 16 June I announced that due to the urgent nature of proposals for maternity and theatre facilities at Glasgow Royal the Government would provide &#163;36 million of public funding. Other aspects of the package of schemes will continue to explore PFI. I also decided that PFI was inappropriate for proposals for the redevelopment of the Western general hospital in Edinburgh and on Monday 23 June announced that &#163;40 million would be provided for a new ward and theatre block.
<P>

<a name="70701w19.html_para6">Information on sums spent on preparatory work is not centrally available. However we estimate that costs should be not more than 1.5 per cent. of the capital value of a project. In view of the innovative nature of PFI boards and trusts have been provided with some funding to help cover these costs. As at 30 April 1997 grants to projects listed above amounted to approximately &#163;4.7 million. We expect costs to decrease significantly as the PFI process becomes more streamlined. It should also be noted that much of the preparatory work for a project is necessary regardless of whether it will be funded publicly or under the PFI.

 CPT-II is the manufacturer's code name for a chemotherapy drug, Irinotecan hydrochloride which this year acquired a product licence from the Medicines Control Agency. While the Department of Health does not undertake research into new drugs prior to licensing, the Medicines Control Agency assesses the research evidence relating to their quality, safety and efficacy before licensing. The dose of CPT-II is adjusted for the size of patient; the cost of one dose is &#163;830 on average and some patients may have up to six doses, at intervals of three weeks.
<P>

<a name="70701w20.html_para6">The drug came on the market only three months ago. Further research is underway to assess its role in comparison with current standard treatment and many doctors will await the outcome of this research before deciding whether to use this drug. For these reasons, it is too early to derive meaningful information on where the drug is being provided. The decisions on whether to use any drug takes into consideration the medical details of the individual patient and evidence as to whether the patient is likely to benefit.

 As my hon.

Generally we would expect that the health care professionals dealing with the patient should be able to provide the advice and support that the patient needs. A few may require more specialist counselling and support. Patients who have a positive test should, if they wish, be referred to a specialist for further advice on the management of their disease, including more specialised counselling. It is for those commissioning services to ensure that suitably trained staff are available to advise such patients irrespective of how they were infected.

<a name="70701w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) considered this issue at its meeting on 23 May 1997 and has since produced a statement entitled, "Research Into The Link Between BSE and nvCJD" (SEAC, June 1997). The statement summarises the key research results on the question of whether there is a causal link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD) which have emerged since March 1996 when SEAC first concluded that the most likely explanation for the cases of the new variant CJD was exposure to BSE before the introduction of the Spongiform Bovine Offals ban in 1989. The statement concludes that the evidence that has accumulated since the March 1996 announcement is consistent with the hypothesis that nvCJD is caused by exposure to the BSE agent, and that no evidence refuting the hypothesis that nvCJD is caused by exposure to the BSE agent, and that 



<P>
<P><I>1 Jul 1997 : Column: 145</I><P>
no evidence refuting the hypothesis has yet come to light. However, SEAC regard the evidence to date as insufficient to constitute formal scientific proof of a causative link, and that further data are required before a firm conclusion can be reached. A copy of the statement has been placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w22.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 There is a significant body of research connecting tobacco advertising with children's smoking, both in predisposing children to start smoking and reinforcing the habit in those who have already started. Research, most recently that commissioned by the Health Education Authority to be published this week, indicates that the percentage of 11 to 15-year-olds who report having seen adverts for cigarettes in the last six months is as high as 96 per cent. Studies have also repeatedly shown that children who smoke choose brands which are most heavily advertised, and there is also evidence that adult consumption is affected by advertising. The 1992 Smee report on the effect of tobacco advertising on consumption found that in individual countries the balance of evidence shows that advertising does have a positive effect on consumption, copies of this report are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="70701w22.html_para2">Controlling tobacco consumption requires a much wider range of measures if we are to have a real impact and see a significant and lasting reduction. The Government summit on smoking on 14 July will inform the development of a range of policy measures to tackle smoking; the resulting policies will be set out in a White Paper to be published later in the year. An advertising ban is a necessary part of that package of complementary measures.

<P>
<a name="70701w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 MAFF has a collaborative agreement with Electrophoretic International (EI) which was effective from 22 December 1995 for one year. Certain clauses of the agreement continue to operate.

 The agreement was signed on 22 December 1995 and has not expired in respect of all its provisions.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the risk to public health from hunt kennels which are assessed to be unsatisfactory under the BSE enforcement programme. [5669]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 No formal assessment has been made of any possible risk to public health arising from failings identified during State Veterinary Service (SVS) audits of the controls under the Specified Bovine Material (SBM) Order 1997. Hunt kennels are required to remove SBM from the carcases of fallen stock which they take from farms and stain and dispatch it under controlled conditions for eventual rendering or incineration. Failings identified by the SVS have related to items such as inadequate staining, storage or record-keeping. These do not pose a risk to public health. Nevertheless immediate remedial action is required to be taken by the operator in all cases, and is subject to a further unannounced visit by the SVS shortly afterwards to check that it has been carried out. Hunt kennels are not permitted to sell for human consumption any of the remainder of the meat recovered from carcases. This is for feeding to the hounds only.

 Cattle slaughtered under the Over 30 Months Scheme are eligible for a weight-based payment, currently worth just under 65 pence per kilogram, irrespective of their overall weight. With effect from 4 August payments will be restricted to a maximum weight of 560 kg per animal and the rate for cows will be reduced to a little under 58 pence per kilogram.

<P>
<a name="70701w23.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 There is no disparity. At present all cattle slaughtered under the Over 30 Months Scheme attract the same rate of compensation per kilogram. However, with effect from 4 August the payment rate for cull cows will be approximately 7 pence per kilogram lower than the rate applying to all other cattle slaughtered under the scheme and payments will be restricted to a maximum weight of 560 kg per animal.

<a name="70701w23.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It is important to distinguish between the types of drift net in use. Coastal salmon drift nets and other small scale inshore drift nets are not believed to have much, if any, adverse environmental impact. The only high seas drift net fishery in which UK vessels take part is the seasonal North-East Atlantic tuna fishery. There is evidence that these drift nets do capture non-target species.

 None. We have taken this decision to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Department. Maintaining the unit at Truro has cost the taxpayer an additional &#163;100,000 a year (at current prices) since 1992.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many incidents of food poisoning have been attributed to the sale and consumption of New York dressed poultry in each of the last five years. [5312]<P>

<P>
<a name="70701w24.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="70701w24.html_para0">There is no record of any incident of food poisoning implicating New York dressed poultry during the last five years. Although the majority of food poisoning outbreaks are investigated the cause of infection is not always identified. For single (sporadic) cases it is not feasible to investigate the infective vehicle.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the dumping of radioactive waste in Beaufort's Dyke. [6461]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70701w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Documents recently discovered in the Public Record Office show that small quantities of laboratory waste and luminous materials which fall within the definition of low or intermediate level radioactive waste were dumped in Beaufort's Dyke during the 1950s. The "<i>Report of the Independent Review of Disposal of Radioactive Waste in the North East Atlantic</i>" by Professor F. G. T. Holliday, which was placed in the library of the House on its publication in 1984 and on which Ministers have relied in answering subsequent questions in this House, makes no reference to such activities.

<P>

<a name="70701w24.html_para1">Naturally it is regretted that the House was given inaccurate information in the past. Copies of the documents have now been placed in the libraries of both Houses of Parliament. Further searches of the archive records are being undertaken as a matter of urgency and if any new information comes to light we will make it public.

<P><I>1 Jul 1997 : Column: 160</I><P>

<a name="70701w24.html_para2">Monitoring undertaken regularly since the early 1960s confirms that this dumping had no measurable effect on radioactivity levels in the area which remain well within internationally agreed safety levels. From 1963 all dumping of radioactive waste was restricted to waters at least 2000m deep and from 1982 the UK ceased all dumping of radioactive waste at sea.
