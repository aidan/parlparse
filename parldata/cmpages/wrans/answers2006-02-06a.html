 In total, US$77.5 million has been pledged by the international community to the Government of Afghanistan&#039;s Counter Narcotics Trust Fund. This includes US$60.1 million worth of assistance pledged during the London Conference on Afghanistan (31 January to 1 February) by the UK, US, Sweden and Korea.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the proportion of Afghan warlords who have <i>(a)</i> supported and <i>(b)</i> opposed the Taliban.  [48769]</p>




<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60206w01.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The term &quot;warlords&quot; is most often used to describe militia commanders, or others exercising influence in the provinces, not appointed by the central Government. The vast majority of warlords opposed the Taliban regime, and many played an active role in the regime&#039;s overthrow in 2001, including in some cases by contributing forces to the Northern Alliance.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60206w01.html_spnew3"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The Government assesses that the negative influence of &quot;warlords&quot; in Afghanistan&#039;s political process is gradually diminishing. Those who chose to embrace the new democratic process were required to cut all links with militia groups before putting themselves forward as candidates at the September 2005 parliamentary and provincial elections. Those who still remain outside the democratic process are finding their influence reduced by nation-wide

disarmament programmes and the growing control exercised by centrally-appointed Provincial Governors and Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police forces. But this is a long process&#151;democratic institutions, although now established, are fragile and the political process of resolving violent conflict will take time to have effect, though the Government of Afghanistan is determined to see it through.

[47242]</p>




<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60206w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Douglas Alexander: </b> 
 There is no indigenous population, or &quot;islanders&quot;, on Ascension Island. People working and living there do so for the duration of their contracts. None of those individuals currently working and living on Ascension, whether born on the island or not, have the right of abode or the right to own property. The human rights of those currently on Ascension Island are protected by those human rights instruments which have been extended to the island, including the European Convention on Human Rights. Procedures relating to deportation for breach of the immigration rules are governed by the Entry Control Ordinance. There is a right to make representations to the Governor against any deportation order.

 The agreement between the UK and US Governments relating to Wideawake Airfield, which came into force on 1 October 2003, provides for up to four non-scheduled civil aircraft movements (take-off or landing) per week. This facility has not been used on a regular basis. This is a matter for commercial decision by potential operators.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what the reasons were for the rejection of a desk study into the Ascension Island Fisheries Protection Project; and what estimate was made of the cost of such a study.  [47246]</p>




<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60206w01.html_spnew8"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 A desk study on Ascension Island&#039;s fish resources was conducted in 1990. Another desk study would not add greatly to the information available from this earlier work (a further study would have cost approximately &#163;30,000) and is not considered an appropriate use of Foreign and Commonwealth Office funds.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what estimate he has made of the potential revenue from the sale of fishing licences for tuna in the seas around Ascension Island.  [47327]</p>




<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60206w01.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Douglas Alexander: </b> 
 Revenue accruing from the sale of fishing licences for Ascension Island was, up until 1 April 2005, combined with that for St. Helena. The figure for 2003&#150;04, the most recent available, was approximately &#163;128,000. Because of the level of uncertainty surrounding both the current state of the stocks of migratory fish in that part of the Atlantic and the intentions of distant water fishing fleets, Ascension Island has not sold any fishing licences since 1 April 2005. It is therefore difficult to estimate the potential revenue from the sale of fishing licences for Ascension Island.

 There is no indigenous population, or &quot;islanders&quot;, on Ascension Island. People working and living there do so for the duration of their contracts. Figures on retirement or termination of contracts are a matter for the individual organisations based on the Island and are not centrally held. A small number, less than 5, have remained on the Island on the expiration of their contract. Their cases are under review.

 There is no indigenous population on Ascension Island. People working and living there do so for the duration of their contracts. Employees whose contracts end, and are not renewed, are required by law to leave the Island. Figures are held by employer organisations, and we therefore do not have access to this information.

<a name="stpa_31">Funding for infrastructure development features prominently in both DFID and EU programmes to support the Overseas Territories. We have worked closely with the EU on a number of projects. Notable recent examples include new airports on Montserrat, Anguilla and Grand Turk and road infrastructure on Providenciales. DFID is also providing funding for an

On Pitcairn, work to pave the Hill of Difficulty, the only access road from the harbour to the main settlement of Adamstown, and make essential repairs to the jetty and slipway was completed during 2005. In addition we are planning to fund jointly with the EU repairs to the harbour wall on Tristan da Cunha and the construction of a breakwater on Pitcairn.

<p>
<a name="60206w05.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_32">DFID&#039;s programmes focus on those countries which still need development assistance along the path to self-sufficiency. We would normally look to the wealthier Overseas Territories to finance their priorities for capital expenditure from their own resources, including under normal commercial borrowing terms. The EU also largely focuses its development programmes on those Overseas Countries and Territories (OTC)s whose economic development is least advanced. Similarly, we would not expect EU grant funding for infrastructure to be available for those OCTs with ready access to commercial borrowing.

[46906]</p>




<p><a name="st_51"><a name="60206w05.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Douglas Alexander: </b> 
 A Department for International Development (DFID) commissioned report by the Tyndall Centre called the Impacts of Global Climate Change on the UK Overseas Territories (OTs) found that long-term weather characteristics are likely to change. It concluded that regional warming in the Caribbean could be as much as 6 degrees by 2100, and slightly less in the South Atlantic and Pitcairn.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60206w05.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_33">The report identified common areas of concern as many OTs share similar characteristics. In particular, many are islands with populations reliant on a fragile natural resource base. The effects of climate change include severe tropical storms and hurricanes in the Caribbean and likely increases in the severity and frequency of low rainfall events and droughts in all areas. Global sea level rise is now projected to be as much as 0.9 meters by 2100 and in the medium-term raised sea levels will exacerbate the effects of more severe storms, directly affecting coastal infrastructure and tourism.

<a name="stpa_34">On 30 January the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) published the book &#039;Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change&#039;. Although not specifically directed at the impacts of climate change on OTs, the book discusses many of the potential impacts that OTs can expect to see in the future, such as degradation of marine ecosystems and increases in global sea levels.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60206w05.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_35">As the international community makes efforts to tackle this global problem, the UK is keen to raise awareness in OTs of the impacts of climate change on their societies.

We know that unprotected sex is the most common cause of infection, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Worldwide less than one in five people have access to basic HIV prevention services (including sexual and reproductive health services). This &quot;prevention gap&quot; is fuelling the spread of HIV. Improving access to a comprehensive range of effective HIV prevention information, services and supplies including sex education for young people and condoms for all those who are sexually active, is therefore important and this is what our programmes supports.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60206w08.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_62">The UK led the support for the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) prevention policy &quot;Intensifying HIV prevention&quot; at its June 2005 Programme Coordination Board, which I attended. This policy clearly emphasises the importance of evidence-informed prevention and we took the opportunity in negotiating and agreeing this policy to engage in dialogue with UN partners, European Governments, the US Administration and other donor Governments on the importance of comprehensive sexuality education, linking sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and HIV programmes and access to SRH supplies including female condoms.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60206w08.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_63">Building on this, as EU president, we steered and secured agreement on the first EU wide policy Statement on HIV Prevention launched on World AIDS day 2005. This affirms the commitment of all 25 European member states to comprehensive and evidence based HIV prevention programming including:
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">Universal access to SRH health information and services</p>

<a name="60206w08.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_64">We are co-chairing the Universal Access steering group with UNAIDS. This group is helping to ensure that the commitments made at Gleneagles and at the World Summit to develop and implement a package for HIV prevention, treatment and care with the aim of as close as possible to universal access to treatment for all those who need it by 2010 are turned into action. Within this process we continue to emphasise the importance of integrating comprehensive SRH information, services and supplies, including female and male condoms, and sex and sexuality education&#151;into HIV programming.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60206w08.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_65">We believe that SRH services should play a more effective role in efforts to prevent HIV, but recognise that more resources are needed to do this. DFID has recently commissioned some work to explore how 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Feb 2006 : Column 791W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the way we work helps or hinders the linkages between HIV and SRH policy, programming and funding arrangements. The forthcoming United Nations Special Session (UNGASS) in June 2006 will be an important opportunity to highlight the importance of SRH to HIV programming.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60206w08.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_66">The US does have different policies from the UK in a number of areas related to international development. This is particularly so in HIV prevention and SRH. We have, for example, different positions on issues promoting sexual abstinence and ensuring availability of safe abortion services as well as access to clean needles and syringes as harm reduction measures. There has been discussion of these differences in global and bilateral meetings. We will continue our dialogue with the UN, European Governments, the US Administration and other donors; but we will, as we always have, continue to work with US colleagues to promote country-led evidence-based and effective approaches to tackling the HIV epidemic and we will continue to promote the importance of access to a full range of sexual and reproductive health information, services and supplies.

<p><a name="st_75"><a name="60206w08.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 In 2004&#150;05, DFID&#039;s bilateral expenditure on projects which were targeting effective reproductive health services was &#163;194 million. This figure is reported in the document entitled &#039;Statistics on International Development&#039; (SID) 2005 (Table 20), (which is available in the Libraries of the House) and reflects all projects that were recorded as having a primary or significant focus on effective reproductive health services. It should be noted that some of these projects will also have had a primary or significant focus on other areas such as education or health systems development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60206w08.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_67">DFID&#039;s overall bilateral spend on reproductive health services is likely to be in excess of &#163;194 million, as further money has been spent on reproductive health by multilateral agencies supported by the UK such as the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the World Health Organisation, and by partner governments receiving &quot;Poverty Reduction Budget Support&quot; (PRBS) from the UK.

<a name="stpa_68">The expenditure figure for all projects that were shown against the tackling HIV and AIDS marker as having a primary or significant focus is also given in SID (Table 20). However, this does not represent DFID&#039;s total bilateral expenditure on HIV and AIDS. A methodology for calculating total expenditure on HIV and AIDS related projects has been developed. Figures for HIV and AIDS expenditure in 2004&#150;05 using this methodology will be available soon.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60206w08.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_69">When referring to SID table 20 on DFID expenditure it is important to note that data for different markers cannot be added together. This is to avoid double counting of expenditure.

 Under the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, consumers are offered protection from telephone cold calling through the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) scheme. This has proved to be an effective deterrent with 11.2 million registrations to date. No one is allowed to make an unsolicited marketing call to a subscriber who has either previously notified the caller that they do not wish to receive such calls or has been registered with the TPS scheme for at least 28 days.

 The Government considers that part two of the Bill, which introduces the statutory regulation of claims management services, will have no impact on collective conditional fee agreements. Statutory regulation will ensure that those who provide claims management services must abide by rules and a code of practice, providing much needed consumer protection. This will not affect the various methods available for funding claims.

 The Ministry of Defence pursues a range of policies aimed at helping personnel achieve a better balance between their work and their personal lives, where this can be done without affecting operational effectiveness. Our long term strategies seek to reduce pressure by lengthening tour intervals, improving career development and, through our future basing strategy delivering improved family stability throughout consecutive tours. We also provide access to a wide range of welfare services, where service families can go for advice and support at all times. We maintain close links with mediation and support organisations such as RELATE to help ensure that additional specialist support is made available whenever required.

 Rest and Recuperation (R and R) provides service personnel, on mentally and challenging deployments, a respite from a stressful operational environment in order to sustain their operational effectiveness. R and R should not, therefore, be considered as compensation for separation from family and friends. Post Operational Leave (POL) exists to meet this requirement (the entitlement to POL does begin on the day that service personnel leave their permanent duty station). Depending on the exigencies of service, the operational chain of command will authorise the time, location and duration of any period of R and R, basing their decisions on published guidelines. We have recently carried out a review of all leave and absence types in the light of the advent of the new tri-service joint personnel administration (JPA) system, which will roll out on a single-service basis throughout 2006. It was not considered appropriate for the qualifying period of deployment for R and R to begin before personnel arrive in theatre.

<a name="qnpa_12">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) takes its responsibilities for the environment very seriously. However, there continues to be a vital requirement for the United Kingdom to maintain a maritime capability to protect crucial lines of communication, to participate in operational activities and to be able to address potential mine and submarine threats, now and in the future. To ensure that our military capabilities in these areas are fully maintained, it is imperative that we continue to use active sonar, both now and in the foreseeable future.

Furthermore, sonar is essential to protect UK waters and ensure safe navigation. That said, this certainly does not imply that our sonar activities are undertaken without the fullest possible respect for the environment.

<p>
<a name="60206w21.html_para2">
<a name="qnpa_13">Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are undertaken for a wide range of our activities in the marine environment, including sonar. Such EIAs cover the marine habitat of the operating area concerned and the species likely to be encountered. The EIAs are used to better tailor the activity and ensure that potentially damaging effects are identified during the planning stage of the exercise and reduced their impact to an absolute minimum. With the same aim in view, we have also issued instructions to all our ships&#039; Commanding Officers for the operational use of sonar in the marine environment. This guidance employs the precautionary principle of &#039;Plan, Look, Listen and Act&#039;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60206w21.html_para3">
<a name="qnpa_14">While we believe that our operating procedures reflect the best scientific advice and provide a sustainable balance between the need for effective military training and the need to protect our marine environment, we are certainly not complacent. The MOD continues to be closely involved in research, in the UK, with the US and NATO authorities, and in other international forums into the possible effects of sonar noise on marine life. Should any new research provide evidence of a link between our method of using sonar and a detrimental effect on marine life, we would, of course, consider what further mitigation measures might be possible. In the meantime, the current measures reflect the best scientific advice available.

 The Government Communication Group (GCG) and the Government Communication Network (GCN) were set up in 2005 as part of implementing the recommendations of the independent Phillis Review of government communications.

<a name="stpa_152">The GCG is a small strategic team within the Cabinet Office, headed by the Permanent Secretary Government Communication.
