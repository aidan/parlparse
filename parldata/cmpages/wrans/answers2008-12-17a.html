Our analysis shows that there is unlikely to be any difference in overall carbon dioxide savings between this system and the original Commission&#146;s proposal which had lower penalties for non-compliance in earlier years.</p>

Any reduction in g/km carbon dioxide savings measured by the test cycle will need to be matched by additional g/km carbon dioxide savings from the eco-innovations.</p>

 Information about English local authorities' actions under the homelessness legislation (Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected quarterly at local authority level. Data collected includes the number of households accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty (to secure that suitable accommodation is available). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available.</p>

We have made additional funding of over &#163;30 million available from 2009 which will go to support local agencies, such as home improvement agencies (HIAs), to help older people with minor repairs and adaptations. This is one of a number of initiatives for the promotion and development of HIAs and better home repairs and adaptations services included in &#145;Lifetime Homes, Lifetime Neighbourhoods&#151;A National Strategy for Housing in an Ageing Society&#146;, published earlier this year, addressing the housing and related service needs of older people.</p>

This project aims to set out a broad agenda for the evolution of the HIA sector to its next level.

The budget will rise by a further &#163;10 million in the next two years increasing to &#163;166 million by 2010, an increase of over 30 per cent.

 Purchasers of new build homes in most cases are afforded protection through the provision of measures such as warranties. Under the terms of a typical warranty, the builder is responsible for putting right any defects caused by breaches of any technical requirements for the first two years (from completion). From years three to 10 the warranty provides insurance against the cost of repairing certain specified defects. In addition, existing contract law offers avenues of redress for purchasers of new build homes who are dissatisfied with the performance of the homebuilder under the terms of their contract. The buyer can either take action through the courts for monetary compensation or to have the contract performed properly.</p>

This is intended to be fully operational by March 2010.</p>

The EC campaigned vigorously on this point but encountered too much opposition to agree a consensus.

 At present there are no plans to formally extend the Thames Path National Trail from its end point at the Thames Barrier. However, the provision of a long distance footpath on either side of the Thames from the Thames Barrier to Southend in Essex and Sheppey in Kent is a key ambition of the Thames Gateway Parklands Vision launched by Communities and Local Government (CLG) in October of this year. A scoping study was launched at the Thames Gateway Forum by CLG to help progress the initiative, outlining the feasibility and estimated costs of approx. &#163;37 million. As yet there is no financial commitment for this Thames Gateway Parklands project, but its potential contribution to the Thames Gateway as the UK's first Eco Region is recognised.</p>

The Bill places a requirement on Natural England to determine the appropriate approach to the Thames Estuary in consultation with land owners and stakeholders as set out in a statutory scheme for England approved by the Secretary of State. Natural England has published a draft of this scheme on their website and the Thames is used as one of the examples in this to illustrate the proposed approach to estuaries.</p>

 The Thanet Inquiry was produced in June 2005 by the (then) Kent Child Protection Committee.

Furthermore, Section 16 of the Act reaffirms local authority responsibilities to ensure visits to looked after children including those placed out of authority and a long way from their homes.</p>

 Child deaths which result in a Serious Case Review being undertaken may be due to a range of causes but it is not possible precisely to quantify the number of methadone related child deaths from the information held by the Department for Children, Schools and Families. Serious case reviews should always be conducted when a child dies and abuse or neglect is known or suspected to factor in the death.</p>

 The legislative provisions for Income Contingent Repayment student loans require that the rate of interest must: (i) be no higher than is necessary to maintain the value of the loan in real terms; and (ii) not exceed 1 per cent. above the highest of the base rates of a specified group of banks<sup>(1)</sup> (the &#145;low interest cap&#146;). The interest rate is normally set every September to equal the retail prices index for the previous March&#151;currently 3.8 per cent. Following the reduction in the Bank of England base rate by the Monetary Policy Committee on 4 December 2008, all the specified banks have reduced their base rates to 2 per cent. and the low interest cap comes into play. The Student Loans Company (SLC) have therefore reduced the interest rate for income contingent loans from 3.8 per cent. to 3 per cent. with effect from 5 December 2008 until further notice. The SLC have published this information on their website and in national newspapers.</p>

 The Department has an extensive range of policies, standards and procedures for the protection of information (including personal data), and the associated information technology systems. In common with all data controllers formally registered under the Data Protection Act, there are legal obligations placed on the Department to ensure that personal data is properly protected from theft or loss, and the Department takes these responsibilities very seriously. It is not in the interests of data subjects for the Department to publish the detailed methodologies, controls and processes which apply to the protection of information in general and personal information in particular, and the related security policies that apply to information technology systems. To do so could enable individuals to deduce how successful the Department is in protecting its systems, in identifying vulnerabilities, and detecting attacks, and might assist such persons in testing the effectiveness of the Department&#146;s controls, and thus unlawfully procuring information and data.

Help is available from the Adviser Discretion Fund to provide financial assistance at the point of transition into work, and a return to work credit is also available to ensure work pays once people move from benefit and start work.</p>

 Winter fuel payments provide a significant contribution to people&#146;s heating costs in winter and were created to give pensioners reassurance that they can afford to heat their homes in winter. This winter, an additional payment will be made of &#163;50 for households with someone aged 60-79 and &#163;100 for households with someone aged 80 or over increasing the winter fuel payment to &#163;250 and &#163;400 respectively. Pensioners may also qualify for cold weather payments when there is a spell of very cold weather in their area.

As to the concerns about possible links between suicide and the internet, I informed the House on 17 September 2008, <i> Official Report,</i> column 142WS, that we intend to update the language of the Suicide Act in a way which we hope will make clear that it applies as much to online actions as it does offline.

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. Establishments are categorised by their main role as at the end of 2007-08. Establishments that have more than one role have been placed in the category that represents the primary or dominant function of the prison. For example, HMP Moorland is designated as category C adult but includes a large young offender population. For this reason, performance of prisons within a category cannot necessarily be compared on a like for like basis.<br>
2. YOI refers to young offender institutions.<br>
3. Data for Elmley, Stanford Hill and Swaleside is reported under the Sheppey cluster. Similarly, data for Brockhill and Hewell Grange is reported together as a cluster, listed as Hewell.<br>
4. There are a number of factors which will cause differences in prison costs, such as the size, age, location and category of the prison, the prisoner population (including gender and age) and the internal regime and rehabilitation work followed.<br>

The Home Office appraisal of overseas primate breeding centres is an ongoing process taking account of additional relevant information as it becomes available, whether that be from the breeding centre itself, from users or other stakeholders. Part of this appraisal is to ensure, as far as is practical, from the records maintained, that the non-human primates are not wild caught.</p>

 Under the auspices of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, the Local Resilience Forum structure has, since its implementation in 2005, been the primary means through which police forces and other category 1 organisations collaborate to develop emergency plans which would include flood preparedness. Although police forces are engaged in the preparation of their own flood response arrangements, the majority of preparedness is achieved collectively through multi-agency planning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_567"><a name="81217w0023.htm_para8"><a name="08121797000139">All Local Resilience Forums have carried out assessments of the risks of emergencies in their areas, and I understand that most recognise flooding as a high risk. Most Local Resilience Forums have a collectively agreed multi-agency flood response plan; and nearly all of the main category 1 responders within them, including police forces, either contribute to these plans or take account of flooding incidents in their own emergency response plans. Most of the plans that exist had already been reviewed in the period following the summer 2007 flooding; and multi-agency plans are being further reviewed following the issue of new guidance from Government in February this year.</p>

 The cost to the customer is clearly the principal barrier to providing new connections to communities and households beyond the mains gas network, including rural areas. Because of the benefits that access to gas offers deprived and other households, the Government developed a model to provide connections to deprived communities by packaging a range of existing funding sources and using independent gas transporters. The successful application of that model was instrumental in persuading the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) to incentivise the large gas networks, such as Wales and the West, to connect deprived communities under the 2008-13 Gas Distribution Price Control.</p>

There are a variety of incidence rates in different geographical and social circumstances and these differ more that would be expected than from simple random or chance variations. This uneven distribution (or clustering) occurs at all levels of population distribution throughout the country, down to very local levels such as those of electoral wards. It is not known why childhood cancers tend to cluster like this. Much attention has been given to interactions between exposure to infections and immune responses. Other possible explanations have also been considered, including exposure to environmental agents. The analyses in this report have been carried out on the largest dataset of childhood cancer cases ever compiled anywhere in the world.

 An update to existing guidance issued on 12 December 2007 to the NHS on priority treatment for war pensioners for any condition related to their service (HSG(97)21) extended entitlement to all veterans from 1 January 2008. This included a requirement that all GPs and clinical staff in PCTs and acute and mental health trusts and NHS Foundation Trusts were made aware of the changes. In line with the Government&#146;s policy of devolving decisions on how change is delivered in NHS organisations, it is appropriate for PCTs to decide how to take this forward. The Operating Framework published earlier this month draws attention to the need to take account of the special circumstances of veterans as part of the commissioning process.

1. <i> Finished in-year admissions:</i><br>
A finished in-year admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data year. Finished in-year admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode starts and finishes. Therefore, admission episodes that start and finish in different years are not counted&#151;for most conditions this represents a small proportion of the total. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
2. <i> Cause code:</i><br>
The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. The field within HES counts only the first external cause code, which is coded within the episode.<br>
3. <i> Data quality:</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
4. <i> Ungrossed data:</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
5. <i> External cause codes:</i><br>
(a) Unintended: V01-X59 (accidents), Y40-Y84 (complications of medical and surgical care), Y85-Y86, Y88 (sequelae of unintended causes), Y90-Y98 (supplementary factors). Excluding: X33-X39 (forces of nature) &amp; X52 (prolonged stay in weightless environment).<br>
(b) Deliberate: X60-X84 (intentional self-harm), X85-Y09 (assault), Y87.0-Y87.1 (sequelae of intentional self-harm and assault).<br>
(c) Other: Y10-Y34 (undetermined intent), Y35-Y36 (legal intervention and war), Y87.2 (sequelae of undetermined intent), Y89 (sequelae of other external causes).<br>

 In 2005 the Department launched 'Delivering Race Equality in Mental Health Care' (DRE). DRE is a five year action plan designed to improve black and minority ethnic (BME) communities' experience of mental health services, including that of Asian communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_747"><a name="81217w0034.htm_para5"><a name="081217112000847">There has been significant progress.

New training in race equality for mental health staff has been tested successfully and made available nationally. The pilot project in Newham, East London, of the programme improving access to psychological therapies has demonstrated that Asian and other BME communities can have equal access to, and equal outcomes from, the new services. Primary care trusts have so far recruited over 400 new community development workers, whose role is to build links between local BME communities and mental health services and to help communities play a part in planning and providing those services.</p>

The signals are very low power, typically 0.1 watt (100 milliwatts) in both the computer and the router (access point) and the results so far show exposures are well within internationally accepted (ICNIRP) guidelines. Based on current knowledge and experience, radio frequency (RF) exposures from WiFi are likely to be lower than those from mobile phones.&#148;</p>
