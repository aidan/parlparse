This is because when ownership changes hands, birds will be spread over a wider area in comparison to gatherings where birds are merely exhibited and returned to the premises of origin.

 Following completion of the Environment Agency&#039;s &#163;3.5 million Frankwell flood alleviation scheme, the scope for further flood risk improvement works in Shrewsbury in the immediate future is limited by benefit cost issues and the relative priority of these works against the need for investment in other locations.

In some cases post mortem finding are also available. The following figures give the total number of tests completed and the number of complaints recorded that relate to test results. Instances when customers contact the VLA to discuss a test result or diagnosis but make no complaint are not recorded in a manor that permits analysis. In some of these cases it may be that customers are questioning a result or diagnosis but are content with the explanation given and make no complaint.

 On 20 October 2005, the Paris Club of official creditors agreed with Nigeria to write off approximately $18 billion, or 60 per cent., of Nigeria&#039;s debt to those creditors. Nigeria will use part of its oil windfall to pay the remaining $12.4 billion of debts to creditors. As a result of this deal, at least $1 billion a year will be freed in Nigeria, which the authorities intend to use for poverty reduction including employing an extra 120,000 teachers and putting 3.5 million children into school.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51201w04.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_24">As part of the deal, the UK will cancel approximately &#163;2.8 billion and receive payments of &#163;1.66 billion. As the debts owed to the UK are denominated in a mix of currencies, these numbers may shift with exchange rates. DFID is supporting Nigeria by scaling up its assistance from &#163;70 million in 2005&#150;06 to &#163;100 million in 2007&#150;08 and encouraging the international community to increase its support to the country.

These funding streams already require universities to develop their implementation strategies in light of regional priorities. In addition, the Regional Development Agencies, who lead on the development of science cities, have their own science and innovation funding programmes, from which science cities can be supported. The Government will continue to work with the RDAs to consider how local, regional and national policies can best work together to support science cities.

an explanation of current Government policy. His comments about &quot;nanny staters&quot; were not a statement of policy. They were a personal observation made in response to a debate within the industry about, in particular, the merits of transferring the control of alcohol licensing from the licensing justices to local authorities. Mr Cunningham made the observation that if the industry allowed such an issue to divide them or to dilute their support for licensing reform, then opponents of reform could be expected to exploit that division. In referring generally to opponents of reform, Mr. Cunningham had used the expression &quot;nanny staters&quot; in his speaking notes which were subsequently handed to representatives of the trade press attending and he subsequently apologised for this use of injudicious language. Mr Cunningham did not refer to any Members of Parliament or any other individuals during the course of the conference.

 The UK does not earmark its contributions to multilateral institutions for the purpose of direct budgetary support. However, our general contributions to the European Commission, the World Bank and regional development banks are used, among other things, to finance policy based lending where resources are transferred directly to the developing country&#039;s budget. This quick-disbursing assistance is used to support policy reforms and institutional changes, either at the macro-level or in a sector or sub-sector. It helps countries implement their poverty reduction strategies and promote economic growth.

The UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, chaired the Conference. My right hon. Friend, Hilary Benn was able to confirm the UK&#039;s earlier announcement of a doubling of our support for the Global Fund in 2006 and 2007 to &#163;100 million in each of these two years. The UK&#039;s pledge amounted to 10 per cent. of the US$3.7 billion pledged to the Global Fund for the two-year period by international donors, far exceeding our &#039;fair share&#039;. The amount pledged by 29 donors represents more than half of the Global Fund&#039;s total resource needs for the two-year period.

As a result of the GTT, the UK expects fundamental improvements in how the UN and international donors such as the Global Fund work together to support countries develop and lead effective responses to AIDS. To support this work, the UK doubled our contributions to the UNAIDS for the next two years.

The statement backs efforts to give people around the world better access to condoms and effective information. It advocates a comprehensive and evidenced based approach to HIV prevention including sexual and reproductive health information and services, harm reduction programmes for injecting drug users and reliable access to sexual and reproductive health commodities.

 The humanitarian situation in northern Uganda is extremely serious. 1.4 million people are living in camps for internally displaced people as a result of the conflict involving the Lord&#039;s Resistance Army (LRA). Those displaced are dependent on food aid and other humanitarian assistance. Mortality rates in the camps are high. 63 per cent. of the population in the North live below the poverty line, compared to 38 per cent. in Uganda as a whole. Although the conflict is characterised by low levels of engagement, there is a constant threat of child abduction and people live in fear of their lives.

So far in 2005&#150;06, we have already committed &#163;3 million to the World Food Programme (WFP) and are currently conducting a further assessment of need with the intention of providing additional resources to WFP and other humanitarian agencies in the next few months. As a result of recent LRA attacks, many humanitarian agencies have been forced to curtail their movement outside major towns.
