<a name="10409w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the future status of the Logistic Information Systems Agency.  [157803]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 As part of the restructuring of the Defence Logistics Organisation, the Logistic Information Systems Agency will cease to be a Defence Agency with effect from 1 April 2001. Its functions will then become part of the unified Logistic Applications Integrated Project Team (IPT) within the Defence Communication Services Agency. The removal of Agency status will avoid potential complications in the management arrangements for the new IPT. This is largely an administrative measure and will not, in itself, result in any geographical relocation or redundancies for staff.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will order a public inquiry into the programme of human experiments at the Chemical Defence Establishment at Porton Down.  [157299]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 No. A public inquiry could not answer the central question of whether volunteers had suffered unusual mortality or illness. Only an epidemiological study can do that. Advice from the Medical Research Council has been sought for the feasibility of such a study. Furthermore, Wiltshire Police are conducting an investigation into aspects of this programme. We already make available to the volunteers any information we possess which is relevant to their individual cases. We also plan to conduct further work as outlined in my answers to the hon. Member on 25 January 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 655W, 5 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 20W and on 26 March 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 525W.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if his Department has received a report from the Operation Antler team of the Wiltshire Police regarding its inquiries into allegations that the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment had experimented on NHS patients during the 1960s; and if he will make a statement.  [157306]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Allegations dating from 1970 that the Chemical Defence Establishment conducted experiments during the 1960s on old and sick NHS patients who were subsequently put to death were thoroughly investigated at the time. The then Minister for Defence Equipment and the Prime Minister both refuted these allegations on 30 January and on 19 February 1970 respectively. Following inquiries by the Wiltshire police in January 2001, the Operation Antler inquiry advised 



<P>
<P><I>9 Apr 2001 : Column: 364W</I><P>
my Department's officials that these allegations were in one case fabricated, and in another case did not involve Ministry of Defence staff.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many former service volunteers have visited the Chemical Defence Establishment at Porton Down to inspect records of their experiments and discuss their tests with member of staff since 1 January 1998.  [157300]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 All former service volunteers who inquire about their participation in studies at the Chemical Defence Establishment are invited to visit Porton Down to view the original record books and discuss their experiences with current members of Porton Down staff.
<P>

<a name="10409w01.html_para0">In the period 1 January 1998 to 6 April 2001, 25 former service volunteers have visited to inspect the records of the studies they were involved in.
<P>

<a name="10409w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many times since 1 March 1998 the Chemical Defence Establishment at Porton Down has supplied information about former volunteers to the War Pensions Agency in response to a claim by such. [157329]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Since 1 March 1998, the staff at the Chemical and Biological Defence Sector at Porton Down have supplied information in response to 29 requests from the War Pensions Agency.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer on 22 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 300W, regarding Porton Down, if he will request the Medical Research Council to consult the Operation Antler team of Wiltshire police regarding its advice on an independent epidemiological study for service personnel who took part in experiments at the Chemical Defence Establishment at Porton Down.  [157342]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 No. The Medical Research Council are aware of the Wiltshire police investigation and should they wish to consult the Operation Antler team, they will do so.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many individuals have contacted the Porton Down Volunteers Helpline since February 1998.  [157345]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Since February 1998, the Porton Down helpline has received 626 inquiries in the form of telephone calls and letters.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the number of occasions <i>(a)</i> UK, <i>(b)</i> US, <i>(c)</i> Soviet and <i>(d)</i> other NATO aircrews in jet aircraft used cannon armament, in his assessing the need for a Eurofighter cannon.  [156973]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The historical pattern of operations, together with the improved short-range capability of the missiles with which Eurofighter will be armed, were taken into account in our assessment that the minimal value of a cannon on Eurofighter is more than outweighed by its considerable associated costs and disadvantages.
<P>

<a name="10409w02.html_para7">The last occasion on which the UK used a cannon in air-to-air combat resulted in one successful hit during the Falklands conflict. Figures for other countries are not known, but historical success rates for fighter gun attacks 



<P>
<P><I>9 Apr 2001 : Column: 368W</I><P>
suggest a 5 per cent. combat probability of kill for the Allies late in World War II, and perhaps 10 per cent. in the Korean War. While the probability of success with guns has advanced little over the years, the performance of air-to-air missiles is now far in excess of these statistics. Similarly, the modern precision-guided munitions with which Eurofighter will be armed make firing a cannon in Eurofighter's offensive support role difficult to justify, owing to the risk of collateral damage and the increased vulnerability of the aircraft.

 The State Aids Policy Unit of the Department of Trade and Industry provided advice on 26 cases; Government Office for the North West was notified of the decisions between 22 January and 27 March 2001; 13 projects were cleared to proceed by the State Aids Unit. Of these only 10 projects will proceed through the appraisal process, with a total value of &#163;16,806,303; they are expected to create 100 jobs.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what role concessionaires at motorway service areas have in respect of the siting of "Tiredness Kills" notices.  [156834]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Highways Agency has occasionally provided "Tiredness Can Kill" signs at locations, like the main holiday routes, where motorists are especially likely to drive for long periods without a rest. Motorway service area (MSA) operators were not involved in these decisions.
<P>

<a name="10409w03.html_para0">More recently, MSA operators have approached the Agency about providing these signs at their own expense. The Agency will normally agree unless there are site-specific reasons for refusing. There are no formal rules, but we have sought to ensure that, where provided, these signs are placed no more than a mile or two ahead of an MSA where drivers can stop safely.

 In June I announced amendments we proposed to make to the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) Regulations 1992. One of the proposals is an amendment to section 225 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to allow local authorities to act at their own discretion to remove posters where they consider them to be illegal. This would bring the legislation into line with current practice and protect the rights of property owners

<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 No local access forums can be established under Part V of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 until regulations have been made by the Secretary of State under section 94 of the Act. Some local authorities operate informal consultative groups to discuss issues relating to access and rights of way. No information

is held centrally about which authorities have done so. We welcome initiatives by local authorities to set up such groups ahead of any statutory system, and the Countryside Agency has issued guidance to authorities on how best this might be done.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 No. Testing and approval of components and vehicles prior to sale or registration is carried out by the Vehicle Certification Agency in the UK. However, there is no statutory approval standard for non original replacement body panels and so they are not tested or approved.

<P>
<a name="10409w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Under new provisions which have recently been approved by Parliament, such vehicles will, in future, need to be inspected by officials from the Department's Vehicle Inspectorate before they can legally be returned to the road.
<P>

<a name="10409w03.html_para2">The objective of inspecting such vehicles will be to ensure that they are genuine, rather than having been stolen and disguised with the identity of similar

accident-damaged ones. At present in the region of 40,000 stolen cars annually are sold on in this way to unsuspecting purchasers. The new inspection scheme will help to eliminate this criminal activity.
<P>

<a name="10409w03.html_para3">The new inspection scheme is not intended to check on the adequacy of the accident repair--and this point will be made very clear to vehicle presenters. That would have made the scheme very costly and unnecessarily cumbersome. However, we are naturally very concerned to do all we can to see that only safe vehicles are used on the road and we will therefore be encouraging motorists to have vehicles independently checked by experts if there is any doubt at all about the quality of repair.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 There are no regulations which deal specifically with this subject.
<P>

<a name="10409w03.html_para4">In practice when a vehicle is written off after an accident it might either end up being crushed or broken for spare parts. Alternatively, where the damage is not so severe, it might be repaired and returned to the road.
<P>

<a name="10409w03.html_para5">In all cases where a vehicle is crushed or broken the owner is required by Regulation 13 of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations 1971 to notify the Secretary of State of that fact and at the same time to surrender the registration document to him. This requirement is to be strengthened by a European Directive concerned with the disposal of motor vehicles when they have reached the "end of life".
<P>

<a name="10409w03.html_para6">In future, in all cases where a written-off vehicle is repaired and returned to the road it will firstly need to be inspected by officials from the Department's Vehicle Inspectorate. The objective of inspecting such vehicles will be to ensure that they are genuine, rather than stolen vehicles disguised with the identity of similar accident- damaged ones.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what annual usage of volatile organic compounds require motor vehicle body repair shops to register with their local authority.  [157138]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Environmental Protection (Prescribed Processes and Substances) Regulations 1991, as amended, made under Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 set thresholds for annual usage of organic solvents in coating processes. The regulations include a requirement that the following processes be authorised by the relevant local authority:
<P>

<a name="10409w03.html_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any process for the repainting or respraying of or of parts of road vehicles if the process may result in the release into the air of particulate matter or of any volatile organic compound and the carrying on of the process by the person concerned at the location in question is likely to involve the use of 1 tonne or more of organic solvents in any 12 month period."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10409w03.html_para8">Additionally, under the Solvent Emissions Directive (1999/13/EC) motor vehicle body repair shops that use between 0.5 and 1 tonne per annum of organic solvents will also be required to be regulated to control volatile organic compound emissions. However, for existing processes, the provisions of the Directive will not fully apply until October 2007.

 Road hump is the generic name for any vertical deflection for controlling vehicle speed. The Highways (Road Humps) Regulations 1999 state that a road hump should be between 25 and 100mm in height, with no vertical face higher than 6mm and have a minimum width in the direction of traffic not less than 900mm.
<P>

<a name="10409w04.html_para1">The DETR has issued a range of traffic advisory leaflets to all local authorities in England and Wales giving guidance on the installation of road humps. Within the scope offered by the Regulations, it is for highway authorities to decide the most appropriate design and dimension of road hump for each of their roads.

 A wide range of advice on traffic calming measures is available through the "Traffic Advisory Leaflet" series published by my Department and issued to all local authorities in England and Wales. The Road Safety Strategy, "Tomorrow's Roads--Safer for Everyone", published in March 2000, stated that local authorities are to be encouraged to use the increased powers they have available to them to introduce 20 mph zones and speed limits in residential areas, where appropriate. This should be a priority, particularly in areas where there are large numbers of children, such as in the vicinity of schools.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what research his Department <i>(a)</i> has undertaken and <i>(b)</i> plans to undertake about the action required to achieve a reduction of 60 per cent. in carbon dioxide emissions in the UK; and if he will publish it.  [157428]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The UK Climate Change Programme, published in November 2000, noted that the Government would review the options for longer term energy choices, considering the scale of emission reductions that might be needed in view of current projections for energy use and the scope and cost of low carbon or energy options that may exist to bridge the gap.
<P>

<a name="10409w04.html_para2">The Government have recently published a report commissioned from AEA Technology, "Role of Technology in Emissions Abatement Under the UN-FCCC: the Medium to Long Term", and has placed a copy in the Library of the House. The study says that cuts of 70 per cent. to 90 per cent. in carbon dioxide emissions are technically feasible over the next 50 to 100 years, but supportive policy decisions will be needed to achieve this.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what level of hydrogen sulphide was emitted at Southwark tube station on 8 March 2001; how many London Underground staff were advised to seek medical attention following the discovery of the hydrogen sulphide leak; how many members of the public were advised to seek medical attention following the discovery of the hydrogen sulphide leak; and what public statement was made to inform the public as to the reason for the closure of Southwark Underground station on that date.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 April 2001]:</i> London Underground (LUL) informs me that Southwark station was closed on 8 March 2001 and the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) alerted following a report from contractors that the gas monitoring equipment was showing toxic gases present in a non-public area of the station. The LFEPA discovered sewage which had blocked the drainage system and had as a result caused a build up of hydrogen sulphide, though the level of gas found was very low. The LFEPA cleared the sewage therefore removing the source of the gas.
<P>

<a name="10409w04.html_para5">As a precautionary measure five members of LUL staff were taken to hospital for checks and later released without problems. LUL confirm that the public were not at risk at any time during this incident as the gas was found in a non-public area and upon its discovery they had instituted normal evacuation procedures and the station had been closed immediately. As the incident was quickly resolved without any ongoing problems London Underground felt that it did not merit a public statement to be released following it.

alone. Ministers do not take decisions on the choice of sites. The scientific steering committee selects sites to reflect the geographic range across the UK where the conventional varieties of the FSE crops are already grown. This ensures that a full range of habitats is evaluated.
<P>

<a name="10409w05.html_para0">The design of the Farm Scale Evaluation experiment does not require a pre-experiment assessment of baseline data other than pre-sowing seed sampling, which gives an indication of the potential for weeds to grow in the field. This is because the experiment is designed to compare effects of herbicide use between the two sides of each experimental field. One half is randomly selected and planted with the GM crop, while the other half is planted with the non-GM equivalent crop. This design allows for the effects of the herbicides on wildlife in the two halves of the field to be assessed more accurately than would be possible by comparison with wildlife in the crop before the start of the experiment.
<P>

<a name="10409w05.html_para1">The purpose of the Farm Scale Evaluations is to examine whether there are any differences in the diversity and abundance of farmland wildlife associated with the use of GM herbicide tolerant crops with the herbicides to which they are tolerant, as compared with equivalent non-GM crops. The wildlife found in crop fields is affected by factors such as the vegetation and crop type. Wildlife present in the bare field before sowing or in a previous, different crop the year before, will not be the same as that to be expected in the experimental crop. Measurements of differences in wildlife between a pre-trial audit and within the experimental crop during the experiment would therefore not allow the effects of the herbicide to be measured.

<a name="10409w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Housing Revenue Account (HRA) credit ceiling is an assessment of the amount of an authority's outstanding debt that is attributed to its own housing stock. The 2000-01 mid-year HRA credit ceiling for Southwark borough council as at 30 September was &#163;732,105,357.
<P>

<a name="10409w06.html_para1">The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) does not make estimates centrally of the outstanding necessary capital works to individual local authorities' housing stock. As part of the annual Housing Investment Programme local authorities are asked to provide estimates to the DETR of the amount they need to invest on capital works to their stock. Southwark council estimated that at April 2000, they needed to spend &#163;220 million to bring their own housing stock (of almost 48,000 units) into a satisfactory condition.

<a name="10409w07.html_para2">London Underground informs me that they estimate that the costs of preventive measures and removal of graffiti have been around &#163;10 million per annum.

 This is an operational matter for London Underground. However, since December 1999 a report on signals passed at danger (SPADs) prepared by London Underground has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses each month. This was flagged in a reply to the hon. Member on 11 November 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 687-88W. The report includes a table of SPADs by month since March 1993, prior to which the data were recorded in a different way that does not allow for meaningful comparison. The most recent version of this report covers the period up to January 2001.
<P>

<a name="10409w07.html_para3">The report also highlights that on the Underground, signals and the mechanical stops are (except in a few cases) set back to greater than braking distance from the danger that they protect. So very few SPADs result in actual danger of collision.

 The SRA's Strategic Agenda lists a range of schemes which it would be possible to pursue.

 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) is currently establishing a project development group to take forward the upgrade of the East Coast Main Line and to develop the project to a sufficiently advanced stage for its construction to be competitively tendered. It is not expected that the joint venture approach will alter significantly the overall costs or timing of the upgrade.
<P>

<a name="10409w07.html_para9">In view of the change to the structure of the upgrade, the SRA has asked shortlisted counterparties for a replacement Inter City East Coast franchise to review their original bids. The SRA currently expects to receive any changes to their proposals by 17 April. Once the SRA has received and considered these it will decide whether to proceed with a request to the Secretary of State for a direction to authorise early replacement of the franchise. Any such request will be given appropriate and timely consideration.

 The UK takes seriously its duty to represent the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies internationally. We take equally seriously efforts by the Financial Action Task Force--of which we are a leading member--to combat money laundering. Over the last year, we have therefore sought at all times to ensure that the FATF's information about the Cayman Islands is accurate and complete and that the Cayman Islands are treated on exactly the same basis as all the other jurisdictions examined by the FATF. We have also helped and encouraged the Cayman Islands authorities to make the necessary changes to their system in order to meet international standards in this area. It would be inappropriate to seek special treatment for the Cayman Islands from the FATF, but we will continue to ensure that the Cayman Islands are treated fairly and objectively when decisions are made.

 The Lindisfarne Gospels are a national treasure. They are the property of the British Library under the British Library Act 1972. We appreciate the particular importance of the Gospels to the people of the North-East where they have been exhibited recently. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State recently met a delegation, led by the Bishop of Durham. Following that meeting, my right hon. Friend has written to the Chairman of the British Library inviting them to discuss with the delegation the feasibility of exhibiting the Gospels in the North-East on a more regular basis. No doubt the question of an exhibition of the Gospels on Holy Island could form part of such a discussion.

 A number of hon.

The Government share these concerns. We propose to introduce measures to preserve the rights of beneficiaries of the concessionary scheme who remain in a sheltered housing complex or residential home provided or managed by a local authority, a housing association or a development corporation, when the social mix or the level of warden cover change. We are consulting with the BBC on the formulation of the necessary amendments to the regulations governing the concessionary scheme.

<a name="10409w15.html_para5">Getting copies of employment records has proved difficult because British Coal records are stored on very antiquated microfiche and in paper systems.

In addition to the increase in ESS, the Government are also increasing Standards Fund grant by over &#163;400 million; and following the recent budget announcement schools will also benefit from an increase of &#163;350 million in direct grants. Taken together all these increases represent an 8 per cent. cash increase in revenue support for authorities and their schools next year, a real terms increase of &#163;200 per pupil.

<P>
<a name="10409w24.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The Fresh Meat (Beef Controls) (No 2) Regulations 1996 set out the generally applicable ban on the sale for human consumption of beef from cattle aged over thirty months at slaughter (OTM rule).
<P>

<a name="10409w24.html_para0">As far as United Kingdom slaughterings are concerned, I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that, as recommended in its review of BSE controls, it intends to review in August 2001 the effectiveness of the tightened animal feed controls introduced in August 1996 and the evidence of BSE incidence five years after that time. Depending on the outcome of that review, it is anticipated that it may be possible in early 2002 for the FSA to advise the date of birth of cattle that need not enter the OTM scheme and which could be sold for human consumption. This date of birth could not be earlier than August 1996 when the enhanced feed ban was

implemented. Such a change could not be introduced unilaterally but would require the agreement of the European Commission and other member states.
<P>

<a name="10409w24.html_para1">Beef from cattle aged OTM at slaughter may be imported from any country but it may only be sold for human consumption if it comes from animals that were born, reared and slaughtered in Argentina, Australia, Botswana, Brazil, Mauritius, Namibia, New Zealand, Paraguay, Poland, South Africa, Swaziland, Uruguay, United States of America and Zimbabwe. These are countries that historically supplied the UK and in which there was no history of BSE. The review of BSE controls recognised the need to keep up to date the list of countries that are considered to be BSE free and I am advised by the FSA that it is being reviewed in the light of recent European Union assessments of geographical risk.

<P>
<a name="10409w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Newcastle strategic review (NSR), as a strategy, was approved by Ministers in December 1993. The first support to its capital investment implications commenced in 1995, with the start of an allocation of &#163;8.4 million of "fast track" capital to commence movement of acute services off the Newcastle General Hospital site. Confirmation of the support to larger scale capital investment was provided by the approval of the second wave strategic outline case (SOC) in April 1998, revisions to which were approved in September 1999.
<P>

<a name="10409w25.html_para0">The 1993 NSR strategy document did not include provision for the relocation of the northern centre for cancer treatment (NCCT) from the Newcastle General Hospital site. It became subsequently apparent as acute services were relocated off the Newcastle General Hospital site that the NCCT would become increasingly isolated from access to surgery, medicine, anaesthetics, critical care and other clinical services. Consequently, the subsequent SOC (approved in April 1998) included the reprovision of the NCCT on the Freeman Hospital site.
<P>

<a name="10409w25.html_para1">Public consultation was undertaken during Summer 2000 on the reconfiguration of neuro-disability services for the northern part of the region. In September 2000 Newcastle and North Tyneside health authority supported the option to reprovide the services including those currently provided at Hunters Moor Hospital with new facilities on the Walkergate Hospital site.
<P>

<a name="10409w25.html_para2">The business cases for the main elements of the NSR (which includes reprovision of the NCCT) were received on 14 February 2001. The date for when bids for the work will be sought is dependent on the completion of the refinement of the outline business cases, which is now being undertaken by the trust and health authority.
<P>

<a name="10409w25.html_para3">Although a business case for the development at Walkergate is in preparation, a definitive version has not yet been submitted to the regional office of the National Health Service Executive for approval. Consequently it is not yet possible to say when bids for this scheme will be invited.

 The Private Security Industry Bill, which was introduced in the House last month, sets out proposals to regulate private wheel-clampers.

<a name="10409w25.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Private Security Industry Bill provides for the establishment of a Security Industry Authority which will have responsibility for licensing individuals employed in designated sectors of the security industry, including door supervisors.
<P>

<a name="10409w25.html_para6">The Authority will be responsible for establishing a licensing regime for all door supervisors. This will involve setting national criteria, in consultation with the police, industry and local authorities, which will be used in deciding whether to grant a licence. Initially the criteria will involve a criminal record check, but it is envisaged that over time additional criteria relating to training and similar issues will be imposed. This aim is to ensure that only fit and proper people receive licences to operate as door supervisors. Those who do not meet the published criteria will be refused licences.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 West Mercia constabulary and the Forensic Science Service are working together on a structured approach to the examination of all potential DNA-bearing material relating to this case. This has involved setting up a staged process applying the DNA techniques in a priority order so as to conserve as far as possible samples for future analysis if the current tests are unsuccessful. The examinations have been carefully prioritised and are being undertaken in a sequential manner using the latest DNA techniques such as Second Generation Multiplex Plus and the more sophisticated Low Copy Number.
<P>

<a name="10409w26.html_para0">As I indicated in my answer of 9 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 386W, so far the test results have provided no positive results.

The results of these tests are expected in the week beginning 23 April.

 We do not provide any direct formal or financial assistance to business watch schemes, and there are no central records available as to the number of such schemes.

<a name="10409w26.html_para3">The Home Department is also intending to launch later this month a Business and Retail Crime Toolkit.

<a name="10409w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 It is vital for the effective protection of the public that there should be effective arrangements for information-sharing, between all the agencies involved, about anyone who may pose a serious risk to others because of a personality disorder or other mental disorder. In some parts of England and Wales health authorities do take part in the work of Multi-Agency Risk Panels and Public Protection Panels. In others, concerns about breaking professional codes of practice relating to patient confidentiality have prevented them from doing so. In the White Paper "Reforming the Mental Health Act", published on 20 December last year, we made it clear that new mental health legislation will create a statutory duty covering the disclosure of information between agencies in these circumstances.

 We are determined to reduce the number of robberies.

The additional funds have enabled those forces to introduce a number of new initiatives and to reinforce good practice.
<P>

<a name="10409w26.html_para4">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has also launched a separate initiative with the police and the mobile phone industry to crack down on robbery of mobile phones.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department receives a number of representations on a wide range of asylum issues, including the application of the 1951 Convention criteria for determining asylum claims.
<P>

<a name="10409w26.html_para5">Each application for asylum is considered on its individual merits to determine whether the applicant can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in a particular country for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.

 Areas that are to be used as clusters are researched centrally by the National Asylum Support Service and there is a full consultation process to enable local authorities, usually through the Regional Consortia, to have input into the decision making process. Each area is considered on its own particular merits and factors such as economic conditions are taken into account.

These projects are helping to identify what works best in tackling violence against women, including domestic violence.

 None at present. After only one round of pilots we believe that there is insufficient evidence on which to base an extension of any piloted arrangements. Notices of the local elections for 3 May have now been issued but we look forward to further pilot schemes taking place in the future.

 We are taking decisive action to minimise the impact of alcohol on young people's lives. In the Criminal Justice and Police Bill, we have sought to introduce provisions placing a positive duty on licensees not to sell alcohol to minors and by placing test purchasing of alcohol on a statutory footing for the first time.

 The maximum penalty for the offence of driving a motor vehicle without a valid Ministry of Transport (MoT) certificate under section 47 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 is a fine of up to &#163;2,500 in the case of a vehicle adapted to carry more than eight passengers and &#163;1,000 for any other motor vehicle. The maximum penalty for the related, but more serious offence, of forgery of an MoT certificate, under section 173 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, is two years imprisonment. We are conducting a review of Road Traffic Penalties and have now received responses to our consultation paper published last December. In relation to the fraud offence the consultation paper proposes that the existing anomaly whereby imprisonment is not available where the offence is tried in the magistrates court is removed so that a sentence of imprisonment of up to six months is available for summary disposal of these cases. We made no express proposals in respect of the driving

<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The rules on the classification of Council documents, including Schengen documents, are set out in Council Decision 2000/527/EC of 14 August 2000. The vast majority of Schengen documents are categorised as "limite" and are not therefore classified within the meaning of the Decision. The Council considers it necessary to classify certain documents containing sensitive operational information. However, even classified documents are subject to the provisions of Council Decision 93/731/EC of 20 December 1993 on public access to Council documents. Any request for access to a classified document is considered on its merits. A decision to refuse access to classified documents is ultimately subject to review by the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

<a name="10409w29.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the level of compensation to the parents of Damilola Taylor; and if he will review the guidance relating to levels of compensation.  [157440]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w29.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Under the terms of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, the determination of individual applications is entirely a matter for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority and the complementary Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel. Ministers do not comment on, or intervene in, decisions in individual cases.
<P>

<a name="10409w29.html_para0">Under the terms of the Scheme, each qualifying relative of a murder victim receives a fixed fatal award (at level 10 of the tariff, or at level 13 if there is only one eligible claimant). Reasonable funeral expenses are also met, and additional (and sometimes very substantial) compensation is paid where there is financial dependency on the victim, or to replace the services of a murdered parent.
<P>

<a name="10409w29.html_para1">Contrary to the impression conveyed by some recent press coverage of this tragic case, the fixed fatal award does not put a 'value' on the life of a victim. No sum of money could reasonably do that. The fatal award is in the nature of a gesture of condolence on behalf of society. And the award is in fact more generous than the amount payable under the fatal accidents legislation.
<P>

<a name="10409w29.html_para2">We have just completed a thorough review of the Scheme based on the findings from a public consultation exercise that was launched in 1999. On 1 April 2001, having secured the necessary parliamentary approval in March, we brought in a wide-ranging package of improvements, worth &#163;20 million in a full year, to what is already probably by far the most generous scheme in the world.




<P>
<P><I>9 Apr 2001 : Column: 470W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10409w29.html_para3">Responses to the consultation exercise were evenly split on whether there should be any increase to the fixed fatal award. On balance, we decided not to recommend changes to the tariff level at which the fatal award is fixed, although the actual amount payable went up by 10 per cent. from 1 April as a result of a general up-rating of most of the tariff bands.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w29.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 I understand that at the end of February 2001, the latest date for which figures are available, 1,100 cases were awaiting a decision by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

<a name="10409w29.html_wqn2"><B> Ms Moran: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action he has taken as a result of the recent report on forced marriages.  [157548]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 'A Choice by Right', the report of the working group on forced marriage, was published in June last year. It made a number of recommendations for tackling the problem of forced marriage.
<P>

<a name="10409w29.html_para4">Since then we have made progress on a number of fronts. Together with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office we have developed and published a Joint Action Plan to address the overseas dimension of forced marriage. This includes gaining a better understanding of the problem, forging links with agencies overseas and looking at our own procedures for handling these cases.




<P>
<P><I>9 Apr 2001 : Column: 471W</I><P>

<P>

 Police resources are allocated between all 43 forces in England and Wales according to a formula that allocates central Government supported funding to provide a standard level of service. The formula is weighted according to population, so that forces with larger populations receive more money. The socio-demographic nature of the population is also taken into account.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will set out, with statistical information relating as directly as possible to the Amber Valley constituency, the effects on Amber Valley of his Department's policies and actions since 2 May 1997.  [157134]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w31.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Department's policies and initiatives have made a significant contribution to the Government's overall objectives of: eradicating child poverty in 20 years, and halving it within 10; promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age while protecting the position of those in greatest need; and, combating poverty and promoting security and independence in retirement for today's and tomorrow's pensioners.
<P>

<a name="10409w31.html_para0">These goals are being pursued nationwide and our achievements are set out in our annual "Opportunity for all" reports. Our second report, "Opportunity for all--One year on: making a difference" (CM4865, September 2000) sets out what progress has been made in the past year, as well as highlighting what more needs to be done. Nationwide statistical information is necessarily more complete than data at a local authority level, but the following provides a comparative guide to the effect of the Department's policies and actions in Amber Valley since May 1997.
<P>

<a name="10409w31.html_para1">Measures in our five Budgets so far will lift over 1.2 million children nationally out of poverty. These include record increases to Child Benefit, the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit, increases in the income-related benefits, the minimum wage and tax changes.
<P>

<a name="10409w31.html_para2">Child Benefit will be worth &#163;15.50 a week for the eldest child and &#163;10.35 a week for other children from April 2001: nationally about 7 million families receive Child Benefit, and in Amber Valley 11,193 families benefit.
<P>

<a name="10409w31.html_para3">We now have the lowest unemployment rate in 25 years. The New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the over-50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. In the period since May 1997 the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance nationally has reduced from 1,562,400 to 960,600; in Amber Valley the number has reduced from 1,900 to 1,600. Since May 1997 the number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased from 1,013,500 to 894,100 nationally; in Amber Valley the number has increased from 900 to 1,000.

This winter, the payment is &#163;200 for households who qualify. Around 18,600 older people in Amber Valley have received a Winter Fuel Payment for this winter (2000-01).
<P>

<a name="10409w31.html_para5">To demonstrate our commitment to combating pensioner poverty, this year we will spend &#163;4.5 billion extra in real terms on pensioners. Some 17,100 pensioners in Amber Valley will benefit from the substantial increases in the basic state pension this April and next; this year's increase is &#163;5 a week for single pensioners and &#163;8 for couples. In addition we have introduced free TV licences for the over-75s of whom we estimate there are about 7,600 in Amber Valley. 2,500 pensioner families in Amber Valley are receiving the Minimum Income Guarantee, which we introduced in April 1999 to help our poorest pensioners. From April they will be at least &#163;15 a week, or &#163;800 a year, better off in real terms as a result of Government measures since 1997.
<P>

<a name="10409w31.html_para6">Other reforms in the pipeline include: the new Pension Credit in 2003 designed to ensure that pensioners benefit from their savings; the launch of Stakeholder Pensions in April this year; and the introduction of the State Second Pension in April 2002 both of which will help provide greater security for tomorrow's pensioners.

<P>
<a name="10409w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 March 2001]:</i> The annual expenditure on training and development for the Department in Scotland for 1999-2000 was &#163;6,719,482; for 2000-01 was &#163;5,676,701; planned expenditure for 2001-02 will be known mid-April 2001. This expenditure supports the Department's work not only in Scotland but also elsewhere in the UK. Similarly, training undertaken elsewhere in the UK benefits the Department's work in Scotland.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment he has made of the effect of the repeal of Regulation 100 under the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 on the ability of local authorities to seek recovery of overpayment of Housing Benefit.  [156339]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w32.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Regulation 100 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations was revoked to simplify the procedure for local authorities to recover Housing Benefit overpayments. The regulation duplicated the primary power set out in section 75(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and had caused some administrative confusion.
<P>

<a name="10409w32.html_para3">The revocation did not alter the powers of local authorities to seek recovery of a Housing Benefit overpayment once it had been decided that the overpayment was recoverable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10409w32.html_spnew7"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Rent Officers do not decide the amount of Housing Benefit payable to a person. The amount of Housing Benefit to be paid is determined by the relevant local authority after they have considered the claim under the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations. If a person disagrees with their award they may appeal against this decision.
<P>

<a name="10409w32.html_para4">Where the Housing Benefit award against which an appeal is made is based on the level of rent set by a Rent Officer, or if the local authority believes the Rent Officer's decision may be erroneous, the local authority has the power to arrange for the Rent Service to revisit the decision. This action is carried out by a Rent Officer other than the one who made the original decision, and normally one from a different rent registration area.

<P>
<a name="10409w32.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 I am aware of my hon. Friend's representations on behalf of Brighton and Hove to the effect that the current rules were too restrictive and that they should be eased. We gave full consideration to these representations as we did to others. The new rules from July this year are therefore designed to reflect better what the market generally has to offer on a national basis. Moreover, local authorities will have the discretion to provide additional support in individual cases under the new arrangements for Discretionary Housing Payments, which will also apply from July. We are considering how best to monitor their operation.
<P>

<a name="10409w32.html_para5">Our objectives for the single room rent are to ensure that young people have access to accommodation so that they can concentrate on finding work, balanced against our aim of making sure that the benefit system does not provide out of work young adults with better housing than their working peers could afford. We made these objectives clear, including the option of broadening the definition of the single room rent, in our Housing Green Paper "Quality and Choice: A decent home for all" on which we consulted widely.

 In March, some 102,000 pensioners were written to with information on the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) and invited to make a claim. These consisted of pensioners who were part of the original take-up campaign but were not entitled due to excess income or capital and those pensioners who had been excluded from the original mailings because they held capital over &#163;8,000. Some 140,000 pensioners will newly benefit as a result of this month's increase to the MIG rates and capital limits.

1. The information in the table is on schemes that are required to pay the Pension Schemes Registry levy.<P>

2. Information on frozen and closed schemes was only required to be reported from 1997. "Frozen schemes" are schemes which admit no new members and do not permit existing members to make new contributions. "Closed schemes" are schemes that admit no new members but allow existing members to continue to contribute.<P>

3. In addition there are 83 schemes that are no longer required to pay the Registry levy. These include schemes that have merged or wound up.<P>
