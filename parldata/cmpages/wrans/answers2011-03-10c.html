 The Government have no plans to transfer the provision of any specific type of health care to any particular type of provider, including the charity sector. Under the reforms set out in the Command Paper and Health and Social Care Bill, patients would be able to receive the best care from the best possible providers, regardless of who owns or runs them, with different types of provider competing on their merits. There is no goal to transfer national health service-funded care to any particular provider sector.</p>

 The Department invested £100,000 in 2009-10 in the development of a national best practice tariff to support improvements in the quality and outcome of care for people with fragility hip fractures. The best practice tariff started in April 2010. It is awarded where surgery is undertaken within 36 hours of admission, where specialist geriatric assessment takes place within 72 hours and where the patient follows an agreed care pathway. Data relating to adherence to the best practice criteria are collected by the National Hip Fracture Database and are scheduled for publication in July 2011.</p>

 On 21 December 2010, we published the consultation document “Healthy Lives, Healthy People: consultation on the funding and commissioning routes for public health”, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library. The consultation period ends on 31 March. For sexual health, we propose that local authorities will be responsible for commissioning comprehensive open-access sexual health services using funds from the ring-fenced public health budget.</p>

However, some public health services for which local authorities will take responsibility will need to be commissioned in a universal way in all areas. The consultation asks which services should be mandatory for local authorities to provide or commission.</p>

 Four EU member states have placed some additional restrictions—not bans—on the use of neonicotinoid insecticides. The UK pesticides regulator keeps up to date with developments on this issue through contacts with its counterparts in other member states and participation in EU fora.</p>

               <a name="11031069000782"> A scientific report submitted to the European Food Safety Authority in December 2009, entitled: “Bee Mortality and Bee Surveillance in Europe”, showed that although there have been some high colony losses in Europe, there is a lack of comparative data and the contributory factors are not fully understood. In addition, the effectiveness of the surveillance systems employed by member states varies considerably, which causes difficulties in assessing trends and forecasts. The European Commission has recently announced, as part of a series of initiatives on bee health, that a pilot surveillance programme will be started-by the end of 2011. The programme is aimed at providing a better understanding of the situation in the EU.</p>

This project aims to increase consumption of sustainable, underutilised fish species that are often discarded. Coley is a quota species with very good quota uptake and so it may not be a good candidate for us to encourage increased consumer uptake, as a small increase could mean we overfish the stock.</p>

 The Government have established an industry-led Task Force on Farming Regulation to identify ways of reducing regulatory burdens on the farming and food processing industry, and achieving a risk-based system of regulation. The regulatory burden on abattoirs is one of the areas being considered. We look forward to considering the task force’s recommendations, once it has completed its work later in the spring.</p>

               <b>Mr Gibb:</b>
 Our calculations were based on the amounts of local authority central services equivalent grant (LACSEG), which we currently pay to academies that have converted from a maintained school. There are two elements to the grant: the proportion which the Department can recoup from the dedicated schools grant that would otherwise go to local authorities, and the proportion that the Department cannot recoup because it is in respect of services normally paid from other local authority funds. For the latter, on the basis of local authorities' financial statements provided to the Department under section 251 of the Apprenticeships, Schools, Children and Learning Act 2009, we estimated an average amount per pupil across all local authorities, and applied that to our estimates of the number of new academies opening over the next two years, using average school sizes. The resultant amounts were then reduced to reflect annual reductions in local authorities' formula grant. The final amounts deducted from local authorities' formula grant were £148 million in 2011-12 and £265 million in 2012-13.</p>

 The Early Intervention Grant (EIG) is a new funding stream created for local authorities to invest in early intervention for the most vulnerable children, young people and families bringing together funding for a number of early intervention and preventative services. EIG will replace a number of existing funding streams which will come to an end in 2011. Details were announced by the Secretary of State for Education on 13 December 2010.</p>

It will be for local authorities to determine how they use that resource to best effect, including what services would be funded for families with disabled children, early support and key working. The grant will help local authorities to support vulnerable young people to engage in education and training, intervening early with those who are at risk of disengagement and to support those young people who have a learning difficulty, disability or mental health problem.</p>

 The Department provides a range of guidance documents that have a bearing on the work of educational psychologists, the main one being the special educational needs (SEN) code of practice. This provides statutory guidance to local authorities and others to whom the code applies and includes advice on the role of educational psychologists, particularly in relation to statutory assessments of children's SEN. The statutory guidance on promoting the educational achievement of looked-after children (March 2010) and promoting the health and well being of looked-after children (November 2009) are also pertinent to the work of educational psychologists. It is, of course, up to local authorities to deploy educational psychologists as they see fit.</p>

 The Government signalled in their response to last year's Children and Young People's Committee's report, ‘Transforming Education Outside the Classroom’, that schools should be given greater freedoms to organise themselves to support field trips and other educational visits. Our reforms will ensure that schools have the freedom and flexibilities to organise staff and resources in a way that reflects local priorities and needs. As part of delivering this commitment we are planning to ask the School Teachers Review Body (STRB) to consider a wide range of issues, including how to address some of the rigidity in the existing pay and conditions arrangements for teachers.</p>

In July 2010, we announced that every local authority will be expected to introduce the Early Years Single Funding Formula (EYSFF) from April 2011 following successful implementation in more than 70 pathfinder areas this year. The EYSFF is designed to increase transparency and fairness in the way funding is allocated to providers offering free nursery education for three and four-year-olds, by establishing locally driven criteria which are applied on an equitable basis across all providers; including maintained nursery schools, primary schools, private, voluntary and independent providers. The Department encourages providers to engage in a constructive dialogue with local authorities about the level of funding, and the transparency of the EYSFF supports this.</p>

The provisions in clause 47 of the Education Bill amend existing legislation governing what costs nursery schools (and schools with nursery classes) can include in determining the charges for additional early education, principally to enable schools to include the costs of permanent teaching staff who provide the early education provision. As such, we do not anticipate that the provisions in the Education Bill will have an impact on levels of child poverty, nor a discriminatory impact. However, by enabling schools to expand their provision, we are giving parents greater choice, in their early education and childcare arrangements, supporting them to work or return to work.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 10 February 2011]:</i> The pupil premium for 2011-12 will be allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils that are known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) as recorded on the January 2011 School Censuses. Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract £430 of funding which will go to the school or academy via the local authority or YPLA if the pupil is in a mainstream setting or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting. We aim to extend the coverage of the pupil premium from 2012-13 onwards to pupils who have previously been known to be eligible for free school meals.</p>

 The following table shows the amount of Exceptional Circumstances Grant (ECG) allocated to local authorities in each of the last three years, in relation to increases in the proportion of pupils with English as an Additional Language (EAL). The allocations are based on: (i) an increase in the proportion of pupils of compulsory school age with EAL, as recorded in the autumn school census, of any year between 2008 and 2011, of more than 2.5 percentage points over and above the level recorded in the January 2008 school census; (ii) where the January 2008 proportion of pupils of compulsory school age with EAL is below 10%, but increases by more than 2.5 percentage points during the 2008-2011 spending review period. Where a local authority qualifies under (i) it receives £1,600 for each pupil above the threshold. Where an authority qualifies under (ii) it receives a £200,000 lump sum.

 Following a competitive tendering exercise, a seven-year contract for the administration of the Teachers' Pension Scheme was let in 1996. The contract value was £70 million. The administrative service was re-tendered at the end of the first contract period and a new seven-year contract was let in October 2003. The total expenditure on the administration of the scheme between the financial years 2003-04 and 2009-10 was £65 million, as noted below. The expenditure in 2010-11 is anticipated to be £9.8 million.</p>

In the spending review we announced investment of over £6.5 billion in housing. This includes over £2 billion to make existing social homes decent and almost £4.5 billion investment in new affordable housing to deliver up to 150,000 affordable homes. We are giving housing associations much more flexibility on rents and use of assets, so our aspiration is to deliver as many homes as possible through our investment and reforms.

We expect that the availability of fee remission for those on JSA or ESA (WRAG) will make them an attractive client group for colleges and training organisations.

 As part of the spending review tough decisions about departmental budgets have been taken and, like all other areas, further education has made its contribution. This has included reviewing the extent to which automatic fee remission for adult skills is provided, and in this context we have prioritised English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) funding to unemployed people in receipt of jobseeker’s allowance or in the employment and support allowance (work-related activity) group, where English language skills have been identified as a barrier to entering employment. We will continue to pay 50% of ESOL course fees for people who are settled here. Increased freedoms and flexibilities for providers will allow them to respond to the needs of their communities and determine within their funding where this is prioritised.</p>

               <b>Chris Grayling:</b>
 We have begun reassessing the benefit entitlement of all old-style incapacity benefits claimants. Those people who are assessed as capable of work will be moved on to jobseekers allowance where eligible. People who are assessed as having limited capability for work will be moved to employment and support allowance. We are reassessing everyone claiming old-style incapacity benefits, regardless of the date of their last incapacity benefit assessment.</p>

               <a name="11031072000177"> We do not believe that it would be right to exclude claimants from the reassessment process as a result of a particular health condition or disability. Many people with health conditions are able to sustain and progress in employment if they are supported to do so. Those people being exempted from the reassessment are those incapacity benefits claimants who will reach retirement age during the reassessment process, as they will shortly be claiming benefits for pensioners.</p>

               <a name="11031072000178"> Those claimants being reassessed need to undergo a work capability assessment (WCA) to allow us to understand their ability to engage in work or work-related activities. The work capability assessment is based on the premise that eligibility for employment and support allowance should not be based on a person's health condition or disability, but rather on the way their health condition or disability limits their functional capability. Therefore, claimants are not automatically exempted from the work capability assessment because they have a particular health condition or disability.</p>

               <a name="11031072000179"> A face-to-face assessment by a trained health care professional is a standard part of the work capability assessment process. However, we recognise that asking claimants to attend an unnecessary face-to-face assessment is in no one's interests. People who unfortunately have a terminal illness do not need to undergo a face-to-face assessment as part of the reassessment of their incapacity benefit. These claimants will automatically be treated as having limited capability for work-related activity, and so will be placed in the support group of employment and support allowance, where they will not be expected to undertake work related activity. Some other claimants may also be exempted from a face-to-face assessment if we are able to make an assessment based purely on the evidence provided.</p>

 From 2013 we will replace disability living allowance for people of working age with personal independence payment, a new, more transparent and sustainable benefit with an objective assessment of individual need. Support through personal independence payment will be focussed on those with the most need. The detailed criteria that will be used in the new assessment to determine eligibility are currently being developed and are being informed by the consultation which recently closed. I am, therefore, unable at this time to comment on how the new assessment will work or make estimates of its impact on people with specific health conditions or impairments. However, we are committed to ensuring that it reflects the needs of all individuals effectively. We recognise that the current assessment criteria for disability living allowance can favour physical impairments and does not always fully reflect the needs of disabled people with mental, intellectual, cognitive and development impairments, including autistic spectrum disorders.</p>

The order in which new claims and existing caseloads will be transitioned will be informed by considering all the evidence and a full option appraisal.</p>

 The Ministry of Justice collects statistical information on the length of time from death to the completion of inquest in aggregate form by asking coroners to report the number of inquests completed within specified time bands. The estimated average length of time between death and completion of inquest for inquests completed during 2009 for each coroner’s district in England and Wales is set out in the table.

                     <i>Notes on how timeliness of inquests is estimated:</i>
l. For the purpose of determining the timeliness of inquests, the time taken to conduct an inquest is deemed to be from the day the death was reported to the coroner until either (a) the day the inquest is concluded by the delivery of a verdict or (b) the day the coroner certifies that an adjourned inquest will not be resumed.
2. The average time for an inquest to be conducted is estimated in the following way: Coroners are asked in their annual return to state how many inquests were concluded within certain time periods. There are five time bands, which are: within one month; 1-3 months; 3-6 months; 6-12 months; and over 12 months. All the inquests falling within a time-band are then assumed to have been completed at or near the mid-point of the various time-bands for the purposes of calculating the average, although inquests within the “under one month” band are assumed to have taken 3 weeks for this purpose of this estimation, and those inquests taking over a year to conclude were deemed to have taken 18 months, although the time-band itself is open-ended. Numbers are then aggregated and the average figure (in weeks) calculated in the normal way.
3. Only deaths occurring within England and Wales are included in the calculation. Statistics are not collected on the time taken for inquests where the death occurred outside England and Wales.

The Ministry and the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) will consider what additional evaluation of the Act, and further consideration of how the needs of vulnerable people are being met, would be useful and will take forward future research as appropriate.</p>

These include the need for registration with the OPG before an LPA can be used and the requirement for an independent person, known as a Certificate Provider, to certify that the customer understands the implications of making the LPA. The customer is also able to choose who should be notified when an application to register is made and these people can object to registration if they have any concerns.</p>

 There are no plans to nominate anyone to operate as prison officers during industrial action. As a result, no such training is required.

Familiarisation training for military staff has been developed which includes an understanding of the prison environment and control and restraint procedures.</p>

 In all cases the courts determine which sentence or sentences to impose and how those sentences should be served. The general principle they follow is that offences arising from the same incident will usually lead to concurrent sentences. On the same general principle, offences committed on separate occasions against different victims usually result in consecutive sentences.</p>

 It was estimated in the “Breaking the cycle: effective punishment, rehabilitation and sentencing of offenders” Green Paper that the effect of increasing the maximum discount available for an early guilty plea will be a reduction of 3,400 prison places in 2014-15, relative to the expected growth of the prison population. No separate estimate has been made of the effect of restricting the maximum discount to admissions at the police station, though it would undoubtedly be less. The Green Paper consultation period has recently closed and we will continue to assess the likely impact of the full range of sentencing policy proposals on the prison population.</p>

 Restricting the guilty plea discount to suspects who co-operate in interview with the police and then plead guilty in court would risk reducing the incidence of guilty pleas at the first court hearing, as there would be no incentive for a defendant who had failed to make admissions in interview to plead guilty thereafter. This would not be in the interests of the efficiency of the criminal justice system or of victims and witnesses. However, we are considering how to incentivise an early guilty plea over a guilty plea later in the justice process.</p>

However, some of the HM Treasury data need to be modified prior to incorporation, for reasons such as to bring the figures onto an accruals basis and to present them on a calendar year, rather than a financial year basis. Additionally, some of the HM Treasury data feed into the UK's capital account, rather than the current account, for example, receipts from the Agricultural Fund for Regional Development and European Regional Development Fund. These are shown in the Pink Book 2010, table 6.1, p. 85. Total official transactions between the UK and institutions of the EU (including current and capital account transactions) are published in the Pink Book 2010, table 9.9, p.161.</p>

                     <sup>(1 )</sup>GB.  <sup>(2 )</sup>UK.  <i>Notes:</i> 1. These statistics are based on households below average income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.  2. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.  3. The reference period for households below average income figures are single financial years.  4. Disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax, payments, national insurance contributions, council tax / domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes.  5. Figures are for the United Kingdom from 2002-03 onwards. Earlier years are for Great Britain only.  6. Figures have been presented on a before housing cost and an after housing cost basis. For before housing costs, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, buildings insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for after housing costs they are.  7. These statistics are publicly available in the Households Below Average Income Report, Table 2.2ts page 25-26, on the DWP website: http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/hbai/hbai_2009/index.php?page=contents

 DECC holds funding information only for those schemes that transferred to the Department on its formation in 2008 or were later set up by DECC. The following table gives the expenditure under the renewables obligation for dedicated electricity generation and the electricity output of combined heat and power (CHP) plants. For the grant schemes, funding was given to CHP plants as a whole, rather than to the separate electricity and heat outputs.</p>

 Our analysis suggests that biomass heat and electricity could provide about 4.5% of overall energy demand by 2020. This would not all be met by burning wood—other biomass feedstocks include a broad range of wastes (eg food and municipal waste, landfill and sewage gas), residues such as straw, perennial energy crops such as miscanthus, and second generation technologies that do not require combustion. We do not have specific expectations for each particular biomass feedstock type but expect that burning wood from imported and domestic sources, preferably waste wood, will make a significant contribution to biomass heat and electricity generation in the UK by 2020.</p>

We intend to do the same next year for heat generation under the renewable heat incentive.</p>
