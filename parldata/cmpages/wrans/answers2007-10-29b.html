The contract for the supply of fresh fish and shellfish is scheduled to be re-tendered early in the new year and assessment of the sustainable seafood sourcing and supply policies of bidders will be included among the evaluation criteria.

 Every one of the 64 Specialist Domestic Violence Courts provides support to victims via an Independent Domestic Violence Advisor service (comprising at least on IDVA). As there is a wide range of work patterns across the 64 areas, we do not have precise employment numbers; we prefer to focus on ensuring delivery of a service that holistically supports individuals who are victims of domestic violence. By autumn of this year, there were 130 Government-funded graduates or students on the accredited training for Independent Domestic Violence Advisers, with a further 75 Government-funded places in the spring 2008.</p>

Part of this review will include a quantitative data analysis of all Specialist Domestic Violence Courts. The review will examine what success looks like for Specialist Domestic Violence Courts in terms of criminal justice and safety measures. Based on the findings of the review, local areas will be advised on how they can measure performance, but we do not plan to have any national performance indicators.</p>

Early data from those areas which have been trained in Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference is promising with significant reductions in repeat victimisation, not least due to the work of Independent Domestic Violence Advisors who often carry out over 80 per cent. of the actions agreed at the conference.</p>

 Closing the pay gap between men and women is a key priority for us, as I made clear in my statement to Parliament on priorities for the Ministers for Women. We see tackling the pay gap as an essential part of enabling families to have real choices about how they live their lives because the pay gap plays such a large part in the unequal division of labour in the home, preventing fathers from playing a more active role in their children's early years and preventing women from fulfilling their opportunities to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="71029w0004.htm_para1"><a name="07102925000368">To galvanise this, closing the pay gap is now one of the indicators in the new equalities public service agreement. This will help to build on other practical measures we have introduced, such as: giving the parents of young, or disabled, children and the carers of adults the right to request flexible working; since 1997, doubling the number of registered childcare places to 1.28 million; and guaranteeing all three and four-year-olds a free, 121/2 hours a week 38 weeks a year Government funded, early education place.</p>

 The National Audit Office measures spending performance against plans by comparing outturns against final provision following Supplementary Estimates&#151;rather than against plans at the start of the year&#151;as plans can change during the year for a number of reasons, such as machinery of government and classification changes. The definitive figures for final provision and provisional outturn are published each year in the Public Expenditure Outturns White Paper. Changes to plans arising in-year are published in Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses, as are differences between provisional and final outturns.</p>

The unspent funds were drawn down in subsequent years and the project was successfully completed in 2004-05.</p>

 Public service agreements (PSAs) apply only to Government Departments. The Department published its first set of PSAs in December 1998 and agreed a measurement methodology in March 1999. Since then we have agreed new PSAs with HM Treasury as part of each subsequent spending review (SR). We publicly report progress against these targets in our departmental annual report (DAR) and autumn performance report (APR) each year, copies of which can be found in the House Library.

 Both of these reports found no conclusive evidence of a link between playing violent games and behaving violently in real life. Both reports confirmed therefore that the current regulatory regime is satisfactory.

These measures included bigger classification symbols; advice explaining the type of content; strengthened guidance for retail staff; all games for adults to be classified by the British Board of Film Classification even if there is no statutory requirement to do so; and a website publicised by five million leaflets where parents can learn about the content of games and their classification.</p>

A commitment to carry out this review was included in CLG&#146;s recent Housing Green Paper. Terms of reference for the review are being finalised.</p>

We have recently made reforms to the planning policy framework and building regulations which has put good design at the heart of decision making and the future housing growth agenda. We will continue to monitor progress to see if any further changes are needed in the future.</p>

 Pursuant to my answer to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath of 26 March 2007, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1321W, to date, public expenditure related to the Millennium Communities programme, excluding the Greenwich Peninsula site amounts to a total of &#163;86,561,250.</p>

The Millennium Communities programme as a whole is bringing forward seven new schools and colleges, five new health centres, 10 new public parks and play areas, and eight new community buildings. In addition, over 70,000 sq m of commercial and retail accommodation will be created. As an example, at the New Islington Millennium Community in Manchester the public investment is creating a new canal network, roads and infrastructure, a new primary school, a state of the art health centre, car club, child care facilities, an energy centre and 6,000 sq m of employment floorspace in addition to the 1,400 new homes.</p>

 In April 2006 four social landlords began piloting Social Homebuy on a voluntary basis. The pilot scheme, which will run until March 2008, allows participating local authorities and housing associations to offer tenants living in social rented accommodation the opportunity to purchase discounted shares of their home starting with an initial share of 25 per cent.</p>

Since April this year a second phase of landlords have joined the pilot scheme and are now offering Social Homebuy to their tenants. As with normal home purchases it can take several months to reach completion.</p>

 The Government set up the Affordable Rural Housing Commission to look into ways to improve the affordability of rural housing. Since its report in May 2006 we have taken a series of measures to help address rural problems, including changes to planning rules and a commitment to set a rural target for affordable housing over the next three years in light of the advice from regional housing boards which is done later in the year.</p>

Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor) to conduct a review on how land use and planning can better support rural business and deliver more affordable housing. The review should be completed around July 2008.</p>

 It is vital that non-statutory organisations such as voluntary and community sector groups and businesses are fully involved in partnership working to agree and deliver local area agreements. Indeed in most areas they are already involved in collaborative working through the Local Strategic Partnership (LSP) for the area. The 2006 LSP survey showed that over 80 per cent. of LSPs have voluntary sector umbrella organisations among their membership and nearly two thirds involve businesses. We want LSPs to develop this further because these sectors have a valuable contribution to make to discussions and can help to deliver in ways in which mainstream public sector providers can find difficult.</p>

 The consultation draft of the Planning Policy Statement (PPS): Planning and Climate Change was supported by a partial regulatory impact assessment (PRIA). The potential additional benefits of the PPS identified in the PRIA included expanded markets and demand for renewable and low-carbon technologies. While not quantifying the estimated monetary value associated with this, the PRIA states that by helping to stimulate markets for renewable, low-carbon and decentralised energy, the PPS would benefit the many small businesses active in this sector.</p>

 Regional Planning Guidance for London and the rest of the South East (RPG9) in 2000 identified the potential for significant growth in the Thames Gateway, Milton Keynes-South Midlands, Ashford and London-Stansted-Cambridge areas. Following studies into the potential for growth in these areas, the Government confirmed on 18 July 2002 that it would work with regional and local partners in each of these four growth areas to establish where, at what scale, and how quickly growth could be achieved. The Sustainable Communities Plan, &#145;Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future&#146;, published on 5 February 2003, announced confirmation of Thames Gateway and the three other growth areas together with funding support and said that working with regional planning bodies and local authorities Government would take forward growth plans for those areas through revisions of regional planning guidance, in the regional planning process.</p>

 Estimates of the type sought will vary substantially according to the assumptions made on matters such as the range of developments to which local policies arc applied, the expected number of developments to be completed, their energy demands, the extent to which the provision of installed equipment complies with the original planning permission and whether the technologies installed in practice provide the predicted savings. However the Government have set out a timetable for all new homes to be zero carbon by 2016. This will require significant increases in the use of renewables and we have assessed that overall implementation of this policy will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by at least 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2050.</p>

 The London borough of Merton adopted their Unitary Development Plan in 2003 with a policy that expects new non residential developments above a threshold of l,000 sq m to incorporate renewable energy production equipment to provide at least 10 per cent. of predicted energy requirements. In doing so they were the first local authority in the UK to include a policy of this kind in a UDP. The council has been heavily involved in promoting the approach leading it to be coined the Merton Rule.</p>

BERR does not collect information on regional petrol prices. A range of factors determine retail petrol and diesel prices. Price differentials between rural and urban areas reflect different costs in distributing and supplying petrol and diesel. Price setting is a commercial matter for individual companies.

Customers should refer any complaints concerning pricing and anti-competitive behaviour to the Office of Fair Trading.

 As stated in the Government&#146;s response to the public consultation on the post office network, closures will principally affect a combination of branches in areas of over-provision and those that are least used. Post Office Ltd. will be tasked with taking a strategic overview of service provision to ensure that in areas of over-provision, people should be able to find an alternative branch nearby and the vast majority will still be within walking distance of their nearest office. With the least used, the number of people affected will, by the nature of the offices, be low. The introduction of new access criteria will minimise the impact by ensuring that the network remains readily accessible across the UK&#151;with far greater coverage than any other retailer, financial service provider or public service provider.</p>

To improve access to basic education we are currently providing &#163;3.3 million through UNICEF and &#163;2.7 million through Save the Children, each over three years. We are providing &#163;4 million over four years through the United Nations Development Programme to improve food security and enable people in rural areas to increase their family incomes, and we are funding community development programmes through non-governmental organisations. We are also providing &#163;1.8 million over three years to help meet the needs of Burmese refugees on the Thai border. Part of the additional &#163;1 million agreed for urgent humanitarian needs in October will be used to improve access to food by poor and vulnerable people in Burma.</p>

New scheme uncleared cases over 5 years old are those which were previously under the old scheme, and have been converted to the new scheme via a new scheme calculation. When a new child support application is made, it may be established that the case has one or more links, through the parent with care or non-resident parent or their partners, to existing cases. If a link is established to one or more cases on the old computer system (CSCS), these cases will be transferred to the new computer system (CS2), along with any further cases that are linked to this chain.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the campaign his Department is running to promote the take up of council tax benefit by pensioners; and what assessment he has made of the impact of this campaign so far. [158054]</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 October 2007]:</i> The three page claim form that has been introduced means less bureaucracy and better service for pension credit customers. One phone call can give customers access to four benefits&#151;pension credit, state retirement pension, council tax benefit (CTB) and housing benefit (HB). This form is completed for the customer. All they need to do is check it, sign it and send it back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="71029w0033.htm_para3"><a name="07103022000363">We are taking other measures to promote the take up of CTB. There are annual awareness campaigns. We have provided local authorities with best practice guidance that contains information about barriers to claiming, ways of overcoming them, and case study examples of good practice to improve take-up. We have supported the three page form arrangements with computer scans run by The Pension Service to discover people getting pension credit but not CTB and this information is passed to local authorities. We encourage local authorities to do take-up activity through our performance standards and have awarded &#163;2.2 million to 38 authorities to increase CTB take-up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="71029w0033.htm_para4"><a name="07103022000364">In the longer term, we want to deliver CTB as accessibly, simply and securely as possible. We want to research the feasibility of using data held &#147;across Government&#148; to build profiles of people likely to be entitled. We also want to develop the concept of a &#147;single point of contact&#148; for pensioners, coupled with alignment of application processes that will provide greater efficiency and a better public service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="71029w0033.htm_para5"><a name="07103022000365">Our assessment shows that enabling people to access CTB and HB via the Pension Service has resulted so far in over 65,000 more people being paid those benefits.</p>

The reason for the breach was a change in the accounting policy. During the 2003-04 financial year DWP reviewed its accounting policy in respect of capitalisation of expenditure on improvements to leasehold properties. As a result of this review the policy was changed so that expenditure in respect of major capital refurbishment and improvement of properties occupied but not owned was capitalised as leasehold improvements.</p>

These regulations outlaw unjustified age discrimination in employment and vocational training. Provisions relating to occupational pensions came into force on 1 December 2006. The regulations give individuals important new rights, extend existing rights and speed up removal of traditional barriers. Figures on the number of legal claims made against employers relating to ageism in the last five years, are not currently available as the regulations have only been in force since 1 October 2006. These will be provided by the ETS in its annual report. ETS does not routinely collect information on the age and sector of claimants, but BERR does carry out periodic surveys of employment tribunal findings. The last of which was carried out in 2003 (DTI/Pub 7531/0.9k/08/04/AR. URN 04/1071). The next survey is due to be carried out in 2008 and will include among other things information on the age and sector of claimants.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what estimate he has made of how much would be needed on average in each of the next 50 years in <i> (a)</i> net present value and <i> (b)</i> cash sum terms in order for the Financial Assistance Scheme to pay 90 per cent. of the (i) core and (ii) expected pensions of all those eligible for support; and if he will make a statement.

<p><a name="st_412"><a name="07103022000688"><a name="71029w0035.htm_spnew5"><a name="07103022002089"><b>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</b>
 The &#145;core&#146; pension as defined by the financial assistance scheme standardises some pension features for ease of administration and to protect the public purse. For example, payments start from 65 rather than scheme pension age and no indexation is provided. The cash and NPV costs of paying 90 per cent. of core pension are in the following table and sum to approximately &#163;10 billion in cash terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="71029w0035.htm_para4"><a name="07103022000689">We do not have the data to estimate accurately an &#145;expected&#146; pension. Schemes that qualify for the financial assistance scheme have very different scheme rules, for example, on indexation and revaluation (particularly for pre-1997 pension accruals), and it is not possible to make precise estimates of these differences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="71029w0035.htm_para5"><a name="07103022000690">In the Government response to the report by the parliamentary ombudsman on occupational pensions (Trusting in the Pensions Promise, June 2006), we estimated the total cost of meeting expected pensions at between &#163;13 billion and &#163;17 billion in cash terms to reflect this uncertainty.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 October 2007]:</i><i> </i>The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) is intended to pay compensation based on those benefits generally provided on the winding up of a pension scheme, and so does not incorporate additional benefits beyond basic retirement and survivor&#146;s benefits. The Government took a policy decision to focus the PPF compensation on these basic benefits to avoid an excessive burden on the Pension Protection Levy, which is paid by other pension schemes.

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="71029w0038.htm_para1"><a name="07103022001201">The Department has, however, estimated indicative costs for the PPF introducing early compensation on ill health grounds; these estimates are highly sensitive to the underlying assumptions. If, for example, 5 per cent. of PPF deferred members qualified for ill-health compensation without actuarial reduction, they lived on average until the same age as those retiring in normal health and the average age at which they qualified was 50, the reserves of the PPF in respect of deferred members would have to rise by approximately 2 per cent. The PPF estimate that such an increase would require an increase in the Pension Protection Levy from &#163;675 million by 10 per cent.</p>

 Following the intervention of the right hon. Member for Witney the trustees of the Earlys of Witney Pension Scheme were contacted by the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) Operational Unit. Subsequently a DWP official contacted an individual member of the scheme to provide information about the FAS, and issued the standard form to return to the Financial Assistance Scheme Operational Unit. The individual subsequently decided not to pursue a claim for assistance, and I am told this was because he was awaiting an appeal judgment in court.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 15 October 2007]:</i> Following the review of Remploy last year by PriceWaterhouse Coopers, we asked the Remploy Board to bring forward a five-year restructuring plan both to modernise the business and to support substantially larger numbers of disabled people into work, ensuring that there would be no compulsory redundancies of disabled employees, and that their full terms and conditions&#151;including rights to final salary pensions&#151;would be protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"><a name="71029w0040.htm_para12"><a name="07103022001483">The Secretary of State has now requested a final report from the Remploy board on the modernisation of the company, no later than 12 November 2007. We recognise that despite substantial progress, significant issues remain unresolved. Nonetheless, these remaining differences can and should be bridged. We continue to believe that a negotiated settlement represents the best outcome for Remploy.</p>

 At July 2007, &#163;264.3 million was outstanding in social fund loans to beneficiaries no longer in receipt of benefits from which deductions can be made. This figure is, generally speaking, obviously inversely proportional to success rates in moving customers off benefits and into work</p>

This transfer will be completed by the end of March 2008. This will ensure that Debt Management&#146;s specialist skills and technology can be used to the best effect to recover these loans.</p>

The overall aim of the Department&#146;s anti-fraud strategy is to have a benefit system which is secure from first claim to final payment.

 Adult learners on low incomes who are in receipt of income based benefits continue to be entitled to full fee remission for further education, along with those undertaking basic skills courses, first full level 2 qualifications and 19 to 25-year-olds undertaking first full level 3 qualifications. Individuals claiming IB, SDA or DLA falling within these categories are not charged a fee for further education. On the basis of information provided by the LSC, the following table sets out the average fee contribution charged to all adult learners not entitled to free further education provision, whether or not they were claiming IB, SDA or DLA, The figures show the position since 2004. Mark Haysom, the LSC&#146;s Chief Executive, will write to the hon. Member with the information for the years between 1997/98 and 2003/04. A copy of his reply will be placed in the House Library.</p>

1. The Time Intervals Survey (TIS) is a sample survey that produces estimates of the average time taken between stages of proceedings for defendants in completed criminal cases in magistrates courts.<br>
2. Results are based on proceedings in one sample week in March, June, September and December for all charged cases (adults and youth/PYO defendants). Defendants who were summonsed to magistrates courts are not included in this analysis.<br>
3. The margin of error is a measure of the precision of a result based on a sample survey. Timeliness in magistrates courts is measured using data from a sample of the total number of defendants. The sample provides one estimate of the average time taken and different samples would produce different average times. The true value is likely to fall within the range of the sample result +/- the margin of error.<br>
4. Both adult and youth defendants included in the one week sample survey are included.<br>
5. First listing refers to the first listed hearing of the case in the magistrates court.<br>
6. More detailed results and notes from the Time Intervals Survey are published in a National Statistics Bulletin at http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/timeintervals.htm<br>

We hope Professor Pinheiro will be able to visit soon and call upon the Burmese regime to co-operate fully with him so that he is able to fulfil the mandate of the Human Rights Council Resolution passed on  2 October. The resolution, sponsored by the EU, with the strong support of the UK, expressed deep concern about the situation in Burma. In our statement to the Human Rights Council, we drew attention to the regime's violations, including restrictions on the freedom of speech and association, and the suffering of Burma's ethnic communities. We have voiced our concern about the lack of co-operation the Burmese government has given to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and call on the regime to grant urgent access to the ICRC so that they can resume their much needed activities in supporting human rights on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_481"><a name="71029w0049.htm_para15"><a name="07103035000068">On 15 October, the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council called for a thorough and impartial investigation of the deaths of demonstrators, imprisonment of protesters and other continuing violations of human rights. In response to the Burmese government's failure to exercise restraint in their treatment of the demonstrators, the Council of the EU agreed to implement stronger restrictive measures against the regime. The strengthened measures include a ban on the import of metals, minerals, timber and semi-precious stones and a ban on investment in these sectors. These measures are designed to target the interests of the Generals, rather than harm the people of Burma.</p>

 The UK is committed to promoting democratic principles and values around the world.

Countries currently governed by dictators, military forces and by a single party structure usually have a poor record of non-compliance with human rights norms, denying rights such as freedom of expression, assembly, association, movement or information, on which democracy is built.

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has not breached its resource budget or its near-cash budget at any time since 2001. The Administration budget was overspent in financial year 2001-02 by &#163;31,245,000 mainly as a result of the reclassification to Administration costs of items that had previously been treated as capital expenditure. The capital budget was overspent in financial year 2002-03 by &#163;36,826,052 mainly as a result of the capitalisation of the Berlin embassy private finance initiative contract which was previously treated as off-balance sheet and in financial year 2006-07 by &#163;1,968,000 mainly as a result of the reclassification of grants to the UN and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation as capital.</p>

 The National Audit Office measures spending performance against plans by comparing outturns against final provision following Supplementary Estimates&#151;rather than against plans at the start of the year&#151;as plans can change during the year for a number of reasons, such as machinery of Government and classification changes. The definitive figures for final provision and provisional outturn are published each year in the Public Expenditure Outturns White Paper (available in the Library of the House). Changes to plans arising in-year are published in Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses, as are differences between provisional and final outturns.</p>

We fine tune spending across programmes towards the end of each financial year to get as close to our annual targets as possible but it is very difficult to turn the flow of capital spend on and off easily. A prudent approach is taken which resulted in underspends in some relevant years.</p>

 The EU Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) at Rafah will cost the EU &#8364;7 million (&#163;4,900,000) this year. The UK will pay a total of &#8364;1.19million (&#163;832,000) of this as part of its 17 per cent. contribution to the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) budget. Any reduction in mission costs arising from the closure of the border will not revert to the UK, but be redistributed within the CFSP budget.</p>

The EUBAM mission is standing by at minimum operational strength, ready to resume its border-monitoring role at Rafah as soon as the situation allows. In the meantime, EUBAM staff are concentrating on the capacity building part of their mandate and offering support to the European Security and Defence Policy police mission in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (EUPOL COPPS). As one example of this, EUBAM Rafah experts recently assisted EUPOL COPPS in the delivery of public order training to the Palestinian civil police in the west bank.</p>

 There is no universally applicable definition of affordability. Individual family circumstances will determine how affordable childcare is in relation to family income and is relative to the different levels of wages in different regions. We know however that childcare costs can have a substantial impact on the family budget, especially those in lower income households, which is why we are providing substantial help (over &#163;3 million a day) through the tax credit system and 12.5 hours of free early education for all three and four year olds.</p>

The affordability of childcare will be an important factor in determining whether there is sufficient childcare in a local authority area.</p>

 Since 1998 schools and local authorities have set targets for pupils&#146; performance in National Curriculum tests and public examinations.

<i> [holding answer 25 October 2007]:</i><i> </i>Extra-curricular activities can help increase the attainment of individual children and young people, as well as increase their aspirations and motivation to learn, enabling every child to fulfil their potential. Since 1997, the Government have been firmly committed to giving children and young people the opportunity to benefit from a wide range of extra curricular activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_527"><a name="71029w0053.htm_para11"><a name="07103041000225">Study support is recognised as a key tool in raising pupil attainment and Improving behaviour and attendance. Since 1997 a range of activity has been undertaken, spearheaded by the publication in 1999 of the strategy document &#147;Extending Opportunity: A National Framework for Study Support&#148;. As part of this, all schools were given access to ring-fenced Government funding for study support activities via the Standards Fund; this was subsumed into mainstream funding In 2004-05.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_528"><a name="71029w0053.htm_para12"><a name="07103041000226">Playing for Success (PfS) was introduced in 1997 as part of the commitment to tackle under-achievement in urban areas. PfS is establishing study support centres at sports clubs&#146; grounds with the aim of raising standards in literacy, numeracy, information and communication technology (ICT) among young people aged between nine and 14 years. The centres use the environment and motivating factor of sport to help pupils to re-engage with education. Typically, pupils attend for two hours per evening, after school, over a 10-week period. Attendance is voluntary. PfS has grown over the past 10 years, and in that period over 220,000 pupils have benefited from attending PfS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_530"><a name="71029w0053.htm_para14"><a name="07103041000228">Building from the success of FSES, the Government are committed to every school providing access to the core offer by 2010. The core offer is: a varied menu of activities (including study support and play) and child care; community access to facilities, swift and easy access to targeted and specialist services; and parenting support. The varied menu aspect of the core offer will give all children and young people the opportunity to engage in voluntary out of school hours activities, both before and after school. Activities can include breakfast clubs, homework clubs, sport, music and the arts and opportunities to pursue particular interests. There are currently over 8,000 schools delivering access to the core offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_531"><a name="71029w0053.htm_para15"><a name="07103041000229">Significant funding has been provided to support extended schools. &#163;680 million was made available between 2005-06 to 2007-08 to support the start up of extended schools. In July 2008, over &#163;1 billion funding was announced for extended schools between 2008-09 to 2010-11. As part of this, &#163;265 million will be made available to support children from disadvantaged backgrounds benefiting from additional out-of-hours tuition and after-school clubs.</p>

 The availability of AS level in year 12 offers choice to young people. Many choose to take a wider range of subjects at AS in year 12, before perhaps specialising further for their full A levels. Taking an exam in year 12 gives them a clear basis for taking such decisions and can encourage further study. Having a discrete award also means this study is recognised by a qualification, so those that do not go on to complete a full A level are not left empty handed. The design of the A level means that the AS forms half of the overall assessment; the option to take them in year 12 allows the whole A level assessment to be spread over two years.</p>

 It is for the awarding bodies to moderate coursework marks and ensure that the grades they award are fair and consistent. Accreditation of A levels and GCSEs includes consideration of the quality assurance and controls they have in place. It is for the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) as the qualifications regulator to oversee standards and fairness within the exams system. Its Regulations and Standards Division runs monitoring and scrutiny programmes of awarding body practice on coursework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_535"><a name="71029w0054.htm_para0"><a name="07103041000253">The QCA&#146;s 2005 review of coursework in GCE and GCSE identified concerns about the nature and amount level of support that it is appropriate for teachers to give. In response to this QCA issued guidelines to teachers and pupils on how much help centres can give to candidates. The Joint Council for Qualifications also provided a set of rules, which took effect from September 2006, which cover how much help teachers can give students. Awarding bodies use these rules to challenge and deal with any individual instances of inappropriate behaviour. There is no evidence to suggest that breaches of the rules are in any way widespread.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_536"><a name="71029w0054.htm_para1"><a name="07103041000254">The changes being made to strengthen further GCSE and A level arrangements include changes to coursework arrangements in many subjects and the introduction of controlled assessments. These will bring tighter controls around: task setting by teachers or awarding bodies; supervision of task taking and task marking by teachers or awarding bodies. Teacher set and marked tasks will not be allowed in GCSE.</p>

 This information on grade boundaries is not held centrally. The process awarding bodies go through to ensure that standards are consistent means there will be variations in terms of the raw marks required between different awarding bodies&#146; qualifications and from year-to-year. It is for the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority as the qualifications regulator to oversee the awarding process to ensure that standards are comparable both between different qualifications and over time.</p>

 We have not collected any data on language learning in year 2, as there is no requirement for schools to teach modern foreign language in Key Stage 1. Research published by the National Foundation for Educational Research in June 2007 found that 70 per cent. of primary schools are teaching a foreign language in class time in Key Stage 2. We do not have accurate data that breaks this down into individual year groups so cannot provide a figure for year 6 pupils.</p>

 Improving standards of literacy and numeracy at all stages of education has been one of the Governments top priorities. Since 1997 the results achieved by 11-year-olds and 14-year-olds as measured by National Curriculum tests in English have risen dramatically with provisional figures for 2007 showing that 80 per cent. of 11-year-olds in England reached the target level 4 and above (an increase of 17 percentage points over 1997) and 74 per cent. of 14-year-olds reached the target level 5 and above (an increase of 17 percentage points over 1997).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_538"><a name="71029w0055.htm_para1"><a name="07103041000451">The National Curriculum provides a clear description of the literacy skills that children are able to demonstrate at different levels of attainment. At age 11 (the end of Key Stage 2) the expected level of achievement is level 4. Children achieving level 4 have literacy skills that mean they can access complex forms of language and complex ideas. They can use inference and deduction and can locate and use ideas and information. Their writing in a range of forms is lively and thoughtful. Handwriting style is fluent joined and legible. Full stops, capital letters and question marks are used accurately and pupils can use punctuation within a sentence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_539"><a name="71029w0055.htm_para2"><a name="07103041000452">Although level 4 is the target that we expect children to reach by the end of primary school, provisional figures show that 93 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved at least Level 3 in English in 2007. Children assessed at level 3 can read a range of texts accurately and independently; and their writing is organised, legible and clear. Children who are assessed at level 2 will show confidence in talking and listening and their reading of simple texts will be accurate and show understanding.</p>

The Government's target is for 60 per cent. of 16-year-olds to achieve 5 good GGSE grades (A*-C) or equivalent by 2008, Provisional figures for 2007 published on 18 October show that this target has been met. But we are raising the bar and in future the target for the end of Key Stage 4 will be measured against the proportion of pupils achieving 5 grades A*-C or equivalent, including GCSE English and mathematics.

 In 2003 the Departments for Transport (DfT) and Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) established the joint Travelling to School Initiative to encourage more sustainable travel to school, thereby improving child health and activity levels and reducing congestion and pollution caused by the number of cars on the school run. The primary tool in helping schools achieve a reduction in car travel is the development of a School Travel Plan (STP). This helps to identify specific measures which could reduce the number of car journeys and promote and encourage more walking and cycling to school, or the use of public transport for longer journeys.</p>

Between 2004 and 2007 more than 14,000 schools have developed STPs and been allocated more than  &#163;77 million to invest on capital items which promote or enable sustainable travel.

 Measures to improve road safety for cyclists include providing better infrastructure, promoting cycle training, improved training and testing for motorists and encouraging cyclists to protect themselves, by making themselves conspicuous and by wearing a safety helmet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_574"><a name="71029w0057.htm_para5"><a name="07103048000136">The new edition of the Highway Code, published in September 2007, includes enhanced advice to all road users to look out for and be aware of vulnerable road users, including cyclists. To make drivers more aware of cyclists the theory test question bank contains a large number of questions about vulnerable road users. The screen-based theory test allows the use of digitised video clips to help test hazard perception with moving images, which include cyclists. The practical driving test has been lengthened, providing a greater opportunity for encountering cyclists.</p>

We have run various cycle safety campaigns over the last 10 years. Currently, cycling safety messages for younger children are included on the Hedgehogs website including advice and games. Last year we produced an online advertisement for children called &#145;No helmet, no ride&#146;, which encourages children to wear a cycle helmet, which last ran in the summer of this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_577"><a name="71029w0057.htm_para8"><a name="07103048000139">There is also the cyclesense website aimed at teenage cyclists, giving advice and tips of cycling safety. This year an MTV/THINK! competition teenagers were asked to come up with ideas for TV commercials about road safety, including cycling, aimed at their peers. This activity ran over five months and the three best ideas were produced as TV commercials and teens voted for their favourite ad online.

 The Department provides two grants to encourage the migration of freight from road to rail. The Freight Facilities Grant helps offset the capital cost of providing rail freight handling facilities and the Rail Environmental Benefit Procurement Scheme assists companies with the operating costs associated with running rail freight transport. These grants are not targeted at particular roads but are available to freight flows which would otherwise move by road where rail is more expensive. During 2007-08 these schemes will secure the removal of over 1 million lorry journeys from our roads.</p>

 The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) will include a reporting mechanism under which any transport fuel supplier wishing to earn a certificate for the supply in the UK of any litre of renewable transport fuel will be required to complete a report on the carbon savings associated with, and wider sustainability impacts of, the fuel in question. The Renewable Fuels Agency is expected to publish regular reports highlighting the different performance of different transport fuel suppliers, and allowing consumers to compare the extent to which different suppliers make efforts to source sustainable biofuels. We believe that this will create a very strong incentive on transport fuel suppliers to source only the most sustainable biofuels.</p>

 The decision to include clause 26 in the draft Local Transport Bill was prompted by a recommendation of the Bus Partnership Forum&#146;s Innovation and Inclusion Task and Finish Group. The recommendation that holders of private hire vehicle (PHV) licences should be allowed to obtain a special public service vehicle operator&#146;s licence to provide local bus services, in the same way as licensed taxis can do already, was seen as giving added flexibility to meet local transport needs, particularly in rural areas.</p>

The proposal is simply intended to give PHV owners an added flexibility where they see an opportunity to use it. We would expect the provision to be of more value in rural areas where a smaller vehicle might be more cost-effective on a particular route.</p>

The validation statement described the EPISKIN system as being a reliable and relevant stand-alone alternative method for this purpose, and the EpiDerm system as having the potential to reliably identify skin irritants within a tiered-testing strategy.

Following the terrorist incidents in Glasgow and London in June, we have spent much of the last few months focused on counter terrorism and security. The Prime Minister has asked Lord West to conduct a review of the protection of crowded places, critical national infrastructure, and transport infrastructure from a critical terrorist attack.</p>

 Dispersal Orders are one of a number of measures to tackle antisocial behaviour and have succeeded in tackling underage drinking, joyriding, noise nuisance, the antisocial use of fireworks and the harassment and intimidation of residents. They are not intended to be used in isolation, but should form part of a tiered and integrated response to tackling crime and disorder and antisocial behaviour in local areas.

 Front line policing is measured using the Frontline Policing Measure, which is based on the proportion of police officers engaged in frontline activities.</p>

Examples of roles considered as front line include: burglary, CID, firearms, community safety, dogs, drugs, foot/car/beat patrol, hate crime, mounted police, special branch, marine, air, underwater, and vice.</p>

 Details of pinch point trades exceeding harmony guidelines<sup>(1)</sup> and voluntary outflow rates in these particular trades are provided in the following tables<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_789"><a name="71029w0075.htm_para0"><a name="0710313000189">Some pinch points record no harmony breaches. These groups, often with very small populations of specialists, have to be managed on a tri-Service basis in order to maintain harmony. This is successfully done by the use of reserves or contractors to solve the problem in the short term or to call upon the other two Services to assist. For example, the Defence Medical Services may deploy tri-Service teams to field hospitals on operations. This enables individuals' harmony to be maintained and enables Force Commanders to retain operational capability, although undermanning in the trade still means it is categorised as a pinch point.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 October 2007]:</i> Defence Estates (DE) does not levy any charges against the proceeds of fundraising activities. However, where publicly funded estate facilities are used in support of the fundraising activities, DE is required to assess and recover a charge based on the Department&#146;s costs. It is common for these costs to be settled by organisers from the proceeds of the activity.</p>

 The 1994 Defence Costs Study led to the closure of all the UK's military hospitals, with the exception of the Royal Hospital Haslar (which is now no longer a military unit). In May 1997, the only other remaining military hospital in the UK was the Duchess of Kent Military Hospital in Catterick (which closed as a centre for physical injuries and illnesses in 1999). The majority of patients treated at all the UK's military hospitals were civilians.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence (MOD) 4-tier grading (4TG) system provides a means of determining accommodation charges for differing standards of service family accommodation (SFA) and single living accommodation (SLA) across the estate. A number of criteria are assessed, relating to scaling, condition, provision of key local amenities and environmental factors.

<i> [holding answer 22 October 2007]:</i> It is not possible to quantify what liability would have been needed for all three Services to maintain all personnel within harmony guidelines. This is because of a number of factors:</p>
<a name="71029w0076.htm_brev0"><a name="0710313002412"><ul><p class="tabletext">a. There are two sets of Harmony Guidelines. Unit harmony is applied to units&#151;such as a ship or an infantry battalion&#151;and governs our force structure. Individual harmony is intended to indicate the degree of turbulence experienced by individuals due to their service in the armed forces and acknowledges that people move between units.</p>
</ul><a name="71029w0076.htm_brev1"><a name="0710313002413"><ul><p class="tabletext">b. Due to the particular requirements of operational commitments, at any given time some units may fail to achieve their harmony guidelines while others will not be in such demand and therefore exceed their harmony guidelines. It is therefore perfectly possible to have the required number of people overall in the Services, but face specific shortfalls in certain specialisations. The MOD actively manages such &#145;pinch points&#146; and has re-roled some units to attempt to mitigate some of the more acute harmony shortfalls.</p>
</ul><a name="71029w0076.htm_brev2"><a name="0710313002414"><ul><p class="tabletext">c. The MOD focuses its effort on, wherever possible, seeking to head off harmony problems before they arise, by looking ahead into the mid-term. As a result, detailed management information on historic harmony achievement is not available. This means it is not possible to produce an extrapolation of the number of additional people required to deliver harmony guidelines.</p>

This means that women employed by the MOD are able routinely to work beyond the current state pension age for women of 60. Moreover, the MOD has introduced procedures which enable its civil servants to apply to work beyond 65 in accordance with the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006. Such applications are submitted to individual line managers and appeals, where they are raised, are dealt with at a more senior level within the business unit.</p>

 MOD employs a number of locally engaged staff overseas who are known as locally engaged civilians (LECs). The definition of a locally engaged civilian is an employee who has been recruited locally as a &#147;servant of the Crown&#148;. In other words, they have not been recruited through fair and open competition in the UK under the Civil Service Order in Council and they are not therefore members of the Home Civil Service or the Diplomatic Service. LECs are also employed on terms and conditions analogous with local employment law and market forces, and not those of the UK.

It is not possible to assign a precise number of personnel to a specific aircraft type, as many individuals provide essential support services to several aircraft types.

1. Finished in-year admissions<br>
An admission episode is the first episode in a patient's hospital stay. An episode is defined as a period of inpatient care under a single consultant. For finished in year admission episodes, only those admission episodes that start and finish in the same financial year are counted. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
2. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)<br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
F10 Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>
K70 Alcoholic liver disease<br>
T51 Toxic effect of alcohol<br>
Please note that &#147;alcohol related&#148; is not a clearly defined condition and there may be some differences in codes used for different cases. These are defined by a primary diagnosis of mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol (ICD10 code F10), alcoholic liver disease (K70) and toxic effect of alcohol (T51) in this reply. Counts for primary diagnoses are included only where these conditions were the main reason for the patients to be admitted to hospitals, therefore, counts do not include patients who were admitted to hospitals for any other reason than defined by the above diagnoses that may have been treated in hospitals with any of these diagnoses as a secondary condition.<br>

Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent over by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes.

Due to changes in strategic health authority (SHA) and primary care trust (PCT) configurations, and the fact that East of England SHA and Suffolk PCT only came into existence in 2006, the figures quoted for 2005-06 and 2004-05 were originally for the old SHAs (Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, Essex and Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire) and PCTs (Central Suffolk, Ipswich, Suffolk Coastal and Suffolk West) that were in existence at the time have been summed to give figures for the new bodies.<br>
<i> Diabetes Prevalence</i><br>
The disease register in QOF for diabetes does not include any patient below the age of 17. However, the denominator is all registered patients. This means that the reported prevalence is lower than the actual value.<br>
<i> Coverage of QOF</i><br>
Patients will only contribute to the figures in QOF if they are registered with a general practice participating in QOF. Not all practices participate in QOF and some participate in only some parts (especially PMS practices who are paid under different arrangements for providing services which are part of QOF for CMS practices). Most indicators in QOF have rules which allow for patients to be excluded (e.g. patient refuses treatment) and so the denominator for a given indicator may be less than the number of patients on the register for that disease. Note also that some indicators have age limits and so exclude some patients on the register.<br>

1. Discharges<br>
A discharge episode is the last episode during a spell, where the patient is discharged from the hospital (this includes transfer to another hospital).<br>
2. Length of stay (duration of spell)<br>
Length of stay (LOS) is calculated as the difference in days between the admission date and the discharge date, where both are given. LOS is based on the whole of the hospital spell and therefore may not be linked to malnutrition entirely. LOS only applies to ordinary admissions, i.e. day cases are excluded (unless otherwise stated). Information relating to LOS figures, including discharge method/destination, diagnoses and any operative procedures, is based only on the final episode of the spell.<br>
3. All diagnoses count of episodes<br>
These figures represent a count of all finished consultant episodes where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in a HES record.<br>
 4. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)<br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
5. Secondary diagnoses<br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
6. Malnutrition<br>
Malnutrition is defined by a primary diagnosis between the ICD-10 codes E40-E46.<br>
E40 Kwashiorkor<br>
E41 Nutritional marasmus<br>
E42 Marasmic kwashiorkor<br>
E43 Unspecified severe protein-energy malnutrition<br>
E44 Protein-energy malnutrition of moderate and mild degree<br>
E45 Retarded development following protein-energy malnutrition<br>
E46 Unspecified protein-energy malnutrition<br>

 Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for providing, or securing the provision of primary medical services within their area, to the extent they consider necessary to meet all reasonable requirements. In exercising these duties, PCTs will need to consider both the location and capacity of local primary medical services. They are also responsible for ensuring the adequate provision of national health service pharmaceutical services. The Government are committed to publishing a White Paper on pharmacy services, which may consider these issues further. The Government have also indicated that, as part of the NHS Next Stage Review, the Department will work with public and professional stakeholders to develop a wider strategy for primary care and community services.</p>

The first set of guidance, including an example menu, for those providing food to older people in residential care who do not have specific diet-related medical needs, was published by the FSA in October 2006. Guidance for institutions providing food to adults who do not have specific diet-related medical needs, will be published before the end of October 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_948"><a name="71029w0095.htm_para2"><a name="07103119002672">The quality of hospital food is measured annually via Patient Environment Action Team (PEAT) assessments. These showed an increase from 17 per cent. &#145;good&#146; in 2002 to 32 per cent. &#145;excellent&#146; in 2006 (there was no &#145;excellent&#146; category in 2002, when a three-point scale was used).</p>

For the last year in which statistics were collected, (2004) 89 per cent. of hospitals had introduced ward kitchen services to provide light snacks, 80 per cent. were providing snack boxes for patients who missed a meal and 84 per cent. provided extra snacks during the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_950"><a name="71029w0095.htm_para4"><a name="07103119002674">It is known that older people in hospital are vulnerable to malnutrition. To identify and deal with patients at risk, we have introduced protected mealtimes and have renewed the emphasis on nutritional screening. These two areas of work are being actively pursued by the National Patient Safety Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_951"><a name="71029w0095.htm_para5"><a name="07103119002675">A national action plan to tackle the issue of older people and nutrition more generally was announced on 14 March 2007 by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Lewis). The action plan followed a nutrition summit on the same day, attended by leading charities, clinicians, nutrition experts and care home representatives. It will be published in November 2007 and will outline a range of measures that NHS and social care managers can take to address nutrition, hydration and nutritional care issues in all settings. FSA guidance to improve meals served in major institutions contributes to this national action plan.</p>

<a name="71029w0099.htm_brev0"><a name="07103119003354"><ul><p class="tabletext">substitute, control or eliminate latex where appropriate and possible;</p>
</ul><a name="71029w0099.htm_brev1"><a name="07103119003355"><ul><p class="tabletext">ensure staff are aware of, and have access to, safe and effective latex-free alternatives;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_990"><a name="71029w0099.htm_para3"><a name="07103119003235">They further recommended that this policy should be backed up by efficient management arrangements, and the policies audited and reviewed to check compliance. A deadline of January 2006 was given for all these actions to be completed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_991"><a name="71029w0099.htm_para4"><a name="07103119003236">In addition, a website-based toolkit has been developed by the Health and Safety Executive, in partnership with the Department, the NPSA, the Latex Allergy Support Group, the National Association of Theatre Nurses, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the healthcare industry and other relevant bodies. This toolkit includes example policies and materials to help local NHS organisations raise awareness of latex allergy with both staff and patients.</p>

 Between 1996-97 and 2007-08, spending on the NHS has increased from &#163;33 billion to just over &#163;90 billion, representing an average annual increase in real terms of 6 per cent. The improvements seen in stroke services have undoubtedly benefited from these increases over the last 10 years.</p>

It set out a range of measures to reduce the incidence of stroke and improve stroke treatment, which have led to a widespread development of services: the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) shows that all trusts caring for people who have had a stroke now have a specialist stroke service and 97 per cent. of hospitals in England now have a stroke unit, these were uncommon a decade ago. The audit also shows that in 2006, around two thirds of stroke patients were treated on a stroke unit. This is a significant improvement since 2004 when the figure was less than half. Length of stay in hospital for stroke patients is falling from 34 days in 2001 to 28 days in 2004. The results of the RCP audit also show that the proportion of trusts with a stroke unit meeting five or six of the audit's criteria has increased from 33 per cent. to 41 per cent. between 2004 and 2006.</p>

significant progress we have made in this area we are now able to redouble our efforts in addressing the challenge of stroke. This is why the Department launched a stroke strategy document for consultation on 9 July 2007. It followed an 18-month programme of work, setting out the views of six expert working groups who represented a wide range of key stakeholders. The strategy aims to accelerate the emergency response to stroke, by setting out a framework for care of stroke patients, and raising awareness about stroke symptoms and risk factors. It is due for publication by the end of 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_999"><a name="71029w0099.htm_para12"><a name="07103119003260">In addition to developing the strategy, in 2006 the Department published &#145;Mending hearts and brains&#146;, a report by Professor Roger Boyle, the National Director for Heart and Stroke. The report makes the clinical case for reconfiguring stroke services. In particular, it emphasises the need to treat stroke as an emergency, including the delivery of thrombolysis at specialist centres and a possible 'hub and spoke' model for stroke services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1000"><a name="71029w0099.htm_para13"><a name="07103119003261">Last year the Department also launched ASSET (Action on stroke services: an evaluation toolkit) to help health care providers compare their performance with others. It considers four aspects of acute treatment setting out how these mean fewer people experiencing death or disability, and more efficient hospital services with people able to return home faster. An additional version, ASSET 2, for commissioners has also been introduced which uses analytical modelling to advise hospitals and primary care trusts of what the impact of making specific changes to their services would be. We have also published a guide for commissioners, setting out key questions they need to consider and a series of best practice case studies.</p>
