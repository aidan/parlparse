<a name="stpa_13">Serviceability is a metric applied to helicopters allocated to the front line as part of the UOF. For the purposes of MOD reporting, a &quot;serviceable&quot; aircraft is defined as one that is used, is capable of being used or could be made ready for a period of two hours flying within a planned flying programme. An aggregated serviceability target level is agreed annually with the Front Line Commands. The target takes account of the expected availability of spares, maintenance personnel and the scheduled maintenance activity.

 Project D154 involves the upgrade of nuclear facilities at Devonport and consists of three phases. The Phase 1 contract ran from 1993 to 1996 and allowed Devonport Management Ltd. to continue with concept and design development work for the facilities during ongoing negotiations for the Phase 2 prime contract. It was originally envisaged that the construction work would begin in 1996, with completion in 1999, but this was not achieved, primarily due to protracted contract negotiations. The Phase 2 contract was awarded in March 1997 and construction work began in 1998. The estimated date for completion of the contract was April 2004, including an end date for the construction work of January 2002.

<a name="51021w04.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_18">During 2001 it became clear that the approved maximum cost for Phase 2 would be exceeded and Treasury approval for an increase in funding was granted in October 2001, allowing the Phase 2 contract to be renegotiated and re-scoped. The existing target date of January 2002, for completion of the key facilities for Vanguard Class submarines, was achieved. Work to complete the Primary Circuit Decontamination Building is expected to be completed in November 2005, in time for use during HMS Victorious&#039;s overhaul. In addition, while some of the work required to upgrade the overhaul and refuel facilities in support of attack submarines (Swiftsure and Trafalgar Classes) was completed by March 2002, elements of the work were transferred to the final phase, Phase 3, as part of the contract re-negotiations.

 It is a condition of all contracts between the Ministry of Defence and its prime contractors that they are placed in the name of &quot;the Authority&quot; which is defined as the Secretary of State. Thus the procurement powers of the Secretary of State are vested in the terms and conditions of the contract. In normal circumstances, those powers are exercised through the prime contractor as appropriate, because there is no direct contractual relationship between MOD and its sub-contractors. If it were to intervene directly, MOD would undermine the contractual responsibilities of the prime contractor. It is principally the responsibility of the Department&#039;s prime contractors to select and manage the performance of their subcontractors.

 The Government&#039;s Skills Strategy, reaffirmed in the White Paper published on the 22 March, sets clear priorities for public funding to support adults without a platform of skills for employability. However, we also recognise the importance of higher level skills, and the Skills Strategy White Paper set out measures to strengthen support for provision at Level 3 and above. Given that higher levels of qualifications have higher rates of return for employers and individuals, it is also important that this should be reflected in the relative contributions employers and individuals make to the costs of such training.

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_89">As you will know, adult participation in education and skills development can take many forms. The main LSC-funded programmes are Work Based Learning (WBL), general Further Education (FE) and Adult & Community Learning (ACL). Annex 1 attached shows how much funding has been allocated to each of our local Learning and Skills Councils for these programmes, in total, for the 2003/04 and 2004/05 years. For 2005/06, you will see that in some regions (where monetary amounts appear against the Regional Office) the details are not yet finalised. We aim to publish final information on our web site as soon as we can.</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_91">employer-based provision through the Employer Training Pilots (ETP), soon to be rolled-out across the country as a National Employer Training Programme and the Workforce Development programme. Taken together, approximate funding levels for these programmes over the 3 years are 2003&#150;04 &#163;84 million, 2004&#150;05 &#163;140 million, 2005&#150;06 &#163;196 million;</p>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_95">In addition, we provide support for learners through Additional Learning Support for specific student needs, around 40 per cent. of which is attributable to adults or, over the 3 years roughly &#163;123 million, &#163;132 million and &#163;135 million, Learner Support Funds, also provide financial support in cases of hardship and to meet childcare costs. These total &#163;80 million a year for adults. Adult Learning Grants are also being piloted in 19 LSC areas at an annual cost of &#163;12 million.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_96">We also fund information, advice and guidance services for adult learners and potential learners at &#163;36 million, &#163;37 million and &#163;38 million over the 3 years in question.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_97">I have not included in Annex 1, the current funding for these programmes, because this would distort the comparison between local LSCs, as some of this funding is routed to particular parts of the country where provision is available or where we are piloting.</p>

<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_98">Annex 2 provides the participation information requested for 2003/04 and 2004/05. Figures for 2003/04 are actuals. Those for 2004/05 are estimated outturns&#151;the 2004/05 academic year is yet to finish and, particularly for adult education which is primarily made up of shorter courses, the pattern of delivery across the academic year changes from year to year, making accurate prediction of full-year outturn difficult. Local LSCs are currently talking with providers across the whole range of our programmes for the 2005/06 year. It is too early to say what levels of participation we will see, but the LSC expects to achieve the targets we have been set on delivering the Government&#039;s priorities. This will lead to shifts in the balance of provision across programmes and we do expect a reduction in adult numbers in 2005/06 as a result. Our current estimate is that this will be around 300,000 learners, a reduction of around 7 per cent. from the 2004/05 planned level.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_99">Regarding your question on future enrolments by over 25s in level 3 and level 4 courses, we are not able to say at this time, what the impact will be. Whilst each of our local LSCs plan provision with their providers, we don&#039;t manage providers at that level of detail. Colleges and other adult education providers will make their own decisions on the number of learners they recruit and the level of fees they may charge to meet course costs.</p>

<p><a name="st_66"><a name="51021w10.html_spnew1"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 &quot;Playing with sounds&quot; has been adopted for use in the Early Reading Development Pilots as it is the Primary National Strategy&#039;s (PNS) most up to date guidance on the teaching of phonics, incorporating various recommendations arising from the expert phonics seminar convened by the Department in 2003. The purpose of the pilots is principally to test certain aspects of the teaching of phonics such as determining an appropriately fast pace, and exploring different models of support to schools and ways of enhancing parental involvement. The pilots are not seeking to examine the evidence for different phonics teaching methodologies currently available; Jim Rose&#039;s independent review of the teaching of early reading will look at those wider questions.

<a name="51021w10.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_47">The content of &quot;Playing with sounds&quot; builds on advice given in previous PNS publications and represents the Strategy&#039;s latest guidance to schools. The content of the phonics pilots is therefore the same as the advice given by the Strategy. Where it differs is that it explores a more rigorous and systematic application of these approaches with greater emphasis on the &quot;Playing with sounds&quot; resource, and more direct guidance on teaching phonics and the application of phonics across the curriculum. It also tests whether children can learn all 44 phonemes, including the long vowel sounds, by the end of the foundation stage, as part of a rich and relevant early years curriculum

The precise consultancy model will be determined locally drawing on local capacity of leading practitioners. Participating schools and settings will receive guidance materials produced by the Primary National Strategy.

 The NHS Security Management Service (NHS SMS) has policy and operational responsibility for the management of security in the national health service including Essex, including work to tackle violence against NHS staff. In November 2003, a comprehensive range of measures were introduced by the NHS SMS to proactively and reactively tackle the problem of violence against NHS staff, including those that work in the ambulance services. Since that time, an estimated 85,000 frontline NHS staff have been trained to prevent and manage violence and the number of prosecutions identified involving those who have physically assaulted staff has risen from 51 in 2002&#150;03 to 759 in 2004&#150;05. The NHS SMS is currently working on a project with the Home Office specifically to look at how technology and other interventions can better protect ambulance staff.

We have also published Career Management&#151;An approach for medical schools, deaneries, royal colleges and trusts&#151;a document that presents an approach to the delivery of career management initiatives for doctors.

Notes:<br>

1. The drop in registrations between September 1997 and September 1998 is mostly attributable to the reduction in re-registration period from two years to 12 months.<br>

2. Most personal dental service (PDS) schemes that have registrations have a re-registration period in excess of 15 months, so the figures for PDS schemes are generally higher than they would have been for the same attendance pattern under general dental service (CDS).<br>

3. Prison contracts have not been included in this analysis.<br>

4. A dentist with a GDS or PDS contract may provide as little or as much NHS treatment as he or she chooses or agreed with the PCT.<br>

5. The Dental Practice Board has no information concerning the amount of time dedicated to NHS work by individual dentists.<br>

6. The areas have been defined using practice postcodes within the current boundaries.<br>

<p><a name="st_135"><a name="51021w18.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Thomas  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 17 October 2005]:</i> The first replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria concluded with the UK-hosted Replenishment Conference on 5&#150;6 September 2005. Donors pledged US$3.7 billion for 2006 and 2007. This represents more than half of the US$7.0 billion <sup>1</sup>  that the Global Fund estimated it needed for these two years. The money pledged will enable all existing Global Fund grants to be renewed (estimated need $3.3 billion <sup>1</sup> ) and provide a modest launch pad (estimated $0.4 billion) for new programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51021w18.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_103">The UK pledged &#163;100 million to the fund for 2006 and &#163;100 million for 2007 at the Replenishment Conference. This represents a doubling of our previous pledge for these two years. The &#163;200 million amounted to 10 per cent. of the US$3.7 billion pledged at the Replenishment Conference. The EU (member states and the EC) is the largest contributor to the Global Fund and pledging more than US$2 billion for 2006 and 2007. The EU therefore continues to show very strong leadership in tackling AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. As President of the EU, the UK drafted an EU statement highlighting the need for the Global Fund to continue to improve its performance and to be well funded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51021w18.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_104">The Replenishment Conference also focused on improving the Global Fund performance at global and country level. Progress on implementing the recommendations from the Global Task Team on Improving AIDS Co-ordination Among Multilateral Institutions and International Donors was discussed. To make the Global Fund&#039;s money work effectively the UK also pledged at the Replenishment Conference to double our contribution to the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) from &#163;8 million to &#163;16 million for the financial year 2005&#150;06.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51021w18.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_105">A mid-term review of the replenishment is planned for June 2006. This will be an opportunity for donors to review further the Global Fund&#039;s performance and get new and existing donors to put in more money. The UK will continue its efforts to encourage new and existing donors, including the private sector, to support the Global Fund.

 DFID has not commissioned studies on the impact of non-agricultural market access on the sustainability of forests in developing countries.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_200">Overall, the environmental impacts of further tariff reductions are likely to be small. However, where governance is poor the social and environmental consequences of liberalisation could be significant.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_201">Further liberalisation of agricultural trade will have a bigger impact on forests than the liberalisation of the forest products trade. This is because of the scale of agricultural trade, the scope for significant tariff reductions and the effects of conversion of forest lands to agricultural use. The product groups that affect forests most significantly are: oil palm, soybean, beef, rubber, cocoa and coffee.</p>

<p>
<a name="51021w23.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_133">There are no reliable estimates of private sector employment generated by public sector because surveys of departments ask for information on employment levels but not on employment by private sector firms under their remits. Similarly, data on public and private sector employment published by the Labour Force Survey ask respondents to classify themselves as working in the public sector or private sector but does not ask whether they are working for private firms in the public sector.

<p><a name="st_177"><a name="51021w23.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 The Financial Services Authority (FSA) factsheet &quot;Endowment mortgage complaints&quot; has been produced and distributed since October 2000 and has been regularly updated. The FSA also produces a more detailed guide to making a complaint, which includes an example of how to write a complaint letter. Consumer awareness campaigns have backed this up.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51021w23.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_134">Millions of the FSA&#039;s mortgage endowment fact sheets have been distributed by firms or requested by consumers. And the consumer communications campaign has resulted in high levels of awareness as evidenced in the FSA&#039;s 2002 Consumer Research (Paper 16) where 99 per cent. of consumers recalled receiving re-projection letters, enclosing FSA fact sheets.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51021w23.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_135">FSA&#039;s latest research results (published in July 2005) indicate that 48 per cent. of households facing a shortfall have restructured their mortgage, savings or endowment. And around 21 per cent. of those facing a shortfall have complained or taken advice. FSA records show that at the end of 2004 around &#163;1.1 billion had been paid in redress.

<p><a name="st_178"><a name="51021w23.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 The FSA has consulted on the Mortgage Endowment Complaints Guidance set out in its Rulebook. This was issued in 2001. The FSA wrote to firms in 2002 and December 2004 to remind firms of their requirement to deal with mortgage endowment complaints fairly and consistently. The FSA has also produced a factsheet on compensation for consumers, which we understand firms are starting to send out with their final response letters.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the likely impact on <i>(a)</i> jobs and <i>(b)</i> the economy in the UK of the proposal to charge VAT on insurance-related services.  [20418]</p>








<p><a name="st_194"><a name="51021w26.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) issued a consultation document on the proposed changes to the VAT exemption for insurance-related services in July, inviting comment from all interested parties. As part of the consultation, views were sought on the impact the changes were likely to have on UK industry and policyholders.

<a name="stpa_157">The consultation exercise formally closed on 30 September and HMRC are currently evaluating the responses.

<p><a name="qn_195"><a name="51021w26.html_wqn2"><b> David Mundell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will change the practice by which the winter fuel payment rebate is paid only to those whose birthday falls before September in the relevant year.  [19434]</p>








<p><a name="st_195"><a name="51021w26.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The qualifying week for winter fuel payments is the week commencing with the third Monday in September. This allows for the necessary checks to be carried out and for the majority of payments to be made automatically by Christmas fulfilling the commitment made by the Chancellor. There are no plans to change this practice.

<p><a name="qn_196"><a name="51021w26.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will extend the winter fuel payment scheme to disabled people under the age of 65; and if he will make a statement.  [20295]</p>








<p><a name="st_196"><a name="51021w26.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 Help is already available through the disability benefits and the disability premium in income support in recognition of the extra costs, including heating, which disabled people have. There are no plans to extend the winter fuel payment scheme to disabled people under age 65.

<p><a name="qn_197"><a name="51021w26.html_wqn4"><b> John Barrett: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will raise winter fuel payments in line with recent energy price increases.  [19751]</p>








<p><a name="st_197"><a name="51021w26.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 We have no plans to do so. The payment has risen from &#163;20 in winter 1997&#150;98 to &#163;200 from winter 2000&#150;01. It is a significant contribution towards fuel costs.
