 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1998]:</i> I have today placed in the Library of the House tables showing the information requested. The figures are entirely speculative. Councils will each take their own decision about their budget requirements for 1999-2000, in the light of the substantial increases in funding announced on 2 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 883-86. Each will look at its own circumstances and consider very hard the need for any council tax increase at all. There is no reason for the capping principles used in 1998-99 to be part of a council's budgeting decisions. The figures for some councils are particularly distorted by an assumption that they would increase their spending up to SSA even where they have in the past consistently spent below that level.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for what reasons Government grant support for Brentwood Borough and Epping Forest District Councils is to decline in the next financial year.  [63041]<P>

<P>
<a name="81214w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Brentwood Borough Council and Epping Forest District Councils will receive central support reduction grant for 1999-2000. This ensures that their income from redistributed non-domestic rates and central government support under various grants to be paid for 1999-2000 will not be less than the income from redistributed non-domestic rates and various grants payable to them for 1998-99.

<P>
<P><I>14 Dec 1998 : Column: 308</I><P>

<P>

<a name="81214w01.html_para1">The main reason for the reduction is RSG for Brentwood Borough Council in 1999-2000 is the change to the method of calculating the element of the Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs) for local authorities' own expenditure on Flood Defence. The calculation is to be based on outturn expenditure instead of budgeted expenditure. Brentwood's budgeted expenditure has been substantially greater than what it has actually spent on flood defence. Other reasons include the adjustment of Capital Financing national totals to allow for the effect of reserved receipts on financing costs and a decrease in the values of some of the indicators used in the calculation of the 'District services' element of the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services SSA.

<a name="81214w01.html_para2">The main reason for the reduction in RSG for Epping Forest District Council in 1999-2000 is the adjustment of Capital Financing national totals to allow for the effect of reserved receipts on financing costs.

 The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is presently conducting a three-year survey, which started in October 1996, into the incidence of drugs (legal or illegal) in fatal road accident victims. A report on interim results to 7 January 1998 was published on 11 February 1998. My written answer of that date, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>233</i>, explained that a copy was being placed in the Library.

<a name="81214w01.html_para3">This survey will not provide evidence of accident causation but it will help to establish the extent of drug use among road users. the interim results show that medicinal drugs were present in some 6 per cent. of road accident fatalities (drivers, passengers, pedestrians, cyclists).

The current restrictions comprise a maximum number of movements which can be made each season with a quota, related to an aircraft's noise classification on take-off or landing, as a supplementary measure designed to encourage the use of quieter aircraft. Each aircraft (landing or take-off) counts as one against the movement limit; it also counts against the noise quota according to its noise quota classification.<P>

The metric EPNL (Effective Perceived Noise Level) is used for noise certification purposes, and each aircraft, depending on the engines fitted, is classified into one of seven 3EPNdB-wide QC bands. They are classified separately for take-off and landing. Therefore, the number of quota points used is proportional to the volume of noise according to the following scale.

 There is no specific definition of "brownfield" land. However, it is usually taken to mean land previously developed for 'urban' uses. For statistical purposes, as defined by the Department's Land Use Change Statistics, "previously-developed urban" uses include residential, transport and utilities, industry and commerce, community services, previously-developed vacant land and derelict land. Land is classified according to its use and not its location, therefore the 'urban' use can occur in rural areas.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will institute contingency plans for the design and routing of an upgrade of the A14 in Cambridgeshire, pending the outcome of multi-modal study for that traffic corridor.  [63526]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w02.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Secretary of State has a statutory duty to review the needs of the network. We have already identified a number of safety related improvements for the Huntingdon to Cambridge section of the A14 which stem from a specific earlier study exercise. The Highways Agency will be implementing these measures by the Spring of 1999.

<a name="81214w02.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Lansley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions he has held with the standing conference of East Anglian local authorities on terms of reference for a multi-modal study of the A14 corridor in Cambridgeshire.  [63530]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w02.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government Office of the Eastern Region is working closely with the Standing Conference of East Anglian Local Authorities (SCEALA) on the technical work leading to the public exhibition of the Draft Regional Planning Guidance for East Anglia, which takes place in February. On 10 December we published our formal consultation with the Regional planning conference on the study programme announced in "A New Deal for Trunk Roads in England". This consultation seeks the Conference's views on the timing, coverage, and scope of the studies. The consultation paper proposes that the Cambridge-Huntingdon study should fall in the second tranche of multi-modal studies. There is a wide range of issues in the corridor including congestion, safety, environment, possible road, bus and rail proposals as well as proposals for significant development that will have to form part of any broad assessment of potential transport solutions.

<P>
<a name="81214w02.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Lansley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what studies he has evaluated concerning the potential for improvements in safety on the A14 in Cambridgeshire; and what action he proposes to take on those studies.  [63531]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w02.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Studies and improvements can be broken down into three distinct lengths, working from east to west as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) The Highways Agency is carrying out studies to identify what safety improvements can be made to the Histon (B1049) and Milton (A10) interchanges north of Cambridge. As an interim measure, the Agency is providing 'queue warning signs' on both carriageways of the trunk road approaching each junction. The signs will be in place by the end of January 1999.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) In 1995 a study was commissioned from consulting engineers, Thorburn Colquhoun, to investigate accidents and congestion on the A14 between Huntingdon and Cambridge. This study suggested measures that could be taken to improve safety on the A14. The first stage of these improvements was carried out in 1995-96 when speed cameras were provided to help reduce traffic speeds. Since that time, and from that study, the Highways Agency has further developed a strategy of safety related improvement measures which will shortly be implemented. These focus on particular problems at specific locations which will be carried out by Spring 1999:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) Improvement to various junctions by small scale widening, replacing existing chevrons with yellow backed signs, install bend warning signs with advisory speed limits, laying anti-skid at the ends of the diverge tapers and providing countdown markers on the approaches to the diverge tapers;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) Improvements within Girton Interchange to improve lane discipline and the flow of traffic;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) The construction of an acceleration lane to Hemingford Abbots eastbound carriageway.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) Further studies are already in place to look at additional safety improvements at various locations;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) Schemes are being prepared to change four existing single level junctions to two level between Thrapston and Brampton. They comprise the provision of bridges with full connections to the A14 at Polopit Road, the B663, Leighton Bromswold and Wooley/Easton junctions together with an overbridge at Chainbridge Lane. The Little Meadow crossing will be closed and alternative access arrangements for land and property owners made. All other central reserve gaps will be closed and the present footpath/bridleway crossing diverted to the proposed structures. All direct access points will be closed and alternative means of access put in place.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>

 In 1997 the highest level of road traffic on non-motorway, two lane dual carriageways, in England, recorded as an Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) flow was 84,000 vehicles on the A1. From readily available records, the ten busiest sections are listed. Lengths of two lane dual carriageway less than 2.5km, which predominantly occur in Urban areas, have been excluded:

 We will be publishing a consultation paper "A New Financial Framework for Local Authority Housing: Resource Accounting in the Housing Revenue Account" on 15 December, allowing until 19 March for comments. The statement on Housing and Regeneration Policy following the Comprehensive Spending Review, on 21 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>468</i>, made clear our intention that local authorities should take a more business-like approach to managing their housing. Local authority housing is a valuable asset. Introducing new-style housing revenue accounts based on a form of resource accounting is one of a number of proposals, including our plans to introduce a Best Value regime for local authorities, to modernise the approach to housing management and encourage greater tenant involvement. 



<P>
<P><I>14 Dec 1998 : Column: 317</I><P>
The proposed new financial framework will show clearly the value of housing, the expenditure needed to maintain it and the subsidy required to keep rents below market levels.

<a name="81214w03.html_para8">These boards fulfil the commitment we gave in our White Paper "Building Partnerships for Prosperity" to reflect an appropriate balance of regional interests. We have already announced that the boards will be led by chairmen with solid business backgrounds. As regards the main regional stakeholders, within each board business experience dominates; four members are drawn from local government reflecting a balance between type and size of authority, geographical spread and party balance; and at least one member on each board can offer a strong rural perspective together with others who have relevant rural experience. Each board also offers expertise from the field of education and the trades union movement and, across the country as a whole, the boards offer significant experience of the voluntary sector. The White Paper had envisaged boards of twelve but, while it has proved possible to constrain the potential size of the board by choosing members who can offer a range of expertise, we have decided that the full range of expertise necessary can only be achieved, at this stage, with boards of thirteen.
<P>

<a name="81214w03.html_para9">All boards will have at least three women--women represent about a quarter of the membership overall. This compares well with other business focused NDPBs. Ethnic minorities make up about 5 per cent. of the board membership.
<P>

<a name="81214w03.html_para10">I have today published a Departmental press release which gives biographical details of the board members. Copies have been placed in the Library.

 The Secretary of State has received no such report. The Government did however consult on the Independent Commissioner's recommendation that Lay Visitors should have their sphere of operation extended to include the Holding Centres. It concluded that no change should be made to the remit of the Lay Visitors, not least because an extension of their role of the nature proposed might leave them open to duress and intimidation.
<P>

<a name="81214w04.html_para0">The Government look forward to the day when the Holding Centres are no longer needed. Meanwhile the Government do not envisage any merging of the roles of the Independent Commissioner and the Lay Visitors.

 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1998]:</i> The Review has been asked to advise the Government on the fitness for purpose of the criminal injuries compensation arrangements in Northern Ireland. It is for Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, who is chairing the Review, to decide precisely what needs to be examined to fulfil this wide-ranging remit. I understand, however, that the whole question of compensation for the relatives of victims is being looked at as part of the Review Body's deliberations on the future of criminal injuries compensation arrangements in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<a name="81214w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1998]:</i> Physicians at the MOD's Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) conduct a full medical examination, including a standard range of physical tests, on Gulf veterans who are referred there. Additional tests or referrals to other consultants or specialists may be required on a case by case basis. In these circumstances, MAP patients are sent for further tests or referrals according to the clinical judgment of the examining physician. Accordingly, the MAP may make use of the National Poisons Information Service (also known as National Regional Poison Centres) in the medical assessment of Gulf veterans as appropriate but has no plans to do so as a matter of routine.
<P>

<a name="81214w05.html_para2">The MAP was established in July 1993 to examine UK Gulf veterans who were concerned that their health had been adversely affected by service in the Gulf conflict. It is open to all Service personnel and MOD civilians who served in the Gulf region at any time between August 1990 and July 1991. Individuals who worked for contractors providing direct support to UK operations during the Gulf conflict may also attend the MAP. The vast majority of those who have attended the MAP are Gulf veterans themselves. However, where medically appropriate, veterans' partners are also welcome to attend and a small number have done so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The Strategic Defence Review, SDR, acknowledged the importance of medical support for defence, and identified a number of shortfalls, both in peacetime care and in operational medical support. 



<P>
<P><I>14 Dec 1998 : Column: 329</I><P>
As a result of the SDR, I announced plans for significant investment in additional medical personnel and equipment of about &#163;140 million over the next four years.
<P>

<a name="81214w06.html_para0">Although the SDR provided funding for substantial improvements to our medical capabilities, this did not by itself solve all the immediate problems. The Defence Medical Services, DMS, organisation continues to suffer from a number of interrelated difficulties which are hindering it in fulfilling its objectives and which are also affecting morale. In particular, serious staffing shortages combined with a high level of operational deployment have led to increased turbulence for DMS staff and their families. There is also serious concern about the continued viability of the Royal Hospital, Haslar.
<P>

<a name="81214w06.html_para1">I therefore set work in hand in July with the aim of producing a strategy for the resolution of these problems and to give DMS personnel a clear and positive vision of the future. I will today be publishing a summary of our findings in a booklet "The Defence Medical Services--A Strategy for the Future", copies of which will be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="81214w06.html_para2">The key proposals include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A major recruiting campaign, properly co-ordinated and targeted, aimed at both new entry Regulars and Reserves, and at a small number of direct entry ready-trained personnel to fill the most pressing shortfalls.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Tackling a range of key personnel issues to address the main problems felt by people in the DMS, including identifying the causes of overstretch and more effective ways of reducing it, harmonising different conditions of service within the DMS and addressing concerns about the need to maintain military standards and ethos while working in NHS hospitals.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Restructured Secondary Care arrangements including: a new Centre for Defence Medicine to act as a focal point for the DMS and a centre of excellence for training and research; a new Ministry of Defence Hospital Unit in Portsmouth; the eventual closure of the Royal Hospital Haslar once these new arrangements are in place; and a clearer responsibility for the Defence Secondary Care Agency to co-ordinate treatment for Service personnel.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A reorganisation of the DMS to improve management and financial co-ordination, including the creation of a new Chief of Staff post on the Surgeon General's staff to co-ordinate planning, personnel management, training, finance and the implementation of change.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Developing closer relations with the NHS, including NHS representation on the two key DMS management boards, and improved arrangements at local level.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="81214w06.html_para3">These proposals will have a significant impact both within the DMS and outside Defence, particularly in the Portsmouth area. We will immediately begin a period of consultation on our proposals and will listen closely to the views of others, including the local community around Gosport, and the Trade Unions that represent our civilian staff. We will be working closely with the National Health Service in taking our proposals forward.
<P>

<a name="81214w06.html_para4">Together the proposals represent a new strategy for the DMS which addresses the very difficult problems being experienced at the moment and looks ahead to the future. We value the DMS, and we plan to rebuild it to meet the needs of our Armed Forces both on operations and in peacetime. It will provide a more attractive and rewarding career not only for those already serving but also for those thinking of joining. Above all, it will be a service in which all concerned can have confidence for the future.

 I am pleased to announce the launch of the MOD's new Post-Doctoral Research Fellowships. The aims of this scheme are to encourage new talent in the defence field; maintain interest in defence studies in the academic community; and encourage informed debate on defence issues. Each fellowship is awarded for a three-year period and funded jointly by the MOD and the academic institution at which the fellow is based. The cost to the MOD is &#163;15,000 per annum for each fellow.
<P>

<a name="81214w06.html_para5">From a strong field, we have been able to select three outstanding fellows. A dedicated Defence Diplomacy Fellowship has been awarded to Dr. Irene Isakova, a Russian national. Dr. Isakova will undertake her research with the Centre for Defence Studies at King's College London, where she will focus on the impact and effectiveness of our Defence Diplomacy initiative in and with Russia. A further two fellowships have been awarded to Dr. Asifa Hussain from the Scottish Centre for War Studies at Glasgow University, and Dr. Tanya Ogilvie-White from the Mountbatten Centre at Southampton University. Dr. Hussain's research will focus on the recruitment of ethnic minorities, race relations and equal opportunities in the Armed Forces, and Dr. Ogilvie-White will undertake research into nuclear proliferation issues. Each of these candidates is ideally placed to provide the MOD with a broader, alternative perspective on these key issues.

 The Periodic Review showed that the Defence Bills Agency, DBA, had performed well against the targets set in the initial Service Level Agreement between the Agency and its MOD customers. The Agency has contained its operating costs with an increased volume of business, achieved higher standards of quality and responded to considerable challenges in the development of Resource Accounting and Budgeting. Following initial operating cost savings of 25 per cent. in the first year, the 



<P>
<P><I>14 Dec 1998 : Column: 331</I><P>
Agency has realised further efficiencies and is now focusing on transaction costs as the key benchmark for future operations. A summary of this report is being placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="81214w06.html_para7">The Review was carried out in accordance with the Government's policy of securing best value for money in the provision of Services. We have concluded that this aim can best be achieved by extending Agency status for DBA for a further five years from 1 April 1999. The Agency will be given new and more challenging targets to make progressive reductions in transaction costs, while maintaining and further improving the quality of service, and meeting the Government's commitment to the prompt payment of bills. These targets will be included in a revised Framework Document which will be published in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what research the Government have evaluated into driving whilst prescribed <i>(a)</i> anxiolytic benzodiazepines and <i>(b)</i> the sleeping tablet Zopiclone.  [62682]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w07.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="81214w07.html_para0">The Government have not commissioned specific research about the drugs mentioned, but a full evaluation of relevant research is being undertaken by the Medicines Control Agency.
<P>

<a name="81214w07.html_para1">The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is presently conducting a three-year survey, which started in October 1996, into the incidence of drugs (legal or illegal) in fatal road accident victims. A report on interim results to 7 January 1998 was published on 11 February 1998. My written answer of that date, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>306</i>, explained that a copy was being placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="81214w07.html_para2">This survey will not provide evidence of accident causation but it will help to establish the extent of drug use among road users. The interim results show that medicinal drugs were present in some 6 per cent. of road accident fatalities (drivers, passengers, pedestrians, cyclists).
<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w07.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. David Stewart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what measures the Government have taken to encourage GPs to issue warnings concerning the danger of driving when using <i>(a)</i> Valium, <i>(b)</i> Librium, <i>(c)</i> Ativan and <i>(d)</i> other types of tranquilliser.  [62683]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 Where there is the possibility that certain medicinal products may cause deterioration of the skills required for driving, the product information provided to doctors and pharmacists recommends that patients should be warned that they may suffer side-effects which may impair their ability to drive. Although these side-effects may wear off, the patient should ensure that they are not affected before driving.
<P>

<a name="81214w07.html_para3">In addition, the British National Formulary (BNF), which provides doctors, pharmacists and other health-care professionals with sound up-to-date information about the use of medicines, advises prescribers to warn patients if treatment is likely to affect their ability to drive. It also recommends that pharmacists provide cautionary and advisory labels with certain medicinal products.
<P>

<a name="81214w07.html_para4">The Medicines Control Agency is aware of public concern that the side-effects of some medicines may be causing road traffic accidents. In response to recent publications they are currently reviewing all available evidence to determine whether there may be a case for strengthening product information, ensuring that Patient Information Leaflets and packaging are updated if necessary.

[63117]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 Section 6(5) of the Land Register (Scotland) Act 1979 requires the Keeper to issue to any person applying, a copy, authenticated or otherwise, of any Title Sheet or part thereof or of any document referred to in a Title Sheet. There are no plans at present to reform the Land Register so that Land Certificates disclose information about previous proprietors and the prices paid by them.

[63118]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The Scottish Law Commission recently published its Report on Diligence on the Dependence and Admiralty Arrestments (Scot. Law Com. No. 164). This Report contains the Commission's recommendations for reform of the diligence of inhibition on the dependence of actions.
<P>

<a name="81214w07.html_para6">The total sums paid by Registers of Scotland in relation to the action of Judicial Review raised by Millar & Bryce Ltd. and 2 other firms of private searchers were as follows: <i>(a)</i> an agreed settlement of &#163;25,000 in respect of the judicially awarded expenses of the petitioners and <i>(b)</i> &#163;36,807.21 in respect of Registers of Scotland expenses.

 The Government recently published their response to the Human Genetics Advisory Commission (HGAC) "Report on the Implications of Genetic Testing for the Insurance Industry", and are currently in discussions with the insurance industry and others on the necessary follow-up action.
<P>

<a name="81214w07.html_para9">It is already a requirement of the Code of Practice on Genetic Testing issued by the Association of British Insurers that insurance companies must consider whether constructive alternatives can be offered to an applicant where a genetic risk is too great to insure. It is sometimes possible for existing products to be adapted to suit individual circumstances and enable people with genetic disorders to obtain insurance. The Government believe it important that people with a family history of a genetic disorder discuss their insurance needs with insurance companies and do not assume they are uninsurable.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what plans he has for implementing Part V of the Police Act 1997 in Scotland providing for extended access to criminal record checks for employment vetting and other purposes.  [64214]<P>

<P>
<a name="81214w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is announcing today that in order to implement Part V of the Police Act 1997 in England and Wales the Home Office will set up a Criminal Records Bureau. In 



<P>
<P><I>14 Dec 1998 : Column: 336</I><P>
Scotland the work of disclosing criminal record information will be carried out by the Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO), which is already well established as a central vetting authority.
<P>

<a name="81214w08.html_para0">The Government's main objective in introducing these arrangements is to strengthen the safeguards for the protection of children. In line with this and to ensure a smooth transition from the current arrangements for employment vetting checks, the SCRO will phase in the issue of three new types of certificates provided for under the Act. Top priority will be given to the issue of 



<P>
<P><I>14 Dec 1998 : Column: 337</I><P>
certificates for those seeking positions that will involve regular unsupervised access to children. The scheme is to be self-financing with all applicants for certificates being charged a fee which, depending on the level of certificate sought, is currently estimated at being between &#163;5 and &#163;10.
<P>

<a name="81214w08.html_para1">We expect that it will take some two years to equip the SCRO for the new much expanded system of checks. In this time we intend to consult widely in order to ensure that the system will meet the needs of the community it serves.

<a name="81214w09.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Licences to export arms are issued by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (DTI). The Export Control Organisation of the DTI is the licensing authority. A number of Departments provide advice; DFID has done so since September 1997. The Department for International Development's (DFID) interest in export licence applications is primarily that the proposed export does not seriously undermine the economy of the recipient country; and also that the equipment is not used for purposes of internal repression or external aggression. We focus our efforts on examining applications to poor countries.

<a name="81214w09.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Our commitment is to reduce poverty through sustainable development. We work with governments who have a commitment to working for the elimination of poverty. This requires effective economic management, efficient government systems, the reduction of corruption, and investment in human development. We engage in dialogue with government where possible. 



<P>
<P><I>14 Dec 1998 : Column: 340</I><P>
Where we cannot work with government we will find other channels including parts of government, local government and NGOs which share our commitment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w09.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We believe that increasing trade in the poorest countries will contribute to economic growth and poverty elimination. The Department for International Development (DFID) works to improve the trading environment by encouraging open markets, good regulation, reduced corruption and strong education and health systems.
<P>

<a name="81214w09.html_para0">We support specific trade and investment initiatives where there is a clear development outcome. For example DFID is promoting links between UK small and medium enterprises and small businesses in South Africa.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w09.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We have greatly strengthened the links between the department and British business since May 1997. We have established a Business Partnership Unit for this purpose and now consult with Business when preparing our strategies for working with individual countries or multilateral development agencies: we also seek to improve the operating environment for investment and trade (for example, through consultative forums on regulatory constraints); help business meet their corporate responsibility objectives (for example, through joint projects to tackle social and environmental issues and invest in the health and education of the workforce) and through partnerships which deepen the impact of business on the local economy (for example, through projects to help large business source from local suppliers). These initiatives all contribute to sustainable development and assist British businesses to invest and trade with the poorest countries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w09.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The White Paper on International Development (Cm 3789), published in November of last year, announced the abolition of the Aid and Trade Provision (ATP) and set out our policy on possible assistance to the private sector in paragraph 2.35. Any potential assistance would be subject to the strategy and sectoral focus agreed for each country and the standard procedures for quality control. We also made clear that all ATP projects previously agreed and still under implementation would be completed. This policy applies in China and elsewhere.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what progress she has made in the promotion of human rights in China; and if she will make a statement.  [63845]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w09.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Government seek to support all the human rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in China and elsewhere, which means that we are concerned with economic and social rights as well as civil and political rights. We are engaged in dialogue with the Chinese authorities and have increased the frequency of formal talks. These have provided the opportunity for us to raise concerns about issues such as China's one child policy, imprisonment without trial, freedom of religion and executions.
<P>

<a name="81214w09.html_para1">As an additional means to addressing the economic and social rights of poor people in China, we are currently designing a range of projects (in basic health, education and water development) with a probable value of some &#163;40 million. Meanwhile, we have approved a &#163;670,000 project to help improve the lives of orphaned children in Shanghai through the introduction of a foster care system and are exploring the scope for further co-operation in the field of prison management reform and measures to combat corruption.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w09.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 In preparing the China country strategy, my officials sought the views of companies with interests in China through the China Britain Trade Group and the British Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. Views were also sought from institutions, including the International Finance Corporation and the Commonwealth Development Corporation, which have strong private sector interests. In addition to the private sector, officials consulted civil society organisations, the academic community and a wide range of Chinese interlocutors.

 Consultations with the private sector and other elements of civil society have been part of the process of developing country strategies since May 1997. The channels used vary depending on country circumstances. Country strategy papers which have been finalised since the Government's White Paper on Development contain an annexe which sets out the process of consultation, including consultation that has taken place with the private sector. The papers are published and are also available in the Libraries of the House. They are also available to the public.

<a name="81214w10.html_para3">Following devolution, the question of whether or not expenditure by UK Ministers is ultra vires will rest primarily with those Ministers acting on the advice of their Accounting Officers. In the unlikely even that there is a disagreement over whether such funding is ultra vires for UK Ministers, as defined by both primary and secondary legislation, the disagreement would usually be resolved through discussion between the relevant administrations. Failing this, the final arbiter would be the courts.

The responses to that paper are currently being evaluated. Once that process is complete the Government will be in a position to consider with the broadcasters the next steps towards extending digital services across the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what action he has taken to increase access to Lottery funds for former coalfield communities in the East Midlands.  [62157]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 I recognise that certain areas, including coalfields communities, have done less well than others from Lottery funding. My Department hosted a conference in Barnsley on 10 November to discuss how the Lottery can assist in the regeneration of the coalfields. In addition, we are working with the distributors to investigate the reasons for the low take-up of funds in many coalfield areas.
<P>

<a name="81214w13.html_para0">The National Lottery Act 1998 contains a number of measures designed to bring about a fairer and more equitable distribution of funds across all regions and parts of the UK. It requires distributors to examine the needs of their sectors systematically and to draw up strategic plans which reflect those needs and their proposals for addressing them; it gives distributors new powers to encourage specific applications which do not come forward spontaneously; and it enables them to delegate decision-making closer to the grass roots and to enter into joint schemes.
<P>

<a name="81214w13.html_para1">All of these measures will help to deliver more Lottery money to coalfield areas.

The Home Office and the National Neighbourhood Watch Association are working jointly to achieve these improvements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w13.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In order to implement Part V of the Police Act 1997, we will set up the Criminal Records Bureau. The Bureau will be established in Merseyside under the management of the United Kingdom Passport Agency, which has a proven track record of discreet delivery of a large application driven service. Appropriate use will be made of public private partnerships to contain set up and running costs, but the core work of examining records and issuing certificates will be handled by civil servants within the Bureau. Once established, it will be self financing through charging for each certificate to be issued as provided for under the 1997 Act. All applicants for certificates will be required to pay a fee which, depending on the level of certificate sought, we estimate will cost between five and ten pounds.
<P>

<a name="81214w13.html_para5">The Government's main objective in introducing these arrangements is to strengthen the safeguards for the protection of children. In line with this, and to ensure a smooth transition from the current arrangements for employment vetting checks of police records, the Bureau will phase in the issue of the three types of certificate provided for under the Act. Top priority will be given to the issue of certificates for those seeking positions which involve regularly caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of persons aged under 18. The Government are no less concerned about the need for similar safeguards to protect vulnerable adults; extending these arrangements to this area will require careful consideration and consultation.
<P>

<a name="81214w13.html_para6">We estimate that it will take some two years to establish the Bureau. In this time, we intend to consult widely on all aspects of the Bureau's operation to ensure that it meets the needs of the community.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We will be spending &#163;248 million more on legal aid over the next three years than the previous Government intended. In addition, we will refocus those resources on areas of greatest need, such as social welfare and public interest work, and will achieve the maximum value for the resources available. Removing legal aid where a suitable alternative exists, and the greater control of cost that the reforms will bring, will enable us to devote more funds to these areas. As a first step, the Lord Chancellor recently announced the allocation of a minimum of &#163;20m for the expansion of advice and assistance services provided by the not-for-profit sector. In addition, more people in future will be able to get advice and assistance, by allowing in people who can afford to pay a contribution but who are entirely excluded now on financial grounds. The extension in July of conditional fee agreements to all civil cases will also greatly improve access to justice for people who cannot themselves afford legal help and do not qualify for legal aid.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on his policy on emergency treatment fees in the NHS for road accidents.  [63163]<P>

 We intend to end collection of the Emergency Treatment Fee by National Health Service trusts. An amendment to section 158 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, removing the right of NHS trusts to the Fee, is contained in the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Bill which was introduced in the House on 27 November 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will estimate the cost to the NHS of making rigid containers for clinical waste mandatory.  [63162]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 It is not possible to estimate the cost to the National Health Service of making rigid containers for clinical waste mandatory.
<P>

<a name="81214w15.html_para0">The requirement to provide rigid containers for clinical waste results from a European Community Directive. The Directive only applies where clinical waste is transported on public road or rail. This is then the responsibility of the waste contractor. However, if the contractor is faced with increased costs to replace containers, this is likely to be reflected in the contract price charged to the trust. Industry is looking into whether their existing systems meet these requirements. The outcome of this is awaited.

 Consultants from a number of different specialties are involved in the care of patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis. Since February 1995, the Specialty Workforce Advisory Group (SWAG) has been advising the Government about the numbers of doctors in higher specialist training needed in all Hospital and Community Health Service specialties to meet estimated requirements for consultants four to six years hence. SWAG's planning process takes account of the views of the National Health Service and the medical profession about service needs. It is for NHS trusts and health authorities to determine locally how the consultants, produced following national workforce planning, are deployed.

The Department is reviewing its programmes, including research components, in the light of the Scotland Act. It is too early to provide a clear picture of the extent to which programme expenditure which is currently administered by the Department may relate to functions which will transfer to Scottish Ministers. Work is taking place to establish the extent of any such expenditure and to assess the need for any consequential transfer of funds to the Scottish Ministers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w15.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mandelson  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 8 December 1998]:</i> During the development of the Millennium Experience project, prior to the establishment of the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC), the Millennium Commission invited companies to tender to provide independent consultancy advice on the achievability of the sponsorship target and to quote their rates for raising sponsorship. IMG were the lowest bidder on both counts. Subsequent negotiations of the detail of the contract for raising sponsorship were conducted from late February 1997, by Millennium Central (the previous name of the NMEC). The key terms of the contract were reported to the House in my answers to the hon. Member for Herstmere (Mr. Clappison) on 17 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>324</i> and the right hon. Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude) on 17 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>327</i>. At that stage both the NMEC and the Millennium Experience project were still in development--the sponsorship task; the nature of the offer to potential sponsors; and the overall sponsorship strategy had yet to be finally decided. Subsequent refinements of the task impacted on the nature of the work IMG were required to undertake. At the same time, NMEC's own in-house Commercial Department grew in expertise and strength. They are now well placed to deliver the remaining sponsorship necessary to meet the target of &#163;150 million.
<P>

<a name="81214w15.html_para3">In light of these developments, the NMEC and IMG have over the last few months been considering the terms of their original agreement. The parties have decided to terminate the arrangement by mutual agreement and NMEC have recorded their appreciation for the considerable contribution IMG has made to the project. The Legal documentation is currently being concluded. Details of the termination are commercially confidential. However, the fee payable to IMG represents the value of their support for, and assistance with, the NMEC's sponsorship work to date and is significantly less than the prospective fee of &#163;9 million which I reported to the House on 17 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>324</i>.

 The Code of Practice on Access to Government Information is the benchmark by which we make public details of competitive tendering. The Department would not normally make known the names of individual bidders participating in such an exercise. It would be generally considered to prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of such persons. However if we were asked to reveal the names we would consult each of the companies involved and ask whether they were content for their identity to be revealed. If the companies wished their names to remain confidential we could not release this information unless there were an overriding public interest.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The 0800 nine-digit range was allocated by BT to itself in the time of its monopoly before 1984. When Oftel took over the administration of the Numbering Scheme from BT in 1994 unused portions ("blocks") of the 0800 nine digit range were recovered from BT and issued as ten digit numbers to other operators. BT has currently allocated over 80 per cent. of the 0800 nine digit capacity. No other operator has 0800 nine digit capacity.
<P>

<a name="81214w16.html_para3">Because of BT's dominance in its holding of 0800 numbers BT was required to stop allocating new nine digit numbers to their customers from July 1997. Since that date BT has been issuing 0800 ten digit numbers out of allocations made to them by Oftel. The remaining unused 0800 nine digit numbers cannot be made available to other operators under current arrangements as they are in BT blocks. They therefore remain frozen pending the outcome of the current Oftel consultation on freephone numbers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w16.html_wqn7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on forthcoming changes to the Hallmarking Act 1973.  [64080]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The Hallmarking (Hallmarking Act Amendment) Regulations and the Hallmarking (Hallmarking Act Amendment) Order 1998 were laid in Parliament on Friday 4 December 1998.
<P>

<a name="81214w16.html_para6">These will align UK law with EU single market rules whilst ensuring that UK manufacturers can remain competitive at home and in Europe. The specific changes are as follows:
<P>

<a name="81214w16.html_para7">Section 2 of the Act is amended so as to recognise certain hallmarks from other European countries as "approved hallmarks". This follows a 1994 European Court of Justice Judgment in the case of Houtwipper (Case C-293/93) which ruled that Member States which prohibited the sale of articles of precious metal not hallmarked in accordance with national laws would not be in breach of single market rules provided that such articles did not already bear hallmarks struck by an independent body in accordance with the legislation of the exporting Member State, containing information which was equivalent to that provided by the hallmarks of the importing Member State and which was intelligible to consumers in that Member State. As a result, articles of precious metal bearing hallmarks which meet these criteria will be able to be offered for sale in the UK without, as previously, having to be re-hallmarked.




<P>
<P><I>14 Dec 1998 : Column: 367</I><P>

<P>

<a name="81214w16.html_para8">The distinction between UK manufactured articles and imports is to be ended so that the same marks will be struck on both UK and imported articles. This, also, is designed to align UK law with single market rules.
<P>

<a name="81214w16.html_para9">The range of finenesses to which articles can be hallmarked in the UK is increased to include new standards (both higher and lower) in addition to those traditionally recognised in the UK. This will ensure that UK manufacturers can compete on an equal basis with European counterparts. Consumers also stand to benefit from being able to purchase a wider range of items of jewellery and other precious articles of a standard of purity which could not previously be sold as precious articles in the UK.
<P>

<a name="81214w16.html_para10">The fineness of UK hallmarked articles will from now on be expressed millesimally. This means that the striking of traditional marks such as the crown for gold and the orb for platinum will become voluntary. This change will make hallmarks more readily understandable to consumers. This is especially important in view of the new increased range of finenesses.
<P>

<a name="81214w16.html_para11">The requirement for the date letter to be struck alongside traditional UK hallmarks is ended although the date letter can continue to be struck on a voluntary basis. This change will place UK manufacturers on an equal footing with their European competitors.
<P>

<a name="81214w16.html_para12">Finally, the date before which articles are exempt from hallmarking will be changed from 1900 to 1920 in response to concerns within the antiques trade about the inability to auction in the UK fine art works made between 1900 and 1920 which do not bear approved hallmarks.

<a name="81214w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The Low Pay Commission took evidence on current practice on the provision of board and lodging during its consultation exercise on the national minimum wage. It recommended that a maximum figure of &#163;20 per week, which was not intended to be a commercial valuation, should be set for any deduction for the cost of accommodation provided by an employer. The draft national minimum wage regulations provide that, when assessing compliance with the national minimum wage, the maximum offset allowable for accommodation provided by the employer will be &#163;2.85 per day.

 Since November this year, an extra &#163;2.50 a week has been made available to less well off families with children under age 11, through the income-related benefits. This is on top of the largest ever increase in Child Benefit for eldest or only children, up &#163;2.95 a week from next April. A simultaneous increase in the family premium, from &#163;11.05 to &#163;13.90, will ensure that those on income-related benefits receive the full amount of the Child Benefit increase.
<P>

<a name="81214w18.html_para3">In June 1998, two enhancements were introduced to the childcare disregard scheme in the in-work benefits (Family Credit, Disability Working Allowance, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit). The maximum amount of weekly childcare costs allowed was increased from &#163;60 to &#163;100 for families who incur childcare costs for two or more children of qualifying age, and the age limit for children was extended by one year to the September following the child's 12th birthday. These families will receive further help next October through the introduction of Working Families Tax credit and associated childcare tax credit.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1998]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has received a number of representations about the circumstances of individual mature students. The main source of support for full-time students is the student support system; mandatory awards, student loans and Access Funds. There are additional allowances as part of the mandatory award for students with dependants. These allowances are increased for single students with dependants and for students who have to maintain a second home whilst studying. They will be retained as supplementary grants when 100 per cent. loans for maintenance costs are introduced in 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="81214w20.html_para0">Most full-time students are excluded from entitlement to benefits such as Income Support and Housing Benefit. Some benefits continue to be made available to certain students in vulnerable groups, including students who are solely responsible for a child. Partners of students who are not full-time students themselves may claim benefits on behalf of the couple. In assessing entitlement to benefit, the Benefits Agency and/or the relevant local authority will take account of all income available to the student, including the maintenance grant and student loan.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on the Government's plans to monitor the impact of the new student funding system on recruitment to higher education institutions of students studying for professions allied to medicine and pre-clinical medicine.  [62640]<P>

<P>
<a name="81214w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 Responsibility for the support arrangements for new students on courses in the professions allied to medicine and for students on nursing and midwifery courses transferred to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health in September this year. I understand that his Department is monitoring the effectiveness of student support for the professions allied to medicine in safeguarding supply. Also from September 1998, arrangements for supporting new medical and dental students became a shared responsibility with the Department of Health. These students will be supported under the main student support system for the first four years of their course and by the Department of Health from year 5 onwards. Medicine has always been a popular subject which is heavily over-subscribed and the situation will continue to be closely monitored by the Department of Health.
<P>

<a name="81214w20.html_para1">Extensive analysis is underway to assess and monitor the impact of our new higher education funding policies in general, using application and entrant data. A range of ongoing and planned research projects will also examine participation in higher education. A combination of internal and external studies will be undertaken.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what steps the Government are taking to ensure local co-ordination between the Single Regeneration Budget and the New Deal.  [62343]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81214w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1998]:</i> The guidelines for Round 5 of the Single Regeneration Budget required bidders to show how their proposals would support national policies and programmes to improve employability. Bidders should also clearly show how the SRB contribution will promote synergy by reinforcing or adding value to other publicly funded programmes.
<P>

<a name="81214w20.html_para3">Government Offices for the Regions have been asked to consider with potential bidders how far their proposals can support and increase the effectiveness of the New Deals and other aspects of the Welfare to Work programme.
<P>

<a name="81214w20.html_para4">Outline bids have now been received and Government Offices will be assessing the links with national programmes including New Deal. The Employment Service will be involved in the assessment of these bids.

 We have made clear that where extra classrooms are needed to meet the class size limit, LEAs should provide permanent and not temporary classrooms. Plans will not be approved where these rely simply on the use of temporary accommodation.

<P>
<a name="81214w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 In our response to the Dearing Report on Higher Education in February 1998 we said that a better balance is needed in higher education between teaching, research and scholarship. Guidance to the Higher Education Funding Council for England issued on 8 December said that we expect the Council to promote and enhance high quality teaching and learning and welcomed the Council's proposals to set aside &#163;30m for promoting and rewarding high quality in teaching. It also welcomed the Council's involvement in the preparation for an

 Matters on expenditure in Wales are for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales. Local education authorities (LEAs) in England are asked each year to return confirmation of their spending in the previous financial year on projects supported through the Schools Access Initiative and to identify individual projects which have been carried out. Expenditure on such projects by LEAs and by grant maintained schools in England is subject to their normal external audit arrangements.

The estimated contribution by students and parents is &#163;163 million, which after allowance for the costs of collection and any default, will be received as income by institutions.

<a name="81214w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) settlement announced on 14 July 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 187-194, allocated a total Welsh budget of &#163;7,812 million, &#163;8,223 million and &#163;8,666 million for 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02 respectively. This provides for an average annual increase of 5.3 per cent. over the three years. I have now reached my decisions on how the budget should be allocated. In reaching these decisions, I took into account the views we received on the CSR consultation paper issued in September, and I would like to thank those who responded to the paper.
<P>

<a name="81214w22.html_para15">I have decided to allocate significant additional resources to health and education to deliver our Manifesto commitments on class sizes, education standards and health waiting lists. These are our priorities because they are the people's priorities. There are also real terms increases for key issues like tackling social exclusion, improving the economic prosperity of Wales and for other

important programmes. The allocations will provide an excellent start to the National Assembly for Wales.
<P>

<a name="81214w22.html_para16">For the NHS, I have allocated the indicative cash sums announced at the time of the CSR settlement in July-- an extra &#163;1.030 billion over the next three years. This is an average increase of 6.4 per cent. (3.9 per cent. in real terms) each year. As well as enabling us to meet our manifesto commitments on reducing waiting lists, these allocations will also secure other important service improvements.
<P>

<a name="81214w22.html_para17">For Education and Training, I am allocating more than the indicative figures announced at the time of the CSR. I am increasing the education and training budgets by &#163;844 million over the three years, an extra &#163;1,000 per pupil/student in Wales. This is an average annual increase of 7 per cent. (4.5 per cent. real) over the next three years. The increase fulfils our manifesto pledges to make education our first priority. Over &#163;70 million of the local government revenue settlement will be for education and we will expect local authorities to increase education spending by at least this amount. The increase in resources will fund an additional 28,000 students in Further Education, and an extra 8,000 students in Higher Education, by 2001-02.
<P>

<a name="81214w22.html_para18">I have already announced, at column <i>390</i>, the provisional settlement for local government and the police. The settlement allows for an extra &#163;868 million in extra spending on services by Welsh local authorities over the next 3 years, net of specific grants. In addition, Welsh councils will be able to invest some &#163;1.2 billion in capital projects over the next 3 years.
<P>

<a name="81214w22.html_para19">We have set ambitious targets for improving the economic prosperity of Wales in 'Pathway to Prosperity'. I have increased provision for economic measures by &#163;134 million over the period. The new Welsh Development Agency will have a gross programme of over &#163;200 million in 1999-2000. We are also increasing our support for small businesses. I am allocating an extra &#163;1 million each year to the Wales Tourist Board to help promote tourism activities associated with the Rugby World Cup and Millennium promotions. On transport, we will begin to address the priorities on roads set out in 'Driving Wales Forward'. We will also be announcing substantially increased support for local authorities' Integrated Transport Packages.
<P>

<a name="81214w22.html_para20">I am also setting up a special fund which will enable the Assembly to continue to improve Wales's economic prosperity.
<P>

<a name="81214w22.html_para21">Social inclusion and tackling poverty is another of the Government's priorities and I am allocating an extra &#163;87 million over the period to help regenerate the poorest communities and to help the most vulnerable members of society. I am allocating provision of &#163;25 million for Sure Start to begin a major programme to improve the life chances of very young children, especially the children of families living in the more disadvantaged areas. We will be encouraging measures to promote access to education and 'second chance' opportunities for training. I also want to encourage joint working across a number of

programmes and organisations and I am setting aside funds for the Assembly to decide how it wishes to pursue these objectives.
<P>

<a name="81214w22.html_para22">I have already announced resources to ensure that the new Tir Gofal agri-environmental scheme will be properly funded, thereby meeting another of our Manifesto Commitments. We are also putting extra money into the Welsh Food Strategy.
<P>

<a name="81214w22.html_para23">Arts and sport in Wales is an area where provision in recent years has been cut in real terms. These programmes add to the economic and social well being of our community and I have allocated additional resources in each of the next 3 years to provide real growth.




<P>
<P><I>14 Dec 1998 : Column: 394</I><P>

<P>

<a name="81214w22.html_para24">Finally, I have allocated additional resources to meet the cost of the Assembly. This includes the capital cost of the Assembly buildings and in the first year the cost of the Assembly elections.
<P>

<a name="81214w22.html_para25">In addition to the CSR settlement, the Welsh budget will receive at least an extra &#163;75 million during 2000-01 and 2001-02 from the Government's Capital Modernisation Fund; these moneys will be used to fund innovative capital projects, such as housing initiatives, schools and hospitals. The allocations to the main programmes are set out in the following tables.
<P>

<a name="81214w22.html_para26">It is my intention to discuss the details of the allocations at a sitting of the Welsh Grand Committee on 16 December.

Under Criterion Two of the EU Code we assess the attitude of the recipient country of the proposed export to relevant principles established by international human rights instruments, and exercise special caution and vigilance in issuing licences to countries where serious violations of human rights have been established by the competent bodies of the UN, the Council of Europe or by the EU. We will not issue an export licence if there is a clearly identifiable risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression.

 North Korea's Framework Agreement with the US commits it to freezing its Nuclear Reactor programme, and to allowing IAEA to inspect its nuclear waste sites. But we remain concerned that the IAEA is still not receiving full co-operation from North Korea. North Korea's decision in October to allow the IAEA to restart canning operations at a frozen reactor was a positive step. But it is essential that North Korea implements the IAEA Safeguards Agreement at the earliest possible opportunity, in order to give the international community confidence that it is complying in full.

 UK business has indeed achieved a series of important successes in Vietnam. UK investment in the country has risen by 50 per cent. in 1998. Foster Wheeler Energy Ltd. have recently won an important contract, worth some $15 million, as front-end engineering design consultants for the planned $1.5 billion Dung Quat oil refinery in Vietnam. The award of this contract against stiff competition is a major success. We expect Foster Wheeler's involvement to lead to substantial further business--worth perhaps several hundred million pounds--in the refinery for UK suppliers. The firm has also secured a $2 million contract to run and maintain PetroVietnam Gas Corporation's operations in Vung Tau.
<P>

<a name="81214w25.html_para3">Cable & Wireless received a $207 million investment licence in August to install 250,000 telephone lines in Hanoi, during the visit of my hon.

<a name="81214w25.html_para4">These successes follow several years of persistent efforts in support of would-be British investors in Vietnam not only by the companies themselves, but also by our diplomatic posts in Vietnam, by visiting UK Ministers, and by DTI and FCO officials.

 The Meat Hygiene Service, an Agency of MAFF, enforces the SRM controls on a day to day basis in licensed slaughterhouses and cutting plants. In all other premises approved under the SRM legislation, the controls are enforced by local authorities. In addition, the State Veterinary Service carries out regular unannounced independent audit visits to all premises approved under the legislation to monitor the extent of compliance. The inspection figures for the 12 month period to the end of October 1998 show that 4,096 visits were made to abattoirs in Great Britain. At 4,074 of these visits (99.5 per cent.), the handling and disposal of SRM were found to be fully satisfactory. No cases have been found of bovine spinal cord not being fully removed from carcases in licensed slaughterhouses in Great Britain since March 1996.

 The European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) carry out a number of missions each year to look at member states' and third countries' procedures and establishments. These missions involve audits of the bodies responsible for consumer health protection and include inspections of some individual processing premises. In addition, some member states who traditionally have carried out their own audits of third countries' procedures and establishments may continue to do so, either for products for which import rules are not yet harmonised across the Community or to complement the Commission's programme. MAFF staff are hoping to visit Brazil and Thailand early in the near year to carry out audits of the public health controls on poultry meat and poultry meat products.
<P>

<a name="81214w26.html_para1">The Commission are in the process of expanding the FVO so that it can carry out inspections in all third countries to verify that their establishments comply with Community provisions. As an interim measure, it has been agreed by the Council of Ministers that, for products of animal origin other than fresh meat, guarantees of conformity with Community provisions for the protection of public and animal health may, until 1 January 2001, be given by the competent authority of the third country concerned.

 All consignments of fresh meat imported into the UK, whether from other EU Member States or third countries, must have been produced in accordance with the harmonised Community rules laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC. Among other things, this Directive sets out the licensing, structural and veterinary supervision requirements to be applied in abattoirs, cutting plants and cold stores. Slaughterhouses in third countries have to comply with standards at least equivalent to those laid down in the Directive before they can export to the EU. The European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office are responsible for carrying out inspections in member states and in the third countries from which fresh meat is imported into the Community. If necessary, the Commission will take infraction proceedings against Member States whose arrangements are considered inadequate.
<P>

<a name="81214w26.html_para12">All consignments of animal products imported into the European Union from third countries are subject to checks at designated B order Inspection Posts (BIPs). Community law requires every consignment to be subject to a documentary and identity check. For poultry meat and poultry meat products, other than from countries with which the Community has equivalence agreements, the minimum frequency laid down in Community law for physical checks is 50 per cent. of consignments. For pork and beef and related products the minimum frequency for physical checks is 20 per cent. European Commission guidance states that at least 1 per cent. of consignments which are subject to physical checks at Border Inspection Posts should be randomly sampled for residues, contaminants and bacteria such as salmonella and coliforms. Single Market rules only permit random-spot checks at the final destination on products from other Member States and on products from third countries that have passed through a BIP.

 <i>[holding answer 10 December 1998]:</i> The Ministry funds research to underpin its policy objectives.

The Ministry paid some &#163;8 million for research projects in Scotland in 1997-98, including projects carried out at Research Council institutes and universities. Post-devolution, the Ministry and the Scottish Office Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department will continue to co-operate fully, through the Funders' Group arrangements, to ensure that R&D funded by both departments remains closely co-ordinated and that the results are shared.

 The Government are not aware of any formal proposal to suspend the operation of the stabiliser applied under the EU regime for sheepmeat. The right to propose amendments to EU secondary legislation rests solely with the European Commission. Were the Commission to propose the suspension of the sheepmeat stabiliser, we would not support such a proposal, in view of its serious implications for both UK and EU expenditure.

 In 1997, the latest year for which data are available, direct payments to UK farmers amounted to some 8% of the total CAP budget. Of this total, 50% were arable payments, 48% livestock (including BSE related payments) and 2% agri-environment and other payments. These figures exclude market support measures such as export refunds which also benefit UK farmers but are not paid directly to them.
