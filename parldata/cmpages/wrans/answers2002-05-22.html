<P>
<a name="20522w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 I attended the EU-Latin American and Caribbean Summit in Madrid on 17 May, with my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.
<P>

<a name="20522w01.html_para1">The summit was a significant further step towards closer relations with Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. We discussed important issues, notably terrorism and sustainable development, which affect us all and on which inter-regional co-operation is essential. The summit also made good progress on liberalising trade between Europe and Latin America, welcoming completion of negotiations on an EU/Chile Association Agreement, and agreeing to press forward with an EU/Mercosur Association Agreement. In addition, the summit decided to take concrete new steps in the development of EU/Andean and EU/central American relations.
<P>

<a name="20522w01.html_para2">I was also pleased to see Caribbean concerns recognised&#151;the result of effective engagement in the summit and its preparations by many Caribbean countries. We have worked with the Caribbean to ensure that they are now playing a full part in the summit and that their voice is heard.

<a name="20522w01.html_para37">The mandate of the Standing Committee is contained in Article 18 of the noise emission in the environment by equipment for use outdoors Directive, 2000/14/EC.

Officials of the European Commission chair these meetings with a view to providing advice based on consensus in order to ensure that there is uniform interpretation of the directive throughout the European Union and also to ensure that any technical barriers to trade within the Single Market are removed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20522w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has protected zone status for Colorado beetle, making it an offence for the beetle to be moved into the country. To support this the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate in England and Wales and the similar inspectorates in Scotland and Northern Ireland inspect imports of plants and plant produce to ensure that the beetle, as well as many other pests and diseases, are not present. Added to this is the long-running campaign to promote and maintain a high level of public awareness of the beetle. This is instrumental in ensuring that members of the public, as well as importers and port operators, report findings of the beetle. These measures have all helped to prevent the Colorado beetle entering and establishing in the UK. Should an outbreak be detected, the Department has contingency plans to contain and eradicate the pest.

[57454]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20522w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In Lancashire, in common with the rest of the country, the farmgate price of milk has been falling for the last two months. The most recent official figures show that for milk delivered in March the average farmgate price of milk in the UK had fallen to 18.04 pence per litre. However, we expect the average milk price paid to farmers (in May) for milk delivered in April to fall substantially, reflecting the price cuts announced by many purchasers and reported widely in the trade press.
<P>

<a name="20522w02.html_para3">The reasons for this fall are complex, but it is principally due to unusually high production in the UK so far this year, which has lead to severe competition between milk purchasers to find customers, at a time of weak world and Community markets for dairy commodities. The Government cannot, of course, prevent such overproduction and negotiations between farmers and purchasers, purchasers and their customers, or indeed, processors and supermarkets, are a commercial matter in which the Government cannot get involved. The Government can, however, influence the environment in which price negotiations take place through the Milk and Milk Products Management Committee and we have supported measures taken in Brussels to support EU markets and encourage exports.
<P>

<a name="20522w02.html_para4">The Department received representations from the industry on the payment of agrimoney aid to the dairy sector. While we acknowledge the difficulties that the sector is facing and are working with them on the recommendations of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food, and the Milk Task Force, we decided not to make a claim for these funds given the many competing demands on the Exchequer at present.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20522w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 All pesticides used in this country, including Atrazine, must be approved by Ministers. Approval is only granted following thorough scientific evaluation of the risk that the pesticide might pose to people, wildlife and to the wider environment. Only if this evaluation shows that there is no unacceptable risk will approval be granted.
<P>

<a name="20522w03.html_para0">Both the UK and the EU systems for regulating pesticides contain routine review programmes of older pesticides to ensure they meet current safety standards. Atrazine is currently being reviewed as part of the EU programme with the UK acting as Rapporteur Member State. The review covers both the possible effects of Atrazine on human health and the environment. The UK's report on Atrazine is currently being considered by the EU Standing Committee on Plant Health with particular attention being given to the levels of Atrazine found in ground water.
<P>

<a name="20522w03.html_para1">In the UK restrictions were placed on the agricultural uses of Atrazine in 1992 as there had been widespread breaches of the EU Drinking Water Directive's limit. However, the levels found did not endanger the health of consumers or damage the environment.

<P>
<a name="20522w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government no longer holds strategic reserves of food. The availability of staple foodstuffs and plans to handle emergency situations are kept under review at regular meetings between officials and food industry representatives. The fuel crisis of 2000 was a good example of Government and industry working together to ensure the distribution of food in an emergency situation.

Eurostar has made it clear that while it has not been its policy to date to permit the animals of any kind on its trains, it is keenly aware of the assistance that guide dogs bring to visually impaired passengers. The company has, for some time, been considering whether, and how, it might allow the carriage of assistance dogs on its trains. The Department is ready to advise it on how the company could meet the requirements of the Pet Travel Scheme.

 There is no reliable basis for estimating quantities of saithe discarded by all British registered vessels during 2001.

 The Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions administers a scheme under the Pneumoconiosis etc (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979.

 <i>[holding answer 16 May 2002]:</i> Different approaches to telecommunications planning apply in England and the devolved Administrations. In England, the installation of any telecommunications mast in protected areas, such as national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty, sites of special scientific interest and conservation areas, and of masts above 15 metres in height elsewhere, is subject to an application for planning permission for determination by the local planning authority. The installation of masts up to 15 metres in height, elsewhere, would be subject to a prior approval procedure under Part 24 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (as amended). The planning arrangements do not distinguish between different generations of telecommunications equipment. The devolved Administrations have their own planning regulations.

 We would like to see more children travelling to school by bus, especially where it is too far for them to walk or cycle or it is not safe for them to do so. There are currently two first yellow school bus pilots running in England with a further one due to start shortly in Wales. Once these pilot schemes have been running for about a year, they will be comprehensively evaluated by consultants working for my Department. Depending on the results of this evaluation, we will then consider whether we wish to encourage wider take-up of yellow school bus schemes, and if so how we will go about doing it.

 Governing bodies of academies will comprise sponsors, or their representatives, and other stakeholders, including staff, parents and an LEA representative.

<a name="20522w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government do not dictate the detailed curriculum for teacher training. However, we do expect teacher training providers to ensure trainee teachers are properly prepared to meet the standards required for Qualified Teacher Status. These standards include being aware of the statutory framework relating to teachers' responsibilities&#151;which would include child protection legislation&#151;and identifying and supporting pupils experiencing behavioural and emotional difficulties, with the help of an experienced teacher. Trainee teachers are also expected to understand the role of other professionals&#151;including those responsible for child protection; to challenge harassment; and to work within schools' policies and procedures.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when he will publish the outcome of the study into the employment of women in the armed forces; and if he will make a statement.  [59012]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20522w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Women play a vital role in the armed forces. They have made, and continue to make, a valuable contribution to recent and current operations. The great majority of posts in the armed forces are already open to them. Only posts in the Royal Marines General Service, Household Cavalry, Royal Armoured Corps, the Infantry and Royal Air Force Regiment remain closed for reasons of combat effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="20522w11.html_para1">Following a detailed study into the performance and suitability of women in these close-combat roles, I have concluded that the case for lifting the current restrictions has not been made. I am today placing in the House of Commons Library the report of this study, entitled "Women in the Armed Forces", together with a short paper explaining the reasons for the decision.
<P>

<a name="20522w11.html_para2">Although women are, on average, less able to meet the physical demands of these roles, some women would certainly be able to do so and this was not, therefore, in itself, a reason to exclude them.
<P>

<a name="20522w11.html_para3">The key issue was whether the inclusion of women in close combat teams could adversely affect the combat effectiveness of those teams in a high-intensity direct fire battle. All the units in question operate primarily in small units as fire teams or tank crews.
<P>

<a name="20522w11.html_para4">The evidence available suggests that on operations other than close combat the presence of women in small units does not affect performance detrimentally. However, there is no evidence to show whether this remains the case under the extraordinary conditions of high intensity close combat.




<P>
<P><I>22 May 2002 : Column 364W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20522w11.html_para5">Given the lack of relevant direct evidence, from either field studies or the experience of other countries, I have concluded that military judgment must form the basis of the decision. The military advice is that under the conditions of a high-intensity, close-quarter battle, group cohesion becomes of much greater significance to team performance and, in such an environment, the consequences of failure can have far-reaching and grave consequences. To admit women, therefore, would involve a risk without any offsetting gains in terms of combat effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="20522w11.html_para6">The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 allows the armed forces to exclude women from close combat posts. The judgment of the European Court of Justice in Sirdar <i>v</i>. the Army Board and the Secretary of State and relevant European Community equality law uphold that position, subject to a requirement periodically to assess the position.
<P>

<a name="20522w11.html_para7">The Ministry of Defence is committed to equality of opportunity consistent with the need to maintain combat effectiveness. It will continue to work with the Equal Opportunities Commission and discuss with it the results of further work to examine the wider issues raised by this study. Women must have the same opportunities as men to progress to the highest ranks.

<a name="20522w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2002]:</i> As part of the Government's wider market initiative, RAF Strike Command is considering the feasibility for commercial exploitation of irreducible spare capacity at RAF Leuchars. No other airfields in Scotland have so far been considered. The RAF Leuchars study is at an early stage with the team currently examining whether commercial exploitation of irreducible spare capacity is feasible. As a part of this work, consultants have sought the views of the airline operator community; however, the detailed findings are commercially sensitive. The feasibility study has no remit to address the issue of what the costs might be for a commercial airline company to operate scheduled services from RAF Leuchars. Initial indications suggest that there might be some irreducible surplus airfield capacity at RAF Leuchars. However, until the Ministry of Defence formally seeks proposals from industry as part of an open and competitive process, my officials cannot fully evaluate the potential for the commercial exploitation at RAF Leuchars. A security assessment has not been undertaken at this stage of the feasibility study.
<P>

<a name="20522w12.html_para0">Some three weeks ago, Ryan Air expressed an interest in introducing new routes into Scotland, possibly using RAF airfields. Their formal proposals are awaited. No Ministry of Defence Minister or official has met representatives of commercial airline companies to discuss the commercial use of RAF stations in Scotland. Apart from occasional use by civil air operators permitted by existing MOD regulations, no formal proposals have been put forward by airline companies for the operation of scheduled services from any of the RAF stations located in Scotland.

Those which are not so required are disposed of, mainly by handing them back to Annington Homes Ltd., to whom the equity in the housing stock (in England and Wales) was sold in 1996.

Customs will be deploying more than 30 additional specialist anti- smuggling staff to combat a range of smuggling threats. Their first priority will be to enhance controls on flights arriving from Jamaica, focusing on identifying any couriers who have escaped detection in Jamaica and on the smuggling of cocaine in passengers' baggage and air freight.

 The threshold of profitability referred to in the paper is not a cash figure. It is based on a measure of profitability expressed as the ratio of net present value to the pre-tax cost of the investment. The precise threshold of this ratio up to which net present value of projects is improved depends on various factors such as the discount rate used by the investor. But in general, projects below the threshold are likely to be the more marginal ones; those above threshold the more economically attractive ones.

1. The data are from the Family Resources Survey 1999&#150;2000 and are rounded to the nearest &#163;1 or 10,000.<P>

2. Estimates are for pensioner units. Pensioner units are defined as single (non-cohabiting) people over state pension age (65 and over for men, 60 and over for women) and couples (married or cohabiting) where the man is over state pension age.<P>

3. Pensioner units are allocated to age categories according to the age of the head. The head of a couple is defined as the man.<P>

4. Estimates have not been split by gender for couples as the extent of income sharing within pensioner units is not known.<P>

5. Means-tested benefits refer to minimum income guarantee, working families' tax credit, housing benefit, council tax benefit and social fund grants.<P>

6. These results are based on survey respondents' identification of different elements of benefit income, and are therefore subject to misreporting. <P>

<P>

<a name="20522w16.html_para0">The main purpose of such reciprocal agreements is to protect the social security position of workers moving between the two countries during their working lives. They prevent employees, their employers and the self-employed from having to pay social security contributions to both the home state and the state of employment at the same time and ensure that such workers' rights to certain benefits are maintained. They vary to some extent from country to country depending on the nature and scope of the other country's social security scheme. Generally, they cover contributory benefits in respect of the following contingencies: sickness, invalidity, unemployment, retirement, bereavement and industrial injuries. Workers who have contributed to both countries' schemes during their working lives can usually receive an old age pension from each country which reflects the proportionate amount or their insurance in, or contributions to, each country's scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the mandate of the Committee for the Implementation of the Multiannual Community Programme to stimulate the development and use of European digital content on the global networks and to promote linguistic diversity in the information society eContent is; how many times it has met over the last 12 months; what the UK representation on it is; what the annual cost of its work is to public funds; if she will list the items currently under its consideration; if she will take steps to increase its accountability and transparency to Parliament; and if she will make a statement.

 The Multiannual Community programme to stimulate the development and use of European digital content on the global networks and to promote the linguistic diversity in the information society (known as the eContent programme) was established under Council Decision 2001/48/EC. The Decision required the establishment of a committee, the mandate of which is to assist the Commission in running the programme. In particular the Committee will be informed of progress with the implementation of the programme as a whole on at least a half yearly basis. The Commission will also seek approval of the Committee for the funding of any projects with a Community contribution of over 700,000 euros. The Committee has met three times over the last 12 months. The UK representation is usually one official from the Department for Trade and Industry. It is not possible to calculate the cost to public funds of the work of the Committee without incurring disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="20522w16.html_para4">Current issues before the Committee are drawing up a new work programme for the second half of the programme and overseeing a mid-term evaluation of the programme. It will also be involved in preparing a call for proposals towards the end of the year.

 The trans-European telecommunications networks (TEN-Telecom) programme is part of the trans-European networks (TENs) initiative established under Article 156 of the treaty and is governed by the general rules for the granting of community aid in the field of trans-European networks (regulation 2236/95, amended by regulation 1655/99). In addition, regulation 1336/97 established a series of guidelines for trans-European telecommunications networks. Both regulations require the establishment of a committee, the mandate of which is to assist the Commission in the implementation of the regulations. The TENs financial committee relating to telecommunications and the TEN-Telecom guidelines committee have the same membership and meet in joint sittings.

<a name="20522w16.html_spnew21"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I am answering these questions together since the individual programmes mentioned are all activities which come under the EU's multiannual framework programme for actions in the energy sector (1998&#150;2002). The mandate for these activities is set out in Council Decision 1999/21/EC of 14 December 1998. One committee meets in six different configurations. The aim of the framework programme is to contribute to the balanced pursuit of the energy policy objectives of security of supply, competitiveness and protection of the environment. A list of related Decisions follows.
<P>

<a name="20522w16.html_para42">The role of the committee in the respective configurations is as follows: under the ALTENER Decision, the committee promotes renewable energy sources; under the SURE Decision the committee promotes safety of nuclear installations in countries supported by the EU's TACIS (Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States) programme; under the CARNOT Decision the committee promotes the development and effective use of clean solid fuel technologies; under the SYNERGY Decision the committee reinforces international energy co-operation with reference to improving security of energy supply and improving countries' abilities to meet their environmental obligations under the Kyoto Convention; and under the ETAP Decision the Committee undertakes a programme of studies, analyses, forecasts and other related work concerning the future development of energy policy within the Community.
<P>

<a name="20522w16.html_para43">Generally, the committee meets once per year in respect of each Decision. With the exceptions of its responsibilities under the ETAP Decision (for which there was no meeting in the period in question) and under the ALTENER and SAVE Decisions (on which the committee met twice combining the two subjects), the committee met to discuss each individual Decision once in the past 12 months (April 2001 to end of March 2002). Each meeting lasted one day with the exception of the second meeting on ALTENER/SAVE which lasted two days. Attendance is by an official from this Department with the exception of SAVE which is attended by an official from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The committee discussed issues relating to SURE in the same meeting as it discussed SYNERGY. These factors together make for a total of five meetings over the past year. It is not possible to calculate the cost to public funds of the work of the committee without incurring disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="20522w16.html_para44">There are two key items currently under the consideration of the Committee of the Energy Framework Programme. The first is the result of the mid-term evaluation of the programme (1998&#150;2002) carried out by independent experts. The second key item under the committee's consideration is the Commission's proposal for a Multiannual Programme for Action in the Field of Energy: "Intelligent Energy for European" Programme (2003&#150;06) (COM (2002) 162 FINAL. This is in large part a continuation of existing activities in the Energy Framework Programme (1998&#150;2002) though it would introduce also a new programme on the energy aspects of transport. In respect of SYNERGY, the committee will be considering applications for project support under the next SYNERGY tender later this year. The next meeting (to be arranged) in respect of ALTENER/SAVE will be considering the evaluation of the final call for proposals

There are no plans to include support for other forms of solar energy under this programme.

<a name="20522w17.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what rules are applied by the ECGD to the offer of export credit support where the British contribution to an export is less than 100 per cent.; what thresholds are required of British content where British content is less than 100 per cent.; whether those thresholds vary for different products and projects; who monitors the share of United Kingdom content; and what measures are used.  [58107]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20522w17.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2002]:</i> ECGD's main purpose is to facilitate the export of UK goods and services but few contracts involve 100 per cent. British content. ECGD determines the appropriate level of support for contracts of mixed national content on a case-by-case basis so it is difficult to generalise.
<P>

<a name="20522w17.html_para1">The factors to be taken into account include the precise breakdown of sourcing, and whether reinsurance arrangements or reciprocal agreements exist with other agencies. ECGD will stipulate the precise amount of foreign content to be supported for a particular transaction in its guarantee documentation. Compliance may be monitored by the bank financing the transaction or by ECGD's own auditors.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20522w17.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what her policy is towards export credit and the apportionment of liabilities, projects and equipment produced on a multi-national basis and which other European Union export credit agencies are involved.  [57518]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20522w17.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2002]:</i> ECGD considers each case on its merits in order to determine the level of support that is appropriate.
<P>

<a name="20522w17.html_para2">ECGD and other European Union export credit agencies can collaborate to support multi-national transactions in a number of ways. Increasingly, use is made of re-insurance between the agencies which often allows a single export credit guarantee or insurance policy to be issued for such a transaction by one agency acting as lead insurer. Liability is then borne by each of the other export credit agencies according to its re-insured share of the transaction.




<P>
<P><I>22 May 2002 : Column 401W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20522w17.html_para3">Sometimes each agency provides support for its own national content (possibly together with some non- national content) through the issues of separate guarantees or insurance.
<P>

<a name="20522w17.html_para4">European Union export credit agencies may also provide support for both their own national and each others national content under reciprocal arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20522w17.html_para5">Combinations of the above methods are also possible.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what criteria have to be met in order for a taxi journey by the Lord Chancellor to be paid for from public funds.  [53817]<P>

<P>
<a name="20522w19.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 In common with Ministers in other Departments, the Lord Chancellor normally uses a car provided through the Government Car Service and it would be exceptional for him to use a taxi for official business. A taxi might be used, and costs paid for from public funds, where a ministerial car was not available and considerations of urgency and security precluded the use of other means of transport.

<a name="20522w19.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 In common with Ministers in other Departments, the Lord Chancellor normally uses a car provided through the Government Car Service and he has scarcely ever used a taxi for official business. If a taxi was used, and costs paid for from public funds, it would be because a ministerial car was not available and considerations of urgency and security precluded the use of other means of transport. Separate records are not maintained of any taxi fares which, wholly exceptionally, might have been incurred by the Lord Chancellor.

 The figures provided in the answer of 7 May 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 72W, were for the number of new matter starts or hours allocated for the financial year 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2003. Solicitors' firms and not-for-profit organisations report their matter starts on a monthly basis, at the end of each month. It then takes up to one month for all the figures to be processed, so figures for April 2002 are not yet available. The figures for the whole of the financial year will not be known until after April 2003.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make a statement on promotion of open government.  [55928]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20522w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 With the Freedom of Information Act 2000 we have legislated to give to the people of this country, for the first time ever, a general statutory right to know. The timetable we have announced will ensure that full implementation of this new right is completed 11 months before the statutory deadline set out in the Act itself. The publication scheme provisions of the Act will be implemented first, on a rolling programme, starting with central Government in 2002. This roll out will be completed in June 2004 and the individual right of access to information held by all public authorities will be implemented in January 2005.
<P>

<a name="20522w20.html_para0">This approach will give public authorities the time they need to put into effect the change of culture necessary to ensure the legal rights are delivered in practice. It also aligns with the 2004 target for the completion of the Government's electronic records management. This initiative will enable the fast retrieval and accurate creation and storage of records that will be necessary to meet the demands of the Freedom of Information Act.
<P>

<a name="20522w20.html_para1">In his annual statutory report to Parliament in November 2001, the Lord Chancellor reported on the progress that had been made towards the implementation of the Act. In particular, he said that each Department had appointed a senior official to 'Champion' freedom of information within their Department and to lead culture change from the top of the organisation. Crucial developments are already taking place in the area of records management and Departments are preparing to meet the targets for the 2004 target for full electronic management of records. The Information Commissioner has already set up five pilot publication schemes with central Government organisation and I look forward to seeing similar pilots in local authorities and the police in the near future.
<P>

<a name="20522w20.html_para2">The report also announced the formation of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Group on Implementation of the Act. The group includes members from representative organisations from across the public sector and independent representatives to advise the Lord Chancellor on what users will need in order to take advantage of their rights under the Freedom of Information Act. It has already met twice and the next meeting will take place in July.
<P>

<a name="20522w20.html_para3">A seminar for Ministers was held in March of this year, where Ministers were reminded of their key role in delivering compliance with the Act and a new culture of openness. In particular, we noted that there should be a Minister in each Department with responsibility for

implementing freedom of information in that Department, its agencies and sponsored non-departmental public bodies; and those Ministers should take an active interest in the delivery of the Act within these Departments.
<P>

<a name="20522w20.html_para4">I have recently completed a series of road shows around the country to raise awareness of the Act at a senior level in public authorities. These events were attended by around 1,000 officials from across the public sector and officials in my Department intend to run a series of workshops in the autumn to follow-up these road shows.
<P>

<a name="20522w20.html_para5">This year's report, to be published in November, will contain further details of developments in all these areas. In the same month, publication schemes will come into force for central Government and other bodies already applying the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. These schemes will provide greater access to information for all members of the public.
<P>

<a name="20522w20.html_para6">Officials from the Freedom of Information and Data Protection Division in my Department have undertaken awareness-raising seminars and will continue to do so. These have been held in a wide range of Departments including: the Cabinet Office; the Home Office; the Department of Health; the Northern Ireland civil service as well as in my Department. Officials also speak at the civil service college course on freedom of information and have spoken on courses and conferences arranged by other organisations. In these sessions, officials are reminded of the requirement to comply with the existing Code of Practice on Access to Government Information when answering requests for information until the Freedom of Information Act comes fully into effect in January 2005.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, how many court houses have closed since 1997; and how many have had improvements made to them.  [54208]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20522w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 There have been 77 magistrates' court houses closed since 1997 in England and Wales, as set out in the table. Of the 404 magistrates' courts in England and Wales currently in operation, almost all have had improvements made to them in one way or another, for example, improvements to environmental systems or enhancements to enable compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act or Health and Safety legislation, including security provisions.
<P>

<a name="20522w20.html_para8">The Department is currently funding an ongoing programme of building works on magistrates' courts throughout England and Wales. It received a &#163;100 million capital grant allocation during the current Spending Review 2000 period for maintenance and other building enhancements. This is funding priority maintenance and improvement works such as facilities for victims and vulnerable witnesses, as well as Disability Discrimination Act and Security facilities. The grant provides 80 per cent. of the funding with a further 20 per cent. being provided by the local authority. There is also a public private partnership programme for the provision of new courts to 



<P>
<P><I>22 May 2002 : Column 411W</I><P>
meet the needs of a 21st century court system. &#163;210 million national credit approval (NCA) has been allocated over the CSR 2000 period.
<P>

<a name="20522w20.html_para9">There have been 15 county court closures since 1997 in England and Wales, as set out in the table. There are two county court closure proposals (Gravesend and Gateshead) under consideration, both of which have gone out to public consultation.
<P>

<a name="20522w20.html_para10">There have been no Crown court closures in England and Wales since 1997. There is, however, currently public consultation on the proposal to close the Crown court at Knutsford. Consultation commenced on 10 April and will run until the end of May.
<P>

<a name="20522w20.html_para11">There are 78 Crown court centres and 218 county courts (permanent) in England and Wales; many have had various renovation works undertaken. The nature of works covered varies but they include items such as health and safety works, security work, Disability Discrimination Act compliance and environmental improvements. In most instances these works have been undertaken within the scope of major maintenance schemes.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what her policy is on the release of papers from the Public Record Office relating to the royal family; how these rules differ according to whether the relevant member of the royal family is <i>(a)</i> alive and <i>(b)</i> dead; and what considerations as to the potential embarrassment caused by a release of papers apply in respect of (i) living and (ii) dead members of the royal family.  [55741]<P>

<P>
<a name="20522w21.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Gentleman to the answer I gave to him on 14 May 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 593W. It is for the originating Government Department to determine the release of papers relating to the royal family, wherever they are held. The policy under which this is conducted derives from the Open Government Code, which applies in the same way to public records relating to the royal family as it does to other public records. One of the Open Government criteria under which records may remain closed beyond 30 years covers documents whose release would cause 'substantial distress' either to an individual or to descendants of the individual. The inclusion of "descendants" means that the criterion may apply whether the relevant individual is alive or dead. Under the Open Government Code, 'potential embarrassment' is not a factor in determining closure or release.

<a name="20522w22.html_para1">A costing survey conducted in 1991, involving six Government Departments answering a total of approximately 1,600 parliamentary questions, established the average full costs of answering both written and oral parliamentary questions, then &#163;87 and &#163;202 respectively.
<P>

<a name="20522w22.html_para2">Since 1991 the costs have been updated annually by indexation using two separate indices, the retail prices index and the civil service earnings index.

<P>
<a name="20522w22.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Cancer is a central priority for the national health service and one in three people in England will develop cancer at some stage in their lives. The NHS Cancer Plan was published in September 2000 and is the first comprehensive national cancer programme.
<P>

<a name="20522w22.html_para4">Improvements to cancer services in line with the implementation of the Cancer Plan will benefit diagnostic, treatment and care services across the NHS and as such will benefit not only cancer patients but also a high proportion of other NHS patients as well.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20522w22.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Evan Harris: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much of the allocation in the NHS Cancer Plan for palliative care has been spent on hospices for <i>(a)</i> children and <i>(b)</i> adults in 2001&#150;02; how much expenditure is planned for 2002&#150;03, and if he will make a statement.  [55402]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20522w22.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 In the NHS Cancer Plan, we pledged that the national health service contribution to the costs of specialist palliative care for adults (including hospices) would increase. By 2004 the NHS will invest an additional &#163;50 million available for specialist palliative care. This investment is intended to help tackle inequalities in access to specialist palliative care and enable the NHS to increase their contribution to the cost hospices incur in providing agreed level of services. At a local level this investment must be based on the agreed strategic plans for palliative care provision within each cancer network's service delivery plan.




<P>

<P>

<a name="20522w22.html_para5">Funding to support this investment is included within the sums made available for cancer in NHS allocations each year.

<P>

<a name="20522w22.html_para7">In addition to the extra investment identified in the Cancer Plan, the New Opportunities Fund has recently announced a further &#163;70 million to support palliative care projects, &#163;22 million for adults and &#163;48 million for children.

 As at 22 April 2002 142 practices did not have an NHSnet connection. 75 of these are awaiting installation, the remainder (by agreement with the relevant health authorities) are where it would not be practical or cost-effective to install an NHSnet connection for a short period, for example, because the general practitioner is shortly to retire or working from temporary premises. 8,586 practices (95 per cent.) have an NHSnet line installed.

<P>
<a name="20522w22.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Under general medical services, the childhood immunisation programme target payment is &#163;2,730 per annum if a general practitioner immunises 90 per cent. of children aged two on his partnership list or &#163;910 per annum if 70 per cent. of children are immunised. The pre-school booster target payments are &#163;810 per annum if 90 per cent. of children aged five on a GP's partnership list are immunised or &#163;270 per annum for 70 per cent. Personal medical services incentive payments for vaccinations and immunisations are negotiated as part of the personal medical service agreement but are broadly similar to those payable to GPs working under general medical service arrangements.

 Renal transplantation services are currently provided from two sites in south-west London: Epsom and St. Helier NHS Trust and St. George's Healthcare NHS Trust. It is proposed that renal services are maintained at both hospital sites and that the transplantation operation and immediate post-operative recovery period is centralised on one site at St. George's hospital. This proposal is currently the subject of a three-month public consultation which concludes on 25 June 2002.




<P>
<P><I>22 May 2002 : Column 419W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20522w22.html_para8">Resource effectiveness and affordability was one of the 10 criteria as part of the relative benefits of centralising transplantation services at Epsom and St. Helier NHS Trust, St. George's Healthcare NHS Trust or Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Trust. The estimated short-term costs for centralising transplantation at either the St. George's or St. Helier sites are outlined in the consultation document as approximately &#163;320,000. The funding for a long-term purpose-built facility on either site would be subject to the development of an outline business case for consideration by the south-west London health authority. Any further development of a business case for an integrated facility at either site will be subject to the outcome of the public consultation on the future of renal transplantation services.

 There are no current plans to conduct new research on child sexual abuse. It is often an issue that is picked up and explored as part of other studies about interventions with children in need. Relevant departmental funded studies on children or young people who sexually abuse are in the completed study, "Sexually Abused and Abusing Children in Substitute Care" by Elaine Farmer and the forthcoming study, "A Protective Study on the Onset of Sexually Abusive Behaviour in Boys who were Sexually Abused in Childhood" by Professor Skuse at the Institute of Child Health.

<P>
<a name="20522w22.html_spnew11"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 "Working Together to Safeguard Children", a guide to inter-agency working to safeguard and promote the welfare of children published in December 1999, sets out how agencies should work together to assess the risks posed by and the needs of children and young people who abuse. It is the responsibility of area child protection committees and their relevant constituent agencies to determine ways of implementing this guidance at local level.

<P>
<a name="20522w22.html_spnew12"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Department has funded two voluntary organisations under section 64 of the Health Services and Public Health Act (1968) to carry out work in relation to stopping child sexual abuse by using public health education approaches to increase public awareness of sexual abuse in a way that empowers people to act responsibly and without panic in the interests of effective child protection. The 'Stop It Now!' project is targeting specific groups of adults including adult abusers and the parents of young abusers. The Lucy Faithfull foundation and the national organisation for the treatment of abusers have been granted &#163;55,000 and &#163;37,000 a year for each year from 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04, with additional funding from the Home Office of &#163;50,000 a year for the same three-year period for the Lucy Faithfull foundation.

 There has been no statutory public inquiries into child abuse or neglect cases since 1990, apart from the Victoria Climbie inquiry that is currently carrying out its work. The Government guidance, "Working Together to Safeguard Children", issued by the Home Office, Department for Education and Skills and the Department of Health in December 1999, states that when a child dies and abuse or neglect are known or suspected to be a factor in the death, the area child protection committee (ACPC) should always conduct a review into the involvement with the child and family of agencies and professionals. In all cases, the ACPC overview report should contain an executive summary that will be made public.

 The number of people aged over 75 with a delayed discharge has fallen from 15.7 per cent. to 10.5 per cent. since 1997. In order that this trend should continue, we have already responded to the issue of delayed discharge with a special grant to councils of &#163;300 million over two years, and the establishment of the 'change agents team' dedicated to supporting social services and the national health service to solve these problems locally. We are in the process of updating the hospital discharge workbook, which aims to help health, social services and other agencies improve discharge procedures.

 The Department does not intend to carry out a national audit of the opinions of mental health service users regarding mixed and single sex hospital accommodation. The Department has set clear objectives for the elimination of mixed sex accommodation in mental health settings. National health service trust boards are responsible for putting in place policies and procedures to address patient safety, privacy and dignity. The Department's guidance to trusts sets out that NHS trust chief executives should ensure that local patient surveys are considered as a means of assessing patients' and relatives' views about services and to ascertain their concerns.

Last year, the Department published a national quality assurance framework to improve the quality of existing referral schemes and help the development of new ones.

The Department has also allocated &#163;30 million to modernise hearing aids services, including the provision of digital hearing aids, and &#163;4 million for the provision of life-like covering for artificial limbs. The Modernisation Agency will be identifying and spreading good practice within wheelchair services.

 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2002]:</i> Health authority allocations for 2002&#150;03 increased by &#163;3,704 million, or 9.9 per cent. This included sufficient funding to meet increases in pay, prices and other pressures faced by all health authorities. It is for health authorities in partnership with primary care trusts and other local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling inequalities and modernising services.

 The office of prisons ombudsman for England and Wales was established in 1994 under the previous Conservative Administration following the report by Lord Woolf and Sir Stephen Tumim on Prison Disturbances (Cm 1456) and the White Paper "Custody, Care and Justice" (Cm 1647). The remit was extended on 1 September 2001 to encompass complaints both from prisoners and those supervised by the National Probation Service (NPS). The office was re-titled prisons and probation ombudsman.

<a name="20522w26.html_para0">The prisons and probation ombudsman is independent of the Prison Service and National Probation Service. The ombudsman is appointed by the Home Secretary and reports to him. The ombudsman investigates complaints from prisoners, and those on license or otherwise under probation supervision, regarding aspects of their treatment. Complainants must first have sought redress through use of the internal Prison Service or NPS complaints systems. The number of complaints has increased rapidly over the last two years. In 2001&#150;02, 1,100 complaints were investigated.

 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2002]:</i> The National Criminal Intelligence Service collates information on street level prices of drugs. The average prices for 'crack' cocaine during the period 1996&#150;2001 are given in the following table.
<P>

<a name="20522w27.html_para13">I view the availability of crack cocaine with concern. I have established an expert group on the treatment of crack cocaine addiction and I am organising a conference to develop more effective solutions to the problems caused by crack cocaine.
<P>

<a name="20522w27.html_para14">We are also working to ensure that routes into Britain for crack cocaine are shut down as effectively as possible. The total amount of cocaine (including crack) seized in 2000 rose to an all-time record of 3,970 kilograms, an increase of about one metric tonne on the previous year.
