The Hemel Hempstead Urban Transport Plan includes a number of proposed measures including the development of travel plans for Hemel Hempstead railway station and the hospital, proactively encouraging the development of car clubs and establishing a project to provide individual households with travel planning advice.</p>

 We advise all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians, of the need to be aware of others and be considerate of their needs. The main source of this advice is the Highway Code, which sets out road traffic law and advice for safe road users. It includes specific sections for cyclists and for pedestrians. The rules for cyclists make clear that they must not cycle on the pavement as this is an offence. It also provides advice on taking care of pedestrians in those areas where cyclists and pedestrians share space, such as unsegregated cycle tracks. In addition the Department for Transport provides local authorities with guidance on the planning and design of facilities used by pedestrians and cyclists including shared use.</p>

One of the reforms on which initial views were sought was contracting with credit unions or other external organisations to provide credit in place of social fund loans. The intention is to move from a scheme that provides only loans to people on benefit to one that also connects our customers to organisations with whom they can maintain a relationship when they move off benefit and into work which could include better financial advice and support.

<i> Data quality</i><br>
Workforce statistics are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data. Processing methods and procedures are continually being updated to improve data quality. Where this happens any impact on figures already published will be assessed but unless this is significant at national level they will not be changed. Where there is impact only at detailed or local level this will be footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>

 In his written ministerial statement of 16 December 2008, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster referred to overpayments made to pensioners of public sector pension schemes, including the NHS pension scheme.</p>

The decision was taken not to publish the accounts until such time as we had sufficient information to be able to inform the pensioners. Critical to this decision was the need to avoid unnecessary public concern among the vast majority of national health service pensioners who were entirely unaffected, but who would not have known that had a general announcement been made. Letters were sent to affected pensioners on 15 December and the statement, formally notifying Parliament of the overpayments, was made on 16 December.</p>

 Public authority authorisation and use of covert surveillance is strictly controlled by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (&#145;RIPA&#146;). RIPA limits the purposes for which such surveillance may be used by specific public authorities and sets out the level and procedures for its authorisation. In particular it expressly requires that its authorisation is both necessary and proportionate with regard to human rights. This reflects the obligation on all public authorities to comply with the European Convention under the terms of the Human Rights Act 1998. RIPA also provides a system of independent oversight by the Office of Surveillance Commissioners and a Tribunal for appeal if anyone believes they have been put under unlawful covert surveillance.

<p><a name="stpa_512"><a name="90121w0014.htm_para3"><a name="09012169000819">The Government are determined to tackle fraud and have recently allocated &#163;29 million in new funding to establish the National Fraud programme. As part of this programme the new National Fraud Strategic Authority is working closely with stakeholders across Government, law enforcement and the private sector to drive forwards a concerted UK strategy against fraud and to make the UK a much more difficult place for fraudsters to succeed. In addition to the new authority, the City of London police now has a national remit to tackle serious and complex fraud cases across England and Wales, and to assist other forces in their response to fraud, while a new National Fraud Reporting Centre (NFRC), expected to go live in 2009, will radically streamline the way that the public report fraud to the police. The NFRC will also enable the police to draw together intelligence from separate incidents of fraud and help to form the basis of better prevention advice and alerts for businesses and the public.</p>

 The Preventing Violent Extremism Pathfinder Fund: Mapping of project activities 2007-08 was one of a number of reviews over the summer which sought to draw out learning and emerging practice on the delivery of activity to prevent violent extremism. Though each review had a different focus, together they provide a useful package of learning material upon which local partners can draw and which will inform the Government's approach to Prevent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_546"><a name="90121w0017.htm_para5"><a name="09012169001130">There are a number of common themes which run through all these reviews.

We have ensured wide distribution of the Pathfinder Fund Mapping report to enable local partners to benefit directly from information on the range of Pathfinder projects and how they are contributing to the Prevent strategy. We published &#147;Delivering Prevent&#151;Responding to Learning&#148; on 10 December, which sets out the key strands of learning from the reviews and work already under way to address these key themes. We will continue to develop our response to the reviews throughout the year.

 Jestina Mukoko, director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project, was discovered in Matapi prison in Harare on 23 December 2008 by Zimbabwe lawyers for human rights, despite official denials that her whereabouts were known. She has since been transferred between other prisons and charged, with nine others, with recruiting persons to undergo training in Botswana in order to commit acts of armed insurgency. The accused claim to have been beaten while in custody and to have been denied access to doctors. Jestina Mukoko's lawyers have filed a separate application in the High Court for those in need of treatment to be taken to hospital. No date has been fixed for this hearing.</p>

This was conveyed to the Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Harare in a d&#233;marche by the EU Troika on 8 December 2008 and reaffirmed by the European Council on 12 December 2008. On 19 December 2008 we issued a note verbale to the Zimbabwean ambassador demanding investigations be made as to the location of Ms Mukoko and fellow abductees. We deplore this ongoing abuse of the legal and human rights of political prisoners and urge the restoration of internationally-accepted human rights standards in Zimbabwe.</p>

 Ethiopian troops have now withdrawn from the capital, Mogadishu. According to the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) the Ethiopian bases have now been occupied by forces supporting the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia and the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, who agreed in November 2008 to establish a Unity Government under the UN-sponsored Djibouti Process. Although the departure of the Ethiopians could risk further worsening the security situation in South Central Somalia, it also offers an opportunity to find a Somali-led political solution to the conflict and may relieve a point of aggravation between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

This update supported the repeal of Section 6 to the Child Support Act 1991, which removed the compulsion from parents with care in receipt of income based benefits to make a claim for child maintenance through the Child Support Agency. The cost of this upgrade to our system is estimated at around &#163;7m however final invoices have yet to be received from our IT suppliers.</p>
</ul><a name="90121w0023.htm_brev4"><a name="09012192001774"><ul><p class="tabletext">At the end of September 2008, the latest date that figures are available, the Agency had a total of 1,339,600 cases registered as live across the CSCS and CS2 computer systems. The Agency also had a total of 44,000 live clerical cases of which a significant number will be included in the cases shown as registered on the computer systems. These are cases which are being progressed clerically but remain registered on the computer systems.</p>
</ul><a name="90121w0023.htm_brev5"><a name="09012192001775"><ul><p class="tabletext">The repeal of Section 6 allows all parents to choose the child maintenance arrangements that best suit their circumstances, whether private arrangements or through the statutory maintenance schemes. The size of the future caseload of the statutory maintenance schemes is therefore dependant on the choices that parents make. Information on the size of the Agency's caseload is published each quarter in the Child Support Agency Quarterly Summary of Statistics and the next edition containing information on the impact of the recent changes is due to be published at the end of January 2009.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 January 2009]:</i> The Child Health Strategy is being developed jointly by the Department for Children, Schools and Families and Department of Health and will set out the Government's long-term strategy to support children&#146;s and families&#146; health. It will be aimed at the NHS, local government and partnership organisations, and build on the work already being delivered through Every Child Matters and the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services. We hope to be in a position to publish the Child Health Strategy in February.</p>

 Although the number of child protection officers in each local authority is not collected by the Government, the NHS Information Centre does collect and publish data relating to the number of social care staff directly employed by councils. The number of child protection officers is collected as part of this larger group of social care staff, although child protection officers and senior child protection officers are recorded in different categories (as follows).

 The Youth Crime Action Plan, published in July 2008, set out the Government's plans for tackling offending by young people. It detailed our plans for a 'triple track' approach of tough enforcement, non-negotiable help and support, and early intervention and prevention. It also states our ambition to reduce the rate of young people entering the criminal justice system by one fifth by 2020. This is supported by close to &#163;100 million over the next three years, in addition to the existing investment in children's and youth services, to support local authorities in making inroads into youth crime locally. This funding is weighted towards areas facing higher levels of crime, antisocial behaviour, fear and deprivation.</p>

Inevitably the majority were former Prison Service staff. This is because the Probation Service headquarters was significantly smaller as many staff are employed in probation boards and trusts. What matters is that all employees in NOMS HQ recognise that they are now working for a new agency and whatever their past employment history they are focused on public protection and reducing re-offending through integrated offender management.</p>

 The number of persons aged 18 and over convicted at all courts for offences relating to child abuse from 2003 to 2007 in England and Wales can be viewed in the following table. As there is no specific offence of &#147;child abuse&#148;, statistics are only provided where the victim can be identified as a child from the description of the offence. Child abuse can be covered by a number of offences, including the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 S.5 which came into force on 21 March 2005.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the de minimis &#163;200 threshold for recording political donations contained in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 would be now if it had been indexed to <i> (a)</i> the gross domestic product deflator and <i> (b)</i> average earnings since its introduction.

 The Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA) received Royal Assent in the final quarter of 2000. Using that as the starting point and the third quarter of 2008 as the end point for the comparison, &#163;200 in 2000 would now be worth &#163;245 if indexed to the gross domestic product deflator. If indexed to whole economy average earnings, &#163;200 in 2000 would now be worth &#163;269.</p>
