<a name="50222w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Kazakhstan</h3>


<p><a name="50222w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what representations he has made to the Government of Kazakhstan concerning <i>(a)</i> human rights and <i>(b)</i> the implementation of good governance practices.  [215768]</p>




<p><a name="50222w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w01.html_para0">
We continually raise, bilaterally and with our EU partners, the importance of respect for human rights and good governance in Kazakhstan. When I met the Kazakh Minister for Justice last May I raised democratic reform and human rights issues, including the death penalty and conditions in Kazakh prisons. Following the parliamentary elections in September/October 2004, the EU released a statement reflecting the concerns of the OSCE Election Observers that the elections had failed to meet international standards. The concerns were also raised by our Ambassador with the Foreign Minister in October 2004. More recently, in February, along with our EU partners we raised human rights issues at an EU-Kazakhstan sub-committee meeting. This month, we supported an EU statement in Vienna expressing concern at the new law on Extremism and the recent banning of an opposition party.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w01.html_para1">
Wherever possible we also look to work with the Kazakh authorities to improve the human rights situation and have funded projects aimed at improving the conditions in prisons, preventing torture in places of detention and encouraging the abolition of the death penalty. We have an on-going dialogue with the government of Kazakhstan on transparency issues and are working closely with NGOs on this too.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w01.html_para2">
We will continue to stress the importance of human rights and good governance with the Kazakh authorities and look for opportunities to provide suitable assistance. Kazakhstan has recently been identified as a priority country under the sustainable development strand of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#039;s Global Opportunities Fund. This will provide further scope for the UK Government to support rule of law, torture prevention and death penalty abolition initiatives.

<a name="50222w01.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Official Residences</h3>


<p><a name="50222w01.html_wqn1"><b> Chris Grayling: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will list the official residences for which his Department is responsible; who occupies each one; what the annual cost is of running each property; what contribution the current occupants 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Feb 2005 : Column 472W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
make towards the running costs of each; what the total capital and refurbishment expenditure has been on those properties in each of the past five years; how much money was spent in each property on <i>(a)</i> flowers and plants, <i>(b)</i> wine and entertaining, <i>(c)</i> food, <i>(d)</i> telephone bills and <i>(e)</i> electricity and gas in 2003&#150;04; how many (i) domestic and (ii) maintenance staff are employed at each property, broken down by post; and what the total cost of staff employment at each was in 2003&#150;04.  [213604]</p>




<p><a name="50222w01.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID currently owns 11 domestic properties overseas, in Zimbabwe (3), Solomon Islands (1), and Malawi (7). DFID also provides approximately 450 UK-based staff posted overseas with commercially leased accommodation. DFID does not pay for flowers and plants, food, wine, or domestic staff, all of which are the responsibility of the occupier. Individuals receive a cost of living allowance, and where appropriate a gardening allowance, in respect of the additional costs incurred of living overseas, and these allowances vary depending on location.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w01.html_para3">
Official expenditure on business phone calls and utilities are met from individual delegated budgets but are not separately identifiable and this detailed information cannot be obtained without incurring disproportionate cost. Similarly, information on the individual occupancy of each of the overseas properties, and the overall cost to DFID, are not held centrally and cannot be obtained without incurring disproportionate cost.
</p>




<a name="50222w01.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Publicity</h3>


<p><a name="50222w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Laws: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State, Department for International Development what the total expenditure by his Department on <i>(a)</i> advertising and <i>(b)</i> advertising and publicity was in (i) 1996&#150;97, (ii) 1997&#150;98 and (iii) 2003&#150;04; and what the estimate of cost of each will be in (A) 2004&#150;05, (B) 2005&#150;06, (C) 2006&#150;07 and (D) 2007&#150;08.  [211660]</p>




<p><a name="50222w01.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn  </b> 
<i>[pursuant to the reply, 10 February 2005, Official Report, c. 1642W]:</i> The correct figure for expenditure on advertising for 2003&#150;04 was &#163;676,649 and the estimated figure for 2004&#150;05 is &#163;663,591.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w01.html_para4">
It was originally stated that the expenditure on advertising for 2004&#150;05, which was then believed to be higher than that for 2003&#150;04, reflected a higher number of posts being advertised in 2004&#150;05. On re-examination this is incorrect. The number of recruitment competitions for which advertisements were placed was in fact slightly more in 2003&#150;04 than the number to date in 2004&#150;05.

The answer stated that the capital consultancy spend of the Treasury was &#163;0.78 million in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;1.40 million in 2003&#150;04.

<p class="tabletext">Since local government reorganisation in 1998, there have been minor changes to local authority district boundaries in Wales in April 2002 and April 2003, and in Scotland in June 2002. However, these have not impacted on the NUTS 1&#150;3 areas because the NUTS boundaries moved to retain the relationships. There have not been any local authority district boundary changes in England since 1998 or in Northern Ireland since 1973.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The NUTS 1&#150;3 areas were frozen by EU Regulation in July 2003 and, in consequence, the small change in the boundary between Powys and Neath Port Talbot, effective on 1 April 2005, will result in part of Powys falling within &quot;Bridgend and Neath Port Talbot&quot; NUTS 3 area, and within &quot;West Wales and the Valleys&quot; NUTS 2 area.

<p class="tabletext">ONS&#039;s practice is to provide analyses by region where this is meaningful in terms of the statistics concerned, subject to the reliability of the figures and providing that release does not create a risk of disclosure of confidential personal information. Following the establishment of Government Offices in 1994, the decision was taken in 1996 that the Government Office regions should become the standard statistical regions for England.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">It is standard practice in ONS data collection to include suitable geographic referencing in surveys of businesses and individuals, allowing statistics to be analysed and published at a variety of geographic levels including region. The bulk of ONS statistics can therefore be produced by region, including the Census of population and household and business surveys. A list of major statistical collections indicating the levels at which figures are available will be placed in the House of Commons library.</p>
</ul>

Notes:<br>

1. The drop in registrations between September 1997 and September 1998 is mostly attributable to the reduction in the re-registration period from two years to 15 months.<br>

2. The figures excludes patients treated in dental access centres who are not registered. In 2004 there were some 375,000 episodes of treatment in dental access centres.<br>

Information is not available on patients who are unable to register with a dentist, but we are undertaking a wide range of initiatives to improve access to NHS dentistry. In the Durham and Chester-le-Street PCT, a local dental access scheme has been developed at a cost of &#163;65,770 from central funds. Under the scheme, 10 practices, which were not previously taking on new NHS patients, have been funded to provide an agreed number of new patient contacts. From September 2004, the scheme has delivered 1,000 additional NHS appointments and expects shortly to deliver a further 300 appointments. As a result, between late September and November, all patients seeking a NHS dentist should have been able to access occasional NHS dental treatment and, in addition, some were able to register with a NHS dentist.

 The Health Protection Agency rapid review panel assesses all products for which 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Feb 2005 : Column 497W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
applications have been received from companies, provided the product falls within the panel&#039;s remit. There are currently 58 product reports available on the Health Protection Agency&#039;s website, together with the minutes of the panel meetings and a list of products reviewed by the panel. This information can be found at www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics az/rapid review/. A further 25 applications received since 13 January will be reviewed later this month. Information on those products awaiting review is not publicly available as information provided by applicants is regarded as commercial in confidence until the applications have been assessed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w07.html_para5">
Of the 58 reports available on the panel&#039;s website so far, 19 contain recommendations for further research and development before the product is ready for evaluation and 10 contain recommendations for in-use evaluation/trial in a national health service clinical setting. Two products have been identified as showing benefits that should be available to NHS bodies to use as appropriate. These products are being considered for inclusion in future workplans for the NHS Purchasing 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Feb 2005 : Column 498W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
and Supply Agency (PASA) and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. Information on which products are currently used in NHS facilities is not collected centrally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w07.html_para6">
Where the rapid review panel suggests further work, it is generally the company&#039;s responsibility to organise this; the panel itself does not organise product evaluations. Some evaluations may be performed as part of normal PASA tendering exercises. Also, some products may be included in the Department&#039;s research and development programme for healthcare associated infection if it is thought they may have a particular impact in a priority area.

Notes:<br>

1. A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. Data quality&#151;hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. The Department liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

3. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

4. Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

<p><a name="50222w11.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Jamieson </b> 
<i>[holding answer 8 February 2005]:</i> The Ml motorway is equipped with cameras for traffic and incident management purposes such as comprehensive surveillance of accidents, traffic and weather conditions. They do not measure individual vehicle speed. However, some cameras measure the average speed of the traffic for the purposes of setting automatic queue-warning signs. These cameras are not used for speed enforcement. The provision of CCTV cameras is controlled by departmental standards and they can only be used for the purposes described. Most cameras are fixed to free-standing masts installed in the motorway verge. In Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, 12 cameras (installed early in 2004) have been fitted to traffic message sign gantries.

On the Al just north of the end of the Ml near Wetherby, a number of traffic and incident management cameras are being provided on message sign gantries.

These cameras have all been provided as part of a much larger project, thus an accurate cost of camera only provision cannot be determined. However it is estimated that the typical cost of installing a single camera on a traffic message sign gantry and making it operational is around &#163;15,000.

 The Government have introduced a range of programmes to reduce crime committed by young people which also have an impact on antisocial behaviour.

The Home Office is supporting a wide range of schemes targeted at young people who are most at risk. These include:

</ul>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Youth Inclusion Programmes (YIPs) and Youth Inclusion and Support Panels (YISPS) are part of the Government&#039;s wider programme to target young people at risk of getting involved in criminal and antisocial behaviour. These are essentially intensive intervention programmes that target the risk factors often associated with young people&#039;s offending.</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Positive Futures programme was launched in March 2000 and is targeted at 10&#150;19 year olds living in the most deprived neighbourhoods in England and Wales. Its objective is to have a positive influence on drug use and other negative behaviours of vulnerable young people. Since its launch over 51,000 young people have taken regular part in Positive Futures activities.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w14.html_para1">
The Government will also be publishing in the near future a green paper on young people, which will consult on proposals for more places to go and things to do for teenagers, as well as on ways to improve advice and support on the choices and challenges they face. The proposals in the green paper are intended to contribute to the Government&#039;s efforts to divert youngsters from crime and antisocial behaviour, and more generally to contribute to positive outcomes for teenagers. There is evidence that a lack of things to do can lead people into offending. A 2003 MORI/Youth Justice Board Survey showed that 25 per cent. of offenders in mainstream education and 42 per cent. of school-excluded offenders said their motive for offending was they were bored. There will be a specific focus within the green paper on those who are at risk of crime and antisocial behaviour, and other poor outcomes.

At present, first determinations in asylum appeal cases are served by post by the Immigration Appellate Authority, as the applicable procedure rules do not permit service by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND).

From 4 April 2005 a new appeal system will come into force.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the value of the British Crime Survey.  [214825]</p>




<p><a name="50222w14.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The British Crime Survey (BCS) is the most reliable and robust measure of crime in England and Wales today. Although no formal evaluation of the BCS has been undertaken, both the criminological and policing communities respect it as an authoritative measure of crime trends. The overwhelming value of the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Feb 2005 : Column 521W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
BCS is that it provides the most reliable measurement of crime trends as it has measured crime consistently since 1981.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w14.html_para5">
The BCS provides the best reflection of the true extent of crime because it also includes crimes that are not reported to the police. We have never claimed that the BCS counts all crimes that occur in England and Wales, but rather that it provides a reliable measure of trends in the crimes that it does count from one year to the next. The design of the survey ensures statistically robust data is obtained. The BCS count also gives a better indication of trends in crime over time than police recorded crime because it is unaffected by changes in levels of reporting to the police and in police recording practices.

There has been no research looking specifically at public confidence in the British crime survey (BCS).

 The offences which form the recorded crime series are all indictable and triable-either-way offences together with a few closely related summary ones. As such these offences are defined by statute. Those referred to in the question are not. For example, a &quot;domestic violence offence&quot; would be recorded as more or less serious wounding or common assault depending on the severity of the violence used and in accordance with the relevant legislation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w14.html_para8">
The ability to produce police recorded crime statistics on the topics mentioned is dependent on the adoption of new IT systems in police forces and the Home Office. An exercise is under way to assess the costs and benefits associated with making this change.

 The Government are firmly committed to tackling illegal migrant working. Our strategy involves increasing enforcing capacity, encouraging compliance by business, and developing joint working between agencies responsible for enforcing workplace regulations.

We are setting up a new authority to regulate gangmasters in the agricultural and shellfish gathering sectors. We will also introduce civil penalties for employers found to be using illegal workers.

 The table sets out the information requested. Of the deaths of young people who die following contact with the police, 89 per cent. (77 deaths out of 87) do so as a result of road traffic incidents. Operational measures to avoid pursuits or curtail them include the use of helicopters, the early deployment of tyre deflation devices across the carriageway and tactical pursuit and containment in which a number of police vehicles are deployed in a planned manner to box in the target vehicle and bring it safely to a halt. More widely, we are working with the Association of Chief Police Officers, the National Centre for Policing Excellence and other key stakeholders in developing guidance setting out minimum standards for safer custody practice. This is due for publication in January 2006 following consultation in summer 2005 on the draft guidance with practitioner groups.

It is used for work to prevent relationship problems and so to provide a stable environment for any children in the family.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w18.html_para6">
The MARS Grant has now been amalgamated with the former Family Support Grant to form the Strengthening Families Grant. The same amount of money is available for relationship support. Adult relationship support services remain an important and integral element of the range of family support services funded by the Department.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how the creation of the Offenders&#039; Learning and Skills Service will affect offender learning provision in Wales.  [214990]</p>




<p><a name="50222w18.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 The new arrangements for offender learning and skills in Wales (and in England) will make the provision for offender learners considerably better. An early focus on advice, guidance and assessment will secure a tightly focused Individual Learning Plan that will accompany the offender learner through the Criminal Justice System. The Plan will ensure that learning needs continue to be met as he or she passes through the System&#039;s principal points of transition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w18.html_para7">
We will substantially enhance offender learners&#039; chances of employment on release&#151;and successful resettlement&#151;through significantly greater planning and co-ordinated funding of learning. A particular focus on the needs of the labour market will make the provision much more relevant to the needs of employers.

<p><a name="50222w19.html_spnew2"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The information is not available in the form requested. Funding for nursery and pre-school education has been provided through a mixture of nursery education grant and education standard spending (up till 2002&#150;03) and education formula spending (from 2003&#150;04). The new education formula spending system is not directly comparable with the old education standard spending assessments at sub-block level. This is because the coverage of the sub-blocks and the amount of resources allocated within them changed significantly in 2003&#150;04. Therefore the figures are not comparable between 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04.

</p>




<p><a name="50222w20.html_spnew1"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 Stockton South has two Sure Start local programmes (Parkfield & Victoria and Mandale, Village & Stainsby) approved by the Sure Start Unit in December 2002 supporting around 1,560 young children and their families living in the area. They deliver a wide range of child, family health and parental support services seeing on average around 17 per cent. of these children. The Parkfield and Victoria local programme has visited 100 per cent. of families with newborn babies within the first two months of their child&#039;s life.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w20.html_para0">
Linked to these programmes are two neighbourhood nurseries delivering a total of 100 full daycare places. Both programmes were designated as children&#039;s centres in September 2004 and are contributing towards achieving our goal of a children&#039;s centre in every community by 2010.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment she has made of the impact of the Sure Start programme on families in The Wrekin; and if she will make a statement.  [216051]</p>




<p><a name="50222w20.html_spnew2"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 Telford and Wrekin local authority is served by two Sure Start local programmes: Sure Start Lawley Plus, which serves the communities in Lawley, Arleston and College, The Rock, Overdale and Newdale and Ketley Bank; and Sure Start Jubilee, which serves Madeley, Woodside and Cuckoo Oak. The programmes between them support over 1500 local young children and their families.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w20.html_para1">
Prior to the establishment of Sure Start Lawley Plus at the end of 1999, the area was identified as an isolated area with no early years infrastructure. It now has a nursery closely integrated with the local primary school and with social care and health services. It has strong links with the Carpenter Family Centre which has a parent and toddler group and training sessions. The programme also supports mothers with post-natal depression. It had meaningful contact with over 95 per cent. of the children in its catchment area in the year ending 31 March 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w20.html_para2">
Sure Start Jubilee was approved in early 2003. It offers a range of services including family support through home visiting, parenting support, baby massage, home safety promotion and reading and early language development and support. It has had some success in reducing smoking during pregnancy and just under 19 per cent. of the mothers in the area gave up smoking prior to or during pregnancy. It is using its &#163;1 million capital allocation towards two children&#039;s centres. One of these, Woodside children&#039;s centre will create a 64 place day nursery and family room in a 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Feb 2005 : Column 546W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
building to which the PCT&#039;s health visiting team will relocate alongside the Sure Start team. The other, Sutton Hill children&#039;s centre will create 42 full day care places, training facilities and a health room. Although it was a very new programme at the time and had no dedicated building from which to deliver services, it had already had meaningful contact with some 17 per cent. of the children in its catchment area in the three months between its establishment and 31 March 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w20.html_para3">
In addition to these services, between April 2003 and March 2004, both programmes contacted all pregnant women in their areas to give ante-natal advice and support. They also both visited 100 per cent. of these families within two months of the baby being born. In the last annual satisfaction survey, some 92 per cent. of families who responded said they were satisfied or very satisfied with the local services for young children.
</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the effects of the Sure Start programme in <i>(a)</i> Whitmore Reans and <i>(b)</i> Dunstall, Wolverhampton.  [216227]</p>




<p><a name="50222w20.html_spnew3"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 One Sure Start programme serves both the Whitmore Reans and Dunstall areas. It was approved in 2001 and supports around 870 young local children and their families. It delivers a wide range of services to support local families including family support in partnership with the Primary Care Trust (PCT); a support group for single parents; the provision of healthy eating advice to families, provision of safety equipment on a loan basis to families at a subsidised rate; a toy library; a cr&#232;che; play and stay as well as play groups; additional home visits by qualified midwife and health visitors and early assessment and referral for children with development delay.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w20.html_para4">
Since opening, this programme has helped to improve the quality of life for local families. For example it works closely with the smoking cessation programme run by the PCT and all staff have received training in ways to support parents and families who may want to give up smoking. All staff have been trained to be able to identify children with delayed language development and either apply strategies recommended by therapists or refer the families for specialist help.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w20.html_para5">
Local health visitors report back to the local programme on all women identified with post natal depression&#151;so that support can be offered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w20.html_para6">
Programme Monitoring shows that the programme has seen 700 of the 870 children in their catchment area since the programme opened (81 per cent.).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w20.html_para7">
The programme has strong parental participation both on the management board, which has six parent representatives with a parent vice chair and in activities where parents act as volunteers. It has a volunteer policy which aims to match skills gaps within the programme to the skills of the parents within the catchment area. This is used as a stepping stone to further training and ultimately employment. Volunteer parents can access all the training available to the programme staff.

Apprenticeships and advanced apprenticeships offer structured programmes of training in a wide range of occupations leading to a recognised qualification for learners of foundation degrees). We will shortly be publishing a White Paper which will set out our future plans for 14 to 19-year-olds.

<p><a name="50222w21.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis </b> 
<i>[holding answer 21 February 2005]:</i> The percentage of 16 to 19-year-olds and 20 to 24-year-olds who were not in education, employment or training (NEET) are given for each local education authority (LEA) in the table.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w21.html_para0">
These figures have been produced by combining information from the local Labour Force Survey for the last three years, to reduce the error margins around the NEET percentages. However, sample sizes are still very small due to the narrow age bands and small geographic area. The rates are volatile and care should be taken when interpreting the figures. An estimate of the confidence interval is provided, to aid with interpretation. Where fewer than 10 people who took part in the survey in a given LEA were NEET, the information has been suppressed as it would be potentially disclosive or particularly unreliable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w21.html_para1">
Figures are not available for the specified age groups, nor for parliamentary constituency, as sample sizes are too small for these narrow groups.

 &quot;Travel by Ministers&quot; makes it clear that special flights may be authorised when a scheduled service is not available, or when it is essential to travel by air, but the requirements of official or parliamentary business or security considerations or urgency preclude the journey being made by a scheduled service. In respect of overseas travel by Ministers, since 1999 the Government has published an annual list of all visits overseas undertaken by Cabinet Ministers costing &#163;500 or more during each financial year. Where RAF/private charter aircraft are used this is shown in the list. The Government has also published on an annual basis the cost of all Ministers&#039; visits overseas.

The provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the European Union with due regard to the principle of subsidiarity and to the member states only when they are implementing Union Law. The Charter does not extend the scope of application of Union Law beyond the existing powers of the Union or establish any new power or task for the Union. Nor does it modify powers and tasks defined in the other parts of the constitutional treaty, which specifically excludes EU action on legislative areas such as pay, the right of association, the right to strike and the right to impose lock-outs.

UK legislation on industrial relations maintains a balance between workers&#039; rights to pursue legitimate disputes and employers&#039; rights to conduct business without disruption from illegitimate industrial action. The Charter will not alter that balance.

The reallocation of staff has had a knock-on effect on emerging area plans. Work is continuing on those plans that are at an advanced stage in the preparation process. However, progress on the remaining area plans, including Antrim, Ballymena and Larne, will be slower then previously programmed.

<p>
<a name="50222w26.html_para0">
<i>Letter from Malcolm McKibbin to Mr. Nigel Dodds, dated February 2005:</i>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding the number of party election posters that were removed in each constituency by the Roads Service in each year since 1997 because they were not removed by the party responsible within the stipulated period; what the cost was in each year; and in what cases recompense was sought from the responsible party. (216411). I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive or Roads Service.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">I should explain that the erection of election posters is governed by planning legislation and I understand that the Department of the Environment&#039;s Planning Service practice is to write to all political parties prior to elections, advising of the statutory regulations for the display of election posters. Under current legislation, all election posters are required to be removed within 14 days after the close of the relevant poll to which they relate.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Although permission is not required from Roads Service for parties to erect election posters on our property, we have powers under Article 87 of the Roads (NI) Order 1993 to remove advertising signs, including election posters, from our property, to seek the recovery of costs and to prosecute those responsible for the signs. In practice, we prefer to persuade offenders to remove such signs themselves and only take stronger action if this proves necessary. Our approach normally begins with a courtesy call to the individual or organisation concerned and this action usually results in the vast majority of posters being removed.</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Feb 2005 : Column 566W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">With regard to the recovery of costs involved, Roads Service policy prior to 2001 was to remove election posters without seeking reimbursement from the political parties. Consequently, there is no record of the number of posters removed, or the cost incurred by Roads Service, before 2001.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Roads Service does not maintain details of the removal of election posters on a parliamentary constituency basis, however, the table below shows the posters removed by Roads Service Eastern Divisional area since 2001. Other Divisions have confirmed that requests to constituency offices for posters to be removed from specific locations have usually resulted in their removal and, that on the few occasions where posters have had to be removed by Roads Service staff, no records were kept.</p>

 The UK, as lead nation, is committed to supporting the Afghan Government in the implementation of their comprehensive National Drug Control Strategy and, in particular, the 1384 (2005) Counter Narcotics Implementation Plan. President Karzai launched the plan during the visit of my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary to Kabul on 16 February. The eight pillars of the plan include the development of the criminal justice system, the creation of alternative livelihoods for farmers and strengthening interdiction and law enforcement measures. The UK and its international partners are supporting many projects across all of these strands. It is too early to make an assessment of cultivation in 2005 but due to a number of factors there may be reduced planting this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w30.html_para4">
I also refer the hon. Member to the written statement I made on Afghanistan: Counter Narcotics on 29 November 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 17&#150;18WS; I hope to make a further statement shortly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w30.html_para5">
Since then, we have increased our efforts on alternative livelihoods for poppy growers to $50 million this year, bringing to $100 million the amount the UK is spending this year on counter narcotics activity in Afghanistan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w30.html_para6">
The creation of alternative livelihood opportunities and an effective agricultural sector is crucial both for counter narcotics efforts and for Afghanistan&#039;s longer-term development. An estimated 80 per cent. of the country&#039;s labour force are employed in the agricultural sector, though individuals&#039; livelihoods strategies are often complex and may involve a number of different types of income generating activity. Action to develop licit alternative rural livelihoods must take place on many levels and include both long-term development and short-term measures.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Feb 2005 : Column 585W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w30.html_para7">
However, rural development assistance is provided to all provinces across Afghanistan through national programmes managed by the Ministry for Reconstruction and Rural Development (MRRD), funded from the national development budget (and, soon, the new Counter Narcotics Trust Fund) and supported by the international community. Each programme focuses on redeveloping the infrastructure and underlying conditions necessary for growth, the development of an effective agricultural sector and viable licit alternatives to poppy cultivation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w30.html_para8">
Short-term seed delivery programmes are being implemented by donors, such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation. The World Bank recently committed US$75 million for quick disbursing activities on alternative livelihoods and is currently developing an accelerated integrated rural development programme.

 The Ministry of Defence is continually restructuring. Currently this is being taken forward in the context of the Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities White Paper, published in July 2004. This set out our requirement for flexible and adaptable Armed Forces supported to carry out the most likely expeditionary operations. In order to better meet these operational requirements we are reducing force levels in certain capabilities in order to invest more in higher priority capabilities. The overall financial effect of the restructuring process will be that we are able to spend more on those capabilities able to deliver the effects we require. That will mean we are able to deploy our resources to optimum effect. Overall, the Spending Review 2004 settlement provided a 3.7 billion increase to the Defence budget. This represents the longest period of sustained real growth in defence spending for over 20 years.

In the Land environment, there will be a shift in emphasis to Light and Medium Weight forces in line with our operational requirement for greater adaptability and flexibility. In order to facilitate this re-balancing there will be a reduction in Heavy Weight capability.

 At the time of the suspension of Remote Ammunitioning Facility Tamar in 2002, &#163;15 million had been spent on works (covering design, ammunition clearance, dredging and site preparation). Subsequent cancellation and project management costs have increased expenditure to a total of &#163;25 million and this has been highlighted as a potential constructive loss in the departmental annual accounts for financial year 2003&#150;04.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w36.html_para2">
A number of environmental assessments were carried out prior to the commencement of the RAFT project. The first in 1996, was carried out by Babtie, the Ministry of Defence&#039;s Project Manager. In 1998, the Babtie Group carried out a desktop archaeological study to review the potential effect of RAFT on existing scheduled monuments at Bullpoint. This was followed by a supplementary report on the effects of RAFT dredging on potential buried archaeological artefacts in peat deposits in the riverbed. An Ecological Study, also in 1998 and carried out by Panscape Consultancy, considered the potential impact of RAFT on the key habitats and species in Plymouth Sound and its estuaries. In addition, a Baseline Environmental Survey of Estuarine Sediment and Benthic Macrofauna, carried out by Zeneca and which supplemented the Ecological Study, assessed the potential environmental impact of dredging on surface sediments and resident worms. In 1999, an extensive hydraulic modelling study was undertaken by Hydraulics Research Wallingford, which covered the potential effects of dredging on the River Tamar (in particular on the salmon), the inter-tidal habitats of the Tamar and the salt marshes in the Upper Tamar estuary. A detailed sedimentation study was carried out of the whole tidal extent of the Tamar rather than just the local area of RAFT. The conclusions and results were overseen by an independent expert appointed by English Nature.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w36.html_para3">
In 2000, during the lifetime of the RAFT project and following award of the construction contract, a Conservation Management Plan was jointly produced with English Nature and the Environment Agency. In support of this plan, extensive mitigation measures were applied, including noise pollution monitoring of the surrounding areas and water quality monitoring in the River Tamar, during the dredging. The Environment Agency has recently confirmed that, as a result of this mitigation, there have been no permanent effects on fish stocks in the river.

Consequently, much of MOD and the armed forces&#039; operational and non-operational activity, together with the associated research work and military equipment development and procurement programmes that support these activities, contribute in some way to HMG&#039;s wider conflict prevention efforts around the world. This is particularly true of the work that MOD carries out in conjunction with FCO and DFID through the separately funded Conflict Prevention Pools. More information on this activity can be found on the FCO website.

<p><a name="50222w37.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Ministry of Defence has no requirement to retain spend information against individual shipping lines. Also, while some bookings may be made direct with shipping lines, others are placed through agents/freight-forwarders and spend will be recorded against them and not the shipping lines used. As the MOD operates a financial regime of disaggregated budgets, bookings can be made by units throughout the United Kingdom and overseas. For these reasons the spend requested is not held centrally or in a form which could be easily extracted and without disproportionate cost. The only spend information readily available is that against P&O shipping companies for invoices submitted through the Defence Bills Agency which is shown in the table.

Building on the expansion of Pathways to Work we have announced a number of measures as part of the Five Year Strategy that will improve incapacity benefits in order to ensure that there are clear rewards for moving into work, and that will address the anxieties many claimants have about trying out a job by minimising the risks. We recognise that a person&#039;s health condition can affect their ability to work in varying degrees, sometimes making work very unlikely, but sometimes leaving a good prospect of a return to work.

<i>Letter from David Anderson to Simon Hughes, dated 21 February 2005:</i>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning our plans for closing and retaining Jobcentres, and the timescale for completing the transformation of Jobcentre Plus. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">I have placed in the Library a list of sites planned for closure as part of the Jobcentre Plus rollout programme and activity to centralise benefit processing. This list includes a number of sites which are closing through merging with co-located offices. While the majority of these sites will be disposed of in due course, a number will be retained by Jobcentre Plus to accommodate non-customer facing activity.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">I have also placed in the Library a list of our planned Local Service Outlets&#151;those customer-facing offices providing access to our services. This listing includes what we refer to as Flexible Service Delivery sites, where we are working with local partners to provide access to services through third party premises.</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Feb 2005 : Column 616W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">I should stress that this is a snapshot of our plans based on the best information available. The lists of offices will inevitably change as we progress through rollout of the new, integrated service and continue to refine our plans for centralising benefit processing in Jobcentre Plus. For example, a significant number of the site closures are dependent on construction of new buildings or acquisition of new premises and these are often subject to delays and other issues. I would also expect the number of Flexible Service Delivery sites to increase significantly as we conclude local discussions with partners on arrangements.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">We continue to review the plans for our network as the reducing headcount is impacted on all parts of the business, and we may have to reconsider the future viability of a number of sites in this context. Completing the rollout of the new service and centralising benefit processing at the same time is a challenging programme of work and I can assure you that providing customer service is at the centre of decisions we make. We will also ensure that local stakeholders are kept informed of progress and any changes to our plans.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">We are shaping the future Jobcentre Plus network in response to the changing business need. The need for face-to-face facilities for jobsearch and other aspects of our business has been superseded in many instances by new business processes and the use of information technology. For example, over the last 12 months we have seen an increase of over 40 per cent. in the number of hits on our jobsearch website. Encouraging our customers to use these new channels enables us to focus on those customers who need greatest help, through the intervention of personal advisers, for example.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">You will see from the lists that we will retain a significant network of offices through which customers can access our services. Our current forecast is that when rollout is complete the total number of outlets from which our services can be accessed is likely to be around 1,000. On present plans, our network will be substantially complete by the Summer of next year.</p>

Notes:<br>

1. State pension age is currently 60 for females and 65 for males.<br>

2. CA is paid in full to people of state pension age who do not have a state pension or at a reduced &quot;top up&quot; rate where state pension is paid at a lower weekly rate than CA. CA is not paid where the weekly rate of state pension equals or exceeds the weekly rate of CA. Such cases are known as &quot;underlying entitlement&quot; cases.<br>





3. The percentages of pensioner population have been calculated using ONS mid 2003 population estimates for males aged 65 and over and females aged 60 and over in GB.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Data has been taken as at August 2004, the latest date for which the relevant carer&#039;s allowance figures are available.<br>

2. Figures are rounded to the nearest five.<br>

3. Figures for households in receipt of pension credit also in receipt of or with underlying entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance (i.e. the figures in the second column) exclude cases where the person to whom the pension credit award has been made is not the same as the person to whom the award of carers allowance has been made (i.e. where the partner of the pension credit recipient is in receipt of or with underlying entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance).<br>

4. Individual recipients may include a small number of partners under the age of 60.<br>

5. Carer&#039;s allowance is paid to people of state pension age where there is no entitlement to state pension or where state pension is paid at a lower rate than carer&#039;s allowance. If a low state pension is paid, a reduced rate of carer&#039;s allowance will be paid as a top-up.<br>

6. Carer&#039;s allowance is not paid where the weekly rate of state pension equals or exceeds the weekly rate of carer&#039;s allowance. Such cases are known as &quot;underlying entitlement&quot; cases.<br>

<p><a name="50222w41.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Battle: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the National Audit Office report on the social fund published on 13 January; and if he will make a statement.  [216095]</p>




<p><a name="50222w41.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 We welcome the report from the NAO; it recognises that the social fund plays an important role in helping people in financial hardship and is reaching many of those in greatest need. The report found that there were &#163;3 million social fund payments made in the last financial year at a total cost of &#163;854 million and acknowledges that the Department recovers the majority of social fund debt. Many of the recommendations in the report are already being taken forward.

Jobcentre plus intend to introduce a standard operating model for the social fund from April 2005, currently being piloted in Wales. Along with new management indicators from April 2004, the model aims to maintain and, where necessary, improve the speed and quality of decision making and customer service.
