To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what has been the net change in each year since May 1997 in the number of forms issued by his Department which <i>(a)</i> charities and <i>(b)</i> other voluntary organisations are required to complete.  [123943]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 My Department has not issued any forms to charities or voluntary bodies since 1 July 1999, when devolution took effect. Collecting information for the period before 1 July 1999 would incur disproportionate cost.

 My Department's policy operates effectively, with two smoking rooms provided in Dover House and at 1 Melville crescent, Edinburgh, and access to smoking rooms in two other buildings shared with the Scottish Executive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 I have had no discussions with the train operator about this matter, but the Franchising Director is monitoring the situation. He has agreed an emergency timetable with Connex as a rest-day working ban by drivers has meant that the original timetable could not be met. While this is a far from ideal situation, the Franchising Director agreed that it is in passengers' interests to have information on which services will run and which are cancelled. Connex are currently recruiting more drivers and services will be re-introduced as they complete their training.

 The shortlisted counterparties for a replacement South Central franchise were selected following the Franchising Director's evaluation of their initial proposals against the criteria given to him by the Deputy Prime Minister in his Instructions and Guidance of September 1999. In summary these are: commitment to secure better performance and customer services; the

extent to which extra or earlier investment can be secured; the extent to which passengers will be given a greater voice in the level and standard of services; and value for money to the taxpayer. The Franchising Director has outlined in further detail the criteria for evaluating bids in his Outline Guide to Franchise Replacement of 25 May.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 No direction has been given to the Environment Agency, by the DETR, about increasing the proportion of its staff recruited from ethnic minorities. However, the Environment Agency does have its own Diversity Policy and statement and it is widening its links with ethnic organisations.
<P>

<a name="00612w02.html_para0">None of the current Environment Agency board members are from an ethnic minority background. However, the DETR is taking rigorous action as part of its current equal opportunities plan for public appointments, to appoint more people from this group to the boards of public bodies as a whole. Currently 5.8 per cent. of all appointments are filled by people from ethnic minorities against the Department's present end-2000 target of 6 per cent..

<P>
<a name="00612w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Department intends to commence further research later this year on the effectiveness of catalyst testing and to determine whether the diesel smoke test may need to be changed to enable better testing of low-smoke emission diesels. The projects are due to be completed in phases and we will be reviewing emerging findings as they progress. Additionally, the Vehicle Inspectorate has undertaken a comprehensive programme of re-training for MOT testers to ensure that they are able to carry out testing more consistently and to the standard required.

This was not an appointment to a public body within the ambit of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments but an appointment as an employee of the Secretary of State under the provisions of Section 407 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999. Nevertheless, the recruitment followed a search and selection process involving the use of head hunters and an independent element. This is a temporary appointment.

It had benefited mainly the landless rural poor, most of whose standard of living had significantly improved.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development (1) how much money has been given to the Government of Zimbabwe under the Land Reform and Resettlement Programme, since May 1997; [124335]

<UL>(2) how many Zimbabwean families have benefited from land acquired using Her Majesty's Government funds since 1997;  [124337]

(3) how many farms the Zimbabwean Government have acquired using funds provided by Her Majesty's Government since May 1997.  [124336]<P></UL>

<a name="00612w04.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 In 1996 a land resettlement grant signed in 1981 was closed with &#163;3 million undisbursed because the Government of Zimbabwe had not produced suitable plans to spend it. We have not disbursed funds for land acquisition and resettlement since. We have made clear that land reform and resettlement should be an important part of a poverty reduction programme in Zimbabwe, and supported the principles to govern a future land reform programme agreed at the Donors Conference in 1998. These include poverty reduction, transparency and the rule of law. The Government of Zimbabwe have not implemented the 1998 principles. We made &#163;5 million available to support land resettlement initiatives led by civil society and the private sector.

 The Government receive a variety of suggestions for additional bank holidays to celebrate special occasions.

To ask the Solicitor-General if he will accelerate the programme for modernising the information technology of the Crown Prosecution Service to match the introduction of the new police IT for managing casework. [124913]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w04.html_spmin3"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 I am pleased to report that all CPS offices, including those in Staffordshire, will benefit from a significant investment in IT in 2000-01.
<P>

<a name="00612w04.html_para2">The CPS was awarded &#163;12 million from the Government's Capital Modernisation Fund in July 1999 and this money, together with existing CPS resources, will fund the Connect 42 project. Connect 42 will provide lawyers and caseworkers with access to modern PCs across the 42 CPS Areas for the first time. It will also enable the CPS to have secure electronic mail connections with its partners in the Criminal Justice System, including the police.
<P>

<a name="00612w04.html_para3">A pilot of Connect 42 has been running in Sussex since March 2000. The national roll-out timetable is demanding and is scheduled to start in August 2000 and to be completed in July 2001, in advance of the new police casework system in most Areas. I understand that the detailed timetable for the new police casework system is being developed. The intention is to implement the system in police forces by the end of 2002.
<P>

<a name="00612w04.html_para4">Connect 42 will be followed by step 2 of the Modernisation Programme, the Compass project, which is procuring a Managed Service through a PFI contract. This will use the IT infrastructure of Connect 42, and complement it with a case management system designed to meet the needs of front line CPS staff. It will provide the ability to work with electronic case files and allow information to be exchanged much more easily with other organisations in the criminal justice system through speedier electronic communications between computer systems.

(3) Since the Key Performance Target for Bona Vacantia Division was introduced it has become apparent that the methodology used to assess the number of cases is statistically biased towards non-achievement as it makes no allowance for the differing complexity of individual cases. The target will remain as set for 1999-2000 but the baseline against which performance is judged will be assessed and, if necessary, adjusted to recognise the differing complexity of cases.<P>

<a name="00612w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 As part of the continuing effort to maximise value for money from the Defence Budget, the Army is currently engaged in an internal review of non-deployable posts. The review is due to be completed in the autumn. There are no formal terms of reference for the review, which is being undertaken by the Army chain of command. The aim is to carry out an audit of military posts in the non-deployable Army, in order to inform judgments on the requirement for and priorities for the deployment of military manpower. There are no plans to publish the outcome of the review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 24 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 67W, on the Royal Irish Regiment <i>(a)</i> for what reasons the report of the Special Investigations Branch of the Royal Military Police has not been made and <i>(b)</i> how many of the sub-sections of the Question he is in a position to respond to.  [123885]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The investigation by Special Investigations Branch, Royal Military Police is now complete and I can confirm the following information.
<P>

<a name="00612w05.html_para4">There have been four Parliamentary Questions on this matter including this one and two Parliamentary Inquiries. The photograph was taken on Monday 12 July at Drumadd Barracks, Armagh and shows 59 Officers and soldiers from F Company the 8th Battalion the Royal Irish Regiment (8 R IRISH). The photoshoot was supervised by a Major who took some of the photographs before joining the Company for further photographs, which were 



<P>
<P><I>12 Jun 2000 : Column: 449W</I><P>
taken by a Warrant Officer. The flag was produced by a soldier of the Company who had just come off duty. A commercial photographic service establishment in Belfast developed the film and approximately 40 copies were made and given to members within F Company. No disciplinary action is to be taken against the officer but formal administrative action procedures have been initiated.
<P>

<a name="00612w05.html_para5">Photographs can be taken in all sorts of circumstances which can subsequently be misinterpreted. F Company was deployed on 12 July along with other Army units precisely in order to prevent sectarian violence and it is wrong to label a whole Regiment, or the individuals in the photograph, as bigoted. We expect the highest standards of conduct from all soldiers, and in particular that they should be aware of community sensitivities in Northern Ireland. During 1999 the Royal Irish Regiment collected over &#163;133,000 for cross-community charities. 8 R IRISH also won the prestigious Wilkinson's Sword of Peace for its cross-community work in Armagh. These are examples of their cross-community activities and are not indicative of a biased Regiment.

<a name="00612w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Slovenia is one of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe included in the Ministry of Defence's Outreach Programme of bilateral assistance. My officials hold annual Defence Staff Talks with their Slovenian counterparts and from these discussions a programme of bilateral assistance is constructed. The main area of assistance is in English language training, but we also conduct seminars on various Defence related subjects, discussions on codification and standardisation, and arms control training. There are also VIP and working level short visits to UK by Slovenian Ministry of Defence officials and members of their Armed Forces, including 



<P>
<P><I>12 Jun 2000 : Column: 450W</I><P>
attendance on TA summer camps, and reciprocal visits by UK Ministry of Defence officials and members of UK Armed Forces.

<a name="00612w06.html_para8">At present there are no MOD UK personnel working in Slovenia, however the UK Defence Attache to Slovenia, who is currently cross-accredited to Austria and resident in Vienna, is moving to Slovenia on 13 June 2000. Additionally, an MOD civil servant is due to take up post as Adviser on Defence Policy and Planning in the Slovenian Ministry of Defence in September 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the extent of joint working with Latvia is on military matters; how many UK personnel work in Latvia on training and related matters; and if he will make a statement.  [124887]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The UK has an extensive programme of defence assistance to Latvia as part of the MOD's "Outreach" initiative to promote stability and security in central and eastern Europe. The UK's programme of assistance to Latvia is underpinned by English language training, defence management training and military training which is provided both in-country and in the UK. We also assist Latvia through our contribution to the joint Baltic projects: the Baltic Security Assistance forum; the Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion; the Baltic Naval Squadron; the Baltic Defence College; and the Baltic Air Surveillance Network. Another substantial area of co-operation is the deployment of a 10 strong Latvian contingent with BRITFOR in Kosovo.
<P>

<a name="00612w06.html_para9">Currently we have six personnel working permanently in Latvia on training and related matters, with a civil servant seconded to the Latvian Defence Ministry to advise on programming and budgeting systems and five Royal Marines working with the Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion Training Team. However, Short Term Training Teams (STTTs) provide most of the military training, visiting Latvia for between two weeks to three months each summer; this year the STTTs will involve approximately 15 personnel. In addition to those involved directly in training, the Defence Attache in Riga, assisted by an Assistant Defence Attache, liaises with the Latvian Defence Ministry to ascertain their training and assistance requirements for each year.

 The additional costs of Operation Palliser, the evacuation deployment to Sierra Leone which commenced on 5 May, are still being established, but it is estimated that they will amount to some &#163;8 million. As Operation Palliser is not a United Nations operation, we do not expect to claim any of those costs from the United Nations.

been removed from HMS Sheffield; what plans there are to replace it; and what similar work has been undertaken on other ships of this class.  [125083]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 June 2000]:</i> The Exocet missile launcher has been removed from the batch 2 Type 22 Frigate HMS Sheffield because the variant of the missile used by the RN is now obsolete and no longer in Naval service. There are no plans to replace the launcher. HMS Sheffield remains armed with a potent mixture of weapons and sensors including Seawolf Anti-Air Missiles, Stingray Anti-Submarine Torpedoes and a helicopter able to carry the Sea Skua Anti-ship missile. There are no plans to remove the launchers from the remaining batch 2 vessels in this class as, given their relatively short remaining life, it would not be economic to do so. The latest Batch (3) Type 22 Frigates carry the Harpoon anti-ship missile system.

 <i>[holding answer 8 June 2000]:</i> Following the policy on ballistic missile defence set out in the Strategic Defence Review, the Ministry of Defence is undertaking a three-year programme of studies known as the Technology Readiness and Risk Assessment Programme. This programme is monitoring developments in the risks posed by ballistic missiles and in the technology to counter them. It is due to be completed next summer. The terms of reference for the programme were announced on 27 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 203W. In addition, we are contributing to NATO preparations for studies into the feasibility of theatre ballistic missile defence. We expect these studies to start next year.

 Conduct After Capture (CAC) training is an integral element of the current Aircrew Combat Survival Course (ACSC) held at the RAF School of Combat Survival and Rescue at RAF St. Mawgan. Attendance on the course is a mandatory training requirement for all RAF personnel engaged on operational duties that may make them prone to capture or interrogation. Since September 1992, 1,029 students have

<P>

<a name="00612w07.html_para0">All students on the (CAC) training phase of the course must give their written consent to undergo the training. Prior to participation, all students are made aware of what they will encounter during the training, and they remain at liberty to withdraw from the training at any time, either before participation or during it. Individuals who choose not to undergo the training, or who do not complete the course, will be moved to duties where they would not be prone to capture or interrogation.

 In 1998-99, labour costs are estimated to have represented an average of 16.2 per cent. of the total farm costs of full-time farm business in England. These labour costs include an imputed estimate of the wholly or mainly unpaid labour carried out on the farm, principally by farmers, spouses and other family workers.

 Between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 1999 the capacity of the UK fleet was reduced by 3.2 per cent. in tonnage and 7.7 per cent. in engine power.

<UL>(2) pursuant to his answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) 15 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 47W, what is the average amount by which other benefits have been reduced for families with incomes of less than &#163;12,000 as a result of the Working Families Tax Credit.  [122988]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w08.html_spnew12"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answers 16 and 19 May 2000]:</i> Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) and Disabled Person's Tax Credit (DPTC) were introduced on 5 October 1999. Total expenditure on these tax credits in 1999-2000 is estimated at &#163;0.9 billion, but reliable estimates for each month are not available.
<P>

<a name="00612w08.html_para3">Given the difference in income rules in relation to maintenance, and the fact that it is not possible to isolate behavioural effects (such as the number of families who may have entered work or increased their hours because WFTC provides a more generous work incentive than Family Credit), it is not possible to determine how much would have been spent on FC in 1999-2000 had WFTC not been introduced<i>.</i>
<P>

<a name="00612w08.html_para4">The receipt of Housing Benefit (HB) and Council Tax Benefit (CTB) cannot be determined from information processed for applications for WFTC. The receipt of WFTC by families in receipt of HB and CTB, and hence the saving in HB and CTB for these families, can be determined from the information processed for claims for those benefits. However, for some families the award of WFTC, together with other income available, will mean that there is no entitlement to HB or CTB. The general level of saving on HB and CTB for these families can only be estimated using household survey data on families receiving WFTC. Such data will become available, in sufficient sample numbers to yield reliable estimates, at some time from the second half of 2001.

 When VAT was introduced the construction and extension of any building was zero-rated. In 1984 the relief for extensions was withdrawn. Following infraction proceedings by the European Commission, the relief for constructing new buildings became restricted to only certain types of building in 1989. New buildings used by charities for non-business purposes or as village halls can still be zero-rated. Agreements with our European partners mean that we cannot re-introduce any zero rates that we have given up.

 In light of recent developments which have increased cash receipts this financial year by &#163;19.5 billion more than the Budget forecast, the Government are making the following changes to the Debt Management Office's gilt remit for 2000-01.
<P>

<a name="00612w09.html_para5"><i>Quantity of Gilt Sales</i>
<P>

<a name="00612w09.html_para6">The DMO will aim for gilt sales of &#163;10 billion in 2000-01, a reduction of &#163;2.2 billion on previous plans. There will be no further reductions in gilt sales this financial year.
<P>

<a name="00612w09.html_para7"><i>Amount and Maturity Mix of Conventional Gilt Issuance</i>
<P>

<a name="00612w09.html_para8">DMO will hold two further conventional auctions in the long (15 years and over) maturity area. DMO should aim for total conventional gilt sales of &#163;6.5 billion for 2000-01.
<P>

<a name="00612w09.html_para9"><i>Exercise of contingency measures in the Debt Management Report</i>
<P>

<a name="00612w09.html_para10">HM Treasury will accommodate &#163;5.9 billion of the receipts by pre-financing &#163;3.9 billion of foreign currency debt due to mature in 2001-02 and &#163;2.0 billion of foreign currency debt due to mature in 2002-03. This differs from the &#163;5.7 billion figure in the Debt Management Report due to the fall in sterling against the dollar since the Budget.
<P>

<a name="00612w09.html_para11">The planned Treasury Bill stock will also be reduced by &#163;0.7 billion to &#163;8 billion.

<a name="00612w09.html_para13">The buy-back programme may be increased later in the year to a maximum of &#163;5 billion. This will be decided at the time of the Pre-Budget Report.
<P>

<a name="00612w09.html_para14"><i>Net short term debt</i>
<P>

<a name="00612w09.html_para15">The remaining proceeds (&#163;10.7 billion before any increase in buy-backs) will be used to reduce net short term debt (the Ways and Means balance, Treasury Bills less short term assets). Given that &#163;10 billion of the proceeds are not expected until later in the year, decisions on the composition of the reduction in net short term debt will also be made at the time of the Pre-Budget Report, also taking into account any revision to the forecast Central Government Net Cash Requirement.
<P>

<a name="00612w09.html_para16">The reduction in net debt will be unwound in 2001-02 and 2002-03, reducing gilt sales during this period.

<P>
<a name="00612w10.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 June 2000]:</i> Temporary to permanent fees, provided they are notified by bureaux to hirers before they enter into a contract, are not at present regulated and my Department does not therefore maintain any systematic record of the complaints it receives about their imposition. Representations about the adverse effects of transfer fees were received from end-users, agencies, various trade associations and others during the course of the consultation last year. My Department has reason to believe that a substantial number of hirers, who have not negotiated satisfactory terms with bureaux, are deterred from offering permanent work to temporary workers because of the inclusion of transfer fee clauses in bureaux' terms of business.

<P>
(4) what assessment his Department has made of the case for regulations to ensure that recruitment agencies can protect themselves from end-users, or other agencies, poaching from their contractor base; and if he will make a statement.  [125185]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w10.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 June 2000]:</i> Our proposal to limit the period of quarantine that bureaux may impose, to a maximum of four weeks, seeks to protect the interests of those using bureaux, to secure the proper conduct of bureaux and to promote labour market flexibility. I do not have power under the Employment Agencies Act 1973 in relation to the conduct of hirers. Bureaux will be able to protect their interests by a variety of means, such as by settling satisfactory transfer terms with hirers or by offering attractive employment terms to workers. In sectors such as IT, bureaux will continue to be able to arrange fixed length contracts with hirers and workers so that they have certainty over the period during which they may recoup costs. Bureaux supplying non-specialist manual workers will continue to be able to negotiate terms that suit them and their clients such as, for example, by providing that no transfer fee is payable once a minimum number of weeks' hire have elapsed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what reasons underlay the decision to sell the waste incinerator plant at Northwick Park Hospital.  [123580]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The then Northwick Park and St. Mark's Hospitals National Health Service Trust made a decision in 1996 to pursue the sale of its waste incinerator plant. This was based upon the view that, with waste disposal forming a non-core element of the Trust's activities, it would be prudent to explore the possible benefits of a partnership with the private sector that might facilitate the integration of clinical waste disposal into a wider and more environmentally-friendly waste management strategy.

Laron Dwarfism; and what assistance his Department provides to support groups for children with growth problems as a result of this condition.  [124492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Children with short stature resulting from Laron Dwarfism and other rare conditions are provided diagnostic and follow up care from paediatric endocrinologists who work closely with other specialists. Each region has such a service and for exceptionally rare disorders care can be provided from a national centre. Where growth is limited, psychological and practical support is available through the National Health Service. Voluntary organisations also play a key part in supporting children with growth problems. Although my Department does not at present provide assistance to these organisations, there is provision for them to apply under Section 64 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 for assistance.

 <i>[holding answer 8 June 2000]:</i> This procedure is available on the National Health Service. However, it is a relatively new and unproven procedure and as such should normally be performed as part of a controlled clinical trial. The Safety and Efficacy Register of New Interventional Procedures (SERNIP), run by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, is the mechanism for assessing new surgical procedures. SERNIP considered there was not yet sufficient information to make a full assessment of the safety and efficacy of metal on metal resurfacing of hip joints.

<P>
<a name="00612w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 In the 12 months prior to 31 May 2000, the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) received 19 reports of adverse incidents involving silicone gel breast implants. MDA have not identified any trends which suggest there is a problem with the performance of any particular model of silicone gel breast implant. MDA continues to record and review all reports of problems with silicone gel breast implants received via the Adverse Incident Centre. This information is regularly reviewed by the Independent Review Group.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Department has received no new evidence recently that silicone gel breast implants are causing illness. The Independent Review Group on silicone gel breast implants continues to meet twice a year to monitor emerging scientific data on this subject. In March 2000, the Group confirmed that there was no need to revise the conclusions reached in 1998.

<a name="00612w13.html_para1">We are addressing this in two ways. We will soon be publishing a Department of Health information leaflet for women considering breast implants.

<P>
<a name="00612w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w13.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We support the collection and provision of as much information as possible and the Medical Devices Agency has increased funding of the National Breast Implant Registry to improve compliance monitoring. Any legislation would however be coercive and would invalidate the individual's consent to surgery.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how recipients of breast implants and doctors are informed of the reporting facility of the Adverse Incident Centre within the Medical Devices Agency.  [125462]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w13.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 At the beginning of each year, the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) writes to chief executives of trusts, health authorities and primary care trusts reminding them of their obligation to report adverse incidents involving medical devices, including breast implants, to the Adverse Incident Centre. MDA also encourages trusts to appoint MDA liaison officers, whose role is to co-ordinate adverse incident reporting and the dissemination of safety information about medical devices within the trust.
<P>

<a name="00612w13.html_para5">As the adverse incident reporting system is focused upon healthcare professionals and medical device manufacturers, MDA does not systematically inform recipients of breast implants of the system. Information on the system is however publicly available via the MDA worldwide website.

 The Department is undergoing a fundamental review of its central and support functions in order to focus resources on delivering front line services to customers. A small Performance Management Unit (PMU) has been established within the Benefits Agency to drive out performance improvement in the Agency's 13 Area Directorates (AD) and the Disability and Carer Benefits Directorate (DCBD). The additional annual cost of this team is estimated at &#163;100,000. There were no set up costs. In addition to the PMU, each AD and the DCBD has a Performance Improvement Action Team (PIAT) to provide support to local managers.
<P>

<a name="00612w14.html_para1">The aim is to improve significantly front line service delivery within the resources already set and allocated in the Comprehensive Spending Review.

 Area Benefit Reviews provide a continuous measurement of fraud and error in Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance in each of the Benefits Agency's 13 Area Directorates. The data collected are rolled up to provide a national picture.

<a name="00612w14.html_para4">Our target is to reduce by 30 per cent. benefit losses from fraud and error in Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance by March 2007, with at least a 10 per cent. reduction by 2002.

[124547]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 During the lifetime of this Parliament the extra total cost of the minimum income guarantee (MIG) for pensioners over and above the cost of Income Support for which pensioners were previously eligible is estimated to be &#163;2.2 billion pounds in real terms.
<P>

<a name="00612w16.html_para0">One 29 May the MIG Take-up Campaign was launched to encourage pensioners who may be entitled to claim their MIG. Around &#163;15 million will be spent over the course of the campaign which includes national TV advertising, writing to around two million pensioners whose records indicate that they may be entitled, and the introduction of a tele-claims centre with specially trained operators who can help complete the paperwork to claim the MIG.
<P>

<a name="00612w16.html_para1">Since the launch was announced at the end of March, there have already been around 50,000 calls to the tele-claims centre, and 24,000 MIG claim packs have been sent to pensioners.

 No specific allocation was made to the Benefits Agency either nationally or locally for increasing benefit take-up.

 The report entitled "Administering Elections in Northern Ireland" contained a number of recommendations to counter the issue of electoral abuse and it is our intention to implement as many of them as is practical.
<P>

<a name="00612w16.html_para5">One of the major recommendations was the introduction of smart cards for voters. This remains our objective but further work is needed before we can be confident that a reliable, cost-effective system exists that would be resistant to abuse. However, the Government have already introduced legislation to extend the time available to the Chief Electoral Officer to scrutinise absent vote applications and has extended to Northern Ireland the provisions of the Representation of the People Act which makes provision for rolling registration and hence a more accurate electoral register. Additionally, officials are exploring the role which enhanced computerisation and increased staffing might play in assisting the Chief Electoral Officer in the scrutiny process.
<P>

<a name="00612w16.html_para6">Many of the other recommendations contained in the report will require legislation by bill. We would hope to find Parliamentary time for this before the General Election, but the timing of this will depend on the time of the election.

The report concluded that the data examined did not obviously implicate radioactive pollution in the Irish Sea as an underlying factor in determining the patterns in Northern Ireland of the conditions studied. To facilitate ongoing research and surveillance, the report recommended that a system of cancer registration should be established. Since the establishment of the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry in 1993, there is now a complete and accurate database on cancer incidence in Northern Ireland which facilitates the monitoring of the health of the population on an ongoing basis. Analysis so far continued to support the findings of the 1989 study.

<a name="00612w17.html_para0">As regards monitoring of radiation levels, currently the Environment and Heritage Service's Industrial Pollution and Radiochemical Inspectorate in Northern Ireland conducts routine monitoring of the impact of Sellafield discharges on the Northern Ireland coastline. In addition, independent monitoring is conducted by District Council Environmental Health Officers under the auspices of the Norther Ireland Radiation Monitoring Committee. Both sets of monitoring continue to indicate that the levels of radioactivity measured are of negligible radiological significance.

QUEST plans to publish the first phase of its report, which focuses on applications for Lottery grants of up to &#163;100,000, shortly. The second phase, dealing with applications for grants of &#163;100,000 plus, will be published later in the year.

<i>Prison Service</i>
<BR>
The Prison Service fully recognises the needs of prisoners' families, particularly with regard to the need for support; maintaining regular contact with imprisoned family members; and the opportunity to contribute to regimes and rehabilitation programmes. Much of this is achieved through working in partnership with prisoners' families support groups, listening to people's concerns. The Prison Service co-ordinates the Family Ties Consultative Group which includes a number of these groups and is tasked with assisting the development of policy and good practice.
<BR>
Further support is provided by way of funding to the umbrella organisation, the Federation of Prisoners' Families Support Groups, as well as to CLINKS which is working with the Service to develop the relationship between the voluntary sector and prisons. An increasing number of establishments also provide facilities for visiting families such as visitors' centres and play areas in visits rooms. The latter has been supported by funding for the lead organisation in this area, Kids Visiting In Prisons (KIDS VIP).
<BR>
<i>Youth Justice Board</i>
<BR>
The Youth Justice Board for England and Wales is a Non-departmental Public Body of the Home Office that has been in operation since September 1998. One of its functions is to advise the Government on standards for service delivery in the youth justice system.
<BR>
Reinforcing the responsibilities of parents is one of the Youth Justice Board's key aims and objectives.
<BR>
Projects are delivered by youth offending teams in partnership with a wide range of specialist organisations such as ParentLine, Coram Family and Barnardos.
<BR>
Some of the projects the Youth Justice Board have sponsored include:
<BR>
an 18 month project in Liverpool to extend support for parents involved or at risk of being involved in the youth justice system. The project will focus on support provided to families with persistent young offenders and those involved in Final Warnings; and
<BR>
an 18 month project in Liverpool to help the Youth Offending Teams and other practitioners understand the impact family breakdown and change can have on young people and the functioning of their families. Project findings will be delivered to Youth Offending Teams and other practitioners.
<BR>
<i>Services to promote racial equality</i>
<BR>
The Home Office has recently launched a new race equality grants programme, "Connecting Communities", to help marginalised minority ethnic communities at grass roots level. The grants aim to empower communities, enabling them to have greater access to and influence over policy makers and service providers. &#163;12 million will be made available through the programme over three years.
<BR>
The programme aims to:
<BR>
help people in marginalised communities gain new skills and combat disaffection and disengagement within communities;
<BR>
work on joint initiatives with other faith and community groups to build strong community networks;
<BR>
provide opportunities for young people to participate in seminars, mentoring and job shadowing opportunities with Home Office services, for example, the police and fire service;
<BR>
celebrate minority ethnic achievements to counteract racist and negative stereotyping.

We support the Association of Chief Police Officers' policy that breath tests should be carried out at all crashes which the police attend. Those motorists who fail that screening test are then normally required to take an evidential breath test at the police station. Failure of that test provides the evidence for prosecution. In certain situations detailed in the Act, a blood sample may be taken by the police in place of an evidential breath sample and it is required where the motorist is suspected of driving when unfit through drugs.

 The role and responsibilities of the Immigration Services Commissioner are set out in Part V of, and in Part I of Schedule 5 and Schedule 6 to, the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The Act prohibits any person or organisation from providing immigration advice or services unless that person or organisation is registered with the Immigration Services Commissioner, authorised to practise by a designated professional body, or is exempt under the terms of the scheme.
<P>

<a name="00612w22.html_para5">The Immigration Services Commissioner will publish the criteria for registration, will receive applications for registration and will determine whether individuals and organisations are competent and otherwise fit to provide immigration advice and services. The Commissioner will also consider cases for exemption. Exemption is likely to be sought by organisations from the voluntary, health and education sectors and the Commissioner will ensure that these organisations meet satisfactory standards.
<P>

<a name="00612w22.html_para6">The Commissioner will establish a complaints scheme and may investigate and determine complaints made against immigration advisers, including members of the designated professional bodies. Remedies available to the Commissioner on finding a complaint proven include powers to require a registered person to re-apply for registration without delay, to withdraw an exemption or to refer a disciplinary charge to the Immigration Services Tribunal. The power to discipline members of a designated professional body remains with the relevant professional body, but the Commissioner has power to refer his findings to the relevant professional body and to impose a timetable for that body to consider the complaint and, where appropriate, to take disciplinary action.
<P>

<a name="00612w22.html_para7">The Commissioner also has a duty to promote good practice by those who provide immigration advice or services.

<a name="00612w22.html_para8">The Government believe that the activities of the Commissioner, together with other initiatives such as the establishment of the Community Legal Service, will provide a comprehensive and coherent strategy for rooting out unscrupulous and incompetent immigration advisers and service providers, while supporting those providing a quality service. In this way standards in the immigration advice sector will be improved.

The selection process is a rolling programme and therefore those who have applied since January 2000 are unlikely to have completed all selection elements. The percentage take-up rates of places offered is based on those individuals who were offered employment and accepted.

 On just processes, the Lord Chancellor's Department, the Home Office and the Law Officers Department are jointly monitoring the number of cases that are dismissed because the magistrates find that there is no case to answer, and non-jury acquittals in the Crown Court.
<P>

<a name="00612w23.html_para6">For just outcomes, the three Departments are monitoring the number of successful appeals against sentence; the number of successful appeals by the prosecution on the basis that the original sentence is unduly lenient; and the number of criminal cases in which there is a successful appeal to the Divisional Court by way of case stated or judicial review.

 The Business Plan follows the definition of disorder used by the police service, i.e. a breach of the peace of which the police are aware, which may require police intervention or action in partnership with others. Racist or homophobic incidents and incidents involving or arising out of disturbances in public places, licensed premises or private property, drunkenness, domestic incidents, marches and demonstrations, civil disputes, neighbour disputes, public or sports events, hunt sabotage, and other unlisted types of disorder or nuisance will all count towards the total.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if a decision not to prosecute or to discontinue a prosecution will count as a disposal for the purposes of meeting the Government's objective of reducing the time taken from arrest to disposal, as set out on page 4 of the Criminal Justice System Business Plan 2000-01.  [125623]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w23.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The timeliness measure for the time taken from arrest to sentence or other disposal for all offenders is currently collected from charge. It excludes cases where there is a decision not to prosecute before the first listing at a magistrates court. Cases discontinued at or after first listing at a magistrates court are counted as disposals in the calculation of the measure; cases that are discontinued at the Crown court also count as disposals except where the indictment is left to lie on file as a result of a prosecution application before the first main hearing.

 I meet the First Secretary on a weekly basis to discuss a variety of issues including the New Deal for over 50s, which is a UK Government scheme. The national roll-out of the New Deal for over 50s was launched on 3 April this year at Merthyr College by the Prime Minister, although a pilot has been in operation in Flintshire and Wrexham since October 1999.

Within the framework set by the European Commission, all concerned have tried to include, so far as possible revised proposals reflecting local and national priorities.

 <i>[holding answer 24 May 2000]:</i> Secondments and attachments are part of the Government's approach to interchange which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the Civil Service and other organisations. All sectors of the economy are involved: voluntary, public and private. Interchange is a key component of the Government's agenda for Civil Service reform.

<P>
<a name="00612w25.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Pike: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment he has made of the impact of the New Deal on employment in <i>(a)</i> Lancashire, <i>(b)</i> the North-West Region and <i>(c)</i> Burnley.  [123556]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w25.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 3,971 young people in Lancashire had found work through the New Deal by the end of March 2000. The equivalent figures for the North-West and Burnley are 30,921 and 260 respectively.
<P>

<a name="00612w25.html_para3">It is likely to prove difficult to assess the impact of New Deal on specific localities. Independent evaluation at national level has, however, shown that New Deal helps people leave unemployment more quickly and has increased employment, and reduced unemployment, by more than would otherwise have happened. It has also suggested that the programme will be close to self-financing.
<P>

<a name="00612w25.html_para4">With the help of New Deal, long-term youth unemployment has been virtually eliminated. Since April 1998 the number of 18-24 year olds claiming JSA for more than a year has fallen from 400 to 50 in Lancashire, from 6,700 to 800 in the North-West and from 12 to two in Burnley.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what measures he is taking to alert school leavers to the availability of New Deal options. [123878]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w25.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 General information about New Deal and the options is available to school leavers through the Careers Service. There are, however, no plans to promote options in any detail to this group as we hope that they will move into work before they become eligible to join New Deal through the help and advice offered either by the Careers Service or by the Employment Service.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w25.html_wqn8"><B> Dr. Iddon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> carried out and <i>(b)</i> commissioned into the reasons for which people leave the unemployment register while remaining unemployed instead of entering the New Deal Gateway.  [123880]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w25.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Young people leave Jobseeker's Allowance at all stages of their unemployment duration and not just at the point of joining New Deal. Information on the reasons for leaving Jobseeker's Allowance by duration of unemployment is published monthly by the Office for National Statistics in Labour Market Trends.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00612w25.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Unemployed offenders and discharged remand prisoners have equal access to employment, training and education and are able to count the period of detention towards the qualifying period for Employment Service programmes. They may enter New Deal from the first day after being released.
<P>

<a name="00612w25.html_para5">Separate management information is not collected on the number of offenders who enter ES programmes, so monitoring of progress overall cannot be undertaken nationally. However, the progress of individuals may be monitored locally by the Employment Service and Probation Service as part of working in partnership with each other.
<P>

<a name="00612w25.html_para6">To help with the transition from custody to employment, the Employment Service have developed a National Framework Document that assists agencies to establish and develop local agreements. The National Framework has been developed in close working partnership with the Prison Service, the Probation Service, the Benefits Agency and the TEC National Council. Local agreements ensure that offenders are aware of employment, training and education opportunities open to them and their responsibility to find work.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the Employment Service is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning the distances people live from a Jobcentre and the definition of a reasonable distance when determining access to a Jobcentre. These are issues which fall within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am afraid that we do not collect information about the distances at which jobseekers, or the population more generally, live from their nearest Jobcentre. However, with over 1000 Jobcentres nationwide, very many people will live within 3 miles of the one nearest to them.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As to the definition of a "reasonable distance", it may be helpful to explain that jobseekers are normally required by regulations made under the Jobseeker's Act 1995 to attend a Jobcentre in person each fortnight in order to confirm that they are available and actively seeking work and that their circumstances have remained unchanged. Where, however, a jobseeker lives more than one hour, by public transport (in either direction), from their nearest Jobcentre; or if their attendance would result in an absence from home of more than four hours; or if they have a mental or physical disability which restricts their mobility, then they will be offered the opportunity to have their claims dealt with by post.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition Jobcentre Managers may also exercise discretion in offering this facility to other jobseekers, even if their journey is possible within the time limits set out above, in circumstances where it would be unreasonable to expect a jobseeker to attend; for example, where they would have to use a form of transport which they could not be expected to use on a fortnightly basis, such as an Intercity train, a ferry or a plane.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many limited jobseeker's agreements for disabled people and people suffering long-term illness were in force in <i>(a)</i> 1997, <i>(b)</i> 1998, <i>(c)</i> 1999 and <i>(d)</i> 2000 to date.  [125402]<P>

 Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations allow people with physical and mental health problems to restrict their availability in any way providing the restrictions are reasonable in the light of their condition. Jobseekers agree any restrictions with advisers when they draw up their Jobseeker's Agreement when they first claim Jobseeker's Allowance. By detecting health problems at an early stage we can help jobseekers who may be entitled to alternative benefits; identify circumstances which may affect their attendance and offer any help or special arrangements that are needed.
<P>

<a name="00612w26.html_para3">We do not hold information about how many jobseekers there are who place restrictions for the reasons about which the hon. Gentleman asks. Statistics are available on the number of claims referred to and decisions made by the adjudication authorities, now decision makers, where there is a doubt on availability because an unreasonable restriction has been identified.
<P>

<a name="00612w26.html_para4">The hon. Gentleman may be interested to know that since the introduction of Jobseeker's Allowance in October 1996, the number of decisions given by the adjudicating authorities on questions of restricted availability has reduced considerably. In the year from April 1995 to March 1996, 27,851 claims were disallowed because of restrictions placed on claimant's availability. In the year to April 1997 only 17,243 disallowances were recorded. The figures for 1997-98, were 14,273; for 1998-99, were 8,627; and for year ending April 2000, were 7,906. These reductions reflect not only the fall in numbers of unemployed but the way in which Jobseeker's Allowance is underpinned by an individually tailored Jobseeker's Agreement for each client taking into account their personal circumstances.

Commission published a proposal under Article 13 for a framework directive dealing with discrimination in employment and training on grounds which included disability. The UK welcomes proposals under Article 13 to improve the condition of disabled people in the European Union. The framework directive on employment and training, which is currently being negotiated, will set out the broad principles to be achieved, but will leave implementation to individual member states. The UK Government are seeking to secure certain changes to the drafting of the proposed directive to meet the approach and framework developed on disability discrimination in the United Kingdom. The Commission has not put forward any legislative proposals relating to the provision of services or access to premises for people with disabilities.
