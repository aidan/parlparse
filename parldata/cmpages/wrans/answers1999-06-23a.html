<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The State Retirement Pension consists of basic pension, graduated retirement benefit and additional pension (SERPS).<P>

2. In 1996-97, &#163;61.15 was equal to the level of the full basic pension for a single person; &#163;97.75 was equal to the level of the full basic pension for one person plus adult dependant.<P>

3. Gross weekly income from State Retirement Pension is measured in current (1996-97) prices.<P>

4. Estimates should be treated with caution since results are based on survey respondents' identification of different elements of benefit income and therefore may be subject to misreporting.<P>

5. The distribution of pensioners' incomes, used to identify the poorest 20 per cent. is calculated using unequivalised net income before housing costs. The distribution is calculated separately for single pensioners and pensioner couples.<P>

6. Estimates are rounded to the nearest 1 per cent. although they are not necessarily accurate to that level. Columns may not sum to 100 per cent. due to rounding.<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data set which is based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS does not include Northern Ireland. 1996-97 is the latest year for which information is available.<P>

2. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say 'actual' income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household).<P>

3. Results may be sensitive to the choice of equivalence scale.<P>

4. It is standard HBAI practice to give results for income both before and after housing costs, in order to allow for the effect of variations in housing costs between households.<P>

5. Component percentages may not sum to one hundred due to rounding.<P>





6. It should be noted that the FRS only covers those individuals living in private households. Therefore the figures quoted above do not include those individuals living in institutions (in this case, for example, hospitals and retirement/nursing homes).<P>

7. It should also be noted that analyses of quality of the survey suggest that response rates are likely to be lower for those aged over 80 and therefore any survey data based on this age group may be more prone to bias than that for the population as a whole.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90623w02.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Rooney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what action his Department is taking to improve clearance times for appeals.  [88212]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90623w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The new Executive Agency of the DSS responsible for the administration of appeals will be set up from April 2000, for which demanding targets will be set. In preparation for this change, responsibility for the administration of appeals passed to the Secretary of State from the President of the Independent Tribunal Service (ITS) on 1 June. The phased implementation of the new appeals procedures introduced in the Social Security Act 1998 will continue during the rest of the year and preparations will be made for Agency launch.
<P>

<a name="90623w02.htm_para0">Appeals have been taking, on average, around 7 months to be heard and this is wholly unacceptable. During the past year, ITS has taken action to improve the situation and in 1998-99 began to make significant in-roads into its backlog of cases, ITS figures showing a record case clearance of 370,008 cases. However, there remains much to do before ITS/The Appeals Service reaches an acceptable level of performance.
<P>

<a name="90623w02.htm_para1">A dual strategy to achieve the necessary improvements during 1999-2000 has been agreed with the new Chief Executive of ITS/The Appeals Service. First, ITS/The Appeals Service is mounting a systematic assault on its backlog of older and oldest appeals (defined for this exercise as any case lodged with ITS before 1 October 1998). Secondly, and in parallel to tackling this finite backlog of cases, ITS/The Appeals Service is seeking to 



<P>
<P><I>23 Jun 1999 : Column: 371</I><P>
reduce both the numbers of all other cases outstanding and the length of time individual appellants have to wait for their appeals to be dealt with.
<P>

<a name="90623w02.htm_para2">In assessing performance during the coming year we have therefore agreed to monitor two new performance indicators. First, we will be monitoring the number of cases in the backlog and the length of time for which these cases have been outstanding. It is the intention that the vast majority of these cases should be cleared by the end of 1999-2000. Secondly, for cases not in the backlog, we will be monitoring the age profile of outstanding cases, by month; and the age profile of cases which have been cleared, by month. This will give a clear picture of how long appellants still in the ITS/The Appeals Service queue have been waiting, and how long those cases have just been cleared actually had to wait. While efforts are being concentrated on the backlog in the early part of the year, progress here will not be as quick as we would like, but the intention is that both waiting times and clearance times will have been reduced by the end of 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="90623w02.htm_para3">The use of average clearance times as the key indicator of performance has not provided appellants, commentators, or ITS itself with a true picture of the levels of performance being achieved. First, average clearance times mask a wide range of performance and, in past years, did not expose the full extent of the backlog of cases which was building up. Secondly, average clearance times actually provide a perverse incentive not to clear backlog cases--the more effective ITS/The Appeals Service is in tackling its backlog of older cases, the less successful it appears in terms of average clearance 



<P>
<P><I>23 Jun 1999 : Column: 372</I><P>
times as cases which have been outstanding for too long are brought to account. Thirdly, the new performance indicators will provide a better picture of exactly how the caseload is being affected by the changes, which are being phased in over the coming months. And, additionally, the new appeals processes presently being introduced would in any event mean that future clearance times statistics were not directly comparable with those for past years.
<P>

<a name="90623w02.htm_para4">This dual strategy has already paid dividends in terms of performance in the last few months. At the end of February, ITS/The Appeals Service figures showed that the backlog contained 70,348 cases and represented almost 50 per cent. of the caseload. By the end of May, the backlog had been reduced to 34,194 cases. During April and May, a total of 64,647 cases were cleared. Due to the changes which came on stream in April, the intake of appeals in April and May has been much lower than usual--ITS/The Appeals Service has taken full advantage of this opportunity and the cumulative effect of the record clearances and lower intake has been that, by the end of May, the outstanding caseload has fallen below 100,000, to 99,410, for the first time since November 1995.

However, organisers of many proposed events have not yet confirmed the extent of these events. There will be a need for maximum operational deployment of river police both to police the areas involved and to support other agencies, such as the Port of London Authority.

 The particular skills required by new entrant prison officers who will work with young offenders aged under 18 include, tolerance, commitment and the ability to deal with and positively influence the behaviour of young people. These requirements have been reflected in additions to the competence questionnaire which forms part of the application form and in additional exercises at the job simulation assessment centres used in the recruitment of prison officers.

 The main thrust of the Prison Service education policy is the improvement of basic and key skills through the prison education core curriculum which includes basic skills, information technology, social and life skills and English for speakers of other languages. The curriculum's emphasis on improving the employability of young offenders and juveniles increases their rehabilitation prospects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90623w03.htm_spnew13"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Home Office has a long established policy of developing, implementing and evaluating rehabilitative programmes for young offenders, either directly or by commissioning them from outside bodies and academics.
<P>

<a name="90623w03.htm_para6">A wide range of such programmes have been examined over a long period of time--including programmes addressing offender behaviour (for example sex and violence offenders), particular offender problems (for example drugs and alcohol abuse problems), educational and numerical deficits, social skills deficits, parenting and other offending issues.
<P>

<a name="90623w03.htm_para7">As a result, the Home Office has concluded that the most effective rehabilitative interventions are those carefully matched to the particular needs of offenders, those which employ a cognitive-behavioural approach to their work, and those which are closely managed and delivered by well trained staff. Programme accreditation--ensuring that programmes have to meet (and continue to meet) an established body of criteria in order to be recognised as effective programmes (and which can be supported by the prison or probation services)--is also an established way of helping to ensure effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="90623w03.htm_para8">Wherever possible, these principles inform the development of regimes and programmes for young offenders.

<P>

<a name="90623w04.htm_para1">The high proportion of positive findings is likely to be as a result of the absence of specific training or other aids to identifying drug impaired drivers, so that police officers arrest only motorists who are obviously and grossly impaired. Moreover, before a sample can be taken a police surgeon has to agree that drugs are an explanation for the motorist's condition.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment his Department has made from previous solar eclipses of eye damage caused by exposure to the sun's rays; and if such evidence was used as the basis for Government guidelines.  [87446]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90623w05.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Anecdotal evidence suggests that, in 1927, 13 people lost their sight due to retinal burns caused by viewing the sun directly during the last total eclipse visible from the United Kingdom. More recently, the Manchester Royal Eye Hospital carried out a study of patients presenting for treatment following the partial eclipse that occurred on 30 May 1984. They identified 11 patients of whom 7 suffered some enduring deterioration in visual acuity.
<P>

<a name="90623w05.htm_para9">This evidence prompted us to collaborate with the optical professions in preparation of a guidance leaflet which is about to be published. It warns that looking directly at the sun is very dangerous. The radiation could permanently damage the eye. The safest way to view the eclipse is indirectly with, for example, a pinhole projection viewer. If people ignore this advice and decide to use a solar filter or a pair of eclipse spectacles, they do so at their own risk. They would be well advised to buy the device from a reputable outlet and ensure that it had a CE mark to show it had been approved under the Personal Protective Equipment Directive and also ensure that it came with full instructions for use, that it fitted closely to the face and that the lenses were not scratched or damaged.

Gp Capt Morley, the UK officer responsible for the establishment of an air port of disembarkation (APOD) for NATO forces at Pristina airport, has also held discussions with Russian officers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90623w09.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Following a two year pilot scheme of the use of the Military Provost Guard Service to carry out armed guarding duties at a number of Army establishments, I have decided, subject to consultation, to extend the scheme. Over five years, the Military Provost Guard Service will initially expand from its existing strength of 118 local engagement regulars to a strength of over 600, providing armed guarding services to a total of 27 Army establishments nation-wide. They will in most cases replace Ministry of Defence Police who currently carry out armed guarding duties but who will in future concentrate on their primary role of carrying out constabulary duties. Where the MPGS replace MDP they will provide a cost-effective method of guarding, achieving savings rising to over &#163;7 million per annum by comparison with existing arrangements once the scheme is fully up and running. This will be done without any changes to security standards. There will be consultation with the Defence Police Federation on these proposals which will involve a reduction in the overall numbers of MOD Police.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimates he has made of the number and percentage of private sector landlords whose rent is derived from housing benefit in each local authority area in England.  [87349]<P>

<P>
<a name="90623w09.htm_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90623w09.htm_para1">The information requested is not available in the format requested as the Department does not collect data on the total number of private sector landlords. The table gives information on the number of tenants in receipt of rent allowance in each local authority.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions on what date the Highways Agency staged the mock accident in the George Green Tunnel, Wanstead; what the results were; and if he will make a statement.  [87278]<P>

<a name="90623w10.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 A limited staged incident was held on 28 May 1999 in the George Green Tunnel. It was arranged to give the London Fire Brigade the opportunity to react to and deal with a mock accident within the tunnel, before it is opened to traffic. In addition a smoke generator was employed to confirm that smoke from an incident would dissipate from the tunnel. Both

exercises were carried out successfully and the Highways Agency is expecting to receive a copy of the fire brigade's report on the exercise in due course.
<P>

<a name="90623w10.htm_para0">A full staged incident, involving all the emergency services, will be undertaken after the whole of the A12 Hackney to M11 Link Road works are completed in the autumn. Staged incidents are carried out as a normal part of the Highways Agency's safety procedures and in this tunnel, are likely to be repeated every few years.

 We ran special adverts, referring to World Environment Day, on TV and Radio as part of the 'Are You Doing Your Bit?' campaign which was launched on 17 June. The theme of the campaign--the impact individuals can make to improve the environment--is closely linked with the World Environment Day theme, 'Our Earth--Our Future--Just Save it!'.

<a name="90623w10.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 For those Transport and Works Act applications that have been decided following a public inquiry, the average time taken from receipt of the Inspector's report to decision has been 11 months.

<a name="90623w10.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The operation of the Transport and Works Act 1992 is constantly kept under review. Although we have no immediate plans to amend the Act itself, we do intend shortly to revise the Rules governing the procedures for dealing with applications for orders under Part I of the Act. The new Rules will implement the revised EC Directive on environmental impact assessments and will make a number of improvements based on experience of operating the existing Rules.

<a name="90623w10.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Special Waste Regulations 1996, implementing the Hazardous Waste Directive, classify certain difficult to handle wastes as special. In general all mineral oils, for example hydraulic oils and lubricating oils, are likely to be special wastes. The Landfill Directive is not expected to have any impact on waste classification.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90623w10.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 All sectors will need to play their part in achieving our climate change targets, including the legally binding Kyoto target of a 12.5 per cent. reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the period 2008 to 2012 compared with 1990. By changing relative prices, the climate change levy will help stimulate the implementation of further measures to improve energy efficiency in all sectors of business. These measures are expected to lead to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 1.5 million tonnes carbon per annum by 2010. The revenue from the levy will be recycled in full to business, principally through a 0.5 per cent. cut in employers' NICs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90623w10.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 June 1999]:</i> We will honour the commitment made in the White Paper, "A Mayor and Assembly for London" (Cm 3897) to transfer Taxicard to Transport for London (TfL). However, we have also indicated that the precise timing of the transfer will be for the Mayor to decide, in the context of his or her overall transport strategy. That is the most sensible way forward, given the current complexity of the scheme, which is operated, on a discretionary basis, by only 29 boroughs with differing levels of funding and services.
<P>

<a name="90623w10.htm_para3">Subject to the passage of the Greater London Authority Bill, the Mayor will have the necessary powers to effect the transfer of the Taxicard scheme, or to operate a similar scheme. I made clear on 25 February 1999, <i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> column 865, that the GLA Bill provisions concerning London boroughs' Local Implementation Plans will be able to deal with Taxicard. The Mayor will be required to include in his or her transport strategy proposals for the provision of transport which is accessible to persons with mobility problems. Those proposals will doubtless include measures on how Taxicard and services like it should be operated. The Mayor will be able to require the boroughs to reflect those proposals in their Local Implementation Plans. Each borough will be required to submit these plans to the Mayor for his or her approval.

<P>
<a name="90623w11.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. White: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement about the consultation exercise earlier this year on tenant participation compacts.  [88073]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90623w11.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 On 25 January 1999 we published the consultation paper, "Tenant Participation Compacts". This put forward the Government's proposals for increasing tenant involvement through negotiation of local agreements (tenant participation compacts) between local authority landlords and tenants on how tenants are involved in local decisions relating to their homes.
<P>

<a name="90623w11.htm_para2">The consultation paper flowed from the work of the Best Value in Housing Steering Group, whose work also informed the consultation paper Best Value in Housing Framework on which I made a separate announcement on 25 May 1999.
<P>

<a name="90623w11.htm_para3">Consultation on the framework for tenant participation compacts ended on 31 March 1999. We received 386 responses from across a wide range of local authorities, tenant and resident associations, housing associations, housing groups and individual tenants.
<P>

<a name="90623w11.htm_para4">These responses have been considered and have informed the "National Framework for Tenant Participation Compacts" which is being launched today.
<P>

<a name="90623w11.htm_para5">The consultation showed overwhelming agreement with the principle of developing tenant participation through compacts, building on existing good practice. Respondents also identified the links between best value in housing and tenant participation as fundamental to giving tenants a real say in local decision making. However, tenants, officers and elected members would need to work together to make compacts successful.
<P>

<a name="90623w11.htm_para6">In supporting the principles behind compacts, a number of respondents raised resource, staffing and budgetary concerns relating to the implementation of compacts. We accept that there are likely to be some initial set up costs in implementing compacts properly, and I am making available &#163;12 million to local authorities over the next two years, specifically to help them and their tenants to implement compacts.
<P>

<a name="90623w11.htm_para7">The national framework for tenant participation compacts is a toolkit to help local authorities and tenants develop, implement and review their local compacts, including the standards considered necessary to ensure meaningful and sustainable tenant participation.
<P>

<a name="90623w11.htm_para8">It will allow compacts to be tailored to meet the needs of the local area and to reach specific groups of tenants such as the elderly, young people, or ethnic minority tenants. (Compacts can also be developed to involve the wider community or to extend beyond housing services where tenants and local authorities wish). The framework also takes account of respondents' concerns that new tenants' groups should be encouraged and that demands on existing organisations should be reasonable. However, tenants' organisations with a role in decision-making will be expected to be accountable, democratic and open to all tenants.




<P>
<P><I>23 Jun 1999 : Column: 412</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90623w11.htm_para9">The framework does not impose particular structures. It will allow compacts to de developed at a pace at which tenants are comfortable and which they can sustain; and tenants can choose how they will be involved and what they will be involved in.
<P>

<a name="90623w11.htm_para10">We recognise that not all tenants and councils will be able to implement compacts that meet the full needs of tenants by 1 April 2000. Nonetheless, by that date, we will expect all tenants and local authorities to have agreed the final outcomes expected from compacts and have in place a clear, measurable action plan, matched by resources, to bring these about. Tenants and local authorities should be working towards this.
<P>

<a name="90623w11.htm_para11">The published framework is being sent to all local housing authorities, and to tenant and other interested organisations, and copies are available in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="90623w11.htm_para12">I am placing a list of the respondents, excluding any who requested confidentiality, in the House Library together with a report providing an analysis of the responses. The list and specific responses are available in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions Library, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE, telephone 0171 890 3039.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90623w12.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The farm-scale evaluations are investigating whether there are any differences in the diversity and abundance of wildlife associated with the management of genetically modified (GM) herbicide tolerant oil seed rape and maize compared with the management of equivalent conventional crops.
<P>

<a name="90623w12.htm_para0">The research contractors, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, the Institute of Arable Crop Research and the Scottish Crop Research Institute have begun to assess the biodiversity in each field. This year there are now two paired comparisons of winter oil seed rape and four of maize.
<P>

<a name="90623w12.htm_para1">The ecological studies are being reviewed by an independent scientific steering committee. The committee comprises scientists drawn from English Nature, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Game Conservancy Trust and academia. The first meeting was on June 14 and the progress of the research was reviewed. The committee considered the work to be making satisfactory progress and that the approach being taken to investigate the effects on wildlife was scientifically sound. Details of progress and steering committee meetings will be made publicly available. A web-site is being set up to provide this information in due course.
<P>

<a name="90623w12.htm_para2">Later this year farm-scale evaluations of winter oil seed rape fields will commence. Next year the ecological studies in the farm-scale evaluations will be extended to approximately 20 paired comparisons of each crop.

 I am pleased to announce that we have today issued a direction to One North East designating the North East Regional Chamber as its regional chamber under the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="90623w12.htm_para3">Section 8 of the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 provides that if the Secretary of State is of the opinion that there is a body which is representative of those in the RDA's area with an interest in its work, and that body is suitable to be given the role of regional chamber for the RDA, he may designate it.
<P>

<a name="90623w12.htm_para4">RDAs must take full account of regional interests. Regional chambers will provide a mechanism through which RDAs can take account of regional views and account for their activities. Ministers expect that each RDA will have regard to the chamber's view in preparing its strategy, consult the chamber on its corporate plan and give an account of its performance to the chamber.
<P>

<a name="90623w12.htm_para5">We are currently considering applications for designation from bodies in other regions.

 The Department has a range of procedures to monitor the quality of services provided by Business Links.
<P>

<a name="90623w12.htm_para9">The main procedure is a system of Accreditation under which each Business Link is required to meet rigorous quality standards in order to be able to use the Business Link brand. These standards are set by an independent Accreditation Advisory Board and include meeting ISO9001 and Investors in People requirements as well as other specific requirements, for example, on customer service. The Accreditation Advisory Board is responsible for advising Ministers on whether or not each Business Link is meeting the standards.
<P>

<a name="90623w12.htm_para10">Business Links are also required to submit information on a quarterly basis on the number of businesses and individuals who have accessed different services and the fee income they have generated. Government Offices use this data, along with local intelligence, to monitor the performance of individual Business Links. Copies of these reports are held in the Library of the House. From April 1998, we have also required Business Links to track the impact of their services on client businesses.
<P>

<a name="90623w12.htm_para11">At national level the performance of the Business Link Network as a whole is assessed through regular customer satisfaction and evaluation studies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90623w13.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Prior to the last Budget the agriculture industry submitted to the Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer various detailed tax proposals including the recommendation that the rules restricting the set-off of farming losses against other income should be modified. These were considered.
<P>

<a name="90623w13.htm_para0">At present losses cannot be set off against profits from other sources if a farming business has made losses for five years. The "five year tax rule" was introduced to protect the Exchequer from subsidising the cost of continued loss-making farming activities where farming is taken up by people who are not dependent upon it for a livelihood. However tax relief is not lost as losses can be carried forward against future profits from the same source. Thus farming losses can be offset against future farming profits.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what funding his Department provides to scientists at <i>(a)</i> Rothamsted and <i>(b)</i> elsewhere investigating the nectar and pollen production of transgenic plants and the foraging behaviour of bees on transgenic plants.  [87180]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90623w13.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Ministry has placed a programme of research at the Institute of Arable Crops Research at Rothamsted, to investigate the interactions between insects and plants. Funding of &#163;950,000 is planned for 1999-2000. This work underpins EU and DETR funded research which looks specifically at interactions between GM crops and beneficial insects. MAFF is also funding a project at the Scottish Crops Research Institute, costing &#163;57,000 in 1999-2000, which includes studies of the role of bees in cross-pollination of genetically modified oilseed rape. Relevant research on the role of bees was reviewed in the recent MAFF report on organic farming and gene transfer from GM crops. This review cost &#163;25,000.
