To ask the Secretary of State for Health what advice has been sought by the East Surrey Health Authority from his Department in respect of providing services and treatment for multiple sclerosis.  [65481]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 No specific advice has been sought by East Surrey Health Authority. The organisation of health services and the manner in which they are delivered, including services for people suffering from multiple sclerosis, is a matter for health authorities.
<P>

<a name="90127w01.html_para0">However, we are determined to challenge and address unacceptable variations in the provision of clinically and cost effective treatments, which are not based on the health needs of the local populations.

<a name="90127w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Blunt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what is the Government's policy on the provision of Beta- interferon for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.  [65488]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Current guidance on Betaferon (Beta-Interferon-1b) recommends tht health authorities will have in place local arrangements with hospitals for purchasing and prescribing the drug in the light of medical evidence and local priorities.

<P>
<a name="90127w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Blizzard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what is his policy for dealing with the spread of head lice among school pupils.  [67033]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Our policy is to encourage a "whole school approach" to the detection and treatment of head lice. This entails parents checking their children and other family members for head lice and arranging treatment where necessary, with such support from the local primary health care team as they may require. If this exercise is successfully undertaken on the same evening by all parents of children within a school, then the spread of head lice will be arrested.

 The West Midlands Beta Interferon Management Group's recommendation to chief executives of health authorities was to increase the region-wide budget for beta interferon to &#163;1 million, to ensure continuation of treatment for existing patients and to facilitate the inclusion of more patients onto the programme in the West Midlands.

 The Department has made no specific assessment of the health implications of the variations in costs of the new analgesic pack sizes.

I am still considering what, if any, action, should be taken in response to these suggestions.
<P>

<a name="90127w01.html_para6">I am, however, aware of the great strength of feeling on this issue, and the divergence of opinion that exists. I would want to reiterate most strongly the assurances already given by the Government, that we will not impose any change in Northern Ireland on this issue without consultation with elected representatives, including the Northern Ireland Assembly, and that any change would come about only with broad support from a cross-section of the people of Northern Ireland.

Burundi will need a substantial and well co-ordinated international effort to address its development constraints. Britain has not been a traditional bilateral donor to Burundi. But we will attempt to ensure that those multilateral organisations to which we are major contributors, including the EU and the World bank, are well prepared to make a major input when the political environment is right.

 The Libra contract was awarded to International Computers Limited in December 1998. Libra will provide national standard computer services to magistrates' courts and offices with the first implementation planned for mid-2001 in Suffolk. The systems and services are expected to be implemented in all magistrates' courts by 2004, and will provide electronic links with other agencies in the criminal justice system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I issued a performance standard in December 1997 setting out the minimum standards of performance that magistrates' courts committees are required to achieve in relation to disabled court users. It is not a requirement that formal access audits be undertaken, however, the Good Practice Guide that accompanied this standard does recommend it.
<P>

<a name="90127w02.html_para4">A survey, undertaken by this Department during May and June 1998, showed that 64 out of 96 magistrates' courts committees had undertaken internal audits during the previous twelve months and 32 had arranged for

<P>
<a name="90127w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 In the period December 1997 to December 1998, 1,962 mediations in family cases have been conducted as part of a pilot project. At this stage of the pilot project, it is not possible to provide exact cost per mediation as these costs include the cost of an initial information meeting with the clients, a contribution towards overheads and set up costs which enable mediation services to meet the requirements of the Legal Aid Board Family Mediation Franchise Specification. Legal aid has only been available for non-family cases since October 1998. It is at present not possible to provide information on the exact number or costs of non-family cases.

[67043]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The evidence available suggests that the removal of access to benefits to those asylum seekers who do not make their claim at their port of entry leads to a significant reduction in the numbers of asylum seekers. The Government believe that cash is a strong factor in encouraging economic migrants and that the restoration of benefits would lead to a significantly higher number of asylum seekers thereby leading to a much greater cost than the current arrangements. These conclusions come from an examination of the publicly available data.

 <i>[holding answer 25 January 1999]:</i> The Government are keen to encourage increased movement of freight by water where that is a practical and economic option. The Department currently gives Freight Facilities Grants for inland waterways schemes where freight would otherwise have gone by road. The Department will be re-examining the rules of the scheme to encourage more applications for inland waterways projects; and as announced in the White Paper on the Future of Integrated Transport, we intend to bring forward legislation to extend the application of the freight grant scheme to include coastal and short-sea shipping. The scheme is demand-led and the Department aims, as far as possible, to meet all eligible demand from within its budget. Since May 1997 there have been 5 inland waterway grants made totalling almost &#163;1.65m, which represents a maximum of 770,000 tonnes. In addition the total 1998-99 budget for both rail and inland waterway schemes has been increased from the previous year by one-third to &#163;40 million.
<P>

<a name="90127w04.html_para2">In addition, the Department is working to update planning guidance on transport which will encourage more freight to be carried by water. Local authorities in their development plans will be expected to consider opportunities for new development which are served by waterways; and to give better protection to sites and routes, both existing and potential, which could be critical in developing infrastructure to widen transport choices, including water transport.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what studies his Department has undertaken on the effect of the phasing out of leaded petrol on classic and vintage vehicles; how many vehicles currently run on leaded petrol; what is the statutory basis for the change; and if he will make a statement.  [67632]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w04.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 In accordance with EU directive 98/70EC, leaded petrol will be banned from general sale from 1 January 2000 by regulations to be made under the Clean Air Act 1993. Of an estimated 6 million vehicles currently running on leaded petrol, about 5.3 million will still be doing so at the time the ban is introduced. Of these as many as 3 million could use unleaded petrol either directly or with simple engine adjustments. For a remaining 2.3 million, for which lead provides lubricant protection for soft valve seats and in some cases octane requirements, substitutes for lead, either in the form of additives incorporated in "lead replacement petrol" or provided separately for motorists' use will be made available by the oil companies. Such products will be

suitable for classic and vintage vehicles as well as older vehicles generally. The Government are in addition exploring the possibilities for implementation of the provision in the directive which allows sales of leaded petrol to continue to a limit of 0.5 per cent. of total sales, though supply will ultimately be a commercial decision.

 The Government intend to develop a balanced and equitable strategy across all sectors to meet the UK's climate change targets. As a first step, on 26 October 1998, the Government published a consultation paper describing progress to date in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the UK and setting out a variety of policy options for further action. The consultation paper refers to a number of options which could be taken to reduce carbon dioxide emissions including improvements in emissions from buildings in the commercial, industrial and domestic sectors.

 The Government's policies on different aspects of planning are contained in Planning Policy Guidance notes (PPGs) and Circulars. PPG1 on "General Policy and Principles" gives general advice on a number of issues bearing on the consideration of planning permission. Environment Circular 9/95, "General Development Order Consolidation 1995", covers permitted development and more detailed procedural matters, including consultations before the grant of planning permission. It also contains advice on best practice in handling planning applications.

[67577]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The original air quality assessment for the Birmingham northern relief road was published within the environmental statement for the scheme in 1993. Additional evidence was submitted to the public inquiry in 1994.
<P>

<a name="90127w05.html_para2">The United Kingdom National Air Quality Strategy, published in March 1997, post-dated both the original assessment and the public inquiry. However, the existence of the air quality objectives within the strategy was acknowledged in the decision letter for the scheme as a post-inquiry development which had to be taken into account, alongside the Inspector's report, in reaching a decision on whether or not to proceed. A judgment was made, based on an interpretation of the previous assessment work, on whether or not the objectives might be exceeded. It was concluded that all of the objectives, with the possible exception of that for PM <sub>1</sub> , would be met with the road in place.
<P>

<a name="90127w05.html_para3">Under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995, local authorities must review and assess air quality within their areas. If a local authority decides that any of the air quality objectives are not likely to be met by 2005, it must designate an Air Quality Management Area covering the area of the predicted exceedance and produce an action plan for the achievement of the objectives. The Highways Agency would need to be closely involved in the development and implementation of any action plan which required measures to be taken in relation to a trunk road or motorway.

The Government are committed to providing sufficient funding for their completion, provided they continue to make reasonable progress, although we do not commit to fund the full costs of a major local road scheme. The table does not include committed expenditure on non-road schemes or resources which cannot be identified to a single road scheme, such as resources to meet applications during 1999-00 for grant under the Industrial Development Act 1982.

 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1999]:</i> The power currently held by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland to issue policy directions to Scottish sports and arts Lottery distributors will be transferred to Ministers of the Scottish Parliament. In relation to the Heritage Lottery Fund, the National Lottery Charities Board and the New Opportunities Fund (NOF), whose operations range across the UK, Scottish Ministers will be able to make directions which require distributors to take into account for their activities in Scotland the desirability of achieving particular objectives for devolved policy areas including giving priority to particular kinds of recipients, or recipients in particular parts of Scotland. In the case of a NOF initiative applying only in Scotland, Scottish Ministers will after consultation with the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport be able to make the order specifying the initiative, and to issue directions on any matter except the amount of funding to be allocated to the initiative. Powers in relation to the Millennium Commission will remain unchanged since most of its work is now complete. Scottish Ministers will not be able to make directions relating to the allocation of resources between Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom, or those relating to the administration of Lottery funding, regardless of the purposes to be achieved by particular projects. Scottish Ministers will however be consulted on these matters as they affect Scotland.
<P>

<a name="90127w06.html_para5">Similar arrangements will apply to the National Assembly for Wales, although any order specifying a Wales only initiative of the New Opportunities Fund would be made by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport with the agreement of the Assembly. The details of these arrangements, including their application to a Northern Ireland Assembly, are still under consideration. Concordats being drawn up between my department and home country departments will set out how the new arrangements will work.
<P>

<a name="90127w06.html_para6">There has been widespread public consultation on the three new NOF initiatives, which include one on green spaces and sustainable communities which could in Scotland constitute a Scottish Land Fund. Consultation on this initiative closed on 15 January and no decisions have yet been made regarding the final form of the initiatives or the financial allocations. After consultation with Scottish Ministers, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport will decide the level of funding each initiative will receive and has the power to direct that a percentage of this amount be used in Scotland. NOF will administer the grant-giving process, taking into account the directions they have been given and decide which applicants should be supported.

 <i>[holding answer 20 January 1999]:</i> Transfrontier broadcasting in Europe is regulated, in the European Economic Area, by Council Directive 89/552/EEC, as amended by Council Directive 97/36/EC ("The Broadcasting Directive"). Outside this area it is regulated by the European Convention on Transfrontier Television of the Council of Europe. Both legal instruments enshrine the "home State" principle; where a broadcaster is under the jurisdiction of one State, and hence licensed by that State, it may transmit freely to all others, provided that the minimum standards of the Directive or Convention are complied with. The Independent Television Commission may not extend its jurisdiction over such broadcasters, whether they broadcast by means of cable or satellite in the United Kingdom. Conversely, an ITC licensed broadcaster cannot be under the jurisdiction of any other State. By these means, a free market in legitimately licensed broadcasting services has been created throughout Europe.
<P>

<a name="90127w06.html_para7">European public service broadcasters are expected to observe principles of political impartiality and balance in their coverage of news and current affairs. This is regulated by the competent authorities in individual States. Any concern about political impartiality in a programme from abroad would need to be taken up on a bilateral basis either with the relevant regulatory authority or with the relevant Government.

The new harmonised accommodation rating scheme, being launched to consumers in September 1999, places far more emphasis on quality and will remove the confusion caused by the plethora of signs, and the lack of clarity about what to expect from each kind of serviced accommodation.

 Work is taking place at the Vulcan Naval Reactor Test Establishment at Dounreay to enhance protection against a number of potential hazards, including earthquakes, while preparing the facility for a further period of operation. Modifications are required to enable the facility to meet standards directly equivalent to those required by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate for modern civil nuclear facilities. The cost of work related to enhanced protection measures against earthquakes is estimated to be about &#163;9 million.

I understand that the DETR are shortly to start discussions with operators, including BNFL who operate Chapelcross, so that proposals and programmes can be produced for presentation to OSPAR in 2000.

Progress is reported through a series of research bulletins, copies of which are in the Library.

 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1999]:</i> Information on adoptions in Scotland is collected and published regularly.

 Payments of the bursaries for mathematics and science students will be made to those who undertake a PGCE course in mathematics or science in Wales, starting in September 1999. It will be paid as &#163;2,500 during the PGCE course, and &#163;2,500 to trainees entering the teaching profession. The full payment of the bursary will therefore be conditional on those students subsequently entering teaching within those subjects.

 Under the Transport Act 1985 local authorities may provide travel concessions for people who are blind or partially sighted, although there is no requirement to do so. My priority with concessionary fares is to ensure that from April all authorities provide schemes for pensioners which meet the minimum standard of a &#163;5 bus pass and half-fares, and then to move to free bus travel for pensioners over the next two to three years. This will of course benefit many blind and visually impaired people.

 <i>[holding answer 20 January 1999]:</i> Only a small percentage of electrical goods on sale in the United Kingdom depend on date changes to function correctly. The 'Millennium Bug Homecheck!' brochure available from Action 2000 and major high street retailers contains a list of domestic electrical and transport equipment not affected by the date change and a list of those which are, mainly home computers, video recorders, burglar alarms, fax machines, digital cameras, answerphones, camcorders, videophones and watches. The Government have sought to make sure that suppliers of electrical goods are fully aware of their responsibilities for ensuring compliance of any such goods on sale that are affected by the date change. Many of the large retailers have tested their electrical goods and given written guarantees that they are millennium compliant.
<P>

<a name="90127w12.html_para3">The application of false or misleading statements to products is a criminal offence under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. Any goods falsely described as millennium compliant would be subject to controls which already exist.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The estimates of the costs to income support of raising the capital limits for residential care should be regarded as orders of magnitude only. They are for Great Britain at 1997-98 prices, rounded to the nearest &#163;25 million. The analysis uses information from the 1996-97 Family Resources Survey on the income and assets of single very elderly people as a proxy for information on the income and assets of residents.<P>

2. The estimates relate to the impact on income support expenditure only--not to any linked changes that might occur to capital limits for local support in residential care.<P>

3. If they were matched in this way, the majority of the costs of raising the capital limits for residential care would fall to local authority social services rather than income support and have significant implications for local authority charging.<P>

4. A minority of the privately funded residents who float on to income support would be eligible for the higher preserved rights rates, by virtue of admission before April 1993.<P>

5. The estimates assume for illustrative purposes that one in eight would receive the higher rates of income support. In practice the proportion would depend on the date of implementation of the raised capital limits. <P>

<P>

<a name="90127w14.html_para0">Where a person who is claiming Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit, Income Support Mortgage Interest or Jobseeker's Allowance Mortgage Interest has a non- dependent adult living in their household, a deduction is normally made from their relevant benefit in respect of that non-dependant to reflect a reasonable contribution towards household costs. These deductions are made at standard rates according to the non-dependant's age and circumstances. No special provisions apply to non- dependants who are in receipt of Incapacity Benefit. It is, of course, for the individuals concerned to decide how much, if anything, a non-dependant actually contributes.

(2) what is the average time taken to recognise failure by a Child Support Agency enforcement officer to obtain payment of assessment from an absent parent and to issue court proceedings to recover outstanding arrears and establish regular payments.  [66480]<P></UL>

<a name="90127w14.html_para7"><i>Letter from Mrs. Faith Boardman to Mr. Roy Beggs, dated 26 January 1999:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary Questions to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the collection of fees and enforcement in relation to child support.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As there are elements of child support administration which cross the boundaries between the Northern Ireland Child Support Agency and the Great British Child Support Agency I have consulted with Mr. Gerry Keenan, the Chief Executive for the Child Support Agency (NI) and provided you with information on both Agencies. I am not able to provide all of the information in the precise format that you have requested, but have provided as much as is available.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Child Support Agency (GB) is divided into 6 front line Business Units; an application to maintenance is dealt with by the Business Unit dealing with the geographical area in which the parent with care lives. Where a parent with care resides in Northern Ireland the case is dealt with by the Child Support Agency (NI). Where the parent with care lives in Northern Ireland and the non-resident parent lives in Great Britain the case may be referred to one of the mainland Business Units to carry out a face to face interview or to take enforcement action.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agencies charged fees until April 1995 when following a legislative change the charging of fees was suspended. Clients are liable to pay fees charged between April 1993 and April 1995 and they continue to be collected.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Fees were charged for both the assessment and collection services, chargeable to both the non-resident parent and the parent with care. Various categories of non-resident parents and parents with care were exempt from the payment of fees.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Contributions to maintenance are only collected from Income Support and Job Seekers Allowance (Income Based--introduced in October 1996); non-resident parents in receipt of Income Support were exempt from paying fees therefore neither the Child Support Agency (GB) or the Child Support Agency (NI) retain contributions to maintenance to cover the cost of fees.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where arrears of maintenance arise, the Agencies take a variety of actions to secure payments. If the non-resident parent cannot pay the full amount straightaway, we try to reach an agreement with them to pay the arrears in instalments, which is added to their weekly maintenance assessment amount.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If a non-resident parent does not pay the agreed amount at the right time an Arrears Notice is sent; we will also try to contact the non-resident parent by telephone. If we reach an agreement, we would not ask the non-resident parent to pay more than 33% of their net income for child maintenance and arrears as long as they keep to the agreement. If a non-resident parent does not make or keep an agreement we can take up to 40% of their net income; if the non-resident parent is employed we will consider imposing a Deduction from Earnings Order. When a Deduction from Earnings Order is not suitable, for example where the non-resident parent is self employed and all voluntary methods have failed we then 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>27 Jan 1999 : Column: 291</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>consider legal action through the courts to secure payments of child maintenance. Very often the threat of such action is enough to ensure compliance.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Throughout the debt management and enforcement process, non-resident parents are given every opportunity to make a voluntary arrangement to pay off their child maintenance debt. The majority do agree to make an arrangement and only in a very small minority of cases is legal action actually taken.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The time taken between a breakdown in maintenance payments and taking legal proceedings is not measured. During 1997/98, the number of cases that were referred to Child Support Agency (GB) enforcement teams for litigation action was 17,833; it was only necessary to apply for 2,498 liability orders of which 1,353 were granted. In the first 9 months of this year the corresponding figures are 8,265, 2,911 and 1,424 respectively.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Child Support Agency (GB) measures its performance in securing maintenance against the target set by the Secretary of State; the target during 1997/98 was for &#163;500 million of child maintenance to be collected or arranged for direct payment from the non-resident parent to the parent with care. The total achieved was &#163;541 million--the portion that was collected by the Agency was &#163;344 million.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Child Support Agency (NI) measures its performance in securing maintenance against the target set by the Minister for Northern Ireland; the target during 1997/98 was for &#163;11.2 million of child maintenance to be collected or arranged for direct payment from the non-resident parent to the parent with care. The total achieved was &#163;12.3 million--the portion that was collected by the Agency was &#163;7.6 million.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="90127w17.html_para1">The Government remain committed to providing clear information so that consumers can make an informed choice about genetically modified (GM) foods.

<P>
<a name="90127w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1999]:</i> There is no legal requirement for foods containing GM material below a certain limit to be labelled as free from GMOs. However, the EC Regulation on labelling of GM soya and maize (1139/98) does recognise the need to consider a de-minimis threshold to avoid the situation where low levels of accidental mixing would require a consignment otherwise free of GM material to be labelled as genetically modified.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the proposed strike by meat inspectors and its effects on butchers and catering outlets in the UK.  [67555]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w17.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 January 1999]:</i> The decision by UNISON to consider strike action by its Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) members at the present time is very disappointing. MHS staff have a vital role to play in ensuring the highest hygiene and animal welfare standards are applied within plants. The MHS pay offer is fair and equitable.
<P>

<a name="90127w17.html_para5">After negotiations, the MHS formally offered UNISON a pay offer with a total value of 4 per cent. in August 1998. Negotiations continued and UNISON requested an offer of 4.55 per cent. citing the total package settlement to core-MAFF staff of 4.7 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90127w17.html_para6">In fact the actual cost of the core-MAFF pay aware to staff was 4.2 per cent, with 0.5 per cent. included for one-off structural changes. The range of awards was from 0 per cent. to 6.2 per cent. depending on performance. Unlike the rest of MAFF, performance related pay (PRP) structures do not apply in the MHS. The MHS's total value offer is on par with the current average civil service settlement of 4 per cent. It would not be possible to justify a higher offer for MHS staff, particularly with no PRP element.
<P>

<a name="90127w17.html_para7">UNISON commenced a formal ballot of its members on industrial action on 6 January. The ballot involved 579 responses, with 352 votes for industrial action and 225 against, with 2 returns invalid. UNISON are now required to give the MHS 7 days' written notice of any industrial action.

<P>

<a name="90127w17.html_para8">Contingency Plans have been drawn up to minimise the effect of any industrial action and MHS managers are in contact with plant operators to make all necessary arrangements. The action taken by the MHS to minimise disruption should help to ensure an adequate supply of meat for butchers and catering outlets. Plant operators are being reminded of their obligations under the Food Safety Act 1990 and Meat Hygiene/Specified Risk Material and Animal Welfare Regulations.

[67408]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 January 1999]:</i> The Bendixon/Dexter report was produced for the European Commission between 1990 and 1992. A full report on the veterinary service in each Member State was produced, but sent only to the Member State concerned. A summary report was produced which presented a broad view of the findings and recommendations regarding the structure, resources and activities of veterinary services throughout the Community. Only a Synthesis Report was circulated to the Member States, and I will place photo-copies of this in the Libraries of the House, but it is, by now, out of date.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 25 January 1999]:</i> Under World Trade Organisation rules it is not possible to require GM material used in food production to be segregated as a condition of import. However, the Government have encouraged the provision of consumer choice by publishing a list of 59 suppliers offering traceable non-GM material. All foods which contain GM ingredients must be clearly labelled under EC Regulations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1999]:</i> There is very little relationship in the short term between agricultural incomes and incomes in the rest of the UK economy. Although agriculture is subject to some of the influences which impact on the economy as a whole (eg productivity changes, world and domestic demand, and exchange rates), it is also subject to other influences which have a greater impact on the sector (eg the Common Agricultural Policy, weather and world commodity prices). As a single sector, agricultural income is more volatile than that of the UK economy as a whole. Agriculture currently accounts for about 1 per cent. of national GDP and about 2 per cent. of UK employment.

 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1999]:</i> Figures for 1998-99 will be published on 28 January. However, it is clear that net farm incomes for all farm types except general cropping are expected to fall substantially in 1998-99.

 MAFF funds local projects through the English Objective 1 and 5b Structural Funds Programmes and the English LEADER II Community Initiative Programme. The socio-economic parameters taken into account in designating Objective 1 and 5b areas included low levels of agricultural income, low population density and location in less favoured areas. Measures of local deprivation are not used by this Department or its Agencies when considering the allocation of funds to specific local projects within the Objective 1 and 5b areas.

 The Government provide no specific assistance to help young farmers to obtain their own farm. However, in certain cases, loans can be guaranteed under the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme. In addition, the changes introduced by the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 will make it easier for young farmers to gain tenancies because landowners will be encouraged to enter the rented sector.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food which countries will qualify for privileged entry arrangements under the Kennedy report on the reform of quarantine; and how many pet animals were imported from these countries in <i>(a)</i> 1998, <i>(b)</i> 1997, <i>(c)</i> 1996.  [67202]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w18.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Kennedy Group recommended that cats, dogs and non-carnivores from EU and EEA Member States and rabies-free islands should qualify for exemption from quarantine, subject to their meeting the conditions for exemption. My officials are examining which islands meet the definition of rabies freedom set by the Office International des Epizooties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w19.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Livsey: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what research his Department is currently funding into formulating a new TB vaccine for cattle.  [67288]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Krebs report concluded that the development of a vaccine for cattle was the best long-term prospect for the control of bovine TB, but saw a badger vaccine as an alternative option if cattle vaccine requirements cannot be met. Following the publication of the report, we have reviewed our research requirements for bovine TB, and in April published a document inviting proposals. These included work to develop a cattle vaccine and to take forward work on a badger vaccine, which started in 1994. Contracts worth over &#163;1.4 million per annum are being finalised on five projects relating to vaccine development. Nearly all of this expenditure is directed at projects relating to the development and testing of cattle vaccines.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w19.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Livsey: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will introduce routine testing for TB in all cattle.  [67271]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Routine testing of the National Herd is undertaken in accordance with Directive 64/432, as amended, and normally exempts certain groups of cattle, mainly young stock or fattening herds in which no breeding takes place. When it is considered necessary, on animal or public health grounds, all cattle are included in routine tests.

<a name="90127w19.html_wqn2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when he will publish <i>(a)</i> the draft Food Standards Bill and <i>(b)</i> his proposals for funding the Food Standards Agency.  [68082]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 I have today published the draft Food Standards Bill for public consultation, along with a consultation paper setting out our proposals for meeting 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 1999 : Column: 308</I><P>
by new costs of the Food Standards Agency through a levy on certain food premises. I have placed copies of both documents in the library of the House.
<P>

<a name="90127w19.html_para0">The draft Bill moves us closer to fulfilling another important manifesto commitment--the setting up of an independent Food Standards Agency with the aim of protecting public health in relation to food. The Agency will play a major role in strengthening consumer confidence.
<P>

<a name="90127w19.html_para1">It provides for a responsible, open and authoritative body charged with protecting public health in relation to food and with powers to act throughout the food chain. The Agency will work with all interested parties to develop soundly based, balanced policies that command the public's confidence. It will discharge a range of important functions in support of its goal, advising Ministers and the new devolved authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and helping all its stakeholders to meet the challenge of safe food.
<P>

<a name="90127w19.html_para2">The Bill provides for the Food Standards Agency to be a UK body. The Government will consult with the new devolved authorities to establish whether they are content to proceed with legislation on a UK basis in the way proposed in the draft Bill.




<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 1999 : Column: 308</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90127w19.html_para3">We want our proposals to be subject to full scrutiny, so that we can get it right from the start. The consultation that begins today seeks comments from all interested parties over the next eight weeks. The draft Bill will also be scrutinised by a Select Committee of Members of this House constituted for this purpose. We will refine our proposals in the light of the comments we have invited. If legislative time permits, we hope to be in a position to introduce the Bill during this session of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="90127w19.html_para4">We have already made considerable progress in strengthening the present arrangements in preparation for the Agency. The challenge now is to ensure that the changes we propose meet the robust standard that consumers and businesses alike can expect.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w19.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Stinchcombe: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what steps he will take to protect organic farming from possible effects of biotechnology.  [66681]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90127w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Our approach is to ensure that all justified concerns about genetically modified (GM) crops are properly addressed. This applies particularly to the concerns raised by the organic farming sector. We have made clear to the industry group SCIMAC, which is drawing up guidelines on the use of GM crops that they need to ensure that these contain adequate safeguards to protect organic farming.
