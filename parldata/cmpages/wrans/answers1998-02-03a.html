<a name="80203w01.html_wqn0"><B> Ms Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what changes are planned to labour market statistics. [27823]
<P><P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Willetts: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer when the Government expects to publish the conclusions of the Office of National Statistics review of unemployment statistics. [27185]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Office for National Statistics is announcing today a new approach to the presentation of labour market statistics following widespread public consultation. This will deliver a more rounded assessment of the UK's increasingly complex labour market.
<P>

<a name="80203w01.html_para0">From April, one news release a month will present a coherent picture of the labour market. It will use all available statistics. There will be no change to any definition of unemployment. But greater weight than previously will now be given to the Labour Force Survey which uses internationally agreed definitions as recommended by the International Labour Organisation. The release will focus on people in employment, on unemployed people who are seeking work and, people who are economically inactive. All three sectors are equally important in understanding the labour market.
<P>

<a name="80203w01.html_para1">The programme of improvements is designed to make labour market statistics both user relevant and user friendly, and includes: an extension of the range of indicators on a monthly basis; LFS information will be released every month as an average of the latest three months' data; for the first time whole economy employment and ILO unemployment statistics will be published monthly on a consistent basis; the publication of labour force survey data on a UK basis; the incorporation of labour force survey data in the regional labour market first releases; the publication of new indicators relating to jobs and businesses derived from employers' survey; improved earnings data to reduce the number of revisions.
<P>

<a name="80203w01.html_para2">The ONS will be organising a series of workshops and seminars. These will build on recently published articles explaining how the various statistical measures inter-relate.
<P>

<a name="80203w01.html_para3">The announcement follows an extensive period of consultation with data users. Independent academic experts have been consulted about changes to the methodology ONS uses in producing its labour market statistics.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Prior: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the total reduction in annual tax revenue, if the personal tax allowance was increased to &#163;10,000. [26528]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The estimated cost at 1998-99 levels of increasing both the non-aged personal allowance and the aged personal allowance to &#163;10,000 is &#163;29 billion.

<a name="80203w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what has been the cost to United Kingdom public funds of support to Asia in respect of the recent economic problems; [26382]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will list the total cost to UK public funds of financial aid to the Far East arising from economic instability. [27061]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 January 1998]:</i> To date, there has been no direct cost to the Exchequer of support to Asia in respect of the recent financial difficulties. The UK contribution to the financial assistance provided to several Asian countries has been through loans from the international financial institutions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Fallon: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many senior staff employed on short-term contracts with regulatory bodies established under the Financial Services Act 1986 are entitled to the full benefits of the public service final year salary pension scheme; and for what reasons they are so entitled. [26484]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 There are no senior staff working in the Financial Services Authority or any of the Self-Regulatory Organisations who are entitled to benefits under the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Fallon: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer on what date the Chief Executive of the Personal Investment Authority gave notice of her resignation; on what date it took effect; what was the basis of her financial settlement with the Authority; and what would have been the saving to public funds if she had been paid within the strict terms of her contract. [26486]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Personal Investment Authority is a private body. No public funds are involved.

<a name="80203w01.html_sbhd6"><H4><center>Individual Savings Accounts</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if lone parents will be allowed to hold ISAs in excess of &#163;50,000 in the event of transfer of savings or resources from an absent parent as part of a divorce or separation settlement. [22972]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 No such proposal is included in the consultative document on the individual savings account (ISA) published on 2 December.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Fallon: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if the holder of the new individual savings account who invests up to the proposed &#163;50,000 limit and whose investment increases beyond the limit will be able to withdraw the excess and re-invest it irrespective of the limit on annual contributions. [26235]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 The &#163;50,000 overall limit for the ISA is a limit on contributions. An ISA will be able to grow to over &#163;50,000 and full tax relief will be given on it. As proposed, any amounts withdrawn from the ISA will be able to be re-invested subject to the annual and overall investment limits.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Fallon: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the revenue implications if <i>(a)</i> 50 per cent. and <i>(b)</i> 75 per cent. of those holding more than &#163;50,000 in TESSA and PEP investments transferred into the new individual savings account transferred the excess into tax-favoured national savings products. [26232]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 The cost would depend on the amounts individuals held above the proposed &#163;50,000 overall investment limit for individual savings accounts, and the extent to which they were able to take advantage of the different limits for the various tax favoured national savings products.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_wqn10"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what steps he has taken to establish the level of savings providers' proposed administrative and selling charges to savers of up to <i>(a)</i> &#163;100, <i>(b)</i> &#163;250 and <i>(c)</i> &#163;1,000 per annum under the ISA scheme. [25226]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 Charges will depend on the final form of the scheme. In designing the ISA we have sought to replicate so far as possible existing PEP and TESSA procedures, and we intend to keep costs to providers as small as possible.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_wqn11"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what plans he has to recruit additional staff in the Inland Revenue to administer the ISA scheme. [25231]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 The number of staff required by the Inland Revenue will depend on the final form of the scheme.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mrs. Lait: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how much tax the Treasury expects to forgo annually with the introduction of ISAs and what tax has been forgone on an annual basis since the introduction of PEPs and TESSAs.[22570]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 The Government are planning to spend at least as much on the introduction of individual savings accounts as on PEPs and TESSAs, and have budgeted accordingly. The estimated annual costs of PEPs and TESSAs since their introducion are as follows.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list the amendments required to legislation on <i>(a)</i> banknotes and <i>(b)</i> the Bank of England in the event of the UK adhering to stage 3 of EMU. [26071]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Under Article 105a(1) of the Treaty (Article 16 of the ESCB Statute) the Governing Council of the ECB has the exclusive right to authorise the issue of banknotes within the Community. The ECB and the national central banks may issue such notes. Banknotes issued by the ECB and the national central banks shall be the only such notes to have the status of legal tender within the Community. In the event of the UK proceeding to Stage Three of EMU, Article 105a(1) would apply to the UK.
<P>

<a name="80203w02.html_para0">The Treaty requirements for central banks in Stage Three of economic and monetary union are described in Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty and in the ESCB Statute (Protocol No. 3 to the Treaty). In the event of the UK joining EMU, national legislation, including the Statutes of the Bank of England, would have to be made compatible with the Treaty and the Statute. The Bank of England would also have to meet the Treaty specification for central bank independence.

 Regional distributions of PEP and TESSA holders based on Inland Revenue records for 1995-96 are given in the table. The value of funds held in TESSAs follows the same pattern as the distribution of holders, and the regional distribution of the cost of tax relief is expected to be broadly similar. The regional distribution of the value of funds held in PEPs is not available from Inland Revenue records.

Carers, defined here are those who are inactive because they look after a dependent adult, are a subset of those looking after family/home. Information about carers is only collected in the autumn LFS. In autumn 1996 in Great Britain an estimated 6 per cent. of those who were unavailable for work because they are looking after family/home were carers.<P>

To ask the Attorney-General what was the cost of prosecuting children under the age of 16 years for soliciting in the last year for which figures are available. [26167] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w03.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The information sought is recorded only on individual case files and is not collected or collated centrally. This information requested could therefore be collected by the Crown Prosecution Service only at disproportionate cost. Home Office statistics from 1989 and 1994 show a decline in convictions for this offence in the 14 to 17 year old age group.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w03.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Sheerman: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General if he will cease the prosecution of children under the age of 16 years who engage in prostitution; and if he will make a statement. [26168]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w03.html_spmin1"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 Prostitution itself is not a criminal offence. However, a person who loiters or solicits for the purposes of prostitution does commit a criminal offence. The overriding principle is that the young person is protected from harm. In such cases the public interest may require the prosecution of a young person who persistently and voluntarily returns to prostitution. Each case is considered on its own merits.

 Information for 1986 to 1995 (the latest available) is given in the table. Data are not available in the form requested before 1986.
<P>

<a name="80203w04.html_para2">Between 1986 and 1995, the number of cautions for possession of cannabis increased nine-fold. The number of prosecutions doubled. The use of fines went up by two-thirds and the number of custodial sentences stayed much the same but with variations from year to year.
<P>

<a name="80203w04.html_para3">The use of cautions for possession with intent to supply cannabis unlawfully increased sixteen-fold and the number of prosecutions went up two and a half times. The use of fines and custodial sentences for such offences about doubled over the period covered with variations from year to year.
<P>

<a name="80203w04.html_para4">Cautioning for the unlawful supply of cannabis showed a ten-fold increase, while prosecutions doubled. Like offences for possession with intent to supply unlawfully, the use of fines and custodial sentences varied from year to year but essentially stayed about the same over the period.
<P>

<a name="80203w04.html_para5">As a proportion of those dealt with for possession of cannabis, the use of cautioning increased from 35 to 62 per cent. The equivalent figures for possession with intent to supply unlawfully rose from less than 2 per cent. to just under 8 per cent.; for unlawful supply the respective figures were less than four and less than 16 per cent. The use of fines for simple possession offences fell from just over a half in 1986 to about one fifth in 1995.

 All couples wishing to reside in the United Kingdom by virtue of their unmarried relationship must meet the requirements of the unmarried partners concession which was announced on 10 October 1997. This includes couples whose partnerships have been registered in Denmark, Greenland, Norway, Sweden or the Netherlands. The concession would not necessarily apply to them because European Economic Area (EEA) nationals who are in the United Kingdom by virtue of the provisions of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Order 1994 may reside here freely as long as they continue to be covered by the 1994 Order. This means that where the couple are both EEA nationals (regardless of their origins) they may both reside here by virtue of their nationality and would not have to qualify under the concession. Where one partner is of non-European Union origin they will need to qualify for admission under the concession even if they have gained a right to permanent residence in another EEA country.

 The Government are determined to do everything possible to protect the interests and enjoyment of the respectable British football supporter attending the World Cup in France this summer and to prevent disruption of the tournament by hooligans. For this purpose, we have established a World Cup Co-ordination Group which brings together official, policing and football representatives from both England an Scotland. They are working closely with the French authorities, who

are responsible for the management and security of the tournament, to ensure a co-ordinated approach to preventing crowd trouble among England and Scotland fans during the tournament.
<P>

<a name="80203w05.html_para4">My right hon. Friend will also be hosting a seminar in Blackburn on the policing of football which will bring together relevant experts from across the European Union to discuss policing, safety and securing arrangements for the World Cup.
<P>

<a name="80203w05.html_para5">There is no reliable estimate at this stage of how many supporters may travel to France. The strong advice of the Government to supporters is that they should not travel to France unless they have a ticket for the match. French legislation against touting is strict, and supporters should not expect to buy a ticket in France.
<P>

<a name="80203w05.html_para6">The overall ticket allocation by the French Organisation Committee (CFO) has been as follows:

<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) Clean Livestock Policy is aimed at improving the standard of cleanliness of livestock presented for slaughter at all slaughterhouses in Great Britain. The slaughter of dirty and/or wet livestock can compromise the hygienic operation of the slaughterhouse. Appropriate action will be taken by MHS staff if dirty or wet animals are presented for slaughter.
<P>

<a name="80203w06.html_para1">Action has been taken to implement the Clean Livestock Policy within the Over Thirty Months Slaughter Scheme. Slaughterhouses processing OTMS cattle are expected to work to the same hygiene standards as those killing for human consumption. This includes the application of the Clean Livestock Policy. However in the case of OTMS animals that would have been rejected for slaughter as too dirty or wet, these are not returned to the farm, but on animal welfare grounds are permitted to be slaughtered.
<P>

<a name="80203w06.html_para2">This approach works well in practice and I have no plans to change the current arrangements as regards the application of the Clean Livestock Policy to OTMS cattle.

the benefit between sheep and beef producers as I had originally proposed. I shall now therefore be utilising &#163;85 million of the EU compensation available to off-set the effects of sterling green rate revaluations. &#163;72.5 million will go to suckler cow producers on the basis of their 1996 claims; &#163;12.5 million will go to sheep producers on the basis of their 1997 ewe premium claims. The latter sum will be drawn from compensation to be calculated in respect of the livestock headage payments whose rate is determined each year by the green rate applying on 1 January.
<P>

<a name="80203w06.html_para3">For suckler cows, the rate of aid will be &#163;44.20 per head. Precise figures for sheep will be determined shortly but I expect them to be around 50p per head at the basic rate and 73p per head in the LFA.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>PACE only retains value information for the properties transferred to it for disposal; the remaining information rests with individual departments and is not held centrally. Our Annual Report and Accounts spells out the value of the surplus property for which we are responsible. Many of these properties are leaseholds with a nil or negative asset value. At 1/4/96 this stood at a negative value of &#163;486m and at 31 March 1997 at &#163;433.3m. So far as freeholds are concerned the opening valuation was &#163;80.2m at 1 April 1996 reducing to &#163;67.6m at 31 March 1997. This takes account of the disposals achieved during the year. Copies of our Annual Report and Accounts have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament. Our second Annual Report and Accounts will report the position at 31 March 1998.</FONT></UL>

 No civil servants in this Department at grade 3 or above have resigned since 1 May 1997. Four people have retired before pensionable age since 1 May as part of an ongoing programme of senior management structure retirements on structural grounds; they reported to four different Ministers. All of these early retirements were approved before 1 May 1997. About a quarter of the officers at grade 3 and above have changed jobs since 1 May either as part of the normal rotation of ambassadors and other senior staff, interchange with other Government Departments or on promotion. Such moves are planned up to a year in advance especially to/from foreign postings or where training is required. A high level of mobility is a feature of FCO work and roughly a third of all UK based FCO staff change jobs in any given year. Statistics on the precise number of moves and which Ministers had responsibility for the posts and Departments people left could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 <i>[holding answer 2 February 1998]:</i> The question of whether to reprocess or to seek alternative options to deal with spent fuel should be a matter for the commercial judgment of the owners of the spent fuel, subject to meeting the necessary requirements laid down by the United Kingdom's regulatory authorities. Since 1976 all contracts for the reprocessing of overseas spent fuel have included options for the return of waste arising from reprocessing. The United Kingdom Government intend that these options should be exercised.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The text of draft regulations to implement the 1985 Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85/337/EEC) as it applies to the offshore industry has been revised following consultation in 1997.
<P>

<a name="80203w11.html_para0">The revised text includes changes designed to ensure that the regulations are workable and enforceable. It simplifies the process for deciding when environmental statements are required and lengthens the minimum time available for public comments on such statements from fourteen days to four weeks. It also introduces penalties for knowingly providing inaccurate information in connection with an environmental statement or for failure to obtain consent or to observe conditions attached to a consent.
<P>

<a name="80203w11.html_para1">I announced on 10 September 1997 that I saw no reason to wait until 1999 to introduce the thresholds introduced in the 1997 amending Directive above which environmental assessment will become compulsory for certain development and pipeline projects. The revised text therefore uses a provision in the 1985 Directive which allows Member States to select appropriate thresholds above which projects covered by the Directive must be subject to environmental assessment, to require assessments of relevant projects which exceed these daily production or pipeline size thresholds. The draft Regulations do not implement the 1997 Directive, which Member States are required to adopt by mid-March 1999.
<P>

<a name="80203w11.html_para2">The revised draft is being circulated by Government Departments and to other organisations which responded to the consultation draft of 1997. The regulations will now be laid as soon as possible after this second round of consultation has been completed, probably in March this year.

 The current pension fund trustees of the former Astra Group were appointed by Receivers following the collapse of the Company in 1993.

The Secretary of State is doing everything possible to assist former Department staff who lost their jobs with the Astra collapse and are still experiencing major problems with this and their Pensions values.

 About 620 hectares of Green Belt have been deleted by development plan changes. Over the same period local authorities have proposed adding some 33,000 hectares to the Green Belt. If they are all adopted that will mean over 32,000 hectares will have been added to the Green Belt--that is about three times the size of Bristol.

 The Government are committed to protection of the countryside. This involves making the best possible use of brownfield sites in urban areas to accommodate new homes. Where development in the countryside is necessary, we have very strict controls on development.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State hopes to make a statement to the House on the whole issue of household growth later this month.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the number of additional dwellings required by 2018; and on what assumptions his estimate is based. [27135]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My Department has made no estimate of the number of homes that need to be constructed by 2018. The latest 1992-based household projections, published in March 1995, indicate a 4.4 million increase 



<P>
<P><I>3 Feb 1998 : Column: 624</I><P>
in the number of households in England in the 25 year period from 1991 to 2016. However, these household projections should not be taken as an estimate of the number of additional houses which have to be built. Rather, they represent just one of the factors to be taken into account by local planning authorities when arriving at figures for housing provision to be included in regional guidance and development plans. The detailed assumptions underlying these projections to 2016 are set out in the Stationery Office "Projections of Households in England to 2016", a copy of which is in the Library. My Department is planning to compile revised, 1996-based, household projections around the end of this year.

 We have declined the London Green Belt Council's request for a meeting because we have indicated to Hertfordshire County Council that we are unlikely to intervene in its Plan if it proceeds to adoption on the basis now proposed. It is now the County Council's responsibility to progress its plan.

 We have already acted to provide additional resources for housing and housing-related regeneration under the Capital Receipts Initiative, and we expect the provision of new social housing in partnership with registered social landlords to be among local authorities' priorities for applying the extra spending power.

<a name="80203w19.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement about the forthcoming financial management and policy review of the British Board of Agrement. [27467]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80203w19.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 As part of the Government's programme of five-yearly Financial Management and Policy Reviews of non-departmental public bodies, my Department will this year conduct a thorough review of the British Board of Agrement. The last review was published in 1995 and recommended a further early review in 1998. We have accepted that advice. As with all reviews, the first stage of the review will take the form of a "prior options" study. This will assess the extent to which the Board's functions are necessary for the achievement of the Government's policies, and whether these functions should continue to be carried out as at present, privatised, contracted out or transferred to another body to ensure best value.
<P>

<a name="80203w19.html_para7">The progress made by the Board since the previous review in 1995 will be examined and the results of that examination and of the prior options study will inform a detailed review by the Department of the future of the Board.
<P>

<a name="80203w19.html_para8">I expect the prior options study to be completed within four months. The time required for the more detailed review cannot be foreseen, but I would expect it to last no longer than a further six months.
<P>

<a name="80203w19.html_para9">In carrying out the study my Department will consult widely with those with an interest in the Board's work.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Your Questions about (a) the estimated average fuel consumption and (b) the total mileage of ministerial cars travelling on official business in each year since 1989-90 to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and the Secretary of State for Social Security have been passed to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He has asked me in my capacity as the Chief Executive of the Government Car and Despatch Agency to reply.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Based on the usage for the current financial year from 1 April 1997, when the Agency was first formed, I estimate that in a full year ministerial cars allocated to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions will have an average fuel consumption of 26 miles per gallon, and will travel 86,000 miles on official business. Using the same basis, I estimate that ministerial cars allocated to the Department of Social Security will have an average fuel consumption of 26 miles per gallon, and will travel 53,500 miles on official business.
