It is not possible to break down ineffective calls into those that did
or did not receive an engaged tone for old system calls in 2002-03.
<i> Notes:</i>  1. Data is presented for calls made regarding
cases on the new system (CS2) and the old system (CSCS)
combined.  2. "Attempted customer calls" excludes calls
attempted outside working hours.  3. "Calls for which outcome
not recorded" are those that were received but for which, due to data
problems, the eventual outcome was not recorded. The volume of such
calls has decreased significantly in the last three years as management
information systems have improved.  4. "Calls for which
outcome recorded" are those which were received and for which there is
management information to track the eventual outcome.  5. IVR
denotes the automated touch tone part of the process where customers
enter their details via the telephone key pad. Once callers have
cleared this part of the process, they enter a queue to be answered by
a member of CSA staff. Note that there is no IVR process on the old
system.  6. Numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand.
Components may not sum to totals due to
rounding.<br></td></tr></table><br><p><a name="06101024000181"><b><a name="06101024001232">Mr.

the market value of occupational pension scheme assets reduced by a
