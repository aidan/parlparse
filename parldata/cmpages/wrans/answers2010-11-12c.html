 In the spending review we announced almost £4.5 billion investment for new affordable housing to deliver up to 150,000 affordable homes in England over the spending review period.

 All of the Department's arm's lengthbodies were reviewed in the lead up to the spending review announcements in October, using existing resources. On 8 June, the Secretary of State announced that Nicholas Shott had been appointed to carry out an independent and pro bono assessment of the conditions necessary for commercially viable local television to emerge in the UK. He receives no remuneration from the Department but receives some support from four full-time equivalent DCMS officials who are working on the DCMS local TV project. Nicholas Shott presented the Secretary of State with his initial findings on 24 September, which can be found on the DCMS website at:</p>

Member for Bath (Mr Foster) was asked to review abandoned betting accounts and other unclaimed winnings. He is not being paid to lead the review, and is working with two civil servants as part of their existing daily role. The report will look at how much money is left abandoned in betting accounts and uncover the value of unclaimed winning tickets, defining "dormant" and looking at how these funds could potentially benefit local communities through investment in sport. The report will be published by the end of 2010.</p>

On 5 July, the Secretary of State announced a review of all the Department's capital programmes. We are clear that future spending needs to be more efficient and with a sharper focus on real needs.
