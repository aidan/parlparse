<a name="01106w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Kaufman: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if he will set out, including statistical information relating as directly as possible to the constituency, the effect on the Manchester, Gorton constituency, of his Department's policies and actions since 2 May 1997.  [136167]

<a name="01106w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 In October 1999, in line with national policy, the City of Manchester Branch of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), in liaison with the police and Manchester City Magistrates Court, introduced the Narey proposals. All defendants charged with a criminal offence now make their first appearance before Manchester City Magistrates Court within 72 hours. Present figures would suggest that between 40 per cent. and 45 per cent. of all defendants now have their cases finalised far more quickly than previously was the case. On 13 November 2000, the City of Manchester Branch will be altering its structures in line with the proposals in the Glidewell review. This will enable the CPS to place greater emphasis on more serious crime in Manchester Crown Court. The CPS, together with other agencies, has also helped to draw up procedures and protocols to speed up youth justice, particularly persistent young offenders.
<P>

<a name="01106w01.html_para0">Since May 1997, the Crown Prosecution Service has successfully prosecuted a number of major cases arising in the Gorton area. In November 1997, James Patterson Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment for the brutal murder of Kelly Ann Bates in Furnival Road, Gorton the previous year. This year the CPS has successfully completed prosecutions arising out of Operation Sydney, involving the supply of hard drugs in the Bennett Street area of West Gorton, and Operation Peking, where four men received substantial custodial sentences for violence and intimidation in Gorton.

 DFID currently has 100 contracts with the British Council, 65 of which are consultancy type contracts. The remaining 44 are for the provision of training services and have been called down under a general Enabling Agreement for management of DFID's Technical Co-operation Training Programme.

<P>
<a name="01106w01.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The UK Government were closely involved in the drafting of the EC policy framework for tackling poverty and major communicable diseases which strongly reflects our own developmental priorities. The communique represents an international consensus and is part of the wider process of building on the commitment to achieving the international health targets. A crucial next step is the forthcoming December G8 meeting in Japan, which provides an opportunity to ensure that the international architecture required to take forward the effective global partnership to tackle infectious diseases is in place.

<P>
<a name="01106w01.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 At the G7/8 Denver Summit in June 1997 my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister committed the Government to increase by 50 per cent. spending on basic education, health care and clean water in sub-Saharan Africa over the next three years.
<P>

<a name="01106w01.html_para13">To fulfil this promise my Department's target was to commit at least &#163;360 million over the three years to 1997 to 2000 compared with &#163;240 million in the previous three years.
<P>

<a name="01106w01.html_para14">We achieved this at the end of October last year. In total, we have committed &#163;452 million; some 25 per cent. over the target.

 To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, if he will make a statement on the future of the remaining bishops' palaces.  [135369]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01106w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 The hon. Gentleman may have in mind a report in 'The Sunday Telegraph' on 15 October, speculating on the possible recommendations of the Archbishops' Review of Bishops' Needs and Resources, chaired by Professor Anthony Mellows. That Review's report is expected early next year. We do not yet know what its recommendations will be. But we will of course pay careful heed to what it says.

<P>
36. <a name="01106w01.html_wqn7"><B>  Sir Sydney Chapman: </B> 
 To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, if he will report on the contribution made by the Church Commissioners to clergy stipends and pensions.  [135373]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01106w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 In 1999 the Commissioners contributed &#163;156.1 million in support of the Church's ministry, representing some 20 per cent. of the Church's overall running costs of approximately &#163;760 million.
<P>

<a name="01106w01.html_para15">That sum includes the Commissioners' expenditure of &#163;87 million on clergy pensions and transitional relief of &#163;17 million to help dioceses with the cost of the new funded pension scheme. It also includes &#163;20 million paid towards the stipends of parish clergy, much of which is targeted specifically towards those dioceses most in need of financial help, and stipends paid to other clergy of nearly &#163;7 million.

 To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, what changes have taken place in the past 10 years in the Church's spending on Bibles in ethnic minority languages.  [135374]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01106w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 The Church Commissioners' expenditure is committed to the support of clergy stipends, pensions and other legal commitments. Those commitments do not stretch to the publication of bibles.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01106w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the written answer I gave him on 10 July 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 369W, in which I explained that the procedure for settling the future of redundant Church of England churches gives priority to dioceses seeking and achieving suitable alternative uses. Dioceses are also encouraged to keep informed the local parochial church council who are also given the opportunity to make representations for or against the proposed use.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01106w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 Conditions of service will vary slightly from diocese to diocese but should include a stipend (based on a National Stipend Benchmark of &#163;16,420), free accommodation (or a housing allowance), membership of a non-contributory pension scheme, and the full reimbursement of all working expenses.

<P>
<a name="01106w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 The Commissioners' ethical investment policy is exercised in the context of their duty to manage their inherited assets to provide financial support for the Church of England's ministry, especially in areas of need and opportunity.

 Over the past 10 years the National Audit Office has published more than 50 reports on privatisations and a variety of public/private partnerships. The Public Accounts Commission last met on 18 July to consider and approve the National Audit Office's Corporate Plan for 2001-2002 and beyond. The resources to be made available to the National Audit Office will include provision to enable it to continue its work on this important area.

<P>

<a name="01106w02.html_para0">

<BR>
1. A PLA Logistics Delegation of six officers (led by a Major-General) visited the UK between 10-12 May in order to study the logistics organisation in the UK armed forces. The delegation visited the Defence Logistics Organisation in Bath, Andover and Yeovilton, and the Defence Procurement Agency in Bristol. The costs of the visit were met by the Chinese.
<BR>
2. The PLA Air Force Command College visited the UK between 28 May-4 June in order to learn about UK defence policy, the organisation of the RAF and its concept of operations in a joint environment. The delegation consisted of eight college staff (led by a Major-General), twenty-eight students, five interpreters, and eleven aircrew. They visited the MOD in London, RAF Brize Norton, RAF High Wycombe, RAF Lossiemouth, RAF Cranwell and BAE Systems in Warton. There were also cultural visits to London and Edinburgh. The cost of the visit to the MOD was approximately &#163;10,000.
<BR>
3. General Cao, the Head of the Chinese General Equipment Department, and an accompanying delegation of twelve officers visited the UK between 18-25 June as part of an ongoing programme of senior military visits and ministerial exchanges. The General visited the MOD in London, the Defence Procurement Agency in Bristol, the Defence Logistics Organisation in Bath, BAE Systems in Farnborough and Warton, and Racal Electronics in Crawley. There were also cultural visits to London and Scotland. The cost of the visit to the MOD was some &#163;15,700.

<a name="01106w02.html_para1">In addition, a Chinese officer was attending the Royal College for Defence Studies course (which runs from January to December), and another officer was conducting English Language Training at the Defence School of Languages in Beaconsfield between 19 June-8 August. The cost of this training to the MOD was approximately &#163;50,000 and &#163;5,000 respectively.
<P>

<a name="01106w02.html_para2">All of these visits were part of our wider efforts to develop a substantive defence relationship with China through regular balanced and reciprocal engagement in order to promote confidence-building and dispel mistrust.
<P>

<a name="01106w02.html_para3">Defence co-operation forms a key part of the UK's overall strategy of constructive engagement with China, and improving contacts with the Chinese in all areas.

They comprise members of the Volunteer Reserve Forces and the Regular Reserve Forces. The latter are ex-Regular personnel who retain a specific liability to call-out on leaving the Regular Forces. The figures do not include ex-Regular personnel who are not in a Reserve Force, but who retain a general liability to recall to the Regular Services in a serious crisis as defined in the Reserve Forces Act 1996. RAF figures are available only from 1 April 1998 as prior to this date medical and non-medical reservist manpower figures were not recorded separately.

 Although some preliminary MOD funded studies are being conducted, we have yet to define a programme to assess future naval fire support requirements. A number of studies will be necessary ranging from operational analysis to technology research. Until this is done, it is not possible to estimate the scope or cost of the work. One study is about to start to examine the technical options for naval variants of the 155 mm artillery gun, one potential approach to meeting our requirement, and this has a 50/50 funding split between MOD and BAE Systems.

 <i>[holding answer 2 November 2000]:</i> Joint Flying Regulations have been in place for some time for all Service aircrew, including those in the Joint Helicopter Command although each of the three services retain individual regulations specific to their aircraft type and role. A review of regulations applying to military flying operations is currently under way and this work is due to be completed by January 2003.

 The success of the air operations, although a critical element, is unlikely to have been the sole reason why Milosevic eventually agreed to the international community's demands. Although it is certain to have had a substantial effect, we believe that it was the cumulative effects of international pressure on all fronts, diplomatic, economic (trade and financial) and military, that achieved the aims of the international community.

 Our procurement strategy has been to seek a prime contractor for the entire Theatre Wide Area Communications Network for the Joint Rapid Reaction Force. The two competing companies (Nortel Networks Global Professional Services (Defence) and Thomson Racal Defence) for the prime contract were invited to propose the most suitable means, including communications equipments and vehicles, to meet the capability requirement. My Department has therefore not sought any tenders directly for vehicles to meet this requirement.

<P>
<a name="01106w03.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B>

<a name="01106w03.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The requirement sought from industry was in the form of the capability required for the entire Theatre Wide Area Communications Network (TWACN) for the Joint Rapid Reaction Force (JRRF). In broad terms this included a requirement for a vehicle capable of being deployed, including by air, and used in accordance with the needs of the JRRF. The detailed requirements applicable to the vehicle are classified and I am withholding them under paragraph 1a of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01106w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Since the spring, the wholesale price of gas has risen sharply and this has had an effect on many industrial and commercial customers, especially those who have contracts tied to the spot price. The main reason for this rise has been increased trade across the GB-Belgium interconnector reflecting high oil-related gas prices, particularly in north-west Europe.
<P>

<a name="01106w04.html_para6">The Government are concerned about this rise. Work is already in hand to boost liberalisation and competition in Europe and thus break the link between gas and oil prices which keeps European prices higher than would otherwise generally be the case. This is the most effective long-term means of ensuring the competitive gas prices industry seeks. However, it is likely to take some time.
<P>

<a name="01106w04.html_para7">Meanwhile, the Government are already in dialogue with participants in the industry about the gas price rise and this is being intensified. However, it is not the role of the Government to influence the prices charged by individual companies.

 We have received an application from South West Trains Ltd. relating to the new Class 170/3 trains they wish to introduce into service.

The exemptions sought were also discussed with the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee.

 Animal rendering plants are regulated under the air pollution control regime established by Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Regulation is transferring to the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 over a transitional period.

<a name="01106w07.html_para8">In accordance with the 1990 Act, rendering plant must be authorised and regulators must include in authorisations conditions aimed at ensuring the use of the Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost (BATNEEC) to prevent, minimise and render harmless emissions. "Harm" is defined in the Act as including offence to the senses and hence local authorities must address any odour issues. The statutory guidance issued to regulators concerning BATNEEC for animal rendering plant focuses especially on the odour issue and we updated and strengthened the guidance earlier this year.
<P>

<a name="01106w07.html_para9">The 1990 Act gives regulatory responsibility for animal rendering plant to local authorities. It additionally provides the Secretary of State with a number of reserve powers which could be exercised in the event of regulatory failings. These include the power to direct what conditions should be imposed in a given case, to direct whether an enforcement notice should be served or whether an authorisation should be revoked, to direct that regulatory responsibility be transferred to the Environment Agency, and to direct that an application for authorisation be referred to him for determination.

<P>
<a name="01106w08.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 We have consulted local government on whether adjustments were required to the SSA methodology to reflect the transfers of funding for Adult Education, Nursery Education Grant and Care Leavers Grant. Over 100 responses were received, the vast majority supporting our recommended approach.
<P>

<a name="01106w08.html_para8">I therefore propose that we implement our recommended approach. That is, that we make no change to the SSA methodology for Other Education or Children's Social Services following the transfers for Adult Education and Care Leavers Grant, and that we make a small adjustment to the Under 5s SSA methodology following the transfer of funding for Nursery Education for four-year-olds. The purpose of the adjustment to the Under 5s SSA is to ensure that the distribution of this funding matches, as closely as possible, the previous distribution under specific grant.

 Information is not available in the form requested. Because data are not collected on the same basis from primary and secondary schools, separate tables are provided, setting out the most appropriate available indicators for each sector. Figures for primary schools are available only from the academic year 1985-86. In both sectors, a constituency-level breakdown is available only from 1996-97. Responsibility for education transferred to the National Assembly for Wales on 1 July 1999.

The Commission have taken the view that it would be more appropriate for them to release the documents rather than the Government of a member state. The papers are kept by the Directorate-General for Education and Culture who can make them available on submission of a written application. There are no plans for any further meetings of the group.

<P>
<a name="01106w11.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2000]:</i> We do not collect detailed statistics on the future occupations of young people when they complete New Deal for individual Units of Delivery and so no comprehensive assessment has been made.
<P>

<a name="01106w11.html_para1">The flexible design of New Deal aims to tailor provision, in particular training, to meet the aspirations of participants and prepare them for a career in their chosen field. The evidence we do hold indicates that of the 317 young people who have gained sustained unsubsidised employment from New Deal in the West Sussex Unit of Delivery, approximately 3 per cent. moved into managerial/professional occupations, 10 per cent. into clerical/secretarial occupations, 9 per cent. into craft and related occupations, 13 per cent. into personal and protective services, 6 per cent. into sales, 14 per cent. into plant and machinery operation and 45 per cent. into non-specified occupations.

<P>
<a name="01106w11.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 We have received over 12,000 letters following publication of the European Commission's original proposal for this directive. Of these, some 10,500 raised concerns on religious grounds, in particular that the wording of the original draft of the directive posed a threat to religious freedoms. We have now negotiated a final text which, we believe, fully responds to the concerns expressed, and allows member states considerable latitude in implementing its provisions in relation to staff policies of religious organisations. In particular the agreed text allows the UK to protect the right of church schools to give preference to teachers of their faith in line with the provisions of the Schools Standards and Framework Act 1999.

Figures from this release show that since September 1998, 324,000 five, six and seven-year-olds have benefited from the Government's infant class size initiative. In September 2000, 30,000 children were in classes of 31 or more children, compared to 171,000 in September 1999. This demonstrates that the Government are delivering early their infant class size pledge, which is supported by some &#163;620 million.
<P>

<a name="01106w11.html_para3">January 2000 saw a fall in the size of the average junior class in England; and a continuing fall in the size of the average primary class, after rising for a decade. The size of the average secondary class nationally, at 22, is still five below the average primary class. Secondary headteachers are receiving an average of &#163;50,000 this year (&#163;60,000 from April 2001) in direct grant to spend as they choose. If this were spent on recruiting teachers, the average secondary class size could be reduced by up to 0.8.

<BR>
As the Employment Service is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked Leigh Lewis to reply to your question concerning the RADAR report on awareness of the Access to Work scheme among small employers and what plans there are to increase their awareness and take-up of the scheme and the resources available for it. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to Mr Lewis as Chief Executive of the Agency. I am replying on Mr Lewis' behalf.
<BR>
I have read the RADAR report and was encouraged to see that 74% of small business respondents to the Jobs Worth Survey reported a relatively high awareness of disability issues. However, I recognise that these respondents also indicated a low level of awareness of the Disability Service, and particularly Access to Work.
<BR>
Employment Service invest around &#163;300,000 each year in marketing and publicising its disability services and programmes, including Access to Work, through a variety of media such as external advertising, exhibitions, marketing events and video. A major process review of Access to Work is currently underway to improve the responsiveness of the programme to disabled people and their employers. A new Employment Service Website is due for launch during November and will contain information on all programmes and services provided to disabled people and their employers, including information for individuals and employers on Access to Work.
<BR>
In 1999-2000, the Employment Service spent &#163;24.39 million on providing Access to Work support to disabled people in paid employment. During 2000-2001, the Employment Service has &#163;25.6 million to spend on providing Access to Work support.

The report for 1999 is being finalised and will be published shortly. Details of the Department's targets for reduced sickness absence for 2001 and 2003 against a baseline of 1998 will be included in its Service Delivery Agreement. This will also be published shortly. In order to meet these targets the Department has streamlined procedures for recording absences, improved monitoring of sickness and pursued more active case management.

 Distribution of National Lottery grants is a matter for 15 National Lottery distributing bodies. The Secretary of State's directions to these bodies (or, in the case of bodies operating solely in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, the directions from the devolved Administrations) require them to establish procedures which ensure lottery resources are being used for the purposes for which grants were given and that the schemes supported represent value for money; that projects are delivering the benefits identified on the application form in accordance with specified financial arrangements; and that assets purchased are being used for the purpose for which they were intended. The distributing bodies are required to set out their performance on this in their annual reports.

 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2000]:</i> Neither my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State nor I have had any such discussions. The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) has advised that, following third-party allegations about the award of certain contracts to a design company, David James, Executive Chair of NMEC, notified the Met's CID. Prior to these allegations David James had, on taking office, initiated a review of past contractual arrangements entered into by NMEC. This study, together with the CID investigation, are on-going and it would not therefore be appropriate for me to comment at this stage. I will, however, report to the House as soon as the investigation is completed.

 The proposals for a national register of recreational land were originally put forward during the preparation of the Playing Pitch Strategy by the GB Sports Council, the National Playing Fields Association and the 



<P>
<P><I>6 Nov 2000 : Column: 62W</I><P>
Central Council for Physical Recreation in 1989. The objectives of the register from the outset were; to monitor change in the recreational land resource; to assist in policy development at the local and national level; to provide information to the public. This proved to be an extensive task, surveying over 70,000 individual pitches on more than 23,000 sites across England. An independent evaluation of the register in 1994 found a number of shortcomings with the data. These shortcomings were due to a number of factors including the voluntary nature of the project, with owner and managers of sites under no obligation to provide data, and many refusing to co-operate.
<P>

<a name="01106w18.html_para1">A review of the effectiveness of the register in 1998 indicated that the likelihood of achieving and maintaining a comprehensive, accurate, up-to-date national inventory of playing pitches was remote. Sport England, with the support of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the National Playing Fields Association, and the Central Council of Physical Recreation, is currently working with the Local Government Association on a suitable model of the register which can be used by local authorities to undertake assessments of playing field need and provision in their area.

If for any reason an individual feels unable to do this or if the matter cannot be resolved in the management line, he/she may report such actions to one of two Designated Officers.

<a name="01106w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 There has been no specific survey of how many learning-disabled children there are; the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) surveys in 1989 estimated that there were 327,000 disabled children under 16 in England and Wales. This estimate represents 3.2 per cent. of the population and is lower than other estimates. It is generally accepted that this estimate although dated, remains valid.
<P>

<a name="01106w20.html_para0">OPCS has also estimated that two thirds of the 110,000 most severely disabled children did not receive any support services. We can also estimate that two thirds of the most disabled 16 and 17-year-olds will receive no service--that gives a figure of about 11,500.
<P>

<a name="01106w20.html_para1">Of the families covered in the OPCS private households survey, only a third of the children in the 5-15 age group or their families had received a domiciliary service in the previous year, and although the rate rose to almost four-fifths among the children under five, this was mainly attributable to health visiting.
<P>

<a name="01106w20.html_para2">The inspection by the Social Services Inspectorate of services to disabled children and their families, published in 1998, identified a heavy demand for services in all local authorities.
<P>

<a name="01106w20.html_para3">The Learning Disability Strategy, to be published early next year, will address the needs of learning-disabled people of all ages. Our consultation with experts in the field and service users has emphasised the importance of increased family support.
<P>

<a name="01106w20.html_para4">On 27 September, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced that we will increase the amount of money put aside specifically to support carers in England through the Carers Special Grant from &#163;50 million this year to &#163;70 million in 2001-02, &#163;85 million in 2002-03 and &#163;100 million in 2003-04.
<P>

<a name="01106w20.html_para5">This funding will more than double from &#163;120 million this year to &#163;290 million by 2003-04. This is an unprecedented investment in the future of some of the most vulnerable children in our country. I expect that at least &#163;15 million of next year's special grant will be dedicated to the new priority area: disabled children. This money will be spent on a wide range of services, including both home based and respite care.

 On 28 September 1999, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced that within two years there would be access to NHS dentistry for everyone who wants it via NHS Direct. The dental strategy,

"Modernising NHS Dentistry--Implementing the NHS Plan", published on 19 September 2000, shows how that pledge can be met. The strategy focuses on the areas of access, quality and oral health and is supported by &#163;100 million new funding. Responsibility for dentistry is devolved to health authorities and they will be performance managed on service provision in their area.
<P>

<a name="01106w20.html_para11">There are 24 practices in Coventry still accepting new patients for NHS dental treatment. A dental access centre across five sites in Coventry and Warwickshire is due to open soon. Dental access centres provide a complete range of dental services, including routine and urgent care. People do not need to register to see a dentist at a centre, and centres have extended opening times.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) if he will set up a review of the system of prescription charges including assessment of the treatment under the scheme of <i>(a)</i> patients requiring life-long treatment for non-exempt medical conditions and <i>(b)</i> other patients who are exempted from charges;  [135987]

<P>
<a name="01106w21.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The list of medical conditions conferring prescription charge exemption was agreed with the medical profession in 1968. The list and other aspects of prescription charges were reviewed in 1998 as part of the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review. No changes were made to the list of medical exemptions. We have no plans to undertake a further review. Our policy is to give priority to helping those who may have difficulty in paying charges, rather than extending the exemption arrangements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health which elements of the Government's proposals for elderly care, announced in the National Health Service National Plan, were included by the Royal Commission on Long Term Care in its estimate for free personal care.  [136041]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01106w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Royal Commission on Long Term Care proposed that personal care should be free, with recipients of long-term care making a co-payment for living and housing costs. It did not sum a series of proposals to reach its estimate of the cost of free personal care. It used information on the costs of care and the numbers of privately funded residents. Our proposals for free nursing care fall within the Royal Commission's estimate of the cost of free personal care, as do the proposed changes to the residential charging rules--the three month property disregard, uprating the capital limits and resources to enable councils to place charges on homes.

 We extended eligibility for National Health Service sight tests to everyone aged 60 and over from 1 April 1999. In England and Wales, 10,030,000 sight tests were paid for by health authorities in the year ending 31 March 2000. This was 34 per cent. more than the total for the year ending 31 March 1999 (7,469,000). Figures for the numbers of people aged 60 and over who have received free eye tests in particular areas are not collected centrally. However, the increase in the total number of sight tests paid for by Coventry health authority in the year ending 31 March 2000 was 



<P>
<P><I>6 Nov 2000 : Column: 73W</I><P>
14,360. The increase in the total number of sight tests paid for by all health authorities in England in the year ending 31 March 2000 was 2,407,080. It is fair to assume that the majority of these increases was due to newly eligible people aged 60 or over obtaining NHS sight tests.

 We have already taken steps to improve the standard of care received by looked after children, and we are committed to a clear programme of action to turn around the experience of this vulnerable group.
<P>

<a name="01106w21.html_para0">The Government Response to the Children's Safeguards Review, in November 1998, set out a detailed programme to ensure good quality care for looked after children. The Quality Protects programme was introduced in 1999-2000, to improve the services provided to and the outcomes of vulnerable children, particularly looked after children. Councils receive special grant funding to help them make the changes required, and councils have been set clear targets which they are expected to achieve. In particular, the funding has been directed at improving the quality and range of placements available and at raising levels of educational achievement for looked after children. We recently announced the extension of this programme from three to five years.
<P>

<a name="01106w21.html_para1">From 1 January 2001, small private children's homes will be brought into regulation.

Inspection will be against national minimum standards for the particular organisations which will ensure that the quality of care received by looked after children will be acceptable throughout England.

the Department published "The Race Equality Agenda of the Department of Health", which set out a programme of action on race equality. "The NHS Plan: a plan for investment, a plan for reform", published in July 2000, recognises the need for a modern NHS to respond to the needs of our diverse, multi-cultural society. This is reflected in the core principles of the new NHS and in a number of the commitments made in the NHS Plan. The NHS Plan also makes clear that every member of staff in the NHS is entitled to work in an organisation which is committed to improving diversity and tackling discrimination and harassment (including racial discrimination and harassment). The Department has also launched an Equalities Framework for the NHS, "The Vital Connection", in April 2000, which includes clear requirements for the NHS to promote race equality and introduces a package of standards, indicators and monitoring arrangements. Significant progress has also been made in implementing "Tackling Racial Harassment in the NHS--a Plan for Action", published in March 1999. All these documents have been placed in the Library.

<P>
<a name="01106w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We are committed to ensuring the best use of adoption as an option to meet the needs of looked after children. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced in February this year that we would conduct a thorough review of adoption services. As a first step towards this, we asked the Cabinet Office Performance and Innovation Unit to carry out a study of adoption practice during the summer to assess the evidence, explore the options for action and make recommendations to the Government. The Performance and Innovation Unit Report was published for consultation in July.
<P>

<a name="01106w22.html_para4">The Prime Minister has announced that we will publish a White Paper before the end of the year setting out our new approach to adoption, building on the review and the results of the consultation. The White Paper will include proposals for new legislation to be introduced next year. In the meantime we are taking forward a programme of work to improve adoption services, including setting up a National Adoption Register and drawing up new National Standards for adoption services. In addition, we have announced an adoption and permanence task force to spread best practice and improve local council performance.
<P>

<a name="01106w22.html_para5">We are also committed to improving intercountry adoption services and to putting in place effective measures to protect children. Regulations under the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999 are being prepared which will shortly be subject to a public consultation exercise. The Act enables the United Kingdom to ratify the 1983 Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. We hope to be able to present the regulations to Parliament early next year.

 The Manchester, Gorton parliamentary constituency, along with the rest of the United Kingdom, is benefiting from the long-term action we have taken to build economic stability and secure high and stable levels of growth and employment. Since the general election, claimant unemployment in the constituency has fallen by 1,812, or 37 per cent. youth unemployment is down by three-quarters, and long-term unemployment has been cut by more than half.
<P>

<a name="01106w23.html_para0">Macroeconomic stability is being complemented at the microeconomic level by the Government's policies to ease the transition from welfare into work and to make work pay. To the end of the August 2000, the New Deal for 18 to 24-year-olds had helped 1,817 young people in the Manchester, Gorton constituency gain valuable skills and experience--755 (42 per cent.) of whom had moved into employment. The working families tax credit (WFTC), introduced in October 1999, is helping to make work pay for low and middle income families. In May 2000, 2,200 families in Manchester, Gorton were benefiting from WFTC.

 Bringing those who are currently unbanked into the mainstream banking system will make a major contribution to reducing financial exclusion. The Government--through its &#163;500 million investment in automation of the Post Office network, and its support for Universal Banking Services at post offices--is enabling the Post Office to make banking services more accessible to the financially excluded.

 The Government's package of corporation tax reforms included not only the withdrawal of payable tax credits on dividends but also cuts in corporation tax rates. These and other measures will help to improve investment performance. The effect of these changes on the size of UK pension funds will vary depending upon many factors, such as: the type of scheme; the take-up of private pensions; the level of future contributions and the investment policy adopted by fund managers.

The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent questions regarding a variety of labour market statistics for men and women in different regions in Great Britain. I am replying in his absence. (136747/136748/136749/146750)
<BR>
Information on the number of employee jobs by region and industry for recent dates is published quarterly in table B.16 of <i>Labour Market Trends</i>. A back series of employee jobs, along with the number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits (the 'claimant count') by age and region are available through the Nomis database at the House of Commons Library. Information on computerised claims, by age, for regions and for a range of local area geographies is available monthly from June 1985.

<BR>
Estimates of economic activity and International Labour Organisation (ILO) unemployment by age and region are available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), National Statistics' major source of labour market data on individuals. The information requested is also available through the House of Commons Library.
<BR>
The ONS preferred measure of unemployment is the ILO unemployment rate, derived from the LFS. It is defined on an internationally recognised basis. It counts as unemployed people who are a) without a paid job b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained. This measure has been used in the LFS since 1984. LFS estimates of economic activity, defined as people in employment or ILO unemployed, are also available from 1984 onwards on a consistent basis.
<BR>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) currently uses Government Office Regions (GORs) as the primary categorisation for regions. LFS estimates based on GORs are only available from 1992 onwards. LFS estimates based on the Standard Statistical Region categorisation are available from 1979, but only from 1984 onwards on the consistent ILO definitions of economic activity and unemployment.

The following table shows the percentage of employee jobs earning within specified hourly pay bands in Greater London and Sutton and Cheam. The table is based on data from the New Earnings Survey (NES) for April 2000. NES answers are given as percentages earning below specified thresholds, rather than numbers. This is because appropriate grossing factors for the NES sample are not available at very detailed levels.

However, the NES underestimates the number of low paid jobs since it does not provide a comprehensive picture of the lower end of the earnings distribution. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) best estimates of the number of jobs in the UK with hourly pay less than national minimum wage rates were published in the NES press release on 26 October available in the House of Commons Library. These estimates are based on a new methodology that combines information from the NES and the Labour Force Survey. Further tables, including estimates for Government Office Regions, will be published on the National Statistics website (www.statistics.gov.uk) on 10 November.

As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question on the number of people unemployed in the Sutton and Cheam constituency in each year since 1979 according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition. (134983)
<BR>
The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the main source of labour market data on individuals used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). However, estimates for the number of people ILO unemployed are not available for small areas such as the constituency of Sutton and Cheam.
<BR>
The measure of unemployment derived from the LFS is defined on a consistent and Internationally recognised basis set out by the ILO. It counts as unemployed people who are (a) without a paid job (b) available to start work within the next two weeks and (c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained. This measure has been used in the LFS since 1984.
<BR>
ONS also publishes the monthly numbers of people who are claiming unemployment-related benefits, also known as the Claimant Count. Comparable figures (based on the 1995 boundaries) are available since 1996. The attached table gives the annual average levels of claimants in the Sutton and Cheam parliamentary constituency since 1996.




<P>
<P><I>6 Nov 2000 : Column: 86W</I><P>

Information on the unadjusted claimant level by parliamentary constituency ward based on the 1981 wards are available monthly from June 1983 to January 1996 and can be obtained from the Nomis database in the House of Commons Library.

The figures are shown in the attached table. The rates for Sutton and Cheam constituency (which are calculated from fewer than 20 deaths) may be unreliable due to the small number of events and should be treated cautiously. Any variation they show over time, or difference from National or health authority rates are likely to be due to chance.

Figures for Greater London are presented in the attached table for years up to 1999, the latest available. Boundary changes to the Sutton and Cheam constituency mean that figures are not available for years prior to 1988.

As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question on estimates of the contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which could result from employment rates in certain age groups being the same as employment rates in the age group 40-45 years.
<BR>
This information is not available. In order to make this calculation it would be necessary to make assumptions about the characteristics of those entering employment and the jobs they would be doing. In particular predictions would have to be made as to what the hours worked and earnings would be of people moving from inactivity to employment. While simplistic assumptions could be made it might prove misleading to assume, for example, that these factors would be the same as for those already in employment.

<BR>
The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what checks are made to ensure validity of claims for backdated winter fuel payments.
<BR>
As with all claims to benefit, checks are made to validate any claim before payment is considered. This is completed by various means, including but not restricted to, reference to existing Departmental records and National Insurance data.
<BR>
For making Winter Fuel Payments in respect of previous years, use has been made of address matching software. Before validating any payments for retrospective claims, records have been cross-matched with previous years Winter Fuel Payments to ensure that payments are made only to those entitled and at the correct amounts.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data set which is derived from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS does not include Northern Ireland, and 1998-99 is the latest year for which data are available.<P>

2. The estimates are sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that control for region, Council Tax band and a number of other demographic variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error and to variability in non-response. All numbers are rounded to the nearest 100,000.<P>

3. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household). While the number of individuals below various income thresholds may be sensitive to the precise way in which incomes are equivalised, changes shown over time generally are not.<P>





4. The estimates are presented on both a Before Housing Costs (BHC) and an After Housing Costs (AHC) basis in line with HBAI conventions. Figures are also provided including and excluding the self-employed, as research suggests that, for self-employed people, income as reported in surveys is often a poor indicator of living standards.<P>

 Estimates of the numbers of households taken off Housing Benefit as a result of the Working Families Tax Credit were produced using the Department of Social Security's Policy Simulation Model (PSM). The PSM is based on the Department's annual Family Resources Survey, which is a sample of around 23,000 households in Great Britain. Individuals' and households' income tax and national insurance liabilities, and entitlements to tax credits and social security income- related benefits, are modelled according to the prevailing tax and benefit rules and rates. The numbers in receipt of particular benefits are then calibrated to the forecasts for those benefits, published in the departmental report, or underlying the Pre-Budget Report.
<P>

<a name="01106w27.html_para0">The effects of Working Families Tax Credit on the number of Housing Benefit recipients was determined by modelling two different benefit systems--one with Working Families Tax Credit, and one as if Family Credit had continued in existence, with appropriate uprating of benefit rates. All other tax and benefit rules were kept the same in the two systems. Adjustments were then made to ensure coherence with other forecasts. Comparison of the two modelled systems then gives the effect on the number of Housing Benefit recipients.

<a name="01106w27.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The reform of Severe Disablement Allowance (SDA) will refocus benefit on people disabled early in life who have never had the opportunity to work and gain entitlement to incapacity benefits through the payment of contributions.
<P>

<a name="01106w27.html_para10">At present, the poorest 70 per cent. of those receiving SDA also receive Income Support (IS). The IS rules require every pound of their SDA to be deducted from their IS so, in practice, they receive no benefit from SDA.
<P>

<a name="01106w27.html_para11">From April 2001, young disabled people under 20 (or 25 if they were in education or training that continued beyond their 20th birthday) will be given access to Incapacity Benefit without having to satisfy the normal contribution conditions. Based on current rates, they will gain up to &#163;26.70 a week. No new SDA claims will be accepted but existing recipients will be protected and will continue to receive SDA for as long as they continue to satisfy the conditions of entitlement. In addition there are special linking periods of eight weeks, one year and two years for people who leave SDA before April 2001 to try work or training which would allow them to return to SDA if they are still within their linking period.

 Many non-resident parents want to, and do, provide financial support for their children while their maintenance liability is being calculated by the Child Support Agency. Voluntary payments of child maintenance paid before liability has been calculated can be offset against that liability. However, voluntary payments are not currently provided for in legislation and the Child Support Agency follows guidelines to determine which payments should be set-off against arrears of maintenance.
<P>

<a name="01106w28.html_para5">The Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 gives statutory recognition to voluntary payments made before maintenance has been assessed. In the new child support scheme, payments in cash, either direct to the parent with care or via the Agency, and payments by the non-resident parent of household bills for mortgage repayments, gas/electricity or water bills can be offset as voluntary payments.

 In his statement on vaccine damage of 27 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 719-27, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said that top-up payments would be made in all cases where a vaccine damage award had been made prior to that date. About 900 awards had been made between 1978 and the date of

the statement. So far 129 top-up payments have been paid amounting to &#163;8,696,500. Another 122 cases are nearing completion. In general cases are being paid in date order, that is to say, those customers who received their original payment the longest time ago will be paid first. The Vaccine Damage Payment Unit has recruited additional staff and arrangements are in place to progress the remaining payments as soon as possible while ensuring the interests of the intended beneficiary are protected.

 The Government welcome the joint inspectorates' report, and the way the six separate inspectorates collaborated together in reporting jointly on casework information flows right across the criminal justice system (CJS). This joint approach fits in well with the Government's development of joint planning for the CJS as a whole and in particular with the CJS Integrating Business and Information Systems (IBIS) initiative. There are no plans to publish a formal response to the report but it will be a useful aid to CJS departments, services and agencies in improving the way they currently handle casework information and its findings are being taken forward in ongoing work by CJS departments, including the points raised about the IBIS model of information flow in the criminal justice system. The inspectorates have indicated that, in their future inspections, they will be seeking confirmation that the recommendations of this report are being addressed and will commission a review of the implementation of the recommendations in two years' time.

 There are no plans to ban ball-bearing (BB) guns. These weapons generally have muzzle energies much lower than that required to inflict an injury more serious than superficial bruising. Because of this they do not fit the definition of a firearm contained in the Firearms Act 1968 and do not come under the

<P><I>6 Nov 2000 : Column: 106W</I><P>
control of the Act. However, as the Home Affairs Committee (HAC) recognised in its recent report on "Controls Over Firearms", there is a danger of armed police being called out to deal with youngsters brandishing these weapons in the street.
<P>

<a name="01106w29.html_para14">In its response to the HAC, the Government accepted the recommendation that the sale of these weapons to young people by mail order, telephone and the internet be banned and extended to include sales through any outlet, including face to face. The Government are therefore now considering how the sale of these and other replica firearms to people under 18 years of age might be restricted.

 <i>[holding answer 31 October 2000]:</i> We have had frequent contacts over many months with voluntary sector organisations on a wide variety of issues concerning the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB). There have been ad hoc meetings at both ministerial and official levels with the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), with individual bodies such as the Scout Association and with groups of organisations such as national sports bodies. The NCVO represents the sector on the board which oversees and advises Ministers on the programme as a whole, and several voluntary organisations are represented on the Customer Forum, which provides a bridge between the CRB and its future clients. Before making regulations prescribing such matters as the fees to be charged by the CRB, we shall carry out a regulatory impact assessment in consultation with affected bodies, including representatives of voluntary organisations. This will provide a thorough and up-to-date assessment of the implications.

<P>
<a name="01106w30.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Costs for the Lord Lieutenancies of Greater Manchester and the West Midlands are higher than those for other Metropolitan Lieutenancies because they include more significant staffing and accommodation costs.

<P>

<a name="01106w30.html_para4">Lord Lieutenants are unpaid. They may however claim expenses from central Government for certain items such as travel and other reasonable non-entertainment expenses incurred in carrying out their official duties. Amounts claimed will clearly vary according to, for example, levels of activity in each county and area, size and dispersal of populations, and the personal circumstances of each Lord Lieutenant.

<P>
<a name="01106w30.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The current requirement for presenting fingerprint evidence in court is based on at least 16 points of comparison. This dates from 1935. In 1988 the Home Office commissioned a review of this requirement. A report was published in <i>Fingerprint World</i> and the <i>Journal of Fingerprint Identification</i> and was placed in the Library. In 1994 the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) initiated a review which concluded that fingerprint evidence should in future be based upon the expert testimony of fingerprint officers rather than any particular fixed number of points of comparison. ACPO are planning to introduce a non-numerical standard in the new year, once they are satisfied that the appropriate quality assurance standards, inspection, training and competency testing regimes that will underpin the new standard are in place within force fingerprint bureaux.
<P>

 The information requested is given in the table. The figures are for Home Office expenditure on emergency planning and include grants, which the Home Office allocates to local authorities in England and Wales as a contribution towards their emergency planning activities. However, it is worth noting that other Government departments also have an interest in emergency management, and provide funding that supports recruitment of specialist staff, equipment purchase and academic research.
<P>

<a name="01106w31.html_para6">The Spending Review 2000 exercise, recently completed by Her Majesty's Treasury, has looked forward to the three years 2001-02, 2002-03 and 2003-4. Budget allocations for these years have not yet been finalised within the overall Home Office settlement.
<P>

<a name="01106w31.html_para7">Figures for 2004-05 and 2005-06 will be established in subsequent spending round reviews.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reasons his Department's grant for emergency planning in Shropshire was reduced between 1999 and 2001.  [136836]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01106w31.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The reorganisation of local government necessitated the introduction of a new distribution mechanism for Civil Defence grant which was announced to local authority chief executives in May 1999. The three-tier system includes a basic allocation, a sum for County Councils in respect of Shire Districts and a final element based on population size.
<P>

<a name="01106w31.html_para8">The allocation to Shropshire County Council has fallen between 1999-2000, and the proposed allocation for 2001-02. However, part of this reduction is offset by an increase in funding to the unitary authority of Telford and Wrekin which was formerly part of the county.

 I have no plans to change the law. Neither the Home Affairs Committee report on electoral law and administration in 1998 nor the working party on electoral procedures in 1999 recommended any change to the current provisions prohibiting convicted prisoners from voting.

 In England and Wales, 32 people were arrested as a result of the fuel protests in early September. In addition, 62 people were reported for summons, predominantly drivers of vehicles wilfully obstructing the highway. Information on the number of charges brought is not centrally available.

 Ministers and officials across Departments met regularly as the Civil Contingencies Committee. The Home Office Emergency Operations Centre was opened, and other Departments involved activated their own special arrangements. All of these were coordinated by operations based in the Cabinet Office.

<a name="01106w32.html_para0">Regular situation reports on all aspects of the situation, including from local authorities, were commissioned and distributed as appropriate by email or fax.

<P>
<a name="01106w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I am publishing today a consultation document which sets out proposals for an order under the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act, 1994, to deregulate certain aspects of the bingo industry. Our consultation document makes three specific proposals.
<P>

<a name="01106w32.html_para1">First, we propose the abolition of a requirement for licensed bingo clubs to notify the licensing authority of changes in their charges to players 14 days in advance. This part of our proposals will also have a small benefit for licensed casinos.




<P>
<P><I>6 Nov 2000 : Column: 114W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01106w32.html_para2">Second, we propose to change the law so as to allow bingo clubs to have a mixture of jackpot and lower prize gaming machines.
<P>

<a name="01106w32.html_para3">Finally, we propose to amend the law on multiple bingo--also known as the 'National Game'--so that it can offer more than one national, regional, and house prize.
<P>

<a name="01106w32.html_para4">The Government believe that these reforms will benefit both the industry and its customers. The consultation document asks for responses by 16 February 2001. I am arranging for copies to be placed in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he plans to publish the Commission for Racial Equality's 1999 annual report; and if he will make a statement.  [137031]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01106w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Commission for Racial Equality's annual report 1999 is published today and copies have been laid before Parliament.
<P>

<a name="01106w32.html_para5">Exceptionally this year the report goes beyond the 12 calendar months stipulated by the Race Relations Act 1976 and covers a 15 month period thus encompassing both the calendar year 1999 and the financial year 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="01106w32.html_para6">The Commission for Racial Equality have produced a report which they believe meets both the requirements of the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Commission's own need to report on achievements against targets which are based on the financial year.
<P>

<a name="01106w32.html_para7">However, since the Race Relations Act 1976 requires reports to be made in relation to the calendar year, and as soon as practicable after the end of the year, we have advised the Commission that future reports need to follow these requirements until such times as Parliament may decide to amend the Act.
<P>

<a name="01106w32.html_para8">Copies have also been placed in the Library and they have been sent to the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales.
