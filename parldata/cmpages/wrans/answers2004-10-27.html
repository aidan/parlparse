<p><a name="41027w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 21 October 2004]</i>: The UK is committed under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to protect and enhance carbon sinks and reservoirs. In order to fulfil this commitment we are expanding the forest estate under the Forest Strategies and policies of the Devolved Administrations. We are doing this in a manner that will provide multiple public benefits including a positive contribution to climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration.

The Government is also committed to protect soil functions, including maintenance of organic matter levels, via the provisions on soil conservation in the reformed Common Agricultural Policy, and to the development of policies to protect existing stocks of carbon in soil organic matter in England, as described in further detail within the first Soil Action Plan for England, published earlier this year and available on the Defra website (www.defra.gov.uk/environment/land/soil/pdf/soilactionplan.pdf).

<p><a name="41027w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I am not aware of a proposal before CITES to ban international trade in lion trophies and skins. At the CITES 13th Conference of Parties, which has recently concluded in Bangkok, Thailand, the Government of Kenya had proposed that the African lion be uplisted to Appendix I. The Government, in common with other EU member states, had an open position on this proposal pending exploration of the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Oct 2004 : Column 1218W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
scope for an agreed solution among range States. During the course of the CITES Conference, after discussions with other range states the Government of Kenya withdrew the proposal, noting that there was no regional consensus on the issue and that discussions were under way for convening regional workshops on lion management for which the UK has offered financial support.

<p><a name="41027w01.html_wqn3"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will examine ways of protecting lions in West and Central Africa.  [189897]</p>




<p><a name="41027w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The UK is taking action in many ways to conserve lions in West and Central Africa, particularly through our active participation in the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Lions and other endangered species are generally protected by national law in all the countries they inhabit; they are also protected internationally by regulation of trade under CITES. Through the UK&#039;s contributions to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) we are helping developing countries and countries with economies in transition to meet their obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity and to implement their own wildlife protection measures and those required under CITES. In addition the Darwin Initiative, funded by Defra, supports projects which help countries rich in biodiversity but poor in resources to protect their biodiversity and use it sustainably. Since its launch in 1992 it has funded over 300 projects in 100 countries, including granting two three year grants for work on &#039;Big Cat Conservation and Sustainable Management in Southern Africa&#039;. The output from this project informed a decision by the South African Government to reduce lion hunting quotas. At the recent CITES meeting in Bangkok I announced a contribution of &#163;30,000 to help set up workshops in Africa to gather information on lion management.

</p>



<p>(2) whether the <i>(a)</i> sewage disposal treatment works, <i>(b)</i> sewage mechanisms and <i>(c)</i> works related to sewage in London are compliant with the Urban Waste Water Directive;  [192322]

<p><a name="41027w02.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The objective of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive is to protect the environment from the adverse effects of waste water discharges. The Directive includes requirements concerning sewage collection systems, and for sewage treatment works. Standards and deadlines are set according to the size of the population served and the sensitivity of waters receiving the discharges.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027w02.html_para2">
The sewage collection systems serving the urban communities along the Thames are largely combined systems which collect both domestic and industrial waste water, and rainwater run-off. The Directive acknowledges that it is not possible in practice to construct combined collecting systems and treatment plants to deal with all waste water during situations such as unusually heavy rainfall. Consequently the Directive requires the limitation of pollution of receiving waters due to storm water overflows according to best technical knowledge not entailing excessive cost. The systems along the Thames have combined sewer overflows which operate to prevent flooding and sewage treatment works from becoming overloaded during wet weather.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027w02.html_para3">
Most of the freshwater section of the Thames has been identified as a Sensitive Area because of eutrophication. As required by the Directive, communities either side of this stretch of the river have satisfactory sewage collection systems and overflows, and Thames Water have or are to provide more

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027w02.html_para4">
The tidal section of the Thames is identified as a normal water body. As required by the Directive, London has a collection system, and secondary treatment is provided at the qualifying (those serving more than 15,000 inhabitants) sewage treatment works which discharge to this area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027w02.html_para5">
As agreed in the last Periodic Review of water company price limits for 2000&#150;05 Thames Water, the Environment Agency, Defra and the Office of Water Services (Ofwat) have been involved in a Strategic Study of the environmental impact of intermittent storm sewage discharges to the Thames Tideway. The remit of the study was to identify objectives for improvement, and to propose potential solutions, having regard to costs and benefits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027w02.html_para6">
As a result of the study the Final Guidance by the Secretary of State to the Director-General of Ofwat, published on 4 October 2004, and the draft price limits published by Ofwat on 5 August 2004, include provision for further measures to address sewage discharges to the Thames Tideway.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027w02.html_para7">
In the medium term this will result in improvements to the capacity and quality of treated effluent from three sewage treatment works (Beckton, Crossness, and Mogden) which discharge to the Thames Tideway. These improvements are also to include reducing the frequency of intermittent discharges from the storm water storage tanks at Mogden. When completed we consider waste water discharges from these works will be compliant with the Directive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027w02.html_para8">
In addition a scheme to improve the treated effluent at Riverside sewage treatment works, which is already compliant with the Directive, is identified to improve water quality in the river and protect fish.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027w02.html_para9">
With regard to the Directive requirement to limit pollution of the Thames Tideway due to intermittent storm water overflows, we consider that the issue of compliance needs further investigation. As a result my officials and the Thames Tideway Strategic Study Steering Group are carrying out further consideration of the issues and possible appropriate measures. These include the proposed long-term interceptor tunnel solution, and possible smaller-scale measures.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps the Department is taking to combat hunger and malnutrition in the Middle East.  [193745]</p>

 World Bank figures show that overall around 15 per cent. of children under the age of five in the Middle East and North Africa show some signs of malnutrition. According to the UN&#039;s Human Development Report, around 33 per cent. of Yemen&#039;s total population, and 27 per cent. of Iraq&#039;s population was undernourished in 2000. Figures for Palestinian refugees are also high.

In Yemen, the only low-income country in the region, DFID&#039;s programme is directed at supporting the Government&#039;s Poverty Reduction Strategy, which includes social protection. The European Commission&#039;s programme of around &#8364;15 million a year has as its main element support for long-term food security. Approximately 17 per cent. of all EC funding (including humanitarian) is attributed to DFID&#039;s budget.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027w05.html_para1">
This year, DFID has contributed &#163;12.35 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestinian refugees, some of which is used for food aid. Since the start of the Intifada in 2000, the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) has provided &#8364;118 million of aid to vulnerable Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and elsewhere in the Middle East, assistance that has included food, health care and water and sanitation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027w05.html_para2">
In Iraq, the Public Distribution System (PDS) for food has provided a basic ration for more than 60 per cent. of the population since 1991. After the end of Saddam&#039;s regime in 2003, DFID helped to re-establish the PDS. Evidence from a UNDP survey undertaken in spring 2004 suggests that stunting and chronic malnutrition remain unacceptably high. DFID&#039;s assistance through organisations such as WHO and UNICEF is helping to address this problem. In the longer term we are working on economic reform in Iraq, including reform of the PDS, which takes into account the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society. DFID has also been planning a programme of work on social protection mechanisms to complement work on economic reform, which will benefit poor people.

 Since 1991, DFID has contributed over &#163;200 million of humanitarian assistance to Sudan. The humanitarian support that DFID has provided for Sudan has included food, water, sanitation, primary health care and shelter.

<p>
<a name="41027w05.html_para3">
DFID&#039;s Country Engagement Paper for Sudan includes, as one of its key objectives to meet life-saving and life-sustaining humanitarian, recovery and re-integration needs. We match our humanitarian programme to assessed need, recognising that needs are not likely to reduce in the near future. DFID is working with other donors to ensure that Sudan&#039;s needs do not go unnoticed or unsupported. We are therefore providing support through non-governmental organisations, and international organisations like UNICEF; and in areas like Red Sea, Unity and Upper Nile states.

<p>
<a name="41027w05.html_para4">
DFID is particularly concerned about the situation in Darfur, where 1.5 million people have been displaced and a further 200,000 have fled to Chad. In response to the crisis in Darfur, we have committed &#163;62.5 million of humanitarian assistance since September 2003.

<i>[holding answer 25 October 2004]:</i> In 2002, there were numerous discussions and exchanges on Iraq between the US Administration and UK officials, including Foreign and Commonwealth Office Ministers and ambassadors. The basis of our argument throughout that period was that we had to go back to the UN and we had to enforce Iraq&#039;s compliance with UN resolutions. We accepted that that might entail regime change, although that was not our objective. We went back to the Security Council in November 2002 to get a further resolution, UNSCR 1441, which 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Oct 2004 : Column 1254W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
authorised the use of force for this purpose. As a result of Saddam Hussein&#039;s persistent and continuing failure to comply with Iraq&#039;s UN obligations (which, as the recent Iraq Survey Group report confirms, continued right up until the launch of military action), the Government concluded in March 2003 that it was necessary to use force to remove Saddam Hussein from power in order to secure Iraqi compliance.

 Recorded crime statistics produced by the Police Service of Northern Ireland do not distinguish between paramilitary and non-paramilitary crime.

What I can say is that there were a total of 127,953 offences recorded in Northern Ireland during 2003&#150;04 compared with 142,496 in 2003. This represents a decrease of 10.2 per cent. The overall clearance rate was 27.4 per cent., 4.4 per cent. higher than that achieved in the previous year.
</p>

<a name="41027w13.html_para9">
Police figures released for the period April to September 2004 show 6,608 fewer recorded offences, a decrease of 10.2 per cent. on the same period last year. This is a result of excellent proactive police work and community involvement right across Northern Ireland. I am confident that this downward trend will continue as long as the police and communities work together to make Northern Ireland a safer place for all.

 My Department is not able to assess the direct effect of changes to the visa arrangements on either the resources consequently available to higher education institutions, or on the numbers of international students choosing particular higher education courses. Data on the number of students in higher education in 2003&#150;04 and the current academic year are not yet available. While no formal representations have been made to the Foreign Secretary on the proposed charges for applications to extend leave to remain in the UK, officials across government are working together to consider the possible impacts, and to ensure they are not unduly prohibitive for international students.

<p><a name="41027w16.html_spnew12"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The Government currently have no plans to ban the use of animals in assessing the safety of finished household products or their ingredients. National and international regulatory bodies require that the chemicals used in a range of household products are tested to assess the risk they might pose to man, animals and the environment. Under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 such testing using animals can only be licensed when the information to be obtained is considered essential to the required risk assessment, and when it cannot be obtained by non-animal methods. Unfortunately, there are, in some cases, still no reliable alternatives to this kind of animal testing if the necessary safety data are to be generated.

<p><a name="41027w16.html_spnew13"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The licensing and monitoring of animal experiments in the UK stem from the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, which transposes into UK law&#151;and in some respects exceeds&#151;the requirements of EU Directive 86/609. The 1986 Act is widely regarded as the most rigorous piece of legislation of its kind in the world, and there are at present no plans to change it or the regulation for which it provides.

<p><a name="41027w16.html_spnew14"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Animal experiments in the UK are not knowingly licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 if they unnecessarily duplicate such work undertaken elsewhere. Appropriate checks on this are undertaken when licence applications are considered. The Government cannot ensure that work licensed in the UK is not subsequently repeated in other countries, as that is beyond its jurisdiction. However, it contributes at the European and wider international level to ongoing efforts to prevent animals being used unnecessarily.

<p><a name="41027w16.html_spnew15"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 There are no plans to take any steps beyond continued rigorous application of the licensing controls in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, one effect of which is to ensure that there are no redundancies or unnecessary duplication in the conduct of animal experiments. Although some replication of experimental work is occasionally required for the purposes of scientific validation, the Government considers that the current regulatory system, as administered and implemented by the Home Office and its Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate, is effective in ensuring that animals are not bred or used unnecessarily.

<p><a name="41027w18.html_spnew2"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 There is no current estimate of the number of organised criminal groups that operate in the UK. Organised criminal groups can range from a collection of people with distinct roles and a hierarchy with clear chains of command and communication, to loose networks where the members coalesce around one or more prominent criminals to undertake particular criminal ventures. And in the latter, the individuals may be involved with a number of sub-groups within the network and therefore be involved in a number of separate criminal ventures at any one time.

 Poverty is about more than low income, it also affects the way people live&#151;their health, housing and the quality of their environment. The Government believes that for many work is the best route out of poverty.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027w19.html_para4">
We are determined to make work pay. That is why we have introduced the New Tax Credits from which over 6 million families are already benefiting and which has helped lift over half a million children out of low income since 1997. However, we know that there is still more to do, both in London and in other regions of the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027w19.html_para5">
We recognise that the availability of affordable child care is key to improving parents&#039; ability to take up and stay in work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027w19.html_para6">
Since 1998, the Sure Start Unit has created over 81,000 new child care places in London (against a target of 63,000) and delivered 8,000 new Neighbourhood Nursery places. We plan to further improve the availability of child care in London by creating an additional 37,000 places and over 8,000 full-time integrated child care and education places in over 200 new Children&#039;s Centres by March 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027w19.html_para7">
Child care provision is only one of many factors affecting employment and poverty in London. For example, London has a much higher proportion of lone 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Oct 2004 : Column 1283W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
mothers than anywhere else in the UK; more lone parents in London have no previous work experience, are full-time students, live in social rented properties and are less likely than those living elsewhere to be receiving any maintenance. All of these factors are associated with lower levels of paid work and contribute to the differences in employment rate between London and the rest of the UK.
</p>

The Government will continue to address these issues through our successful active labour market programmes such as the New Deal and by ensuring, through the Tax Credit system, that there are sufficient financial incentives to make work pay.

<p class="tabletext">All costs of design, development and implementation of the new IT system fall initially to EDS who provide this as a managed service to the Agency. The cost of the service is expected to be &#163;456 million payable over the period to the completion of the contract in 2010.</p>
</ul>
<p>

<p class="tabletext">The payment due each year is determined by the contract. It is linked to service levels and to the degree of functionality delivered.

Notes:<br>

1. The figures are based on 1 per cent. and 5 per cent. samples and are therefore subject to a degree of sampling variation.<br>

6. HB and CTB caseloads will include overlaps where a claimant is in receipt of both benefits.<br>

7. Income-related benefit caseloads include HB/CTB/IS/JSA(IB) recipients with all overlaps removed.<br>





8. IS/JSA(IB) data includes claimants in receipt of income-based JSA who would also be entitled to the contributory element.<br>

9. It is not possible to determine the value of the disability income guarantee. The total amounts refer to amounts of HB, CTB, IS/JSA(IB) paid to recipients with enhanced disability premium or enhanced child disability premium. It is not possible to determine how much of each benefit is due to the disability premium.<br>

<p><a name="41027w24.html_wqn6"><b> Miss Kirkbride: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the Association of Caravan and Camping Exempted Organisations was consulted in his review of permitted development rights; and if he will list the organisations which were consulted.  [193908]</p>




<p><a name="41027w24.html_spnew6"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has made no proposals to amend permitted development rights for caravan sites. A research report into permitted development, commissioned from consultants, was published last year on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s website, www.odpm.gov.uk. This was the initial phase of a review of permitted development by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. A list of those whom the researchers contacted has been made available in the Library of the House. We intend to consult early next year on changes to certain permitted development rights, but not on the rights to station caravans. If we decide to propose changes in that area, we would again go out to public consultation. The Association of Caravan and Camping Exempted Organisations will be welcome to contribute its views on any proposals we make.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister when all local authorities are expected to supply land searches electronically.  [193808]</p>




<p><a name="41027w24.html_spnew7"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister continues to encourage local authorities to subscribe to the National Land Information Service (NLIS) as the best way of e-enabling land searches. In turn this should improve the speed of response and efficiency of the service. NLIS has already been used for over three million searches and achieved an estimated 30&#150;35 per cent. of the e-conveyancing market share. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister anticipates that as part of the overall e-government target all local authorities should offer e-enabled land searches by December 2005.

<p><a name="41027w24.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b>

 The target for local authorities in England is 100 per cent. capability in electronic delivery of priority services by December 2005, in ways that customers will use. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister anticipates all authorities reaching this target. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will have new data on their progress in the new year. Authorities have been requested to submit this year&#039;s Implementing Electronic Government statements by 20 December.

<p><a name="41027w24.html_spnew10"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 There is no requirement for home information packs to be kept in an electronic format. Potential buyers may ask for a copy of the pack and the Housing Bill provides that this may be provided in an electronic format if the potential buyer agrees to it. This will assist efficiency and minimise costs. The Bill also specifies circumstances in which a copy may be refused, allows conditions to be attached and for a reasonable charge covering the costs of making and sending a copy to be made.

<p><a name="41027w25.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what proportion of planning appeals submitted to the Planning Inspectorate in <i>(a)</i> 2003 and <i>(b)</i> 2004 to date (i) have been and (ii) he expects to be determined within 30 weeks.  [193348]</p>






<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Oct 2004 : Column 1302W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="41027w25.html_spnew0"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The information requested is not held centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, in 2003&#150;04 the Inspectorate received 22,548 planning appeals (in England) and issued 18,914 decisions. 87 per cent. of the decisions issued that year were despatched within 30 weeks of receipt of the appeal. In 2004&#150;05 (year to date&#151;30 September) the Inspectorate has received 12,222 planning appeals (in England) and has issued 7,339 decisions. 79 per cent. of the decisions so far issued in 2004&#150;05 have been despatched within 30 weeks of receipt of the appeal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027w25.html_para0">
It is likely that over the year as a whole the proportion of appeals determined within 30 weeks will reduce. This is due to the considerable growth in the number of planning appeals received; in the first six months of the year receipts were about 23 per cent. more than in the same period last year.

 In the debate on the security screen on 22 April 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 467, the Leader of the House quoted a figure of &#163;1.3 million.
