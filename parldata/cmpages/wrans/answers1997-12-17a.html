<a name="71217w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what research his Department is undertaking into marriage. [20141]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Department has commissioned two research projects on marriage which began in April 1997. The first, which looks at individuals' views of marriage over two generations, is being undertaken by Professor Jane Lewis of All Souls College, Oxford and will be completed in March 1999. The second, by One plus One, is the preparation of a series of review papers on the causes, and ways of preventing, marital breakdown. This is due to be completed in March 1998.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what criteria will be applied in <i>(a)</i> assessing the success and value for money of the 13 projects being financed in 1997-98 in support of marriage and <i>(b)</i> determining whether to renew funding for 1998-99 and beyond for each project. [20142]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The aims of the programme are (i) to identify the types of service which support marriage most effectively; (ii) to increase public awareness of marriage support services; and (iii) to improve access to existing services. The Department will assess the effectiveness of each project in terms of the achievement of its specific aims and objectives and its cost effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="71217w01.html_para0">Whether or not the Department decides to continue funding any of the projects will depend on the results of evaluation and the availability of further resources.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what was the conviction rate and clear up rate for rape cases expressed as a percentage and in total in each of the last five years; and if he will make a statement. [20593]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Government are very concerned about the low proportion of reported rapes that result in a conviction. The Research and Statistics Directorate in the Home Office is undertaking a study to discover what factors influence whether or not a recorded rape leads to a conviction for rape and whether such factors have changed since a similar study of 1985 cases. I am today placing in the Library copies of an interim report on the processing of rape cases in the criminal justice system. 



<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 1997 : Column: 172</I><P>
The interim report provides some useful information on where reported rape cases drop out before they reach court. We now need to know precisely why so many cases fail to result in a conviction. This will be covered in the final report, which should be available in the second half of next year.
<P>

<a name="71217w02.html_para0">My right hon. Friend has already announced a number of wide-ranging reforms to make the criminal justice system more swift and effective. In July, he also set up an inter-departmental working group to look at further ways of assisting vulnerable witnesses, including rape victims, which is due to report shortly.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Working practices and organisation in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate are currently being looked at internally in order to improve the service to applicants. Next year, the introduction of the Caseworking Programme in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate will produce efficiency savings which will speed up the processing of these applications.

<P>
<a name="71217w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what conditions would have to be satisfied for a drug classified as Schedule 1 in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 to be reclassified as Schedule 2. [20627]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1985 allow and govern activities in relation to controlled drugs which would otherwise be unlawful under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. They divide those drugs into five schedules, with those in Schedule 1 being subject to the most stringent controls.
<P>

<a name="71217w02.html_para1">The drugs in Schedule 1 are generally acknowledged to have no therapeutic applications and their use is accordingly confined by international convention and domestic law to research and other special purposes.
<P>

<a name="71217w02.html_para2">Reclassification from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2 would depend upon the therapeutic benefits of a medicinal form of the drug being satisfactorily demonstrated in the United Kingdom, or the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs reducing the international controls on the drug.

However a not guilty outcome as a result of the presumption of doli incapax is neither in the interests of the child or children concerned nor in the interests of the public. It is clearly important that the court is not prevented from dealing with the youngster when there is no doubt about the facts of the case.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what arrangements she has made to ensure the continued supply of concessionary fuel to ex-employees of British Coal. [21817]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 My Department took over liability to supply concessionary fuel to ex-employees of British Coal in March 1995. Contracts were placed then with two companies to supply and deliver concessionary fuel over the period from March 1995 up to March 1998.
<P>

<a name="71217w02.html_para3">Following a competitive tender, two-year contracts have recently been awarded to T. H. Fergusson Ltd. in Scotland and Coal Products Distribution Ltd. in England and Wales, to take effect from 30 March 1998. Both companies already supply and deliver solid fuel to other domestic customers.
<P>

<a name="71217w02.html_para4">All fuel supplied will continue to be of high quality and approved for use by HETAS, the solid fuel industry's Heating and Testing Approvals Scheme.
<P>

<a name="71217w02.html_para5">My Department's agents, the National Concessionary Fuel Office (NCFO), will continue to administer the concessionary fuel service, handling all inquiries and claims about entitlements from the beneficiaries.
<P>

<a name="71217w02.html_para6">Because European law on public procurement requires one manufacturer not to be favoured over another, and because fuel prices have changed in relation to each other and the mix of fuels bid into the tender is different from the last tender, it will be necessary to revise the entitlement levels for some brands of manufactured smokeless fuels to ensure that cost of supplying fuel to each beneficiary is equivalent. Higher prices for some brands means this rebalancing will reduce annual entitlements from present levels for those beneficiaries who receive those brands. However, all beneficiaries will have the opportunity either to remain with those brands or to switch to broadly equivalent fuels which will generally provide the same or higher entitlements. Anyone switching to a cheaper brand will receive more than they receive at present.
<P>

<a name="71217w02.html_para7">No-one need change from the fuel they receive now. No-one will be made to change, everyone will be able to make their own decision. Fuller details are being provided to the mining unions this month and to the recipients of concessionary fuel early in the New Year so that they can make their wishes known and stocks can be ordered.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 December 1997]:</i> The Consumer Protection Act 1987 contains a power to make regulations prohibiting the supply of goods to particular classes of people; for example to children under the age of 18 if the goods would be unsafe in the hands of those people. However, to do this we would require clear evidence that there was a safety problem arising from the sale of Class 1 or Class 2 laser pointers 



<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 1997 : Column: 174</I><P>
to children under 18 years. To date there is no such evidence since all incidents appear to involve Class 3 lasers and above.
<P>

<a name="71217w02.html_para8">On 28 October I acted swiftly in urging Trading Standards Departments to remove from general sale all Class 3 and Class 4 laser pointers as specified under BS EN 60825-Part 1: 1994 (Safety of laser products), because these pointers present an unacceptable risk to consumers. I have been advised by the National Radiological Protection Board that there is no evidence that laser pointers in Class 1 or Class 2 of the BS EN standard can cause a direct risk to health.

<P>
<a name="71217w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 December 1997]:</i> Overall, the changes will have little impact on companies' post tax profits, which are of course computed on an accruals basis rather than by reference to cash flow. No company will pay more corporation tax in total as a result of the changes, and from 1999 companies will be free to take a whole range of business decisions without having to worry about ACT and, more particularly, surplus ACT.

 My Department does not generally collect data on the payment of awards. However, the most recent survey of Industrial Tribunal Applications (the 1992 Survey of Industrial Tribunal Applications, Employment Department Research Series No. 22) reported that the median time for payment of awards as a lump sum was 7 to 14 days after the hearing. Once an award is made, the payment is a matter for the parties and it can be enforced through the civil courts in the normal manner. To help ensure prompt payment, awards which are paid late attract interest.

<P>
<P>
<P>

 Industrial tribunal awards of money are enforced through the normal mechanisms of the civil courts. In Scotland they are enforced in the same manner as extract decrees arbitral. This means that if payment is not made the creditor may proceed to diligence without requiring to refer to the civil courts for a decree. Diligence is effected in the normal manner for civil debts. To help ensure prompt payment, awards which are paid late will attract interest.

 My right hon. Friend welcomes the various Dearing Report recommendations on widening participation and has asked the Higher Education Funding Council for England to give priority in funding additional places to those institutions which can demonstrate a commitment to widening participation. We shall be monitoring the composition of applicants and new entrants to higher education as a whole. It is, however, for individual universities and colleges to determine whether or not to publish data on the characteristics of applicants and new entrants to their own institution. The Department does not keep a record of which universities do or do not publish such information, but we know that the universities of Oxford and Cambridge publish annually an analysis of applications and accepted applicants which includes details of the candidates' previous schooling. The Universities and College Admissions Service (UCAS) routinely provide each higher education establishment with detailed analyses of their applicants and accepted applicants through the bi-annual Management Statistics and the institutional datasets. Ethnicity data are available by institution within the Higher Education Management Statistics, available from the Higher Education Statistics Agency. With the authorisation of the institutions involved, UCAS can provide demographic details of applicants and accepted applicants to each institution.

These include a code of conduct to guide future negotiations; a mechanism to institutionalise security co-operation and handle crises; facilitating agreement on implementation of commitments under the Interim Agreement, in particular on Gaza air and sea ports and transit arrangements between the West Bank and Gaza; and engaging Israel in a dialogue on ways of removing obstacles to Palestinian economic development.

<P>
<a name="71217w06.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Mallon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what fluoride compounds are added to public water supplies in Tandragee and Bangor; in what concentration; and by whom they are supplied. [20063]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 The fluoride content of the water supply is increased only in water supplied to Tandragee and Holywood. The water supplied to Bangor is not subject to fluoridation. The compound of fluorine used to increase the fluoride content of the water supply is hexafluorosilicic acid.
<P>

<a name="71217w06.html_para1">The fluoridation of water is subject to the provisions of the Water (Fluoridation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1987. Under the provisions of that Order the concentration of fluoride is, so far as is reasonably practicable, required to be maintained at one milligram per litre.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 I have received 15 representations in relation to fluoridation. Five of the representations related to the fluoridation of Tandragee's water supply.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment has been made of the impact of fluoridation on the <i>(a)</i> dental and <i>(b)</i> general medical health of the population of Tandragee and Bangor. [20066]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 No assessment of the effects of fluoridation have been carried out in Tandaragee or Holywood because the population supplied with fluoridated water is too small for a valid statistical assessment to be made. However observation by general dental practitioners and community dentists indicate the patients in Tandragee and Holywood supplied with fluoridated water enjoy better dental health than those who do not receive fluoridated water.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w06.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 Following encouragement from Government in 1968 Councils responsible for Tandragee and Holywood agreed to introduce fluoridation schemes in these areas.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w06.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 Fluoridation takes place at the water treatment works serving Tandragee and Holywood. These schemes were both introduced by their respective Councils. The Holywood plant became operational in 1970 followed in 1974 with the opening of the Tandragee plant.

Israel has undertaken to verify the originating status of orange juice exported to the Community since June 1995 and to complete these inquiries by 10 March 1998.

 Increasing the recycling and recovery of waste packaging is an important element of achieving a more sustainable waste strategy. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 are intended broadly to double UK recycling and recovery rates by the year 2001, so that around 50 per cent. of all waste packaging is recovered. These regulations, enacted by the previous Government, are based on an industry agreement reached on 15 December 1995 and, as I have indicated previously, I am keen to ensure that we review their effectiveness and ensure that they fairly reflect that agreement. I accept the importance of an early Review as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Packaging, chaired by Sir Peter Parker, to the then Secretary of State for the Environment, the right hon.

 On 10 October I invited all authorities which are eligible to participate in the Local Government Reorganisation Costs Scheme for 1998-99, and which have been or are to be reorganised on or before 1 April 1998, to submit estimates of the amount of expenditure they expect to incur on transitional costs of reorganisation in 1998-99.

 Whilst my right hon.

<a name="71217w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 I have today placed copies of the final report of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Blight in the Library. The report is accompanied by a draft Code of Practice on the dissemination of information during the various stages of major infrastructure developments. I have also deposited copies of the report of the research conducted by the City University Business School into the operation of compulsory purchase orders which is published today by the Stationery Office.
<P>

<a name="71217w10.html_para1">The Interdepartmental Working Group on Blight was set up to review the scope, cause and effects of blight arising during the various stages of major infrastructure projects and to consider whether any practical changes can be made to the existing arrangements for property purchase and compensation throughout Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="71217w10.html_para2">The Group has identified a number of options. One relates to the desirability of improving information flows at all stages of major infrastructure developments, and this provided the impetus for the Code of Practice. A further tranche of recommendations relates to relatively small-scale amendments to existing legislation. However, one recommendation (that a new property purchase guarantee and compensation scheme should be devised) would, if it were accepted, involve major changes to legislation. I should emphasise that this recommendation, which is born of a desire to reduce or eliminate generalised blight, does not undermine the fundamentals of the existing blight and compensation arrangements.
<P>

<a name="71217w10.html_para3">The Group points out that although the focus of the review was generalised blight consequent upon proposals for major infrastructure projects, responses to the discussion paper issued in June last year suggested that the most effective remedy might lie in changes to the arrangements for addressing statutory blight. However, the Group, in seeking to ameliorate the worst effects of generalised blight in this way, has not sought to reassess compulsory purchase and compensation law in its entirety, nor has it considered it consistent with its terms of reference to recommend changes to the law which are not germane to the issue of generalised blight.
<P>

<a name="71217w10.html_para4">The Group has delivered a detailed report on a subject of some complexity. None of the issues is clear-cut, nor are any of the options it has identified free from wider consequences. For this reason I am anxious that the report should be made widely available for discussion and comment before I, together with my ministerial colleagues

<P>

<a name="71217w10.html_para5">The guidelines, which have been prepared with the close cooperation of the Government Offices in the Regions, MOD and my Department, are designed to help mitigate any adverse impact on a local community which may follow the closure of a defence establishment. We hope that, by putting in place arrangements for joint working between MOD and the Government Offices, and by bringing into discussions at an early stage local authorities and other agencies which may be involved in planning the future use of redundant sites, the full potential of these sits will be realised, consistent with the principles of sustainable development. It is hoped that these arrangements will also help speed up the disposal process. It should be noted, however, that these guidelines may, in due course, need to be revised to take account of research currently underway into the development of the redundant defence estate, and to reflect the establishment of the Regional Development Agencies. For this reason, they should be seen as interim.

 The UK was one of the first countries to ratify the Second Sulphur Protocol under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution. This commits the UK to reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide by 80 per cent. by 2010 compared with 1980 levels. The Government are currently taking an active part in negotiations in the EU on a Strategy to further combat acid deposition. This was discussed on 16 December at a meeting of EU Environment Ministers.

<a name="71217w12.html_para2">Acid rain is an on-going transboundary issue and only by concerted action across Europe shall we deal effectively with the problem. The final report of the Welsh Acid Water Survey carried out in 1995-96 and commissioned by the Welsh Office and the Environment Agency was published on 26 November. The Survey indicates that although there are signs that the benefits of emission controls are being felt in the environment the recovery of sensitive ecosystems has been slow.

This project will review the full range of trust services to find ways of using telemedicine technology to benefit much larger numbers of patients. The results will be published at a conference and exhibition on telemedicine in Cardiff on 27 and 28 April 1998. I expect health authorities and trusts to learn from such work and to exploit opportunities in their own areas.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 contains an exemption which allows the possession of starting pistols by certain officials for use in the starting of athletics races. These pistols must be held on a firearm certificate which will be issued only where the police are satisfied that the individual requires the pistol because of the status of the athletics meetings at which he officiates. Most starting pistols can fire only blank rounds.
<P>

<a name="71217w13.html_para1">No representations have been received from the police on this issue. The British Athletic Federation sought the retention of the exemption when the Government announced their intention to ban small-calibre pistols. The Federation is currently funding research into an effective alternative to the starting pistol.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 Currently the Crown Estate, as owners of the seabed, issue licences for minerals dredging. A prerequisite to the issue of a licence is a favourable "Government View" (GV) issued by the Scottish Office which co-ordinates and considers the views of Government Departments and responses to public consultation on the proposals before issuing a GV.
<P>

<a name="71217w13.html_para2">After consideration of all the responses to earlier consultation on the review of the GV procedure, we have concluded that the way forward is to introduce statutory procedures for the better regulation of marine minerals dredging in Scotland to replace the non-statutory GV procedure. The new arrangements would be based on the Secretary of State for Scotland being responsible for administering, monitoring and enforcing the new dredging consents; those consents being subject to regular review; the costs of administering the new statutory procedures being recovered from operators; and a statutory right of appeal against refusal. Although to date there has only been limited dredging activity in Scotland, pending legislation an interim scheme will be introduced and administered by the Scottish Office in place of the Crown Estate's current role in the GV process.

 Three trawlers were used for specific intelligence gathering operations against the former Soviet Navy in the mid 1960s and early 1970s. These operations ceased in 1973. All of the vessels were owned by a Hull based company and almost certainly operated from that port. For those operations conducted in the 1960s, the owner was guaranteed compensation for loss of catch resulting from any diversion from the trawler's usual fishing grounds. Available records do not indicate whether similar arrangement existed for those carried out in the 1970s.

 My Department has completed the process of scanning onto the Dosimetry Information Database all the available dosimetry documents from the former Dockyard at Chatham that are not part of an Approved Dosimetry Service. This includes all such records from before 1979. The database complements the approved Dosimetry Service records and will allow searches for all of the information relating to an individual to be carried out much more speedily than in the past.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 2 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>171</i>, if he will make a statement on the scheme whereby Royal Navy officers gained sea-going experience in deep sea trawlers. [20354]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w14.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 It has been long standing practice to send junior RN officers to sea on Merchant ships. In the 1950s this was extended to include deep sea trawlers. The aim was to provide sea going experience and to foster good relationships between the fleets. While the Royal Navy/Merchant Navy Voyage Scheme continues to this day, available records indicate that the use of trawlers ceased in the mid-1970s.

 <i>[holding answer 16 December 1997]:</i> Under the terms of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Acts 1976 and 1989, my Department is required to monitor the religious/community background of employees wholly or mainly employed in Northern Ireland.

There is therefore no requirement to monitor the religious/community background of this or any other General Service Battalion and the information requested is not monitored centrally in Northern Ireland.

 The marketing authorisation (the licensing) of all medicines throughout the European Union is governed by the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union, in particular, Council Directive 65/65/EEC. Under these rules a licence application is refused if the medicinal product is harmful in the normal conditions of use, or if its therapeutic efficacy is lacking or is insufficiently substantiated, or if there are concerns about its qualitative and quantitative composition. In this context "therapeutic efficacy" and "clinical effectiveness" are judged to be synonymous.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Bone marrow donors are recruited through two organisations. The British Bone Marrow Register is funded through the national health service and recruits from blood donors at blood donation sessions. The Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow Trust is a charity funded by voluntary giving and recruits donors from the general public through local and national publicity campaigns. Both of these organisations, as well as some local campaigns, are working to encourage donation from ethnic minority groups.
<P>

<a name="71217w15.html_para1">The Anthony Nolan Trust has been particularly active in this field, both nationally and locally. It has produced leaflets and posters to encourage donations from the African-Caribbean community and has also worked to encourage people from the Greek and Turkish communities to come forward as donors. This year the Department funded through the Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow Trust a commercial to be included in Asian video films to appeal to the Asian community to donate blood and bone marrow.
<P>

<a name="71217w15.html_para2">There have also been local campaigns. In Birmingham, for example, transplant co-ordinators have produced a multi-ethnic poster to encourage donation generally (the poster features the organ donation card) by people from ethnic minority groups.
<P>

<a name="71217w15.html_para3">More generally, there are continuing campaigns to encourage positive attitudes towards tissue donation. During this year, the Department is promoting a wide range of measures designed to increase the number of regular blood donors through raising awareness of the need to maintain supplies of blood to hospitals. This includes the launch this year of a new 3 to 5 year publicity strategy, designed to increase the current donor base. As the British Bone Marrow Register recruits solely from those who are blood donors any success in increasing blood donation should also lead to increased numbers registering as potential bone marrow donors.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what representations his Department has received in response to the de-registering of patients who have not visited their dentist within the last 15 months; and if he will make a statement. [21322]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 From 1 September 1996, the registration period for both adult continuing care and child capitation was harmonised to provide patients with a period of continuing dental care for 15 months following each course of treatment. The aim of the changes was to improve value for money by focusing payments to dentists on those patients receiving active care from them.
<P>

<a name="71217w16.html_para0">Patients lapse from dentists' lists only if they have not seen their dentists since they registered. This is so, irrespective of the length of the registration period. Patients who attend their dentist at least every 15 months, have their registration period rolled forward automatically for another 15 months when they attend. They will notice no difference from the changes. Less regular attenders are still fully entitled to NHS dental treatment.
<P>

<a name="71217w16.html_para1">The changes to the registration periods were agreed with the British Dental Association (BDA) before they were implemented in September 1996. The BDA has recently changed its position, and has asked the Department to look again at the length of the registration periods.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Patients who attend their dentist regularly will not be affected by the change in registration period. Less regular attenders are still fully entitled to National Health Service dental treatment, and are free to register at any time with a dentist willing to accept them.

[20411]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The evaluation consists of two phases. The first phase was in two parts. First, a review of literature on residential provision for people with learning disabilities. The terms of reference were

<a name="71217w16.html_para2">Professor Eric Emerson of Hester Adrian Research Centre, University of Manchester, successfully competed for the contract for the first phase of the research which cost &#163;26,471.

<P>

<a name="71217w16.html_para3">The second phase consists of two related parts. The first will look at a sample of 300 people with learning disabilities living in residential or village communities, and 300 people with learning disabilities living in small scale community-based residential services. In the second part, more detailed information will be collected on two smaller matched sub-samples of people with profound multiple learning disabilities living in residential or village communities, and small scale community-based residential services.
<P>

<a name="71217w16.html_para4">Analyses of the data will focus upon: (1) describing and comparing the characteristics of the people served, the types of services received, the costs of services received and the outcomes associated with the two approaches to residential provision; and (2) examining the inter-relationships between the characteristics of the people served, the types of services received, the costs of services received and the resulting outcomes within and across the two types of provision.
<P>

<a name="71217w16.html_para5">To avoid any undue delay in the start of the second phase of the research, and because he successfully completed the first phase, Professor Eric Emerson of the Hester Adrian Research Centre, University of Manchester, was approached on a single tender basis to take the second phase forward. Professor Martin Knapp of the Personal Social Services Research Unit at the London School of Economics is undertaking the economic aspects of the research.
<P>

<a name="71217w16.html_para6">The study was commissioned in December 1996 at a cost to the Department of &#163;274,464. Main findings from the study are expected in December 1998.

 Yes. The European Commission has allocated the United Kingdom some &#163;20.3 million to operate the Scheme during 1998. Approximately 10 million cans of stewed steak will be made available to local authorities and to charitable and other non-profit making organisations to distribute to those on Income Support, Family Credit, Jobseekers Allowance (income based only) or Disability Working Allowance, the homeless and destitute and those living in welfare hostels.

<P>

<a name="71217w17.html_para2">The committee did not consider that there was an immediate risk from intraspecies feeding. However, they thought it possible that TSEs might arise spontaneously in any species with a prion protein gene, and that if this were the case the practice of recycling waste as feed within a species could spread any resultant disease. The committee describes the risk here as small, but considered that it could not be discounted completely.
<P>

<a name="71217w17.html_para3">The committee has recommended that the Government develop a strategy to remove this risk, taking account of practical enforcement considerations and alternative disposal option, and discuss it with EC partners. Although the risk is small, I intend to accept this recommendation on a precautionary basis.
<P>

<a name="71217w17.html_para4">Essentially this means that the current practices of processing certain types of waste containing porcine material and feeding it as swill to pigs, and using poultry and feather meal as high protein ration for poultry, will have to end. Before legislating, however, I shall, as advised, consider the alternative routes for disposing of such waste. I am currently conducting a review of national animal waste legislation and intend to issue proposed legislation for consultation early in the New Year. That will set out our proposals in respect of pig swill subject to any further discussions in the European Community. I shall use that opportunity to ask for comments on the other issue raised by SEAC's advice. Subject to those comments, I also envisage bringing forward legislation to ban the recycling of poultry meals as poultry feed, but want to sound out Community partners first.
<P>

<a name="71217w17.html_para5">This action to avoid any possibility that a risk which the committee described as "small" and "potential" means that consumers will continue to enjoy the highest possible protection against the risks from TSEs, and give the assurance that pig and poultry products remain TSE free.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Eligible vessels other than purse seiners and freezer trawlers will have their existing licences replaced by a new category A pelagic (trawler) licence. Any vessel which already holds a beam trawler licence will be permitted to continue to fish by that method.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Ring Fencing of Pelagic Licences</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From 1 April 1998 vessels holding a category A pelagic (purse seine or freezer trawler) licence or a category A pelagic (trawler) licence will be ring fenced. Anyone wishing to introduce a new vessel into the pelagic fleet or to modify an existing pelagic vessel may only do so by acquiring an entitlement to a pelagic (purse seine or freezer trawler) licence or to a pelagic (trawler) licence. Within the ring fence it will not be possible to undertake a single licence transfer which involves the placement of a pelagic (trawler) licence on a pelagic freezer trawler or purse seiner.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Existing capacity penalties--10 per cent. for licence transfers and 20 per cent. for licence aggregations--will continue to apply to all licence transactions within the pelagic ring fence, as will existing restrictions on engine power and tonnage. However from 1 April 1998 the replacement or modification of purse seiners or pelagic freezer trawlers will be subject to a zero capacity penalty where single licence transfers occur or to a 10 per cent. capacity penalty where the aggregation of licences occurs. Any freezer trawler must be capable of processing at least 30 tonnes of pelagic species per day.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As from today it will no longer be possible to aggregate white fish licences with pelagic (purse seine or freezer trawler) licences to undertake minor engine modifications. The provision to park licences on purse seiners or freezer trawlers for up to two years pending their replacement or modification will also be terminated from this date.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As at present there will be no restrictions on category A pelagic licences being downgraded to ordinary category A white fish licences.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>The Recording of Engine Power on Fishing Vessel Licences</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For all licence transactions which will take place from 1 January 1999 the Fisheries Departments propose that the engine power to be recorded on the fishing vessel licence shall be the maximum continuous engine power that is capable of being generated by the vessel's engine. It is further proposed that this provision be extended on 1 January 2000 to all vessels licensed before 31 December 1998. Where fishing vessels engines have been permanently derated, the derated engine power will be treated as the maximum continuous engine power.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In parallel with the arrangements set out in the previous paragraph the Fisheries Departments will be undertaking random checks to ensure that the maximum continuous engine power of fishing vessels is not greater than that which is stated on the fishing vessel licence.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Review of the Licensing Arrangements</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The present system of licensing has evolved over a long period following the agreement of the Common Fisheries Policy in 1982. It is the mechanism through which the Fisheries Departments seek to regulate both fishing activity and the size and structure of the UK fleet. Over the years the system has become highly complex in terms of the number of different licences that are issued, the conditions which are attached to the licences, the arrangements for transferring and aggregating licences, and the operation of capacity penalties and tonnage and engine power constraints which together exert downward pressure on the size of the UK fleet. Although a number of changes to the licensing arrangements have been announced today, I believe that it would be beneficial to undertake a more detailed review of the operation of the arrangements to establish whether they are necessary and if so how they may be improved. In undertaking such a review it is important to take account of the knowledge and expertise that lies within the fishing industry. To this end I propose that a series of 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>17 Dec 1997 : Column: 229</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>meetings should be held with representatives of the principal fishermen's organisations and that a report on the conclusions reached be presented to Ministers. This forum will also be invited to consider what arrangements might be made to accommodate the recording of maximum continuous engine power on fishing vessel licences.</FONT></UL>

The risk to puppies or kittens born to a quarantined mother is believed to be restricted to transmission of infected saliva after birth. Transmission of the rabies virus in utero is unknown, according to the scientific literature. As the rabies virus is present in the saliva for less than two weeks before clinical signs appear there is no risk to offspring if the mother is clinically healthy a fortnight after separation from the litter.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment she has made, and on the basis of what sources of information, of the difference in incomes between lone parents on income support and those in work <i>(a)</i> before and <i>(b)</i> after child care costs are taken into account. [19703]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71217w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Estimates by the independent Policy Studies Institute indicate that the weekly income for lone parents already in work and receiving Family Credit is likely to be, on average, over &#163;50 more than their estimated income on Income Support.
<P>

<a name="71217w20.html_para5">This estimate is based on a 1994 sample of lone parents in work, adjusted by the Policy Studies Institute to take account of two subsequent policy changes (the introduction of the childcare disregard in all in-work benefits in October 1994 and the introduction of a 30 hour credit in Family Credit in July 1995) and the annual uprating of benefit levels. It does not take account of changes announced in June 1997 to extend the child care disregard further.
<P>

<a name="71217w20.html_para6">The &#163;50 per week estimate is before in-work costs which, excluding child care costs, averaged &#163;5 per week; 79 per cent. were not paying for child care.
<P>

<a name="71217w20.html_para7">Some 21 per cent. of the sample were paying for child care. After allowing for in-work costs, including the costs of child care, this group is on average over &#163;18 per week better off in work than on Income Support. These figures are, however, based on a small sample and should be treated with caution.
<P>

<a name="71217w20.html_para8">Direct comparisons between out of work income and in-work income for those lone parents currently receiving Income Support are difficult. It is not straightforward to predict the earnings of those lone parents who move into work since this would depend on the type of job they might get, and for how many hours. In addition, it is not possible to predict what child care costs they might have.
<P>

<a name="71217w20.html_para9">In order to ensure that more lone parents are better off financially in work, the Government will implement a National Minimum Wage and National Child Care Strategy, reforming the tax and benefit systems, and provide extra help with the cost of child care and access to lifetime learning.
<P>

<a name="71217w20.html_para10">It is important to recognise, though, that the financial return from working is not the only consideration which lone parents make in deciding to work. Qualitative research indicates that some lone parents choose to work in part to provide a role model for their children, and to take them away from dependency on benefit.

<a name="71217w20.html_para11">The New Deal for Lone Parents will provide practical help and advice for the lone parents on Income Support who want to move into work.

Households Below Average Income (HBAI).<P>

<i>Notes:<P>

</i>1. Figures are for 1995-96.<P>

2. The data come from the Department's Households Below Average Income (HBAI) series, based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS) and covering Great Britain. The FRS data were used to achieve a large enough sample size to provide more robust information. All results are subject to sampling error.<P>

3. Both mean and median figures are given. This is because mean results may be affected by atypical households skewing the results.<P>

4. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income. The definition of income used follows that in the published HBAI series for FRS based results and therefore takes no account of child care costs; figures are given both before and after housing costs in line with usual HBAI practice. Families are counted as "with a mortgage" if the household they live in has a mortgage.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 25 November 1997]:</i> The Government strongly believe that work is the best form of welfare for people of working age, and have set aside &#163;195 million to fund a programme improving opportunities for sick and disabled people who want to work. We are currently consulting representatives from a number of disability organisations and employers on our initial proposals. These include funding a number of innovative schemes to explore how best to help people move into work or stay in work; introducing personal advisers to help sick and disabled people to overcome barriers to work; an information campaign to improve knowledge of the existing help available to help people into work and to change attitudes of benefit recipients, employers and the public; and a programme of research and evaluation to develop our understanding of the client group and to determine the effect of our initiatives. Participation in the welfare to work programme will be voluntary.
<P>

<a name="71217w21.html_para3">In addition we are examining the effect of benefit rules on incentives for sick and disabled people who want to work as part of our comprehensive spending review, and are considering the need for any changes. We are particularly keen that benefit rules should not discourage participation in the Welfare to Work programme.
<P>

<a name="71217w21.html_para4">We are committed to looking at ways of ending the exclusion of disabled people, and empowering them to play a full role in society. We want to develop an approach which focuses on people's abilities, instead of their disabilities.
