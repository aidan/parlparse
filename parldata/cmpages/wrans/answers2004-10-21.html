 Data for industrial processes regulated by the Environment Agency are published in the Environment Agency&#039;s Pollution Inventory for years since 1998. This information shows that greenhouse gas emissions from major industry and power generation in Yorkshire and the Humber increased by about 1.7 per cent. between 1998 and 2003, mainly because of an increase in emissions from power generation in 2003. The Pollution Inventory does not include emissions from transport, the residential sector, small-scale business or the public sector. A previous study conducted for Yorkshire Forward by Cambridge Econometrics suggests that between 1995 and 2001, greenhouse gas emissions from all sources in Yorkshire and the Humber fell by 2.4 per cent.

<p><a name="41021w07.html_wqn3"><b> Diana Organ: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the Joint Nature Conservancy Council has produced recommendations for <i>(a)</i> the protection and <i>(b)</i> the re-establishment of the red squirrel.  [192511]</p>




<p><a name="41021w07.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The red squirrel is currently protected in the UK by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (and The Wildlife and Countryside (Northern Ireland) Order 1982), amended, most recently, by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW) for England and Wales and the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004. It is included in both Schedules 5 and 6 making it an offence to kill or injure a red squirrel or disturb its place of rest. In addition to this the red squirrel was identified as a priority species for conservation action by the UK Biodiversity Action Plan process. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee, as a member of the UK Red Squirrel Group (UKRSG), has undertaken research into the conservation issues of the red squirrel, and has set out recommended actions and targets in the red squirrel Species Action Plan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41021w07.html_para4">
The UKRSG has largely focused conservation action for the red squirrel in key woodland sites where they are still present. A prioritisation exercise has identified those sites with suitable red squirrel habitat that can be managed to ensure their continued survival and reduce the influence of factors that may be causing their decline, such as habitat loss and loss of habitat condition, grey squirrel incursion and disease.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41021w07.html_para5">
With regards to the re-establishment of the red squirrel in the UK, there are several issues to be addressed, including the amelioration of the reasons for their decline at different sites. JNCC, and the UKRSG, have produced best practice guidelines on the release of red squirrels, but do not recommend the re-introduction of red squirrels without careful consideration of the site to ensure that it is of suitable habitat to support a red squirrel population and that it can be protected from the above factors.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action her Department intends to take to control the grey squirrel.  [192512]</p>




<p><a name="41021w07.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Grey squirrels are difficult animals to control, particularly on a wide scale. Landowners can take positive action to control grey squirrels locally to protect isolated populations of red squirrels and woodlands. I refer the hon.

This document aims to facilitate the implementation of Sustainable drainage options (such as reed bed technology) in developments in England and Wales by providing model maintenance agreements and advice on their use. It provides a set of agreements between those public organisations with statutory or regulatory responsibilities relating to SUDS, including local authorities.

 Requests to make orders to close rights of way under section 118 (and section 118B) of the Highways Act 1980 are made to local authorities, and the role of the Secretary of State is to designate areas within which the powers under section 118B may be used by local highway authorities in response to the local authority applications. We have received 23 applications to designate such areas since the legislation came into force in February 2002; 14 were received in 2003 and nine in 2004. 20 have been approved, covering 72 areas in England.

 No specific assessment has been made. Network Rail must seek consent from English Nature if they wish to undertake a potentially damaging operation on an SSSI in England in their ownership.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) is committed to working with the governments of developing countries towards the education of all children, including those with limited vision and blindness. Poor vision has a detrimental impact on access to education and literacy. DFID is therefore engaged in ongoing discussions with developing countries governments to help find ways to improve the vision of children and adults.

<p><a name="41021w10.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn </b> 
<i>[holding answer 18 October 2004]:</i> DFID uses consultants to help development partners manage a wide range of aid programmes on the ground. For example, in Uganda, DFID-funded consultants have helped the Government manage the HIV/AIDS crisis. In Bangladesh, consultants have helped the Government strengthen management of health services, saving administration costs and improving service delivery at local level. In Grenada, a DFID funded consultant is helping the Prime Minister&#039;s Office plan for reconstruction and development following the hurricane.

For those county areas that were affected by local government reorganisation on 1 April 1998, the figures used for each year relate to the current county area. For example, the figures used for Essex for each year cover only the area currently covered by Essex county council, and not the areas of Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock, where there are now unitary authorities.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) what information his Department has received about the EU&#039;s Interreg Equi Save Atlantic Area Project; and if he will make a statement;  [190925]

<p>(2) what discussions he has had with agriculture Ministers in <i>(a)</i> Scotland, <i>(b)</i> Wales and <i>(c)</i> Northern Ireland on eligibility of breeders of rare equine species for the EU&#039;s Interreg Equi Save Project; and if he will make a statement;  [190927]

<p>(3) what steps have been taken to consult breeders of rare equine species in the United Kingdom about the EU&#039;s Interreg Equi Save Project; and if he will make a statement.  [190929]</p>




<p><a name="41021w11.html_spnew3"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, which helps to co-ordinate UK interests in the European-funded Interreg initiative, received a copy of an application for European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) support under the Interreg IIIB Atlantic Area Programme from the French lead partner, Les Haras Nationaux (French public sector body charged with promoting and developing equine interests at regional level).
</p>


<p>
<a name="41021w11.html_para4">
The application indicated that there were no UK partners who would derive any financial support. There were two English associate partners with minor engagement (Exmoor Pony Society and Exmoor Ponies in Conservation).
</p>


<p>
<a name="41021w11.html_para5">
It is normal practice for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to liaise at official level with the Devolved Administrations over any such applications which have partners in either Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland and, where appropriate, with Government Offices and other Government Departments. In the case of the Equi Save project, there were no ERDF beneficiaries in any of the UK countries. The project has now been approved by the programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41021w11.html_para6">
The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister sought clarification on the eligibility of rare equine species from the programme authorities who confirmed that they are eligible.

Breeders of rare horses in the United Kingdom were not consulted as there were no UK ERDF beneficiaries.

 Both the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and planning inspectors will consider appeals from Gypsies on a case by case basis taking account of material considerations such as the local assessment of the need for sites in the area and policies in the local development framework. Local connections are a lesser consideration because of changing work patterns. Local planning authorities should consider applications on the same basis and grant planning permission if appropriate.

 Where needs have been identified in a particular area through the Local Housing Needs Assessment process, local authorities will be required to formulate a strategy on how that need may be met, whether or not they have already made provision for Gypsies and Travellers in the past.

 The need for Gypsy and Traveller sites in a particular area will be determined through the Local Housing Needs Assessment process and, where a need has been identified, local authorities will be required to formulate a strategy which will set out how those needs will be met.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) what the time scale is for publication of a replacement for Circular 1/94;  [193111]

<p>(2) whether the replacement for Circular 1/94 will put a duty on local authorities to make adequate provision for gypsy sites;  [193112]
</p>



<p>(3) whether the replacement for Circular 1/94 will require all local authorities <i>(a)</i> to have policies relating to Gypsies in their development plans and <i>(b)</i> to ensure that they each make provision for Gypsies.  [193114]</p>




<p><a name="41021w11.html_spnew7"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will consult on a revised circular later this year. We will then meet stakeholders to discuss the responses received. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister aims to bring the new circular into force in April 2005. The circular will require each local planning authority to have policies relating to Gypsies in their development plans and will also reflect changes that are being introduced as part of the Housing Bill. These place a duty on local authorities to assess the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers in their area and to produce a strategy setting out how those needs will be met.

It sets out what more the Government will do to make sure the benefits of full employment are felt in every neighbourhood in England. This will build on the great deal of progress already made in recent years in helping people into work, regenerating deprived areas and supporting businesses.

Although the Social Exclusion Unit has a remit for England only, the concentrations of worklessness that the report explores are also found in Scotland and Wales.

This work included a visit to the &#039;Childcare Works&#039; project in Glasgow, which the report highlights as a good example of how to draw together the welfare to work agenda with the National Childcare Strategy.

 International civil aviation is governed by the Chicago Convention.

States are required to recognise the certificates issued by other contracting states unless they have reason to believe that they have not been issued in accordance with ICAO standards.

Reports of all ramp inspections conducted under the SAFA programme are held on a central database and are available to all ECAC states.

<p>(9) which bodies the Strategic Rail Authority recently consulted about the changes required to public service requirements (PSR) in order to allow the proposed new South West Trains timetable to conform to the terms of the PSR.  [190512]</p>




<p><a name="41021w16.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Secretary of State has no contractual relationship with Train Operating Companies (TOCs). The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) has responsibility for managing franchise agreements with TOCs under Directions and Guidance from the Secretary of State, copies of which are in the Libraries of the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41021w16.html_para0">
TOCs cannot depart from the Passenger Service Requirement (PSR) without SRA approval. The SRA has powers to grant derogations from PSRs. It is not specifically obliged to consult on these but is expected generally to consult to an appropriate level those affected by the exercise of its functions and normally does so.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41021w16.html_para1">
The SRA requires TOCs to demonstrate that they have consulted those affected by proposed timetable changes. South West Trains (SWT) has consulted widely with local authorities and rail user groups about the proposed timetable as well as consulting the SRA about associated proposed departures from the PSR. It has not been necessary for SWT to consult the Department.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41021w16.html_para2">
The Secretary of State has general discussions periodically with the SRA about a range of issues. The Secretary of State has received no representations about the proposed changes to the SWT timetables from 12 December 2004. The SRA has consulted affected local authorities and Rail Passenger Committees which represent passengers about proposed PSR changes. The consultees are listed in the table.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41021w16.html_para3">
The SRA is considering a request from SWT, to grant temporary derogations to allow implementation of the 12 December 2004 timetable. A summary of these requests for derogations was sent to the affected MPs, including the hon. Member, in a letter from the SRA dated 17 September 2004. A copy of the summary has been placed in the Library of the House.

Notes:<br>

1. The Transport Policies and Programme/Local Transport Capital funding to local authorities covers all aspects of transport (e.g. maintenance, road safety and public transport). Historically this funding has been allocated partly in the form of grant (Transport Supplementary Grant or TSG) and partly by means of borrowing approval (Supplementary Credit Approvals or SCA and Annual Capital Guideline or ACG). Since the introduction of the Prudential system of finance in the 2004&#150;05 financial year, borrowing approval is now in the form of Supported Capital Expenditure (SCE).<br>

It is for the local authority to set priorities and allocate funds accordingly for transport<br>

from its Single Capital Pot budget.<br>

2. In addition, the local authority receives Revenue Support Grant (RSG) from the Government each year. This is a block allocation for all council services, which includes support for transport schemes; however, it is not possible to identify specific allocations for transport schemes from within the RSG allocation.<br>

<sup>(14)</sup> Figures up to 1985&#150;86 are from UKAEA&#039;s annual report and may not necessarily be the same as UK Government expenditure on fusion&#151;for example, the rise in 1981&#150;82 is due at least in part to fusion&#039;s share of the writing off of capital assets across UKAEA.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Figures from 1996&#150;97 to 2001&#150;02 are from the Fusion Programme Letter funded by DTI and for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 are the allocations from OST and EPSRC.<br>

2. The dip and peak in 1996&#150;97 and 2000&#150;01 were due to changes in invoicing arrangements. The peak and dip in 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 were due to expenditure being brought forward across the end of the Financial Year at DTI&#039;s request.<br>





3. UK Government funding for Fusion provides (a) the UK contribution to the UK&#039;s domestic fusion programme (in addition Euratom fund the programme at typically 25 per cent. of the gross cost, though the rate has changed over the years) and (b) the UK&#039;s financial contribution to JET. The JET project formally started in 1978 (though there had been a European design team at Culham before this).<br>

4. The UK&#039;s indirect contribution to the European fusion programme, via central European Union funding for the Euratom Framework Programme, is excluded.<br>

 The Equi Save Atlantic Area project received approval for ERDF support under the Interreg IIIB Atlantic Area Community Initiative, at the Atlantic Area Programme Steering Committee held on 14 and 15 October 2004. One of the project partners is from the Republic of Ireland and therefore the Republic of Ireland will benefit financially from this Programme. However, Northern Ireland is not involved in the project at partner level and as a result, project funds will not be made available to Northern Ireland. As a result, I do not intend initiating contact with my Irish counterpart on the subject of this project.

The Scarborough Whitby and Ryedale NHS Primary Care Trust published in November 2003 an independent &#039;Descriptive Study of Cancer Occurrence Around RAF Fylingdales&#039;, which showed no evidence of a link between RAF Fylingdales and the number of local cancer registrations, and they plan to issue further updated reports roughly every three years.

The large increase in the number of states with nuclear weapons, as feared by some in the 1960s has not taken place. However, there have been a small number of instances where the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in its prescribed role under the treaty, has raised concerns about the compliance of Non Nuclear Weapon States with their obligations under the NPT. The UK shares those concerns and also supports the six party talks intended to resolve the worrying case of North Korea&#039;s nuclear programmes.

<p class="tabletext">From 2001, the publication of Jobcentre Plus vacancy statistics was deferred due to distortions in the data. These arose partly from difficulties with a new computer system and partly from the introduction of innovative vacancy-taking procedures, such as the creation of Employer Direct Contact Centres, which made it difficult to interpret changes in the figures. Published data on the number of unfilled Jobcentre Plus vacancies remains suspended and at present is not suitable for use as a labour market indicator. We are currently reviewing the derivation and composition of the data. We are working closely with colleagues in the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to reinstate data that will be suitable for public use.</p>

<p class="tabletext">The figures in the table below show management information on numbers of unfilled vacancies at the now Jobcentre Plus office from August 2001 to August 2004. Figures are not comparable to the National Statistics series shown above and should not be interpreted as reflecting changes to labour market conditions over the period from 1996. These figures may also be higher, as the catchment area for vacancy recording has widened reflecting broader travel to work patterns.</p>

<p><a name="41021w26.html_spnew6"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The Green Paper on pensions made it clear that we would not introduce any change to mandatory indexation unless we had good reason to believe that it would result in increased coverage of occupational pensions. The decision to reduce the Limited Price Indexation cap for defined benefit pensions was made in the context of our proposal to introduce a Pension Protection Fund. In order to ease the financial burden that the PPF would impose on employers, we took steps to balance the costs by reducing the LPI cap from 5 per cent. to 2.5 per cent. The PPF will improve incentives to save by providing essential security for scheme members and will thus increase confidence in, and coverage of, occupational pensions.

<p><a name="41021w27.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) has kept the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants under review since the time of licensing and has issued timely advice when new information has become available. Depressive illness is a debilitating condition, in which there is an increased risk of suicide and suicidal

behaviour. The SSRI antidepressants are effective treatments that have benefited millions. They are increasingly being used for first-line treatment of depressive illness, particularly as they are more easily complied with.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41021w27.html_para3">
It is general clinical experience that symptoms of depression, including suicidal behaviour, may increase in early treatment with any antidepressant and the patient information leaflets reflect this advice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41021w27.html_para4">
The question of a possible link between SSRIs and an increased risk of suicidal behaviour was first identified in the early 1990&#039;s following publication of case series involving fluoxetine by Teicher et al (1990) which stimulated scientific debate and intense media interest. The CSM reviewed the available data and concluded that there was little evidence to support the suggestion that fluoxetine induces suicidal or aggressive behaviour. This issue has been kept under close continuous review by the Medicines and Health Care products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the CSM and all new data has been carefully scrutinised as and when it becomes available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41021w27.html_para5">
The CSM conducted a further comprehensive review of the available study data in 2000 and concluded that these data do not suggest an increased risk of suicidal behaviour associated with in adults but an effect in a small sub-population could not be ruled out. This issue was also considered at a European level in 2000 and all EU member states endorsed the conclusions of the United Kingdom assessment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41021w27.html_para6">
The CSM considered this issue again in December 2001. This review confirmed the previous advice that the evidence was not sufficient to confirm a causal association between SSRIs and suicidal behaviour, although an effect in a small high-risk population could not be ruled out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41021w27.html_para7">
In June 2003, the MHRA and CSM published advice not to use paroxetine in patients under the age of 18 years with major depressive disorder because of clinical trial data which showed a lack of efficacy in this population and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. The advice was published within two weeks of the data being made available to the MHRA. Comprehensive advice on the safety and efficacy in children and adolescents of the remaining medicines included in the review of the expert working group was published in December 2003.

The Department for Education and Skills supports the young carers initiative through a grant to the Children&#039;s Society. The initiative supports over 250 projects or groups working with young carers, which are funded through a range of sources including statutory agencies, the voluntary sector and lottery funds. Each project in turn supports between thirty and fifty young carers. In addition, the young carers initiative supports an annual festival, which attracted approximately 1,350 young people in 2004.

 We are undertaking the most far reaching reforms to national health service dentistry since the service began in 1948. By October 2005, we will have recruited the equivalent of 1,000 additional dentists to the NHS, funded 170 additional training places for dental undergraduates and introduced new contractual arrangements which will delegate to primary care trusts (PCTs) responsibility for contracting with general dental practitioners for their local population&#039;s oral health needs.

 The base contract values under our proposed new contractual arrangements will be based on the dentists&#039; previous national health service earnings, which will directly relate to the amount of NHS work they provided.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41021w28.html_para1">

 Our expansion of the dental workforce is already underway with the recruitment of 1,000 additional dentists to the national health service by October 2005. In addition, by 2011, the first cohort of students to fill the additional 170 training places for dental undergraduates, that we are funding from October 2005, will be entering the workforce.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Oct 2004 : Column 921W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
remuneration for premises, equipment and ancillary staff, would be &#163;130 million at current prices. In 2005&#150;06 we are allocating an extra &#163;250 million to NHS dentistry, an increase of 19.3 per cent., compared to spending in 2003&#150;04.

We estimate that the total cost to the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Department of their academic and clinical training will have risen to some &#163;40 million recurring, supported by total capital investment of &#163;95 million over the period 2005&#150;06 to 2009&#150;10.

<p><a name="41021w28.html_spnew7"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The model on which the review was based was constructed in 2002, before the National Institute for Clinical Excellence had published draft guidance proposing that the recommended interval between oral health reviews should be determined specifically for each patient based on disease levels and risk of dental disease. This contrasts with current practice of recalling patients at six monthly intervals. We took account of the implications of the draft guidance for the workload of dentists in announcing plans to recruit the equivalent of 1,000 additional dentists and will be checking our progress next year.

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority summarisation forms and primary care trust summarisation schedules which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure by the relevant health authorities, and the commissioner costs of the primary care trusts. Figures are given in cash terms.<br>

2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities and primary care trusts.<br>

3. The figures do not represent the total NHS spend as some elements are not accounted for at the health authority or primary care trust level e.g. the majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the individual health authority accounts or primary care trust summarisation schedules and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities or primary care trusts.<br>

4. Figures for 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. This is to ensure consistency between years. Figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 based on strategic health authority areas have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.<br>





5. In many health authorities there are factors which distort the expenditure per head.<br>

These include:<br>

the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and<br>

asset revaluations in NHS Trusts being funded through health authorities or primary care trusts.<br>

For these reasons expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between health authorities or between different years.<br>
