 In May 2007 Malalai Joya was suspended for three years (until the end of the legislative term) by her peers in the Afghan parliament for contravening Article 70 of the Afghan parliament's rules of procedure. Article 70 states that members of parliament who insult others are subject to disciplinary action. Action was taken against Ms Joya after a media interview in which she said that the Afghan parliament was worse than a 'stable or zoo'. Ms Joya has the right to challenge the decision and has indicated her intention to do so. Together with EU partners, we regularly raise the issue of freedom of expression in Afghanistan and look forward to Ms Joya and the Afghan parliament resolving this internal parliamentary issue.</p>

 The Government of Yemen's third Socio-Economic Plan for Poverty Reduction (SEDPPR) 2006 to 2010 aims to reduce poverty rates to 19.5 per cent. by 2010. However it contains no specific targets for 2008. A mid point review of the SEDPPR is due to be completed by September 2008, and will show whether Yemen is on track to meet its 2010 targets.</p>

This assessment demonstrated that poverty rates have declined from 40.1 per cent. in 1998 to 34.8 per cent. in 2005. However recent World Bank figures estimate that these gains may have been fully reversed due to inflation and high food prices.</p>

 The Department for Transport makes a judgment about the appropriate length of each franchise while the specification is being developed. The key factors will usually be milestones in the wider franchising programme, and the impact of any major rail projects. The new South Central franchise is planned as a five-year, 10-month franchise, ending in July 2015, with a further possible two-year extension at the department's discretion. This gives maximum flexibility to the Department to align the end dates of the Thameslink Greater Northern and South Central franchises with the completion of major infrastructure work on the Thameslink Programme, and any major franchise remapping that may result.</p>

<i> [holding answer 5 June 2008]: </i>No. This would not be sensible as we are seeking to reduce emissions across the economy not just within road transport.

A similar approach has been proposed by the European Commission in order to meet the EU's 2020 greenhouse gas reduction targets. The European Commission has proposed a 16 per cent. reduction target over 2005 levels for the UK's non-traded sector.</p>

 The Government's Ten Year Childcare Strategy, Choice for parents, the best start for children, aims to ensure that every child gets the best start in life and that parents have more choice about how to balance work and family life. It will help to reduce child poverty and the achievement gap between the most disadvantaged children and their peers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="80609w0009.htm_para9"><a name="08060913001514">The Strategy will transform services by creating a strong, multi-agency, high quality universal infrastructure for all young children and families, but with additional help and support targeted on disadvantaged families who benefit most from high quality early years and childcare provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="80609w0009.htm_para10"><a name="08060913001515">Just a third of the way into the Strategy, we are ahead of schedule in establishing a new infrastructure. 2,907 multi-agency Sure Start Children's Centres have opened, offering services to over 2.2 million young children and their families. Almost all of those living in disadvantaged communities now have access to one. There are over 10,500 extended schools (two in five of the total) delivering access to the full core offer with many more schools delivering parts of the offer. 95 per cent. of three and four-year-olds are taking up the free part-time early education entitlement and some 13,000 disadvantaged two-year-olds in 32 local authorities have benefited from access to free early education. The assessments of childcare sufficiency that all local authorities have completed under the Childcare Act 2006 have given them a clear idea of the demand for childcare in their areas, its supply and any gaps between the two, to meet their duty of securing sufficient childcare for working parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="80609w0009.htm_para11"><a name="08060913001516">We regularly evaluate the effectiveness of our policies through research and have a number of ongoing evaluations and data collections to monitor progress and inform the development of new policies. The latest National Evaluation of Sure Start research, published on 4 March, highlighted very clearly that Sure Start programmes are having a positive impact in some of the country's most disadvantaged communities, improving young children's development and strengthening the skills of parents so that they can provide a better home learning environment, helping prepare children to do well at school and make the most of their talents.</p>

 Local authorities have a broad power under Section 17 of the Children's Act 1989 to provide services to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in need and to promote the upbringing of children by their families, defined to include any person with whom the child is living. These services may include financial help if that is the most appropriate way to meet the child's needs. Grandparents in these circumstances are also entitled to claim child tax credits and child benefit in the same way as other parents.

 The Department is currently considering advice from the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) External Reference Group on proposed markers of good practice from prevention through to end of life care. This advice will be considered by Ministers and options developed for implementation. These will include options for early diagnosis of people with COPD and raising awareness of the disease. There is good evidence that pulmonary rehabilitation and regular exercise can drive significant improvements in the health status of people with COPD, with subsequent reduction in the number of emergency hospital admissions.</p>

 The development of the MOD Pandemic Flu Guide (renamed the Framework in 2008) has been an ongoing activity since November 2005, and was first issued in May 2006. The requirement is to ensure that the MOD has a robust approach to its contingency planning to deal with the general pandemic risk and to reinforce this with selective measures to protect critical activities or those judged to be especially at risk. As the Guide/Framework is a live document, it has been subject to continuous updates and revisions, with the latest version issued in February 2008. Updated versions of the Framework (together with supporting leaflets) are distributed to top level budget holders (TLBs) and trading funds as and when these become available. A &#147;work in progress&#148; copy of the Framework (and some supporting leaflets) has recently been placed in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="80609w0013.htm_para4"><a name="08060913002026">Development of the MOD Pandemic Flu Guide/Framework has been undertaken by the Flu Sub-Group (composed of expertise drawn from different organisations across the Central TLB and wider Defence community) and the participation of MOD personnel (civilian and military) in activities, work streams and exercises co-ordinated by the Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS). MOD personnel also support the Department of Health (DH) and Health Protection Agency (HPA) Programme Board in creating the national framework for responding to an influenza pandemic. Taken together this involvement ensures MOD influenza pandemic planning accords with cross-Government influenza contingency preparations.</p>

Additionally, the proportion of adults who perceived drunk and rowdy behaviour in public places to be a fairly/very big problem in the year ending December 2007 was the same compared to the year ending 2006.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 19 May 2008]:</i> The Home Office concluded an internal review of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 in 2007. It found that there were instances of unnecessary application of legislation and unnecessarily bureaucratic processes, including where the police service had imposed some bureaucracy on itself. This was mainly caused by uncertainties over what the law required. Since then the Home Office has been working with police and others to raise understanding of what RIPA is for and how it should be used appropriately. Some progress has already been achieved, including improved guidance for practitioners from the new ACPO Covert Investigation Steering Group and from a new statutory code of practice for the acquisition of communications data which came into force on 1 October 2007.

This provides a framework for police forces and their authorities, as well as organisations that deliver national projects and services to the Police Service, to plan information and communications technology services. This includes the development and implementation of systems in accordance with agreed standards, including those for software. The National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), together with its policing partners, is responsible for a number of existing national IT systems and for developing new ones, including the Police National Database being delivered by the IMPACT programme.</p>

 The Government's Guidance, 'Safeguarding Children in Prostitution', which was published in 2000, acts as a circular to the police and sets out how forces should respond to the issue of child prostitution locally. The police are responsible for leading the investigation and detection of these crimes, as well as working in partnership with other local agencies to ensure the early identification of those at risk and the provision of adequate support and protection. The guidance does not specify that each police force should have a unit dedicated to tackling child sexual exploitation, although all police force areas in England and Wales now have dedicated specialist child abuse investigation teams staffed by specialist sexual offences officers and rape prosecutors.</p>

 The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 puts under statutory control public body use of covert investigatory powers, including interception, access to communications data, surveillance and the use of undercover officers and informants. It covers the spectrum of interference with privacy, from the most serious&#151;such as an intelligence agency planting microphones inside the house of a suspected terrorist&#151;to local councils' use of telephone company subscriber data to identify and prosecute those involved in unhygienic meat supply or benefit fraud. It ensures that in the case of both ends of the spectrum, authorisation is consistent with the human rights principles of necessity and proportionality. As part of the statutory safeguards built into RIPA, the authorisation of covert investigatory powers is subject to the oversight of independent Commissioners who carry out their remit by regular inspection visits, reporting to the Prime Minister and publishing annual reports on their findings.

 Electronic monitoring (EM) has been operating throughout England and Wales since 1999, following earlier pilot schemes. It is available at all stages of the criminal justice system.

 HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has too much office space and is engaged in a review programme to decide which offices should be retained as best suiting its future business needs. The review is being carried out on a regional basis but in the light of HMRC's operational needs across the UK, as its work is organised on national business lines rather than regionally.</p>

However, it would be misleading to look at these in isolation as they are just a small part of the overall picture. HMRC is restructuring its entire business operations in order to achieve the value for money savings and customer service improvements required by the end of the comprehensive spending review (CSR) period in March 2011. MRC is monitored on its performance against its departmental strategic objectives and this includes a cost/benefit analysis of its departmental transformation programme.
