We encourage partner governments to ensure that as wide a range as possible of stakeholders participate in the consultations on national poverty reduction strategies, including groups representing disabled people. Issues of social exclusion and targeted interventions for excluded groups will be addressed in the discussions our Country Offices will have with governments on developing 10-year plans for education.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60503w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 DFID has engaged extensively with the pharmaceutical industry as part of our work to increase access to medicines in developing countries. In January 2005, we published a set of recommendations for the industry, that specifically looked at pricing policies, investment in research and development for diseases affecting developing countries, and ways of working in developing countries. These recommendations built on existing good practice in the industry. Many companies have made significant progress in making their medicines more available and affordable in developing countries.

<a name="60503w01.html_para6">
To date, our discussions have focused on major communicable diseases such as HIV, malaria and TB, and on neglected tropical diseases, such as sleeping sickness. However, discussions with the industry have also emphasised the degree to which treatments for non-communicable diseases such as cancers really should also be the subject of differential pricing offers given the significant public health needs in developing countries. There are in fact higher rates of cervical cancer deaths in Ghana than in the UK.

 The Department has had discussions with both the horticultural and farming industries on this subject.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60503w02.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_11">The horticulture sector is making efforts on a number of fronts to reduce carbon emissions. Under the new Climate Change Agreement, growers will be entitled to an 80 per cent. discount on the levy provided they meet prescribed energy saving targets. Under the new Energy Scheme, it is possible for businesses to claim capital allowances on items such as thermal screens and insulation, variable speed pumps, certain heating equipment (including combined heat and power plant) and lighting. In addition, both Defra and the Horticultural Development Council carry out research 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>3 May 2006 : Column 1561W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
into energy efficiency issues and the Carbon Trust (funded by Defra) provides advice and organises free energy services to assist in the identification of energy saving steps that can be implemented in nurseries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60503w02.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_12">The Government are very much aware of the link between farming and the environment. The Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food (SFFS) was launched in England in 2002 and sets out the basis for a new relationship in which Government works in partnership with the farming industry in England to make farmers more market, and less subsidy focused, while managing their businesses in more environmentally and socially responsible ways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60503w02.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_13">Achievements under SFFS include: CAP reform which, by breaking the link between subsidy and production, means there is no incentive to overproduce; the cross compliance element of the Single Payment Scheme where subsidies are linked to the delivery of environmental and animal welfare standards; the launch of Environmental Stewardship to which all farmers are eligible to apply to earn payments for undertaking environmental management of their land; and the launch of the Rural Developments Service Farm Advice Unit which oversees delivery of technical and environmental advice to farmers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60503w02.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_14">In addition, the Department is working closely with the agricultural industry to reduce it&#039;s contribution to climate change. The Department has set up the Agricultural Change and Environment Observatory to monitor, and where possible anticipate, changes in agriculture and at farm level, and to asses consequent implications for the environment. A Stakeholder Advisory Group has been set up with the aim of advising priorities for the work of the programme, providing feedback on emerging results and their implications, identifying new and emerging areas on which the Observatory could usefully focus their work and to provide a channel of communication with a wider stakeholder community. Further information can be found on Defra&#039;s website at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/observatory/background.htm
</p>


<p>
<a name="60503w02.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_15">A vital element of Defra&#039;s policy on agriculture and climate change is to raise awareness within the industry of the issues and possible actions to be taken.

 The agriculture and forestry sector contributes 7 per cent. of UK greenhouse gas emissions.

 The Department is in regular contact with the Department of Trade and Industry to discuss a whole range of issues related to bio-energy, including the impacts on biodiversity. Most transport biofuel feedstocks will be grown in rotation as part of a mix of several crops on the farm. Production from a mix of feedstocks and replacing crops for food would have a neutral effect on biodiversity. Any replacement of spring sown break crops with winter oilseed rape would have a negative effect on crop diversity and farmland birds. If arable crops replaced natural-regeneration set-aside, this would reduce habitat diversity. In the longer term, as technology improves, straw and wood could be used for bioethanol production without significantly affecting biodiversity.

<i>[holding answer 26 April 2006]:</i> The national Market Towns Initiative (MTI) was launched in FY 2000&#150;01 and provided &#163;32 million to Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), and &#163;5 million to the Countryside Agency (CA) to support community-led market town regeneration in the regions. The initiative was therefore not established as a national funding programme, but as a means of enabling regional partnerships to target towns in their region according to regionally agreed selection criteria. The aim was to provide support to 100 towns but, by the time the national initiative ended in FY 2003&#150;04, over 230 towns had benefited.

Currently only one RCC, the West Midlands RCC, is working at full capacity and it has an established system for monitoring consistency and timeliness of sign setting to support the Agency&#039;s goal of demonstrably improving the accuracy of VMS. The system involves checking timeliness of response both when incidents are identified and when cleared. Results are used to identify and implement improvements.

<p><a name="st_95"><a name="60503w11.html_spnew1"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 The total overall spend on all adult programmes for 2004&#150;05 was reported in the Learning and Skills Council&#039;s (LSC) Annual Report and Accounts as &#163;2,999 million. Our planned funding for the LSC&#039;s major programmes only for adults for 2005&#150;06 is &#163;2,942 million and for 2006&#150;07 is &#163;2,946 million. Estimated spend on smaller programmes and experience of the previous two years suggests final funding for adults will be in the order of &#163;3.2 billion each year. On 1 October 2005 the Government set out their priorities for post-16 education and training. This established our priorities for the learning and skills sector and the impact on funding in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08. While overall spend on adult learning will remain broadly constant the pattern of that learning will change. To meet our national priorities, we need to shift the pattern so that we provide a greater number of longer and more expensive courses for adults, to equip them with the range of skills they need for employability and further progression to higher levels of training. We have consistently said that public funding alone cannot and should not pay for all the training necessary in a competitive economy. To support this shift, there has to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>3 May 2006 : Column 1593W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
be a new balance of responsibilities between Government, employers and learners so we do not accept that withdrawal of LSC funding means that courses automatically have to close. Where provision is valued by learners, where it is high quality, and where learners and employers are prepared to pay more, we expect colleges to consider providing courses on a full-cost recovery basis.

It explained that the role of the board was to work in partnership with the chief executive, David Higgins, and his staff, helping to set the overall direction, policy and plans of the authority, in accordance with the Olympic plans and its statutory duties, and to provide advice and support to the executive team in accordance with best governance practice and guidance. All board members were required to demonstrate commitment to public service values and the principles of public life (particularly integrity and probity), be respected by or have credibility with their peers, have significant experience of leadership, management and governance at board levels within the public, not for profit or private sector, and possess an understanding of the public policy context and the role of Government.

 There are no plans to amend the provisions for people who live with close relatives. Where a person lives with their landlord who is a close relative, such as a brother and sister, they are treated as not liable to make rental payments because there is usually no intention to create a legally enforceable liability in such circumstances.

These assumptions are subject to change as plans develop to ensure that we maintain and improve customer services and achieve our PSA and efficiency targets.

<p><a name="st_136"><a name="60503w16.html_spnew2"><b> Alun Michael </b> 
<i>[holding answer 2 May 2006]:</i> The new procurement directives, simplify, clarify and modernise public procurement procedures. These were implemented in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2006. There are new provisions on framework agreements, competitive dialogue for complex procurements, central purchasing bodies and electronic procurement methods such as e-auctions and dynamic purchasing systems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60503w16.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_139">The directives allow contracts to be reserved for supported factories and businesses, and provide greater clarity on the extent to which social and environmental issues can be incorporated into procurements. There is also a requirement for the mandatory exclusion of companies that have been convicted of offences related to fraud and corruption. The rules applying to purchases by utilities now incorporate an exclusion mechanism where a sector is subject to normal competition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60503w16.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_140">Concerning the effects on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the new directives, and the regulations that implement them, apply rules directly to purchasers rather than to suppliers. There are, therefore, no compliance costs to business from these new rules. The new procurement methods that the rules provide for, including electronic systems, together with the simpler and clearer rules generally, reduce the burdens of the procurement process and should encourage suppliers, including SMEs, to participate in public procurement opportunities either directly or as sub contractor.

A revised violence reduction strategy is planned for 2007 to reflect expected learning from the forthcoming report of the inquiry into the death of Zahid Mubarek and from a recent research study, which was undertaken to identify good practice in implementing the violence reduction strategy in the first year. There has also been an operational review of violence reduction, many of the recommendations from which have already been adopted in prisons.

The results of the pilot are currently being evaluated. The sentence plan which outlines the interventions is owned by the community based offender manager and delivered by the custody based offender supervisor.

<a name="stpa_187">UK law honours the spirit of the Convention in relation to the standards of care and treatment available to children in the UK, including asylum-seeking children. We believe it is necessary to retain this reservation because it preserves the integrity of our immigration laws. The UK has entered other, similar reservations in respect of other human rights instruments. We are satisfied that asylum-seeking children in the UK receive adequate care, protection and support.

<p>
<a name="60503w20.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_188">Regarding children mixing with adults: we have made great progress in achieving separation of under and over-18s in custody, for example by placing girls under 17 in non-prison service accommodation and by providing new, special units for 17 year old girls. We will therefore be considering whether there is a continuing need for the Reservation against Article 37<i>(c)</i> of the Convention; and this review is due to begin shortly.

<sup>(15)</sup> Please note that the above information relates to employees on adult rates who have been in the same job for more than a year.<br>

<sup>(16)</sup> Implementation of Office for National Statistics (ONS) recommendations to improve the quality of the survey have resulted in a discontinuity with earlier data from 2004 (see the ONS Review of Distribution of Earnings Statistics report at http://www.statistics.gov.uk).<br>

<sup>(17)</sup> ASHE statistics prior to 1997 are currently not available (n/a).<br>

Notes:<br>

Housing<br>

1. Estimates of the average sale price of existing terrace properties (2002&#150;05) are being produced, but are not currently available.<br>

2. The figures shown on average sale price of new terrace properties are taken from NI Housing Statistics, but this taken in isolation does not represent the housing market for terrace properties. In particular, new terrace houses are more expensive than new semi-detached houses, whereas the same is not believed to be true for existing properties.<br>

3. In the granting of mortgages, lenders take account of the entire income of the purchaser(s), including the income of partners, which may be earned in the non-industrial sector.<br>

Earnings<br>

1. The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) is a UK wide survey that provides a wide range of information on hourly, weekly and annual earnings by gender, work patterns, industry and occupation inter alia. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) 



carry out ASHE in Great Britain and it is carried out by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) in Northern Ireland.<br>

2. ASHE is a sample survey and uses the Inland Revenue&#039;s PA YE system as the main sampling frame. To improve coverage and hence make the survey more representative, supplementary information was collected since 2004 on businesses not registered for VAT and for people who changed or started new jobs between the sample selection and the survey reference period. The improvements have caused a discontinuity with earlier available data (1997&#150;2003) when no supplementary data was collected. The data on earnings is obtained not from the employees, but from their employers under the authority of the Statistics of Trade and Employment (Northern Ireland) Order 1988. Information collected is treated as strictly confidential and is used only for statistical purposes.<br>

3. A recent National Statistics review of earnings statistics recommended that median values (the figure below which 50 per cent. of values fall) are used in preference to mean values (the sum divided by the number of values) when reporting earnings. The mean and the median measure different things and can both be appropriate measures depending on what the user is trying to measure. The mean measures the average amount earned by individuals but in a skew distribution such as earnings this measure is susceptible to small numbers of very high earners, whereas the median measures the amount earned by the individual in the middle of a ranked distribution. However, in this instance the mean values have been used to ensure equivalence with the average used to report on house prices in the response.<br>

 I understand from the Oxfordshire coroner that as of 20 April 2006 no inquests remain unopened in relation to soldiers who died in Iraq. Otherwise the number of unopened inquests relating to all other kinds of deaths will be rarely in excess of 3 cases at one time. The earliest deaths in Iraq for which inquests have been opened but not concluded took place on 29 March 2003 when a helicopter crashed killing eight servicemen. Otherwise the coroner believes the earliest death to be that of a prisoner at HMP Bullingdon in 2000.

Complaints that concern title deeds might include, for example, complaints that title deeds have been lost while in the custody of Land Registry, or that the provisions of a particular title deed have been reflected incorrectly in the register of title. However, complaints concerning title deeds are not recorded as a distinct category. The following figures reflect the total number of complaints received and&#151;so far as they have been recorded as such&#151;the number of complaints considered to be unjustified or misdirected. These figures therefore reflect complaints of all categories, including those that do not concern title deeds such as, for example, complaints about the way in which a particular application has been handled, aspects of the legislation governing land registration or specific Land Registry policies and procedures.

 An independent evaluation of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister-funded choice-based lettings (CBL) pilot scheme was carried out and a report published in May 2004. The evaluation report showed that the pilots were successful in offering increased choice to social housing applicants and that applicants largely welcomed the move to CBL, feeling that it gave them greater choice and control and increased the transparency of the lettings process. Local authorities were also very positive about their experience of CBL. In order to build on the evaluation and assess the longer term impacts of CBL, ODPM has commissioned Heriot Watt University to undertake further research which is currently underway and scheduled to complete by summer 2006.

The average gross weekly expenditure on residential and nursing care for older people for each local authority in England for the financial years 1999&#150;2000 to 2004&#150;05, the latest for which data is available, has been placed in the Library. These figures are provided by local authorities. The figures for 1999&#150;2000 are not directly comparable to those for subsequent years because they are based on gross expenditure whereas later years are based on gross total cost. The difference is that gross total cost includes capital charges and certain types of income received such as income from joint arrangements with other local authorities.

Notes:<br>

1.Data in the table is taken from local monitoring of delayed discharges included in the situation reports (SITREPs) collection. The delayed transfers of care figures are based on a snapshot taken on the last typical Thursday in the month. This differs to the day used in the separate, quarterly, LDPR commissioner collections on which the figures published in the Statistical Supplement to the Chief Executive&#039;s Report to the NHS, December 2005 are based. The number of days delayed sums all delays in the month.<br>

2.Due to the way the data is collected, the number of days delayed data for June 2005, September 2005, December 2005 and March 2006 are based on five weeks&#039; data&#151;all other months are based on four weeks&#039; data.<br>

The regulatory authorities within Europe, including the UK, did not identify any new safety issues in this review. No additional enquiry is necessary. Regulatory action to withdraw this medicine in the UK, equivalent to that proposed in H.R. 1079 (Holly&#039;s Law) in the United States, is not appropriate since European Union advice, including UK expert advice, is that the balance of risks and benefits of mifepristone remains positive.

<i>[holding answer 2 May 2006]:</i> The primary outcome measure for assertive outreach teams is not a reduction in hospital admissions. The principal purpose of assertive outreach teams is to provide intensive support for people with severe mental illness, and who might not otherwise engage with mainstream mental health services, in their own homes or in other community settings. In December 2005, 17,000 people were receiving care from 262 assertive outreach teams, representing a 14 per cent. increase in caseload compared to 2004.

In the first three quarters of the financial year 2005&#150;06, crisis resolution teams provided 61,000 home treatment episodes for patients who would otherwise have been admitted.

 The complex nature of dementia once it is diagnosed requires a whole systems approach across a range of health and social care providers. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is currently working on dementia guidelines. The first consultation on this guideline is expected in May 2006. This is in addition to the ongoing work of the older people&#039;s mental health programme which includes guidance on the provision of services.

<i>[holding answer 2 May 2006]:</i> The quality and outcomes framework (QAF) of the general practitioner contract includes points for setting up and maintaining a register of people who have had a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke, a key indicator that there is a high risk of a full, or more serious, stroke. The QAF also includes a range of points for managing that risk including for recording and managing of hypertension and cholesterol in patients who have had a stroke or TIA. In addition, the QAF includes points for managing other key risk factors such as treatment and care for atrial fibrillation, management of diabetes, recording smoking status and giving advice on smoking cessation, and setting up and maintaining an obesity register.

<i>Finished admission episodes</i>
A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one Healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_345"><i>Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)</i></p>
</ul>
<p>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_346"><i>Main operation</i></p>
</ul>
<p>

The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, for example time waited, but the figures for all operations count of episodes give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality.<br>

The true value is likely to lie within &#177; twice the CV e.g. for an average of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent., we would expect the population average to be within the range 180 to 220.<br>

The median replaces the mean as the headline statistic. The weighted mean is the sum of the weighted values divided by the sum of the weights. The median is the value below which 50 per cent. of employees fall. It is preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less.<br>

The first phase of change was to implement a virtual service centre in three locations. These locations were selected as existing technology platforms could be utilised. The costs to date are related to the set up of a contact centre in two of the locations (the third already operated in this way) and are in the region of &#163;100,000. The project, when completed in 2008, will lead to savings of 702 staff and an HR to total departmental staff ratio in line with Gershon proposals.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assurances he received during discussions on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#039;s funding for Shell&#039;s proposed Sakhalin II development that none of the remaining western gray whales will die as a result of the project.

<p><a name="st_447"><a name="60503w46.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, together with the other potential lenders to the Sakhalin II project, have undertaken an extensive and detailed assessment of the risks to the western gray whales. This assessment has drawn on the views of an independent panel of world-renowned whale experts, convened by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). This panel produced a series of recommendations on whale protection measures relating to noise, construction schedules, vessel movements, monitoring and other relevant issues, and it is hoped that these measures, together with Sakhalin Energy&#039;s own whale protection plans, will minimise the level of disruption to the whale&#039;s habitat. To date there is no evidence of Sakhalin Energy&#039;s activities resulting in any whale deaths, and recent research has indicated that the whale population is showing signs of recovery.

<p>
<a name="60503w46.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_323">Further comfort is drawn from the establishment of an independent western gray whale Advisory Panel that will oversee and advise on ongoing whale conservation activities and research. Sakhalin Energy has agreed to implement all reasonable recommendations that this panel produces.

<p>
<a name="60503w46.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_324">Whale protection measures and commitments would be contractual obligations under any loan agreements between Sakhalin Energy and the potential lenders, and these commitments would be monitored and publicly reported on.
