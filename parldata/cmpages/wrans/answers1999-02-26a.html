To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the British Horseracing Levy Board's financial plan.  [73513]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 It is the British Horseracing Board (BHB) which has produced a financial plan for British racing. We are having constructive discussions with the Chairman of the BHB on the issues it raises.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Soames: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he last met members of the British Horseracing Levy Board; and what was discussed.  [73514]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary met the Horserace Betting Levy Board in October 1997. I met the Board on 24 March 1998 and have subsequently had several meetings with the Chairman--most recently on 23 February. We discussed a range of betting and racing issues which impinge on the Board's work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Dr. Jack Cunningham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 February 1999]:</i> On the one occasion that policy on GM Foods was discussed in the Ministerial Group on Biotechnology and Genetic Modification, the Minister for Science left the meeting.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on her Department's policy of linking aid to good governance and human rights in <i>(a)</i> Zimbabwe, <i>(b)</i> Burma, <i>(c)</i> Vietnam and <i>(d)</i> Cuba.  [73731]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Government's White Paper on International Development makes it clear that raising standards of governance is central to the elimination of poverty. All our development assistance programmes take good governance and human rights issues into account. We do not have bilateral aid programmes in Burma or Cuba. We have published a detailed Country Strategy paper for our programme in Vietnam and will shortly be publishing one for Zimbabwe which set out our approaches in those countries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 In Sudan, we regard "leakage" as being synonymous with "diversion" which refers to food aid that is deflected from reaching its intended beneficiaries.

 I made a brief visit to Zimbabwe in January 1998 and have no immediate plans to visit again. I will make arrangements to visit when and if it would contribute to the reduction of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development in Zimbabwe.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w01.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Prior: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the shortages of general practitioners and the action the Government are taking to encourage more doctors to <i>(a)</i> remain and <i>(b)</i> become general practitioners.  [70082]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w01.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 February 1999]:</i> We believe that there is no overall shortage of general practitioners at present; and the supply of new GPs is adequate in the short term. However, there are difficulties 



<P>
<P><I>26 Feb 1999 : Column: 457</I><P>
in certain localities at present and, potentially, more widespread problems in the future without effective action.
<P>

<a name="90226w01.htm_para1">Recent policy initiatives to improve GP recruitment and retention include the salaried doctors scheme and Personal Medical Services Primary Care Act pilots, both of which provide opportunities for doctors to work in general practice in more flexible ways, without committing themselves to long-term financial investment, and to provide services in the areas where there is most need. They also include improvements to the GP retainer scheme, allowing GPs to work in general practice on a limited sessional basis, keeping in touch with practical and educational developments. On a longer time scale, the continuing support of out of hours developments is having a real impact on GPs' conditions and their morale.
<P>

<a name="90226w01.htm_para2">In addition, we announced on 22 July 1998 that undergraduate medical school intake to United Kingdom universities would be increased by about 1,000 places, a 20 per cent. increase. Intake is now planned to rise from the 1997 level of 5,050, to about 6,000 places by 2005.

<a name="90226w01.htm_sbhd8"><H4><center>Mumps Vaccine</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w01.htm_wqn9"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) if he will list the manufacturers from which the NHS purchased the single mumps vaccine for use in the UK, and the dates when it did so; and what is the cost of a dose sufficient to immunise a child;  [71314]
<P>
<UL>(2) between which dates the single mumps vaccine <i>(a)</i> has been available in the UK and licensed for use by the Medicines Control Agency and <i>(b)</i> has been available on the NHS;  [71311]
<P>
(3) what percentage of immunisations against mumps in the UK on the NHS are by way of <i>(a)</i> the single mumps vaccine and <i>(b)</i> the MMR vaccine.  [71310]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w01.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The vaccines recommended in the childhood immunisation programme in England are centrally purchased and supplied to doctors free of charge. Single antigen mumps vaccine has never been recommended as part of the childhood programme and has, therefore, never been centrally purchased and supplied to doctors. Medicines Control Agency (MCA) records show that a single mumps vaccine. Mumpsvax (supplied by Pasteur Merieux MSD), has been licensed in the United Kingdom since October 1972, when the licensing of medicines, and records, began and would have been available on prescription. The British National Formulary (September 1998) gives the price of a single-dose vial of Mumpsvax as &#163;4.00. The administration of the vaccine would be a matter between the individual doctor and patient.
<P>

<a name="90226w01.htm_para3">During the period 1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998 553,000 children in England received a first dose of mumps, measles and rubella vaccine. Overall, around 1 million children would have received MMR vaccine over the year, taking those who received a second dose into account. Equivalent data on mumps vaccine coverage are not collected, since it is not a recommended vaccine, but, in the same period, a total of 440 prescriptions for mumps vaccine were dispensed. It is not possible to say how many children received the mumps vaccine.




<P>
<P><I>26 Feb 1999 : Column: 458</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90226w01.htm_para4">Mumpsvax was available in the UK until recent changes were made to the manufacturing process. Last year the Department was alerted that, owing to production changes, the US mumps vaccine no longer matched the UK licence and that Pasteur Merieux has no plans to relicense the product. The vaccine has been unavailable on the UK market since August 1998. A small amount of stock may be held by local wholesalers but the Department does not hold this information.

<a name="90226w01.htm_sbhd9"><H4><center>Sodium Consumption</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w01.htm_wqn10"><B> Mr. Martin Bell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what studies his Department has assessed which indicate health outcome benefits from a reduction in the dietary sodium intake of the general population;  [72325]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will request the COMA Panel to review the recommendations on sodium consumption set out in its 1994 report on Nutritional Aspects of Cardiovascular Disease.  [72320]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w01.htm_spnew10"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Government's source of independent expert advice on food and nutrition policy is the Committee of Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA). It considered the dietary requirements for sodium amongst the general population in its 1991 report on Dietary Reference Values, and the relationship between sodium and blood pressure in its 1994 report on the Nutritional Aspects of Cardiovascular Disease. Both of these reports are available in the Library and contain full references of the studies considered. We have no plans to ask COMA to review its recommendations.
<P>

<a name="90226w01.htm_para5">However, at the Department's request, the Faculty of Public Health Medicine (a faculty of the Royal College of Physicians) and the British Heart Foundation convened a seminar to review the evidence on the relationship between dietary sodium and blood pressure. This confirmed that there is a large body of authoritative opinion which favours a general reduction in salt consumption, and we have, therefore, asked officials to explore with the food industry the scope for reducing the levels of salt in processed foods.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The information requested is not collected centrally. However, there were 34,000 estimated finished consultant episodes and estimates occupied bed days of 1,600,000 with the primary diagnosis of schizophrenia psychoses in 1997-98, the latest date for which figures are available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Jowell: </B>

<P>
<a name="90226w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The &#163;140 million covers the years 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02. A special grant report, giving details of the allocation of the &#163;20 million for the first year, will be laid before Parliament shortly. As the results of the allocation formula change from year to year because of new data, any figures for 2000-01 and 2001-02 could only be indicative at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no plans to provide specific funding for centres for blind or deaf people. It is for local authorities to determine how their funds under the standard spending assessment should be spent. Gloucestershire County Council's personal social services resources will increase by 6.5 per cent. next year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment he has made of the overpayments of disability living allowance and other benefits, which have come to light as a result of benefit reviews; and if he will make a statement.  [74164]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w02.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The need to ensure that the amount of benefit paid to claimants is correct at the outset, and remains correct, is an important element in our programme of welfare reform. This requires systems of review which are fair, sensitive and appropriate to the individual circumstances of the claimant.
<P>

<a name="90226w02.htm_para2">These requirements are particularly important where the claimant is a severely disabled person. Accordingly, on 28 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>321</i>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security announced that the existing, unsatisfactory system of review of entitlement to Disability Living Allowance--the Benefit Integrity Project (BIP)--would end on 31 March, to be replaced in April by a new, fairer system of periodic review.




<P>
<P><I>26 Feb 1999 : Column: 461</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90226w02.htm_para3">There is however an outstanding issue which has arisen from the operation of BIP. This is where because of the claimant's condition, or a change in that condition, entitlement to DLA reduces or ceases altogether. This might be because of an improvement in their physical or mental condition or because the disability proves not to be as severe as was originally thought. Guidance from the Chief Adjudication Officer on this question has indicated that any such changes to entitlement would, to comply with the law, need to be backdated to the point where the change in the condition had actually occurred, or where an erroneous statement had been made on the basis of which the entitlement was awarded. This means that, in any such case, an overpayment is created, which in the normal course of events we would need to take steps to recover.
<P>

<a name="90226w02.htm_para4">In the context of DLA, this situation has the potential to cause severe hardship and exceptional difficulty for many severely disabled claimants. For example, a successful operation, the purchase of special aids or equipment, or gradual rehabilitation from a crippling injury can all constitute a change which potentially affects entitlement. Often, the claimants will be quite unaware that this is the case; or even that his or her needs have actually changed. Moreover, because no system of reviewing DLA entitlement existed until 1997, such a change may have gone unnoticed for months or years, resulting in the need to recover sums of money which can amount to many thousands of pounds, often from very vulnerable people who had no idea that this was likely to happen to them.
<P>

<a name="90226w02.htm_para5">We regard this situation as unacceptable, and are not prepared to seek recovery in such cases. We have therefore decided to act swiftly, and in the interests of fairness, in two ways.
<P>

<a name="90226w02.htm_para6">First, we intend to deal with existing cases, and those which will continue to arise until the arrangements for determining DLA overpayments can be changed in line with our new system of periodic review. We have issued a Direction to the Accounting Officer to ensure that no recovery action is taken in such cases. Thereafter, we intend to seek Parliamentary approval for this approach by taking powers through the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, currently before this House.
<P>

<a name="90226w02.htm_para7">Second, we want to make sure that this situation cannot recur in the future, and that in the longer-term, our approach to overpayments of DLA, and also Attendance Allowance (AA) for severely disabled elderly people, is in line with our proposals for a new, fairer review system for these benefits. We therefore intend to lay regulations as soon as possible. These will provide for a fairer system of review and recovery more closely based on the claimant's understanding of his or her condition, and more regularly and sensitively reviewed, to minimise the scope for large overpayments to accrue, but also to ensure that public money is protected and that fraud and abuse does not pay.
<P>

<a name="90226w02.htm_para8">These measures will apply not only to DLA and AA, but also to overpayments of other benefits which have arisen as a consequence of a review of DLA or AA.




<P>
<P><I>26 Feb 1999 : Column: 462</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90226w02.htm_para9">It is, however, important to be clear that they will apply only to those cases where a review is made in respect of factors directly related to the disability of the claimant. In particular, they will not apply to overpayments created by any fraudulent claims for DLA and AA; or to the much larger number of cases where an overpayment results from changes in the claimant's situation where it was clear that entitlement might be affected and notification required--for example, change of address, going abroad or into hospital.
<P>

<a name="90226w02.htm_para10">Although this situation has arisen in the context of DLA, there are potentially similar issues for other benefits such as Incapacity Benefit and Severe Disablement Allowance. We therefore intend to extend the new arrangements to clarify that people do have a duty to report changes which they know could affect their entitlement to these benefits. At the same time we will ensure that when entitlement is reviewed, this is done in a fair and sensitive way.

 The DTI is acting to ensure that its policies meet the needs of disabled people and that we comply with our legal obligations. The Department already takes positive steps to make it easier for disabled people to make use of its services.

<a name="90226w04.htm_para0">The Department has recently circulated guidance on mainstreaming to those with responsibility for policy development. This ensures that all new and existing policies and programmes are assessed for any adverse impact not only on disabled people, but on any minority or disadvantaged group and, where necessary, action is taken to remove or reduce any such impact.

 Ocean Wave was the deployment of a Royal Navy Task Group to the Gulf, Far East and Asia Pacific regions between 13 January and 28 August 1997.
<P>

<a name="90226w05.htm_para0">Clear military and strategic objectives were set for the Task Group prior to the deployment. Ocean Wave demonstrated the UK's continued commitment to the Asia-Pacific region after the hand-over of Hong Kong. It underlined our interest in the promotion of regional peace and stability, the protection of freedom of international trade, and promoted bilateral relations by the joint working between military forces in the Asia-Pacific region. There was also considerable benefit to the UK defence industry.
<P>

<a name="90226w05.htm_para1">In addition, the Royal Navy were able to test their readiness and to assess how well equipment, procedures and personnel stand up in a realistic scenario with integrated forces.

<P>

<a name="90226w05.htm_para2">The additional costs directly attributable to Ocean Wave were about &#163;9.8 million. The main elements of this additional sum were port and harbour dues, Suez Canal transit fees, operational support, additional fuel costs, local overseas allowances, ships taken up from trade and travel subsistence.
<P>

<a name="90226w05.htm_para3">Planning for Ocean Wave commenced 2&#189; years prior to the deployment taking place, so that we were able to ensure that all routine or contingent tasks were also undertaken.

 The New Millennium Experience Company's (NMEC) ticketing strategy and pricing structure aims to ensure that as many people as possible who wish to visit the Dome will be able to do so. The structure will include a range of group, family, student and other discounts. In addition, the company is working closely with the travel trade to ensure that attractive packages combining travel and Dome entry are available. In drawing up its pricing structure and discount categories the Company has been informed by the experience and systems of other major visitor attractions both in the public and private sectors. Concessionary tickets for families on means-tested benefits is not standard practice and would be particularly difficult to introduce in a way 



<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list by <i>(a)</i> title, <i>(b)</i> name of author and <i>(c)</i> date of receipt the advice that he has received about the (1) environmental and (2) health consequences of the (i) growth and (ii) sale of genetically modified crops in the United Kingdom; and if he will publish that advice.  [73511]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w07.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Secretary of State is advised on the environmental and health consequences of genetically modified crops by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE). The Committee publishes an annual report which is available in the Library. DETR and the Committee have also produced a series of guidance notes and DETR has produced a number of research reports to inform ACRE's advice. These are all published and are listed in the annual reports.
<P>

<a name="90226w07.htm_para2">The Deliberate Release legislation requires the Secretary of State to seek advice from ACRE on all consent applications. ACRE advise as to whether or not a consent should be granted and the conditions which should be attached to a consent. As the legislation requires certain information to be made available to the public, DETR maintains a public register of all consent applications and the advice on them from ACRE.

<a name="90226w07.htm_para3">English Nature has also published advice calling for the regulatory process to include an assessment of the risks to wildlife in its "Position Statement on Genetically Modified Organisms", which is also available in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions where the new Greater London Authority will be located; and if he will make a statement.  [73922]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w07.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I have decided to proceed with the scheme for a new building on the London Bridge City site proposed by CIT Markborough Ltd., incorporating an outstanding design by Foster and Partners. The building, on a major brown field site on the south bank of the River Thames, by Tower Bridge, will be very energy efficient, include the provision of significant civic space in and around the building and improve public access to the river.
<P>

<a name="90226w07.htm_para4">We shall be working with the developer and his architect over the coming weeks to develop the building design taking account of comments that have been expressed about it, and to agree the detailed terms on which the building will be available. Subject to a satisfactory resolution of these discussions and the developer securing planning permission quickly, I anticipate that the building will be ready for occupation in 2001.
<P>

<a name="90226w07.htm_para5">This concludes a major and very competitive search for a suitable location for the headquarters of the Greater London Authority (GLA). From a long list of 55 initial sites, we invited the developers of seven sites to submit outline proposals which, after a careful assessment, was reduced to a short-list of two. The developers were then invited to submit detailed designs by two of the country's leading architects, for London Bridge City and Victoria House in Bloomsbury Square to show how they would meet the GLA's needs.




<P>
<P><I>26 Feb 1999 : Column: 482</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90226w07.htm_para6">Both schemes have since been carefully assessed against the following criteria: location, interior and external design concepts, accessibility, operational suitability, the impact on the environment and value for money. I have also taken into account the views of my design advisory group and the views of Londoners who were invited to give an opinion on both schemes when visiting exhibitions about them late last year.
<P>

<a name="90226w07.htm_para7">The new building will not be ready before the Greater London Authority assumes its responsibilities on 3 July 2000. We are currently considering the options for accommodating the new Authority in the interim period and I will make a further announcement in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions he has had with bus companies about introducing wheelchair-accessible low-level buses; what plans he has to speed up the introduction of such buses; and if he will make a statement.  [73141]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w07.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We are introducing regulations under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 for all new buses to be wheelchair accessible. An informal consultation on regulations to require improved access to buses and coaches took place in 1998. Copies of the consultation document were circulated widely, including to all bus and coach operators. Meetings were also held with representatives of both manufacturing and operating industry, and a formal consultation on the draft regulations is planned for this year.
<P>

<a name="90226w07.htm_para8">The regulations will progressively require a lower first step height, provision for wheelchair users and other passengers with a wide range of disabilities, starting in January 2000. End dates are also being proposed for all regulated buses and coaches to ensure that over a reasonable timescale they all become fully accessible.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w07.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions he has had with local councils about the design of kerbs with regard to wheelchair accessibility; if he has discussed kerb design with charities for the blind; and if he will make a statement.  [73142]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w07.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Department first issued advice on dropped kerbs almost twenty years ago. Last month we issued new technical guidance to local authorities "Guidance on the use of tactile paving surfaces". The first chapter of that document deals with the design of dropped kerbs for wheelchair users and the provision of tactile paving at such installations to warn blind and partially sighted people that they have reached the edge of the footway. The advice was produced after consultation with local authorities, disability organisations, including those representing blind and partially sighted people, and other interested parties.
<P>

<a name="90226w07.htm_para9">We propose to support the advice contained in this document on dropped kerbs with a Traffic Advisory Leaflet which will be issued to local authorities. The leaflet should be available later this year.

<P>
<a name="90226w07.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to introduce legislation to ensure that all new buildings have wheelchair access to all floors via front and back doors.  [73137]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w07.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Part M of the Building Regulations, which applies to all new buildings, requires that reasonable provision shall be made for disabled people to gain access to and to use the building. The Approved Document which gives guidance on meeting this requirement says that the requirement will be met by making it reasonably safe and convenient for disabled people: to gain access to and within buildings other than dwellings and to use them; and from 25 October 1999 to be able to visit new dwellings and to use the principal storey. For the purposes of Building Regulations disabled people are defined as people who have an impairment which limits their ability to walk or which requires them to use a wheelchair for mobility or who have impaired hearing or sight.
<P>

<a name="90226w07.htm_para10">The provisions for access and facilities in buildings other than dwellings are for the benefit of disabled people who are visitors to the building or who work in it. One of the objectives of Part M is that disabled people should be able to use the principal entrance provided for visitors or customers and an entrance which is intended, exclusively, for members of staff. The provisions are not described in terms of front and back doors. Another objective of Part M is that in designing buildings, it is important that disabled people are able to reach the facilities that are provided within them and to use them. To this end reasonable provision is to be made for vertical circulation within a building other than a dwelling.
<P>

<a name="90226w07.htm_para11">In view of this, I have no plans to introduce further legislation.

[73144]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w08.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We work closely with Railtrack on a wide range of issues affecting the needs of disabled rail travellers, including those who are blind. Railtrack, in common with other service providers, are subject to the provisions of Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. From October 1999, service providers will have to take reasonable steps to change practices, policies or procedures which make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to use a service and provide auxiliary aids or services, for example induction loops or information in Braille, which would enable disabled people to use a service.
<P>

<a name="90226w08.htm_para0">My Department (in collaboration with representative bodies of local authorities and the professional institutions) is also producing advice for service providers in the transport sector on best practice in meeting the 



<P>

<a name="90226w08.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 It is not my Department's practice to give reasons for not calling in planning applications. The Courts have endorsed this view.

<a name="90226w08.htm_para1">Under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, my power to call in planning applications is discretionary and I exercise it very selectively. My policy is not to interfere with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities unless it is necessary to do so.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what is the secondary school (11 to 15) standard spending assessment per pupil in <i>(a)</i> City of London and <i>(b)</i> Rotherham; and if he will make a statement.  [72958]<P>

<P>
<a name="90226w08.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 &#163;9,837 for the City of London and &#163;2,891 for Rotherham when calculated using the overall secondary SSA and the number of pupils aged 11-15 educated by each authority. However, after stripping out the effect of the SSA element for resident pupils, the difference between the two authorities would fall to 1.6:1, which in this case is a better measure of the real difference in secondary SSA funding per pupil.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90226w08.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list for each English local authority the percentage of the standard spending assessments for education per pupil for <i>(a)</i> primary schools and <i>(b)</i> secondary schools which was transferred by the local education authority to schools in the last year for which figures are available.

<P>
<a name="90226w08.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 This question cannot be answered in the form in which it has been tabled. Education SSAs have a wider coverage than funding which is delegated to primary and secondary schools. They have to cover costs such as home-to-school transport, school meals, special schools, and some central costs which cannot be delegated to schools, such as the LEA contribution to the Standards Fund. In addition, pupils are counted at different dates for the purposes of calculating education SSAs and delegated school funding respectively.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Education SSAs were changed in 1998-99 to distribute the under fives sub-block on the basis of provision rather than population.<P>

2. The increase in ring-fenced funding through the Standards Fund includes the LEA contribution, as well as Government grant. For most Standards Fund grants in 1997-98 the DfEE contribution was 60 per cent., whereas in 1998-99 it was 50 per cent.<P>

3. Other central government funding consists of additional loan sanction above the 1997-98 baseline figure and the New Deal for Schools to fund additional investment in school buildings. New Deal for Schools grant was fully funded by DfEE. <P>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For each of the past three years, the Employment Service has carried out an annual audit of the progress on its planned programme of works to improve the accessibility of Employment Service offices to people with disabilities. The annual audit is undertaken to ensure that we comply with the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act within the timescales set. The audit indicates whether our buildings have wheelchair access, loop hearing and disabled toilets.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The latest audit results show that from a total of 1180 premises, 93% have either equal or special wheelchair access for clients. The remaining 7% which do not allow wheelchair access offer alternative arrangements for access to our services, to clients with special needs, either arranging interviews at a nearby office with disabled access or by visiting clients in their homes. Of these offices, there are proposals to remedy difficulties in 12 of them next year. The remaining offices will present longer term difficulties because structural or other constraints mean that it is not possible to replace steps with ramps, or the office is located on an upper floor of a building where it is not physically possible to install a lift or chair lift.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<a name="90226w11.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 February 1999]:</i> Inhumane slaughter would contravene the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 which implement the provisions of a 1993 EU Directive. The Meat Hygiene Service enforces these rules on a daily basis in licensed slaughterhouses and the State Veterinary Service monitors compliance on farms and other premises. It is not feasible to assess how many animals may have been slaughtered in contravention of the law: however, the Government seek full compliance with these regulations and does not hesitate to take action where there is evidence of contraventions. Prosecution action has been taken in 13 case since the regulations were introduced in April 1995.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what steps he has taken to validate safety tests in the USA and Canada on Monsanto's genetically engineered bovine growth hormone recombinant bovine somatotropin prior to consideration of its approval in the UK; and if he will make a statement.  [73259]<P>

<P>
<a name="90226w12.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 February 1999]:</i> The use of recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST) is subject to a European Union moratorium, which is likely to be reviewed before it expires on 31 December. There could be no unilateral decision in the UK to approve its use. I have asked the Veterinary Products Committee to review recent scientific evidence, including evidence from the USA and Canada, on the safety of rBST in order to inform the Government in preparation for EU discussions on the moratorium.
