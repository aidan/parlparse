<P>
<P>
<a name="90610w02.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his oral answer to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake), of 18 May 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 861, on MOX shipments to Japan, by what means the plutonium in MOX fuel is destroyed in nuclear reactors; and if he will list the evidence on which he based his reply.  [85825]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90610w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Typically, MOX fuel contains between 50 and 70 kilograms of plutonium for each tonne of fuel entering the reactor. It is estimated that after four years of generating electricity, the amount of plutonium remaining in the fuel would have been reduced by about 18 kilograms in each tonne. This underpins the view that the use of MOX fuel reduces proliferation risks by gradually reducing plutonium stockpiles.
<P>

<a name="90610w02.htm_para0">This is supported by an OECD (Nuclear Energy Agency) study ("Management of Separated Plutonium: The Technical Options", OECD, Paris 1997) which has indicated that if MOX fuel is burnt at reasonable levels, the world's stockpile of plutonium can be held steady and then gradually reduced during the first decade of the next century.

 We are in regular contact with the Angolan authorities both in London and in Luanda. Indeed I most recently discussed these issues with Dr. Miranda, the Angolan Foreign Minister, on 23 February when I was in Luanda. We deeply regret the renewal of the conflict for which we hold Dr. Jonas Savimbis' UNITA responsible. We fully support the tightening of United Nations sanctions on the sale of diamonds, on oil supplies and arms for UNITA. We welcome the establishment by the United Nations Secretary-General of expert groups to study the issue. We look forward to learning the results of the visit to the region by Ambassador Fowler, the Chairman of the UN Angolan Sanctions Committee. We shall then discuss with the Angolan authorities, our EU partners and all those members of the international community interested in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in Angola how best to implement his findings.

 I view with great concern the estimate by the World Health Organisation (WHO) that, if current trends continue, tobacco will be the leading cause of disease burden in the world by 2030, causing about one in eight deaths, and that 70 per cent. of tobacco-related deaths will be in developing countries. I strongly support the priority being given to tobacco control by WHO through its "Tobacco Free" initiative, and the efforts to establish an international framework convention for tobacco control which, in particular, will aim to protect children and adolescents from exposure to tobacco products and their promotion. We are contributing &#163;200,000 this financial year to the "Tobacco Free initiative".

 MOD records show that 4,700 Patent Applications were passed to MOD in the period 1985-98, of which 1,669 are still prohibited from publication. The total number of applications passed to MOD between 1978, when the Patents Act was implemented, and 1984 is not available, because the only information in the computer database relates to those applications which are still subject to prohibition; 471 applications from that period are still subject to a Section 22 prohibition order. Annual summaries of these figures follow: Of the overall total of 2,140 cases still prohibited from publication, 927 are overseas patent applications, which have been filed under secure conditions in the UK. These come from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United States of America, countries with which the UK has reciprocal arrangements for the protection of applications which have been prohibited from publication, and which have procedures similar to Section 22 of the 1977 Patents Act.
<P>

<a name="90610w03.htm_para0">The MOD may not see any prohibited application until either the owner of the application has given permission for this, or until 18 months after the filing date, if such permission is not forthcoming. The MOD endeavours to confirm a prohibition order, or to recommend rescission of the order, within three months of receipt of the applications. 85 per cent. of new applications are dealt with within this time.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on trends in the levels of <i>(a)</i> ammonia, <i>(b)</i> benzene, <i>(c)</i> mercury and <i>(d)</i> phosgene in the atmosphere.  [86026]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90610w04.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 June 1999]:</i> <i>(a) Ammonia</i>--My Department has been funding a nationwide network of around 70 sites to measure the ambient concentrations of ammonia since 1996. To date, there is not a sufficiently long dataset to discern authoritatively any trends, although early indications are that there is substantial seasonal and inter-annual variability. There are larger concentrations in spring and summer, and the largest concentrations are in warm, dry years. On the basis of natural variability, monitoring for more than five years will be necessary to clearly detect changes in response to changes in national emissions. Numbers of livestock and nitrogen fertiliser usage, which are the main sources of ammonia, have declined since the mid 1980s.
<P>

<a name="90610w04.htm_para2">Earlier ad-hoc monitoring campaigns from this period are not sufficient to demonstrate increased concentrations in the 1980s compared with the present. Much longer term datasets of precipitation chemistry and deposition have shown that atmospheric ammonia increased substantially between 1950 and the 1980s, which can be explained by both increases in livestock numbers and nitrogen fertiliser inputs.
<P>

<a name="90610w04.htm_para3"><i>(b) Benzene</i>--My Department has funded the continuous real-time measurement of benzene in the air since 1993. There are now 13 sites in the network, including roadside, urban background, and rural locations. In 1997, the running annual mean for benzene from this network ranged from (rural) 0.5-(urban centre) 2.1 parts per billion. To date, there is not a sufficiently long dataset to discern authoritatively any trends. Results of the monitoring are available in the Department's Digest of Environmental Statistics, and are available on the Department's internet site.
<P>

<a name="90610w04.htm_para4"><i>(c) Mercury</i>--Mercury is predominantly present in the UK atmosphere as either particulate mercury or other semi-volatile mercury compounds. This leads to measurement problems in that it is difficult to measure the two phases in the same sample. My Department has been measuring mercury at three sites--Chilton in Oxfordshire, Styrrup in north Nottinghamshire and Wraymires in the Lake District. These are all relatively remote locations. Measurements have been taken of particulate mercury and of mercury in rain. Table 1 lists the atmospheric concentrations of mercury (ng m-3) at rural locations. The particulate mercury is only a small fraction of the total, perhaps 4 per cent. Table 2 gives mercury concentrations in rain water (g l-1) at rural locations, mercury is rarely detectable in rain water. There is no trend to speak of in either of these measures of mercury concentrations, except that analytical detection limits have improved markedly in recent years.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he has reached conclusions following the second stage of the consultation on night restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted; and if he will make a statement.  [86775]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90610w05.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 On 17 November 1998 the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions issued the second of two consultation papers on the next night restrictions regime for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports, to apply from 31 October 1999 until the end of the 2004 summer season. This second consultation paper took into account all relevant responses to the preliminary consultation paper issued on 27 February 1998.
<P>

<a name="90610w05.htm_para3">The November consultation paper was in two parts. Part 1 was concerned with all aspects of the night restrictions regime now applying at the three airports. Part 2 examined options for changes to the preferential use of Heathrow's runways at night. The decisions I am announcing today are concerned with Part 1 of the November consultation paper only. Consideration of the responses to the options examined in Part 2 is continuing and a separate announcement will be made on that in due course. Decisions on Parts 1 and 2 of the consultation paper are not inter-dependent.
<P>

<a name="90610w05.htm_para4">The current night restrictions are among the most stringent in Europe: night movements by Chapter 3 noise certificated aircraft are not limited at most other leading airports. We said in the preliminary consultation paper that we did not expect to propose major changes to the night restrictions for the next regime. To relax the restrictions significantly or to ban night flights entirely would not be consistent with the Government's objectives set out in the consultation paper.




<P>
<P><I>10 Jun 1999 : Column: 379</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90610w05.htm_para5">We have decided to implement the proposals in the consultation paper, but with four modifications.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) The proposal to reduce the seasonal noise quotas for Heathrow from winter 1999-2000 onwards to nearer the level of current usage is to be implemented but with smaller reductions in the noise quotas than proposed. The winter season noise quota will be set at a level which is below quota usage in winter 1998-99.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) The proposal to reduce the seasonal noise quotas for Gatwick progressively from winter 2001-02 onwards is to be implemented but with larger reductions in the noise quotas than proposed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) The proposal to reapportion the Gatwick movement limits pro rata to the length of the summer and winter seasons is not to be implemented and the current apportionment of the movements limits is to be retained for the next regime.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) The proposal to increase the noise quotas for Stansted, while maintaining the incentive for airlines to use quieter aircraft at night, is to be implemented but the reasons underpinning it differ to some degree from those set out in the consultation paper.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90610w05.htm_para6">The overall effect of the decisions is to put in place a new night restrictions regime at the three airports which will contribute towards achievement of the Government's objectives set out in the consultation paper. The decision to reduce the noise quotas for Heathrow to nearer the level of current usage, and in the case of the winter season to a level below usage in winter 1998-99, will help safeguard the improvement in the noise climate during the noise quota period brought about since 1993 under the current regime. The decision to reduce the noise quotas for Gatwick by more than proposed in the consultation paper, in conjunction with the decisions we have reached on other aspects, is expected to bring about an improvement in the night noise climate around the airport over time. The decision not to reapportion the Gatwick movements limits pro rata to the length of the seasons will enable airlines to develop services in summer by more than would have been the case under the Government's proposal, but other environmental benefits will be provided through the larger than proposed reductions in the noise quotas. The decision to increase the noise quotas for Stansted by about 3.5 per cent. per annum will provide for the further development of the airport broadly as envisaged in 1993 and 1994.
<P>

<a name="90610w05.htm_para7">The full decision and the reasons for the decision are dealt with in the document "Night Restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted: Revised restrictions with effect from 31 October 1999", copies of which have been placed in the House Library.
<P>

<a name="90610w05.htm_para8">In reaching these decisions we have taken into account the disturbance caused by night flights and the need to ensure that local communities are not exposed to excessive levels of aircraft noise at night. Account has been taken of the existing noise climate around each airport, the local circumstances of each airport, and the distribution of population under their principal arrival and departure tracks. These have been weighed against the aviation interests involved, the existing air services using each airport and the wider economic considerations. We believe that the decisions announced today will protect local people from excessive levels of aircraft noise at night.

 Entitlement to help with National Health Service dental charges is based on the principle that those who can afford to contribute should do so, while those most likely to have difficulty paying should be protected. Pensioners on low incomes are entitled to claim free NHS dental treatment or help with the cost of charges under the NHS Low Income Scheme.

 Contracts for organisations taking on the delivery of education services in poorly performing LEAs will contain a series of key performance indicators and core outcomes against which the contractor's performance will be judged. These performance measures will be linked to a payment mechanism which will ensure that payments to the contractor are based on delivering an improved service. The precise details of such contracts are, of course, a matter for negotiation with providers. The LEA and the contractor will also need to hold regular contract monitoring meetings to review progress against the Service Management Plan.

 None. Arrangements for admission to schools are determined locally by the relevant admission authority, that is the local education authority for county and controlled schools, the governing body for voluntary aided and grant-maintained schools.

The places do not have to be provided at schools in its area. Where a child is without a school place because he or she has been refused admission to, or excluded from, every school within a reasonable travelling distance, the local education authority has the power to direct a school to admit the child.

<P>
<a name="90610w08.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 We have taken a number of steps to ensure that voluntary pre-schools and playgroups contribute fully to early education and care. The voluntary and private sectors have to be represented on the Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships which plan the delivery and development of local early years service. Each partnership has to provide specifically for the involvement of voluntary providers; to assess the health of the non-maintained sector in their areas; and to show financial support that may be available. Plans for the provision of additional places for 3 year olds, for which we are making available new funding of &#163;390 million over three years from September 1999, must also fully involve the voluntary sector.
<P>

<a name="90610w08.htm_para1">The same principles apply to Sure Start, which will provide integrated and community-based services for 0 to 3s and their families. The voluntary sector is a significant partner in all 60 Trailblazer programmes, and leads some of them.

 Our commitment to increase parental choice is made clear in the Code of Practice on Admissions which came into force on 1 April. The Code reminds LEAs and governing bodies that they have an overriding duty to comply with parents' declared preferred school for their child. We want parents to be able to send their children to their preferred school wherever practicable, and LEAs should make every effort to ensure that they have sufficient school places to allow the maximum number of parents to obtain a place at a school of their choice. The funding we are providing to LEAs to meet our infant class size pledge will enable 12,000 extra places at popular schools to be achieved.

 The contribution of the head is pivotal in leading schools to excellence and we are committed to helping all headteachers to develop the skills and knowledge they need. We are investing &#163;100 million over the next three years to ensure heads have access to high quality, practical and professional training at every stage of their careers. As set out in the Green Paper, "teachers: meeting the challenge of change", we will build on the existing headship training programmes to develop a new national framework of training and development opportunities. Already, some 400 teachers have achieved the National Professional Qualification for Headship and some 6,000 are now in training. We are developing further the NPQH to build on the strengths of the qualification before making it a mandatory requirement for all those coming new to headship. The Green Paper also set out our intention to establish a National College for School Leadership. On 2 June we published our prospectus for the college, which will be a driving force for world-class leadership in schools, providing professional support for heads through cutting-edge training and development opportunities. Responsibility for designing and overseeing the existing headship programmes will move to the national college when it is established in 2000.

 The meeting scheduled for 30 May to 1 June in Dresden is an informal meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers. As is usual for such meetings, there is no formal agenda and no official documents will be discussed. The only item scheduled for discussion is a German Presidency Paper on "Sustainable Rural Development: Agricultural Structure Policy for Rural Areas".

 <i>[holding answer 8 June 1999]:</i> The Government are pressing the Commission to forward to the Council its proposed Regulation covering novel animal feeds. This is necessary to ensure fair and consistent labelling in the EU. We are exploring whether national labelling arrangements are feasible pending the introduction of EC measures.
