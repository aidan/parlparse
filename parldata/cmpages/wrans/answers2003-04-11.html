<a name="30411w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Government are keen to promote greater national diversity on the boards of public bodies. Departments are advertising their public appointments vacancies on a new website (www.publicappts-vacs.gov.uk) launched by my Department on 27 March 2003. The website currently has details of over 100 opportunities, arising at local and regional levels throughout the country, as well as those with a national remit. Departments also publicise vacancies in the media and on their own departmental websites.
<P>

<a name="30411w01.html_para0">All public appointments are made on merit. For my own Department, between 14 May 2002 and 31 March 2003, five new appointments were made to NDPB's. Those appointed live in either London or the South-East region.
<P>

<a name="30411w01.html_para1">The regional seminars for women held during 2002 to help increase awareness of public appointments were organised by the Women and Equality Unit, which is now in the Department of Trade and Industry. The seminars were aimed at encouraging more women from the regions, minority ethnic women and disabled women who are already participating in public life to apply for regional and national public appointments. There were eight regional seminars which 848 women attended. In addition, five national seminars took place, targeted at specialist female audiences. In total, 1,328 women, from diverse backgrounds, attended the 13 seminars. As a result of the seminars, 91 per cent. of those attending said that they would be more likely to apply for an appointment after attending the seminars.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30411w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has a range of flexible working policies intended to help staff achieve a better work/life balance, including paid and unpaid special leave. Staff are entitled to take a maximum of 10 days paid special leave each year to deal with domestic crises, as well as an extended period of unpaid special leave if appropriate. No central records are kept of the numbers of staff taking this leave and no requests have been received under the Employment Relations Act 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will set up a system to report the proportion of Lottery funds which are spent on projects that previously would have competed for central government funding.  [108473]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30411w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 We have no plans to set up a system on this basis. It is the Government's policy that Lottery funding should be additional to, rather than substitute for, Government spending.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30411w01.html_wqn7"><B> Bob Spink: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what proportion of the good causes Lottery money was distributed via the <i>(a)</i> Community Fund and <i>(b)</i> New Opportunities Fund in 2002&#150;03; and what her estimate is of these proportions in the next two years.  [108477]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30411w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Of all the money entering the National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF) in 2002&#150;03, one sixth was allocated for distribution by the Community Fund and one third by the New Opportunities Fund (NOF). I have guaranteed the share passing to the charitable good cause until 2009. Currently this is distributed solely by the Community Fund. There are no plans at present to change the share passing to the NOF, which distributes funds for health, education and environment good causes.
<P>

<a name="30411w01.html_para2">Interest accruing on the balance held in the NLDF passes to the distributors in proportion to their share of the overall balance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30411w01.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has a range of policies intended to support staff with parental responsibilities including paid maternity and paternity leave; adoptive leave; career breaks; special leave with and without pay; and a range of flexible working options.

 Safety instructions, covering all aspects of the hazard management of DU munitions in theatre, have been issued by the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) through the operational chain of command to all units and formations deployed in the joint area of operations. I will be placing copies in the Library of the House and on the MOD website.
<P>

<a name="30411w02.html_para0">The safety instructions make clear that the risks from DU are far lower than those from other hazards arising from military operations and that combat and life-saving activities should never be delayed on account of concern over DU.
<P>

<a name="30411w02.html_para1">UK military personnel are advised not to touch, pick up or retain souvenirs from tanks struck by DU rounds, nor climb onto or into them unless specifically required to do so. In general, personnel should stay at least 50 metres away from a struck tank and attempt to stay upwind of the tank while it is on fire. Eating, drinking and smoking should be avoided near struck tanks.
<P>

<a name="30411w02.html_para2">If there is a requirement for UK military personnel to enter the vicinity of a DU&#151;struck tank, then the advice is to cover all exposed skin. If practicable, NEC rubber or leather gloves should be worn and a dust mask or wet cloth should be used to cover the nose and mouth. Full NEC protective equipment is not necessary unless prolonged dust-raising activities are to be carried out. The task should be completed as quickly as possible, keeping dust disturbance to a minimum. As soon as possible after task completion, dust should be brushed off clothing in a controlled and marked site. Facial masks and gloves should be maintained until contaminated clothing has been removed. Outer clothing should be changed at the first convenient opportunity and laundered in the normal way before being worn again. Hands should then be washed before eating, drinking or smoking.
<P>

<a name="30411w02.html_para3">The Defence Medical Services Directorate has disseminated separate medical instructions to medical staff. Medics should, if practicable, wear filter masks,

plastic aprons and double-layered surgical gloves. Aprons and gloves should be changed between patients. Patients should be wrapped in a blanket for transport, contaminated clothing should be cut off and bagged and wounds that may contain DU must be cleaned at the earliest opportunity under running water and covered with a dry dressing.
<P>

<a name="30411w02.html_para4"><P>

<a name="30411w02.html_para5">UK military personnel that may have been contaminated with DU are to have that fact annotated in their medical and personal records. Personnel will be advised of their access to biological monitoring; Personnel who have had an encounter with a struck tank will be advised to accept a urine test for uranium exposure. All other troops who served in theatre will have the opportunity to have a urine test for uranium exposure if they wish. Other tests will be conducted as considered clinically necessary.

<P>

<a name="30411w03.html_para0">The reference to the authorisation of deadly force on the notice does not amount to a blanket pre-authorisation. It is US practice, in relation to specially sensitive areas, to draw attention to what is implicit whenever armed personnel (US or British) are deployed to guard military installations in the UK, namely that they are authorised to use lethal force in circumstances where it is lawful.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his guidelines are on sources of supply for <i>(a)</i> ammunition and <i>(b)</i> propellant in the United Kingdom arms industry.  [107264]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30411w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The guidelines used to determine which sources of supply provide ammunition to the Ministry of Defence are based on smart acquisition principles, which utilise competition to obtain best value for money in meeting the military requirement, whilst ensuring security of supply.

Following a review the Government announced on 15 October 2001 that The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre would retain its public sector role and status. The review did not recommend contracting out or privatisation, which it considered could be difficult to implement, and would be poor value for money.

 To assess the risk of over-30-months (slaughter) scheme (OTMS) operations the Environment Agency commissioned a number of studies from independent expert consultants to establish the risk from BSE to human health via different environmental pathways, based on the precautionary principle. These reports covered both the incineration of carcass material and the incineration of rendered products. They were produced in consultation with the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) and published in 1997. They showed that the risks are negligible compared to other risks in daily life and endorsed SEAC's advice to Government in 1996 that the current and proposed methods of dealing with animal waste material from the slaughter of cattle are safe.

<a name="30411w06.html_para2">The cost of rendering and subsequent incineration of rendered products is less expensive than that of the direct incineration of cattle carcasses.

Both methods of disposal are used under OTMS and each represent good value for money.

<P>
<a name="30411w08.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 There is little research evidence to show whether or not population screening in the over 70s is effective in reducing mortality. What little evidence there is suggests that screening in this way may not be effective and could even do more harm than good to some women. However, for some individual women there will always be a clear benefit in screening. Women aged over 70 will be offered free three yearly screening on request when the extension to women aged 65 to 70 is fully implemented, as are women aged 65 and over now. Women who have already participated in the programme will be informed of this right after the age of 70.

<i>[holding answer 8 April 2003]:</i> The Government recognises the importance of ensuring that the needs of people with dementia and their carers are met. For that reason, the national service framework (NSF) for older people has set a standard and within this a service model that includes access to specialist care to ensure effective diagnosis, treatment and support. Local programmes are being developed as part of the NSF to improve services for older people with mental health problems, including dementia.
<P>

<a name="30411w08.html_para2">In the south west peninsula, local specialist mental health, primary care and social services provide a range of services for people with dementia and their carers. This includes in-patient units for assessment and treatment, respite provision, community mental health teams, day services and support in the home and for carers. In Dorset and Somerset, there is capital investment to support mental health services, and partnerships have been developed with local community mental health groups. In Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, a planning and priorities framework target on mental health and older people has been included in local delivery plans.

 We are determined to improve the awareness of endometriosis and training of general practitioners, as the first point of contact for women with this condition. Departmental officials are working with the National Endometriosis Society (NES) and the Simply Holistic Endometriosis (SHE) Trust to see if a robust application can be drawn up for the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to develop clinical guidelines on endometriosis for general practitioners. This is still at an early stage and there are many calls on the services of NICE as we take forward national health service reforms on a broad front.
<P>

<a name="30411w08.html_para3">NICE is currently undertaking a referral practice project on advice to general practitioners about referring common conditions, the results of which may give us an effective way of offering referral guidance on endometriosis.

 The overall aims and objectives of the local exercise action pilots (LEAP) programme were included in the original invitations for 'expressions of interest', sent by regional directors of public health to primary care trusts (PCTs) within neighbourhood renewal fund areas. The criteria regarding target groups, location, partnership working and innovative practice were highlighted throughout the application process and in the assessment guidance to regions. The criteria were applied to the decision-making process, both at the 'expression of interest' stage and, again, once the bids were fully worked up. PCTs completed a structured application form, which asked for further details under the headings of the criteria and some additional contextual information such as the local evidence base and their monitoring and evaluation framework.
<P>

<a name="30411w09.html_para1">Following initial expressions of interest, 31 short-listed PCTs submitted full applications, which were assessed by regional panels, led by public health colleagues and representatives from the funding partners, Sport England and the Countryside Agency.

<a name="30411w09.html_para2">Central to the assessment process was the involvement and commitment of the regions. The regional panels were best placed to assess the individual applications. Their recommendations were then reviewed by the national management group. This consisted of the Department of Health, Sport England, the Countryside Agency and the Local Government Association. The role of the management group was to ensure the nine pilots selected provided a national cross section, in terms of target audiences, locations, range of partners and innovative interventions.

 Hours for Home Office staff with full-time attendance are 41 hours for staff in the London pay area and 42 hours elsewhere, including meal breaks. Within the Prison Service, prison officer and related grades work 39 hours per week, exclusive of meal breaks, which are unpaid. Many staff who work full-time or part-time are able to work flexible hours. For a 'traditional' full-time worker, core hours are 10:00 until 11:30 and 15:00 to 15:45. In some Home Office agencies and non-departmental public bodies these hours may vary by 30-minutes/one hour, but in general are within the times stated.

An individual's working pattern is decided in conjunction with their local management to suit both the individual's preferences and the requirements of the office. Staff also now have the statutory right to request to work flexibly and there is a duty for managers to consider such requests seriously.

 My Department continues to give support to international efforts to tackle the spread of HIV and AIDS. In our bilateral programmes alone, expenditure on HIV/AIDS related work has increased from &#163;38 million in 1997&#150;98 to over &#163;200 million in 2001&#150;02. Major new investments include support for programmes in Nigeria, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mozambique, Russia, Ghana, China and India totalling over &#163;350 million. We have pledged US$200 million to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, and &#163;30 million to the international AIDS Vaccine Initiative and the Medical Research Council's Microbicide Development Programme. Considerable additional resources have also been committed to United Nations agencies and civil society organisations to help combat HIV/AIDS and to help people living with the disease across the developing world. We will continue to support health system strengthening and comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention, care, control and impact mitigation programmes.

<a name="30411w11.html_para4">We are currently working intensively to improve access to affordable, new and existing medicines, including for HIV/AIDS, for poor people in developing countries. In November 2002, the Prime Minister launched the Report of the High Level Working Group on Access to Medicines. The Group brought together UK Government, and involved partners to facilitate widespread voluntary differential pricing of essential medicines for the poorer developing countries as the operational norm. The report proposes that pharmaceutical companies provide drugs for HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria at near to cost of manufacture to the poorest countries, and my Department is working hard to achieve these ambitions. We also support the Global Fund whose primary role is to provide drugs and commodities for the prevention and treatment of AIDS, TB and Malaria and some associated health system strengthening.

 The UN has an administrative and oversight role over the Oil for Food Programme (OFF) in central, southern and northern Iraq.

and vulnerable inside Iraq. WFP concluded contracts last week to buy a further 400,000 metric tons of food aid for Iraq, which they intend to use to replenish the OFF distribution systems. These supplies should start reaching the region by late April. But they will only reach people if the distribution system can be kept in place. This means helping Iraqis keep 55,000 separate outlets across the country operating, 45,000 of which are in the centre and south of Iraq. In some parts of the country, they are still doing so; in others it will be a greater challenge. We are continuing to liaise closely with relevant UN agencies on these issues.

The court had a high workload, which could not be accommodated at Wimbledon, and the journey to Wimbledon would inconvenience court users.

 Cases involving death or serious injury to young children, where it is not possible to say which of two parents or carers was responsible for the injury, present particular difficulties for the prosecution.

<i>[holding answer 7 April 2003]:</i> The Government are aware both of reports in the media (including on the internet) and reports by various animal welfare groups about the mistreatment of domestic cats and dogs in parts of Asia and the reported use of their fur. So far, we have not seen reliable evidence that these practices take place on a significant, organised scale, nor have we been able to ascertain whether domestic cat and dog fur produced in this way is indeed entering the UK. We would therefore be interested to hear from anyone who has hard evidence about the practices relating to this alleged trade, and more particularly, any evidence of proven domestic dog and cat fur goods produced by this trade that may be entering the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30411w14.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Stamp duty is charged according to the type of property, rather than the type of buyer so the Inland Revenue does not keep a record of the numbers of businesses or individuals who claim the relief. However, the exemption has been claimed on over 700 commercial property transactions and around 72,000 residential property transactions to date, benefiting buyers of all those properties with an exemption from stamp duty worth up to &#163;1,500 per transaction. The number of claims in relation to commercial property is likely to increase now that the Chancellor has announced the abolition of the existing &#163;150,000 cap for non-residential property from 10 April which will offer unlimited stamp duty relief on non-residential property to businesses investing in the 2000 enterprise areas.

 There is normally a six year limit for a contributor to pay Class 3 voluntary contributions to make up gaps in contributions in a past year. The Inland Revenue have announced an extension of the limit in respect of the years 1996&#150;97 to 2001&#150;02 to 5 April 2008. Starting later this year the Inland Revenue will contact people who could have gaps in their records for the years from 1996&#150;97 to 2001&#150;02, to allow them to check their positions and make voluntary contributions if they wish to do so.

 Banks and other financial institutions generally lend money to PFI special purpose companies in the form of limited-recourse debt, financed by project cash-flows. This money is at risk if the agreed PFI service is not provided.

<a name="30411w14.html_para4">Investors who hold equity stakes in Special Purpose Vehicles typically do not have an obligation to repay debt. Their equity in PFI companies is, however, at risk if the agreed PFI service is not provided.

<a name="30411w14.html_para5">PFI builders and facilities managers working under contract with PFI special purpose companies will also not generally be responsible for repaying the debt issued by PFI special purpose companies.

<a name="30411w17.html_para5">Flexible working hours schemes operate wherever practicable, and staff are not unnecessarily excluded from participating. The schemes cover all grades, including part-time staff, job share and part year appointments. Participation in a flexible working hours scheme is voluntary. Individuals who prefer not to participate in a scheme may work fixed hours. Individuals who abuse flexible working can be suspended from the scheme.

<a name="30411w17.html_para6">Core-time is not mandatory, but where flexible working hours schemes include a core-time, the maximum number of core hours is six hours daily for full-time staff working standard work patterns.

Staff may vary the length and timing of their lunch/meal break within the parameters of the scheme.
