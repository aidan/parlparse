To ask the Minister of State for International Development whether the United Kingdom will raise at the G8 Evian Summit the failure to reach agreement within the WTO to amend the TRIPS agreement to provide affordable access to medicines to Africa's poor; and whether the UK will seek to obtain at Evian a recommitment to this policy by all G8 countries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w01.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Government is concerned by the continued lack of progress on this issue. We are actively working with our WTO partners, including members of the G8, to reach a satisfactory agreement as soon as possible and hopefully in advance of the 5th WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun, Mexico in September.
<P>

<a name="30519w01.html_para0">At the G8 Evian Summit leaders will discuss both the current blockage in the WTO TRIPS and Public Health negotiations as well as the broader issue of access to medicines. We hope to secure further positive action on these important issues.

To ask the Minister of State for International Development how many United Kingdom companies involved in extractive industries in Africa have disclosed their payments to host governments as envisaged in the UK implementation plans for the G8 Africa Action plan; and if she will make a statement.  [113644]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w01.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The UK is working to persuade relevant stakeholders to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). This would encourage producer and host countries to allow company disclosure of payments and to disclose revenues.
<P>

<a name="30519w01.html_para1">Ministers, CEOs and high-level representatives will be attending a conference in London on 17 June to agree a statement of principles underpinning EITI and to agree actions on how to take it forward.

 DFID's Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) team has hosted two pre-Evian international meetings:

To ask the Minister of State for International Development when a Commonwealth Development Corporation African Fund was established; how much it intends to invest in African businesses; how much this will increase its investment in Africa; and whether the Commonwealth Development Corporation intends to mirror the G8 proposal to devote half its resources to Africa.  [113610]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w01.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Under the 1999 Act, the Commonwealth Development Corporation became a public limited company, registered as CDC Group plc, and trading as CDC Capital Partners.
<P>

<a name="30519w01.html_para3">In August 2002, it was announced that, from 2003, CDC would organise its investment activities through specialised funds. This reorganisation is progressing well and it is intended that fund raising will start later this year. One of these funds will be dedicated to Africa.
<P>

<a name="30519w01.html_para4">In the meantime, CDC continues to make investments in Africa. In the past six months, CDC has taken ownership of power assets in Tanzania and South Africa; financed the management buy-out of a leading Egyptian consumer business; made a further investment in Uganda's leading private sector bank; and provided expansion capital to a leading agribusiness exporter in Kenya.
<P>

<a name="30519w01.html_para5">CDC Group plc operates under an investment policy, agreed with DFID, which requires that at least 50 cent. of its new investments are in, or for the benefit of, the countries of sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia and that 70 per cent. of new investments must be in, or for the benefit of, the poorer developing countries (which of course includes most of sub-Saharan Africa). It is not planned to revise these targets in the foreseeable future.

To ask the Minister of State for International Development what assistance the Commonwealth Business Council has given to the New Partnership for Africa's Development-NEPAD-Business Group.  [113611]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w01.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Commonwealth Business Council (CBC) helped to establish, and is a member of the NEPAD Business Group (NBG). NBG comprises leading business organisations who have a broad constituency&#151;both inside and outside Africa&#151;and are committed to helping the continent realise its full

economic potential. The Group acts as a medium between NEPAD and private companies who support its aims.
<P>

<a name="30519w01.html_para6">The NEPAD Heads of Government Implementation Committee at the African Union Summit approved the NBG as its business partner, and set up a special committee of the NEPAD Steering Group to work with CBC. CBC has established a Project Support Unit, to which DFID has contributed &#163;117,000 of funding. The Unit is conducting national consultations with African businesses, policy analyses, and the development of action plans which map out the constraints and opportunities for the private sector to influence the NEPAD process.

To ask the Minister of State for International Development what assistance her Department is giving to expand digital opportunities in Africa.  [113612]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w01.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Through partnerships with others, DFID is supporting four key initiatives that seek to build digital opportunities. First, Imfundo : Partnership for IT in Education 2001&#150;06 (&#163;7 million) works with civil society organisations, the private sector, global agencies and academic institutions to enhance initiatives that support universal equitable basic education. Second, Catalysing Access to ICTs in Africa (CATIA) 2003&#150;06 (&#163;8.8 million). This project promotes reform and affordable access to ICTs across Africa and forms part of our response to the G8 Africa Action Plan. Third, Building Digital Opportunities 2001&#150;2004 (&#163;7 million); this global initiative has strong African components and covers a range of ICT issues from regulatory issues to inclusion for the poor through links with traditional media such as community radio. And fourth, the African Virtual University (AVU) 2002&#150;04 (&#163;2 million). The AVU's goal is to reach all students in Africa who would like to attend university but are unable to do so because of costs and distance.

<P>
<a name="30519w01.html_wqn6"><B> Hugh Bayley: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State for International Development what new initiatives have been taken by G8 countries to support the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals for education in African Countries which are not yet reforming, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> Nigeria and <i>(b)</i> Democratic Republic of Congo; and what additional funding has been made available for education in African countries already covered by the World Bank's Fast Track initiative.  [113613]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w01.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Between 2002 and 2007 we intend to spend &#163;1.3 billion on basic education, subject to agreeing high quality programmes with our partners. Of this, about &#163;500 million will go to Africa. This figure of &#163;1.3 billion compares favourably with the &#163;700 million committed to Universal Primary Education since 1997.
<P>

<a name="30519w01.html_para7">There is broad consensus among international agencies that greater harmonisation of resources will increase aid effectiveness. We will work with G8 to ensure that they increase support and resources to meet the education MDGs. Our approach to Nigeria and DRC is to support long-term change while supporting rapid improvements in education delivery. In Nigeria we have committed &#163;12.5 million of technical support to help 16 Nigerian states with their plans for Universal

Basic Education alongside $100 million of financial support from the World Bank. In the DRC, DFID has agreed to support an education adviser within the World Bank office in Kinshasa and to provide additional support to the education planning process. We will consider supporting education following the conclusion of the peace agreement.
<P>

<a name="30519w01.html_para8">Our approach to the Fast Track Initiative (FTI) is to ensure that it focuses on encouraging Governments with large numbers of children out of school to develop credible education plans that will enable them to achieve the aim of universal primary education. We have successfully pressed for the inclusion of those countries with the most children out of school&#151;like India (with 30 million children out of school), Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo. A working group of which DFID is a member has been established to take this forward. In countries where we are engaged, we will consider increasing our support in the context of their PRSP and Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. We will continue to be involved in the Fast Track Initiative at all levels but do not envisage diverting existing commitments in order to support specific Fast Track Initiative proposals.

and the Government of Ethiopia in January 2003. The first such Memorandum was signed with the Government of Rwanda in April 1999. It is expected that a country Memorandum of Understanding will be agreed with the Government of Tanzania later this year. In Uganda, a memorandum is being considered with the Government but finalisation will await the revision in late 2003 of the national Poverty Eradication Action Plan with which it will be aligned. Country Memoranda are also being actively considered in Ghana and Mozambique but no timetable has been set. The Department will consider entering in to such long-term partnerships with other African governments that demonstrate strong commitment to the goal of poverty eradication, have appropriate policies in place and, are building the capacity to deliver effective programmes.

To ask the Minister of State for International Development what steps the Department is taking to help small coffee producers in developing countries <i>(a)</i> to diversify into alternative livelihoods following the decline in world coffee prices and <i>(b)</i> to gain organic certification for their coffees.  [113508]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w02.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 UK development assistance is provided on a bilateral basis to a significant number of coffee producing countries including Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. UK bilateral assistance to these six countries in 2001&#150;02 amounted to &#163;200 million. Additional financial resources are also provided through multilateral channels including the European Commission's external aid programme and the Common Fund for Commodities. UK support to poverty reduction strategies, and other national strategic planning processes, provides an important contribution to livelihood diversification in many coffee dependent countries.
<P>

<a name="30519w02.html_para0">Through our membership of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) the UK is also supporting the development of an ICO diversification programme. The aim is to undertake specific projects to generate other sources of earnings for growers, such as by the introduction of new crops, without eliminating coffee growing itself.
<P>

<a name="30519w02.html_para1">It does not necessarily follow that organic certification will deliver improved livelihoods for poor coffee producers. It is important that careful consideration is given to ensuring that any additional premium generated from the production and sale of organic produce justifies any additional costs that may be incurred, including associated certification costs. In 2000, DFID financed a study to examine the opportunities and constraints for resource poor farmers in organic production and trade. DFID is also supporting a coffee certification feasibility analysis in Uganda.

To ask the Minister of State for International Development what representations he will make to EU Commissioner Nielson on the use of unspent EU aid money to compensate poor countries for the fall in coffee prices through <i>(a)</i> assisting the International Coffee Organisation in monitoring coffee quality, <i>(b)</i> increasing aid to boost coffee farmers' market power and <i>(c)</i> helping them diversify to the production of other crops.

 The funds in question refer to resources available from the now expired Lome Convention. However, it is important to recognise that these funds, while not disbursed, are currently allocated to other activities. Until such commitments are actually spent, financial resources remain with Member State Treasuries. In the case of the UK, they are spent on poverty reduction activities elsewhere. The European Commission does not maintain a fund of unused finances beyond normal balances needed for cash management purposes.
<P>

<a name="30519w02.html_para2">However, from an efficiency point of view, the Commission needs to provide more information about old and undisbursed commitments that could and should be recommitted elsewhere to fund other development activities through bilateral or multilateral channels. The mid-term reviews of EC Country Strategies starting in 2004, will give each country an opportunity to reassess their own priorities and requirements, and could allow reallocation of existing commitments. The Secretary of State will make this point at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 19 to 20 May 2003, at which Commissioner Nielson will be present.
<P>

<a name="30519w02.html_para3">We would be willing to support, within the framework of poverty reduction programmes or other appropriate national planning processes, efforts by the Commission to direct any released funds to activities that facilitate livelihood diversification in poor countries including those dependent on coffee.
<P>

<a name="30519w02.html_para4">The market power of coffee producers is partly a function of their capacity to negotiate improved terms with other market participants. There are a number of ways in which EU aid could be applied to achieve this. This includes support provided within the framework of poverty reduction programmes.
<P>

<a name="30519w02.html_para5">The EU is supportive of the ICO Quality Initiative. Progress with implementation of the Quality Initiative is currently being discussed by the Working Group on Commodities (PROBA) at which the UK is represented by DEFRA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w02.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The UK Government remain sceptical about proposals to finance the reduction of stocks of surplus coffee. A voluntary cut in total global production that results in a better balance between coffee supply and demand is the only feasible means to achieve an improvement in coffee prices. It is also important to 



<P>
<P><I>19 May 2003 : Column 513W</I><P>
recognise that any arrangement that promotes an increase in market prices in the absence of strict disciplines on production is likely to be short-lived as producers will respond to increased prices through an expansion in output. For these reasons we do not intend to finance or compensate producer countries in respect of any stock reduction programme they undertake.
<P>

<a name="30519w02.html_para6">The Coffee Retention Scheme agreed by the Association of Coffee Producing Countries was intended to raise coffee prices, by retaining a set proportion of coffee supplies destined for export. The Scheme was formally abandoned in 2002 as producer members were unable to work out a mechanism of control over coffee prices. The International Coffee Organisation also used to operate a quota system whereby coffee supplies in excess of consumer requirements were withheld from the market. However, changes in the pattern of supply and demand, resulting in an increase in prices, also led to the collapse of this quota system. This highlights the problems with stock retention schemes.

 We are working to ensure that a greater proportion of "value-added", including through processing, is retained in the developing country of origin.

 UK development assistance is provided to a significant number of coffee producing countries. More generally, the UK has supported the strengthening of agricultural research and extension systems over many years both nationally and internationally, including in coffee producing countries. At the developing country level, support to agricultural extension is being integrated into sector-wide reform programmes that receive support from multiple donors, for example in Ghana, Uganda and Mozambique. The UK is also a supporter of the Neuchatel Initiative, a multi-donor group established to achieve convergence on the objectives, methods and means of support for agricultural extension policies. The Neuchatel Group has produced studies on alternative financing mechanisms for agricultural extension involving public and private actors.

<a name="30519w02.html_para11">The decision to establish a co-operative, or indeed any other organised grouping of people, must be entirely voluntary and based on a shared commitment to particular ideals or objectives. Activities must be bound by agreed rules including those relating to the behaviour and conduct of members and accountability. The lessons from past experience, particularly of the state-led drive to establish co-operatives in Africa in the '70s, highlight the difficulties that can arise when decisions to form a co-operative are imposed by external agents. Having said that, UK development assistance lends support to a range of institutional arrangements as deemed appropriate.

<P>
<a name="30519w03.html_wqn0"><B> Jeremy Corbyn: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State for International Development what aid to Dalit people and their organisations <i>(a)</i> has been provided in India in each of the past five years and <i>(b)</i> is expected to be provided in 2003&#150;04.  [113521]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w03.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Department for International Development has increasingly focused its aid to support the Government of India in sustainably addressing poverty reduction and targeting the poorest. The Dalit people, who number about 170 million, are particularly disadvantaged. Much of the sectoral work in service provision, such as the DFID-supported Child Environment Programme in water and sanitation of UNICEF or the Urban Services for the Poor programmes in Kolkata and Andhra Pradesh, deliver aid to Dalit people. The District Primary Education Programme, which DFID has supported since 1998, and the Lok Jumbish primary education programme, which DFID has been funding for about four years, both have explicit budget lines on educational needs of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, particularly girls. Through such government programmes, DFID seeks to increase the potential for the far greater resources of the Government of India to address the needs of the poorest, including the Dalits.
<P>

<a name="30519w03.html_para0">In addition, DFID has a relatively small allocation to civil society organisations, which are required under Indian law to be registered under the Foreign Contributions Registration Act in order to receive foreign contributions. DFID, through its Civil Society Department, has supported a number of UK-based NGOs that work with empowering Dalits. More directly the Poorest Areas Civil Society programme works in most of the 100 poorest districts identified by a Government of India survey that included social criteria. These districts include high levels of Dalits and include many of the districts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The PACS programme has made grants to a number of organisations that address issues of discrimination against Dalits and more information on these grants can be obtained from the PACS website www.empowerpoor.org (e.g. grants 7 to "Chetna Vikas" and 8 to "Gramin Evam Nagar Vikas Parishad" among others). This is a new programme and the first grants were made in the UK financial year 2001&#150;02, but are mostly effective in 2002&#150;03 and subsequent years. 



<P>
<P><I>19 May 2003 : Column 516W</I><P>
DFID has also committed 65,000 to the Village Service Trust for four years from 2001&#150;05 for increasing political participation of socially marginalized groups in Theni District, particularly women and Dalits. The Department's support for ActionAid's "Fighting Poverty Together" corporate plan covers work with particularly discriminated groups, including Dalits. Through the Small Grants Scheme, operated by the British High Commission, a grant of &#163;11,000 was made in 1999&#150;2000 to "The Society of Depressed People for Social Justice" in Delhi, creating awareness on legal rights for Dalit women in various slum colonies in Delhi.
<P>

<a name="30519w03.html_para1">DFID has recently approved the District Health Management and Sector Reform Programme (for the State of Madhya Pradesh) which will invest &#163;18.4 million over the two years 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 and will seek to target health service provision "more effectively and equitably to address the needs of disadvantaged groups, particularly Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, other vulnerable communities and women".
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w03.html_wqn1"><B> Jeremy Corbyn: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State for International Development what consideration is given to the position of Dalit people in India when bilateral and multilateral aid programmes are considered by the Department for International Development.  [113522]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w03.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID's programme in India is primarily a bilateral partnership with the Government of India, which itself has a number of Centrally Sponsored Schemes that focus on disadvantaged groups. Recent estimates suggest that the administrative category of "Scheduled Caste", essentially Dalits, has about 9 per cent. higher levels of income poverty than the all-India average of 26.5 per cent. in 1999&#150;2000 and that other indicators also show poorer outcomes than average for Dalits. DFID's overall aim of reducing poverty through supporting appropriate government actions therefore addresses these inequalities of outcomes. DFID is seeking to analyse the non-income barriers to poverty reduction and ways of addressing these. Issues of discrimination against Dalits, Adivasis and Minorities are at the heart of social exclusion and poverty.
<P>

<a name="30519w03.html_para2">One way DFID seeks to address the position of Dalit peoples when considering bilateral aid is to build in an explicit focus on indicators such as educational or health outcomes for Dalit girls in annual and mid-term reviews of programmes, (even where these involve DFID funding for Government of India programmes, such as the Sarva Shikshya Abhyan primary education programme). To do this, DFID seeks to encourage the collection of disaggregated data that will permit such analysis. This has already been done through the earlier District Primary Education Programme, for example.
<P>

<a name="30519w03.html_para3">Developing the demand side for reform of services to be more accountable to, and responsive to the needs of, particular groups of the poor and, in particular, Dalits, requires support for their organisations and representatives to be directly involved in policy formulation and programme implementation and monitoring. DFID is looking at ways of supporting such constructive engagement with government.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the nature of the support intended by Commission Regulation (E2) 44/2003, 10th January, OJ L7 Vol 46, 11th January, with particular reference to combating fraud.  [112495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w05.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 This regulation relates to the export refund system&#151;a CAP market support measure intended to allow EU traders to sell competitively outside the Community. Under the export refund system, eligibility to refund is, in many cases, established when the exporter provides proof that the goods have been imported into a particular destination. In the UK, the export refund system is administered by the Rural Payments Agency which is an Executive Agency of DEFRA.
<P>

<a name="30519w05.html_para3">Investigations by the Commission's anti-fraud arm, OLAF, indicated widespread irregularities in the import of beef, veal and pigmeat products into the territory of the Russian Federation. These irregularities were thought to be attributable to the unreliability of documentation produced by the Russian customs authorities.




<P>
<P><I>19 May 2003 : Column 523W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30519w05.html_para4">Consequently, OLAF brokered an agreement with the Russian authorities. This was partly intended as an anti-fraud measure and partly in recognition of the problems EU traders were experiencing in obtaining proof of import.
<P>

<a name="30519w05.html_para5">This agreement was enacted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2584/2000. It established a mechanism for communicating information on the movement of goods between the EU and the Russian Federation. The mechanism made it possible for EU authorities to trace exports by road of the products concerned to the Russian Federation and, where appropriate, detect cases in which the requirements for the payment of export refund were not met.
<P>

<a name="30519w05.html_para6">The regulation was amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 44/2003. This extends the agreement, from 1 June 2003, to cover all types of transport. More importantly, it introduces a provision whereby a confirmation from the Russian authorities that the goods have arrived may be regarded as the primary proof of import for the payment.of export refund. Prior to the amendment, such a response could be considered only in conjunction with other supporting evidence. This new provision should ease the administrative burden on EU exporters and authorities while at the same time ensuring effective control of the export refund system.
<P>

<a name="30519w05.html_para7">The UK trade has been kept fully informed of developments in this regard via the Rural Payments Agency's Notices to Traders 1/01 and 36/03 (pertaining to Regulations 2584/2000 and 44/2003 respectively).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 29 April 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 308W, on nuclear waste, what contingency plans are in place to deal with future arisings of low level wastes that cannot be accommodated at Drigg.  [112456]

 The 2001 UK Radioactive Waste Inventory gives the time profile for generation of the 1,490,000m <sup>3</sup>  of low level waste referred to in my answer of 29 April 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 308W. This shows arisings of that waste during the period to 2120 with the majority being produced after 2070. For this reason the currently estimated life of the existing Drigg disposal facility is of the order of 50 years. The capacity of the site and its forecast life will be reviewed by the 



<P>
<P><I>19 May 2003 : Column 527W</I><P>
Environment Agency in light of safety cases provided by the site's operators, British Nuclear Fuels plc (BNFL). At some future point either extension of Drigg or the identification of another disposal site will be necessary. Further consideration can begin to be given to this once the outcome of the Environment Agency's review of the safety cases is known, around mid-2004. The outcome will provide vital information for consideration of disposal capacity, as well as providing a basis for the Agency's review of the Drigg disposal authorisation.

 Discrimination on the ground of pregnancy or maternity is a form of direct discrimination on the ground of sex. The courts have interpreted the Sex Discrimination Act as meaning that discrimination on the ground that a person is, or might become, pregnant is unlawful. The amended Equal Treatment Directive published on 5 October 2002 says that less favourable treatment on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity within the meaning of the Pregnant Workers Directive constitutes sex discrimination.

 As a result of the recommendations in the joint DCMS/Strategy Unit Report&#151;Game Plan&#151;and a Quinquennial Review, Sport England is undergoing a radical modernisation and restructuring programme which will turn it into a more strategic and customer focused body. Good progress is being made with the adoption of a new strategy for sport and new business plan by Sport England's Council with proposals for restructuring the organisation are well advanced.

 On 24 February 2003, the UK Film Council and Skillset launched "Developing UK Film Talent: A Comprehensive Skills Survey of the UK Film Industry", the most in-depth report ever on skills in the British film industry. Building on this work, a Film Skills Action Group has been convened, comprising representatives from across the industry, to deliver an industry training strategy by September 2003. I very much welcome this.

 My Department is working with other Government Departments and agencies to deliver a programme of positive activities for children and young people during the summer and other school holidays. The programme builds on the success of last year's Summer Splash and Summer Plus schemes, and aims to reduce youth offending, encourage children and young people to return to education or training and build community cohesions. The type of activities will vary according to local need, but will include arts and sports.

 In licensing civil aerodromes in the UK, the Civil Aviation Authority does not specify the type of aircraft that can operate from a particular aerodrome. Instead, it ensures that national and international operating and safety standards are complied with. These standards will be amended as necessary to reflect any relevant new characteristics of the next generation of civil aircraft, such as weight or size. Provided any amended standards were met it would be a matter for operators of next generation aircraft and the aerodrome licensee to be satisfied that the facilities and manning levels matched their requirements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 UK flight and duty time limitations are the responsibility of the Civil Aviation Authority. Their prime objective in setting such limits is to ensure that crew members are adequately rested at the beginning of each flying period and while flying are sufficiently free from fatigue so that they can operate to a satisfactory level of efficiency and safety. Any amendments to UK limitations will take that objective into account.
<P>

<a name="30519w10.html_para1">The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has reviewed the European Parliament's proposed flight time limitations (FTL) requirements. They advise me that, while the requirements are not totally acceptable, with suitable amendment they could form a baseline European FTL requirement which could be supplemented by additional requirements in each member state. We recognise the need for FTL requirements to be harmonised at a European level and should the proposal come before the Council we will work constructively with other member states to ensure that it is appropriately amended. We will not endorse the proposal if any of the limits are significantly different to those set by the CAA in CAP 371, which are in line with scientific advice that the CAA has received over the years.

<a name="30519w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 May 2003]:</i> The numbers of students studying for A2 and AS examinations are collected through the Department's Annual Schools Census (ASC) and the Learning and Skills Council's Individualised Learner Record (ILR). The ASC information is a snapshot as at the third Thursday in January of each year. The ILR is a snapshot as at 1 November of each year
<P>

<a name="30519w12.html_para1">In both these data sources, information is collected on all the qualifications a student is studying for. However students often combine qualifications. In the departmental publication on the participation of 16&#150;18 year olds, the figures are calculated on the basis of the highest qualification being studied. Part of this hierarchy of highest qualification is:

<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Special Educational Needs (SEN) Code of Practice gives statutory guidance to schools, local education authorities and others on assessing children's special educational needs and making provision to meet those needs, including the needs of children with autism.
<P>

<a name="30519w12.html_para5">Autism is a spectrum disorder with children across the spectrum showing the full range of intellectual abilities. Many children within the spectrum can, with the right support, achieve in National Curriculum assessments and external qualifications alongside their non-autistic peers. Special arrangements are available under the National Curriculum and from awarding bodies to allow children with SEN to take examinations and tests on an equal footing.
<P>

<a name="30519w12.html_para6">There are no assessment arrangements or qualifications that are specific to children and young people with autism or similar disabilities. However, there are a range of arrangements available for assessing the progress and recording the achievements of children with special educational needs, including those with autism, for whom the usual assessment arrangements and public examinations are not suitable. The Department, with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, has published guidance to help schools, including special schools, set targets for children with SEN who are performing below National Curriculum Level 1 or within Levels 1 and 2 in English, mathematics and science. The guidance contains Performance Criteria, the 'P' scales, which can be used to assess pupils' progress. Award schemes areavailable through which the key life skills of young people with SEN can be recognised and 'Progress Files' can be used to record their academic and non academic achievements. The Working Group on our 14&#150;19 reforms, under the chairmanship of Mike Tomlinson, will be looking at assessment arrangements and how they can be used to motivate all learners.
<P>

<a name="30519w12.html_para7">A primary aim of SEN support is that young people with SEN make successful transitions from school to further education, training and adult life. The revised SEN Code of Practice, effective from January 2002, contains strengthened transition planning arrangements involving the Connexions Service. In addition, under 



<P>
<P><I>19 May 2003 : Column 550W</I><P>
the Learning and Skills Act 2000, the Connexions Service, on behalf of the Secretary of State, must carry out assessments of all young people with statements of SEN who are in the last year of compulsory schooling and are intending to go on to further education or training or higher education and may carry out assessments in other circumstances. The assessments are of the young person's education and training needs and the provision required to meet those needs. The Learning and Skills Council must have regard to these assessments and the Connexions Service is expected to work with the Council and other providers to make suitable learning opportunities available to young people with SEN. Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 further and higher education and training providers must make reasonable adjustments to prevent discrimination against disabled students and potential students.
<P>

<a name="30519w12.html_para8">More generally, the Government is developing an SEN Action Programme of practical measures to support local education authorities and schools, working in partnership with others, in improving provision for children and young people with special educational needs.

<P>
<P>

 We currently have no plans to introduce ring-fenced funding in education for children with autism or for any other type of special educational need.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what action he is taking to address the implications for schools and colleges of the decision to reorganise British Sign Language, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> teacher supply, <i>(b)</i> validation and <i>(c)</i> funding issues.  [112849]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 While the Government has recognised British Sign Language as a language in its own right, we remain committed to preserving diversity and choice in relation to the different communication methods available for deaf and hearing impaired people. Children with hearing difficulties will continue to be taught in accordance with their and their parents' preferred style. Under the terms of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001, it is now unlawful for schools and further and higher education institutions to discriminate against disabled learners by treating them less favourably than others. In addition, institutions have a duty to provide reasonable adjustments to provision where people with disabilities might otherwise be substantially disadvantaged. The Government does not expect the statement of recognition to have any new implications for schools and colleges in relation to teacher supply, interaction between deaf children and others, or funding. We shall however be keeping all these issues under close review.
<P>

<a name="30519w12.html_para9">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is providing &#163;1 million to fund a discrete programme of initiatives to support the Government's statement of

<P>
<a name="30519w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend last met representatives of the Independent Schools Council (ISC) on 7 April. A range of issues were discussed, including the ISC's proposal that some looked after children could be educated in independent boarding schools, where that would be appropriate and beneficial to the young people concerned. No arrangement has yet been made to hold further meetings. We are actively considering how best to build on these productive discussions.

<a name="30519w13.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to the answer of 29 April 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 351W, on Command Paper 5778, which parts of the Children Act 1989 are failing to be implemented effectively in his Department as set out in paragraph 2.22 of Command Paper 5778.  [112184]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Paragraph 2.22 of Command Paper 5778 neither states nor implies that the Children Act 1989 is not being implemented effectively. As the then Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Hilary Benn) noted in the answer that he gave on 29 April, the Children Act is a shared responsibility across Government, and our aim, as set out in the Command Paper, is to increase the range of family support provisions that can be made available through the Children Act, as part of our response to tackling anti-social behaviour.

 The Department for Education and Skills will monitor the performance of each Academy against the targets in its School Development Plan and against national trends for schools with similar characteristics. A wider evaluation of the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and impact of the Academies Programme is being undertaken by the University of York in partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers. This exercise will run to September 2007.

 The available information for the years since 1994, showing students accepted to full-time undergraduate courses via the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) is given in the table. UCAS does not cover students applying to part-time courses, the majority of whom are mature. Around three-quarters of all mature students enter part-time courses. Comparable figures for earlier years are not held centrally. In 2002, a new socio-economic classification was introduced, which is not directly comparable with the social class figures for previous years. The Department has increased significantly its targeted support for mature students, through increased Access and Hardship funds but also through a package of help for student parents including a generous childcare grant introduced in 2001. In addition, the AimHigher HE roadshow and advertising campaign have been launched to promote the benefits of higher education.

 Our White Paper 'The Future of Higher Education' acknowledged the critical involvement of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in regional, social and economic development. It welcomed the involvement of HEIs in developing Regional Economic Strategies and the new Frameworks for Regional Employment and Skills Action. The White Paper proposed strengthening the growing HE partnerships with Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) and confirmed a larger formal role for RDAs within the next round of the Higher Education Innovation Fund to ensure that the funding is properly focused on regional development priorities.

 Three mainstream secondary schools in North Yorkshire are eligible for the new LeadershipIncentive Grant which began in April 2003. Each school will receive &#163;125,000 for each of the next three years, plus &#163;50,000 partnership funding per year, providing these schools with significant additional resources to raise standards, strengthen leadership at all levels and enable collaborative working. Eligible schools will be expected to revise their School Development Plan in the light of the additional funding, and, as a condition of funding, to work together to draw up a collaborative plan setting out their shared priorities. For schools such as these in North Yorkshire which are outside Excellence in Cities areas, Education Action Zones and Excellence Clusters and which are eligible for the funding, LEAs will be responsible for approving these collaborative plans.

<a name="30519w15.html_para2">The Quality Assurance Agency is responsible for safeguarding the standards and quality of the foundation degree as a higher education qualification. Employers and employer organisations are being involved in foundation degree design and development to ensure that qualifications meet professional standards and workplace needs. 50 per cent. of students currently studying for foundation degrees are part-time. A new promotion campaign to be launched later this year will continue to promote the message to both students and employers alike of the quality of foundation degrees and of the flexible modes of study available.

 Credit systems which make it possible to break off and start again without having to repeat learning are increasingly important for part time learners in higher education.

We are building on the potential of e-learning to offer interactive, individualised learning at the pace, place and level most suited to the learner.

 All local education authorities (LEAs) with operational Schools PFI schemes contribute towards the costs of these schemes. Funding from this Department is intended to meet the capital repayment element of the unitary charge. LEAs must meet the facilities management element. They do this by recouping some of the funds which would otherwise have been devolved for this purpose to schools involved in the project, and by using their own resources.

<a name="30519w15.html_para6">The contract for a Schools PFI scheme is usually between the LEA and the contractor. The DfES is not a party to the contract, so we are not aware of the unitary charge that the LEA would have agreed to pay each year. The size of the charge will of course be dependent on the overall value of the contract, however, a number of checks are put in place during the procurement process to try to ensure that LEAs agree deals that are affordable and offer good value for money.

 The Department has issued no advice specifically to schools in the London Borough of Havering about the number of hours of physical education that should be taught to GCSE pupils or the setting of homework tasks for GCSE pupils. Both are determined at local school level.

To this end, the DfES and DCMS are working with a range of partners to deliver an ambitious Public Service Agreement target to ensure that, by 2006, 75 per cent. of all pupils will receive two hours per week of high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum. Delivery of this target is supported by Government investment of &#163;459 million over the next three years.

This gives advice to schools and parents on issues relating to school uniform. The Secretary of State for Education and Skills recently confirmed his support for school uniform when he announced the results of our school uniform survey. He welcomed the results as they confirmed that the majority of parents were in favour of uniform and think it can contribute to improved behaviour and standards.

<P>
<a name="30519w16.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 We said in the White Paper, "The Future of Higher Education", that graduates enjoy different returns from different courses and according to the institution attended. Recent research found a 44 percentage point difference in average returns between graduates from institutions at the two extremes of the graduate pay scale. No specific estimates have been made of the distribution of lifetime earnings premia by type of course or institution attended, for either first-degree graduates or post-graduates. However, we will be publishing research evidence later this year on how lifetime earnings premia might differ according to institution attended.
<P>

<a name="30519w16.html_para6">Academic research on graduate returns at a point in time shows that while higher education is a good investment for the average graduate, returns do vary according to degree subject. External research also indicates that graduate earnings vary according to the institution attended. These findings suggest that graduate lifetime earnings differentials may be influenced by degree subject and institution attended.

It also consults representatives of the banks, the Post Office, retailers and the vending machine industry. The subject to feature on a new coin is approved by the Queen on the recommendation of the Chancellor in his capacity as Master of the Mint. Once the choice of subject has been decided, the Royal Mint Advisory Committee invites coin designers and artists to submit designs. The Advisory Committee recommends its preferred choice to the Chancellor for him to seek the approval of the Queen if he is content.
<P>

<a name="30519w17.html_para3">Choosing the design of Bank of England banknotes is the responsibility of the Bank of England itself. The Bank consults with the Royal National Institute of the Blind. Exemplars of new notes are sent to the manufacturers of vending machines that accept banknotes, and are also offered to the commercial banks and the Post Office. Retailers are informed in advance of the new note.
<P>

<a name="30519w17.html_para4">Consultation on new stamp designs takes place with the independent Stamp Advisory Committee, which includes representatives from the Department of Trade and Industry and the Royal Mail Board. New designs are submitted to the Queen for approval.

<a name="30519w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 As the Chancellor made clear in his Budget speech the Treasury review of the inflation target is being examined from a monetary policy perspective.

<a name="30519w18.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Generally the International Court for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) arbitration relates solely to the claim being considered, and need not have any bearing on how commercial debt should be treated under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) more widely, which primarily focuses on the cancellation of debt acquired through borrowing, and not with claims that might arise from the possibly illegal appropriation of assets.
<P>

 The majority of Territorial Army medical personnel are serving with either 34 Field Hospital (34 Fd Hosp) or 202 Volunteer Field Hospital (202 (V) Fd Hosp). On current plans, 34 Fd Hosp personnel should return to the United Kingdom by the end of May 2003. 202 (V) Fd Hosp personnel will be released from theatre through a staged process beginning in the next few weeks. It is hoped that all should have returned by the end of July 2003. There are some additional singleton appointments undertaken by medical personnel who will leave theatre as and when their parent Regular unit leaves theatre. TA personnel will be able to return to their employment with the national health service once they have been through the demobilisation process and taken their post operational tour leave which is commensurate with the period of their mobilised service.

 Files opened by the Human Organs Inquiry, including those containing correspondence with relatives, were placed in the Public Records Office for Northern Ireland when the inquiry completed its work in May 2002. They are currently held under a 30-year seal, which was applied to the documents to safeguard the privacy of all those involved. The Public Records Office will consider requests for documents held under seal. Where a member of the public wants to see a record that is closed, an application should be made in writing to the Public Records Office who in turn will arrange for the appropriate authority to be contacted on their behalf. Every request will be considered on its own merits.

<P>
<a name="30519w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The proposed new pay system for non-medical staff in the national health service, "Agenda for Change", has been designed to ensure fair pay and conditions of service and is underpinned by equal pay principles. Negotiators representing the four United Kingdom Health Departments, NHS employers and 17 NHS staff organisations successfully concluded talks on the package of pay modernisation proposals in November 2002. The Department of Health published full details of the proposed agreement on 3 March 2003. Copies are available in the Library.

 If the proposed new national health service pay system, "Agenda for Change", is ratified following consultation by staff organisations, we intend that those NHS organisations chosen as prospective NHS foundation trusts will become early implementer sites.

 We are aware that the summer months can cause particular problems for patients with asthma because of factors such as high pollen counts. This phenomenon is however, well understood by both clinicians and patients so we do not feel that specific extra guidance is needed to help manage this. Patients with asthma are able to access the full range of national health service support services in both primary and secondary care settings throughout the entire year.

These will illustrate how the standards should be applied to ensure that services delivered to children are effective and meet their needs.

<a name="30519w25.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 As part of its evaluation programme on Disability Equipment, the Medical Devices Agency, now the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, published a report on bed safety equipment in February 2002&#151;EL8 "Bed Safety Equipment&#151;An Evaluation"; ISBN 1&#150;84182&#150;568&#150;9.

The report concluded that covers for bed rails are primarily used to prevent impact injuries. They will not necessarily reduce the risk of entrapment and should not, therefore, be regarded as a means to prevent entrapment.

In addition, the MRC has just announced funding for two trials that will look at the effectiveness of various treatments for CFS/ME. The results of these trials will help patients and their doctors to choose the best treatment.

However, a &#163;200 million PFI scheme has started on the procurement route when it despatched a contract for publication in the "Official Journal of the European Communities" in November 2002. Part of this development at the Pontefract General Infirmary will involve a purpose-designed ambulatory care and diagnostic centre, together with an accident and emergency unit, specialist rehabilitation facilities, and a midwife-led maternity unit.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) whether there will be a common UK position on the definition of unreasonable periods of delay for treatment within the NHS, as phrased in the European Court of Justice ruling on treatment of patients abroad; and if he will make a statement;  [109877]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w29.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 'Undue delay' is a term used in Netherlands' national law, which was considered by the European Court of Justice in case C157/99 Geraets-Smits/Peerbooms. The Court did not define what it meant by 'undue delay', by implication leaving that a matter for determination by the member state in question.

<a name="30519w29.html_para0">If an application for treatment elsewhere in the European Economic Area or Switzerland is made on grounds of delay by patients resident in England, Scotland or Wales under the referral scheme in Regulation (EEC) 1408/71, the Department takes account of the national targets for waiting times as published in England, Scotland and Wales and of the individual patient's clinical need. Applications in Northern Ireland are authorised by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and take account of similar considerations.

<a name="30519w29.html_para1">A further European Court of Justice judgment was published on 13 May 2003 in case C385/99 Muller-Faure/Van Riet. The Department is considering its position in the light of that judgment, in consultation with the Devolved Administrations.

 Our document, "Improvement, Expansion and Reform", which sets for the national health service a priorities and planning framework for 2003&#150;06, makes clear that implementation of the older people's national service framework is a top priority, and that the 2004 milestone around specialist stroke services is a key target.
<P>

<a name="30519w30.html_para0">There have been significant increases in the number of stroke physicians, the proportion of patients being treated in specialist stroke units and the number of patients returning home following hospital treatment. There have been important improvements in care. For example, 83 per cent. of patients are receiving brain scans to improve diagnosis, which is more than ever before, and over the last four years, the proportion of hospitals with specialist stroke units has gone up from 45 per cent. to 73 per cent. We also know that 83 per cent. of the hospitals already now have plans to have a specialist stroke service in place by April 2004.

We are also promoting the establishment of "design champions" at both regional and local level and are working with the construction industry to develop the Design Quality Indicator (DQI) system that was launched in July 2002. Government planning policies have for some time made it clear that when submitting planning proposals applicants should be able to demonstrate how they have taken account of the need for good design. PPG1 "General Policy and Principles", for example, underlines that "good design should be the aim of all those involved in the development process and should be encouraged everywhere". The policy is supported by good practice guidance, "By Design". The Government will restate its commitment to good design when it updates PPG1.

 I announced on 10 February this year a substantial increase in Government funding for the disabled facilities grant budget for England. The increase to &#163;99 million will be for each of the next three years.

 Subject to Parliament's approval of the provisions in the local government Bill, it is the Government's intention that the European parliamentary elections, Greater London Authority elections and the English local elections in 2004 will be combined.

As indicated in the consultation paper 'Combining English Local Authority, Greater London Authority and European Parliament Elections in 2004' announced to the House in October 2002, the Government is currently considering very carefully whether we should hold pilots at the proposed combined elections in 2004.

 The recent review of the 1:25 000 OS Explorer map series specification by Ordnance Survey has been conducted with an extensive consultation with users.

At that time the consequences would be of removing outline planning permission will be considered. Full consultation will take place before removing outline planning permission.

 As at November 2002 there were 18,700 pensioners receiving a key benefit in the Amber Valley constituency. 5,000 people are aged 80 and over and if they are entitled to a winter fuel payment from this winter, they will also be entitled to the additional payment announced in the Budget. There were 8,400 people aged 75 and over receiving a key benefit who would therefore be eligible to receive a free TV licence. 2,800 people received an average weekly minimum income guarantee of &#163;43.34.

1. Forecasts for 2003&#150;04, 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 consistent with Budget 2003 DWP benefit expenditure forecasts, and published in the DWP 2003 Departmental Report.<P>

2. Expenditure for 2002&#150;03 reflects the latest benefit-by-benefit estimate of outturn, and not the amounts voted by Parliament.<P>

3. Includes all spending on pensioners including that outside the departmental objective to "Combat poverty and promote security and independence in retirement for today's and tomorrow's pensioners".<P>

4. Widow's/bereavement benefits and incapacity benefit paid to pensioners are included in the Retirement Pensions spending.<P>

5. All numbers are on a Great Britain basis except over 75 TV licences which also includes Northern Ireland.<P>

6. Pensioner spending on income related benefits and winter fuel payments includes payments to men aged 60&#150;64.<P>

7. Housing benefit and council tax benefit spending (included in income-related benefits) covers benefits paid to pensioners, regardless of whether the payments are funded by DWP, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister or the Welsh Assembly Government (and predecessor Departments), or from local authorities' general funds.<P>

8. Figures for 1999&#150;2000 onwards are on a Resource Accounting and Budgeting basis. Previous years' figures are on a cash basis, but the impact of the change is unlikely to be significant.<P>

<a name="30519w34.html_para0">We have no plans at present to introduce an 'autism compact' with employers. However, we recognise that the employment needs of people with disabilities vary and we have been working with the National Autistic Society to improve our understanding of how best to help people with autism find and keep jobs. In addition, Disability Employment Advisers within Jobcentre Plus provide support to disabled people facing complex barriers to work and help employers develop good recruitment policies. They can offer help to disabled people with finding work and can refer them, where appropriate, to occupational health assessments training and the full range of Jobcentre Plus disability programmes.

This is a work based development programme that aims to provide disabled people with their first step into a chosen career. As part of this programme we currently have two graduates on six month placements.

 My ministerial colleagues and I meet hon. Members from all political parties from time to time to discuss various issues which concern the work of the Department for Work and Pensions. To establish the exact cost of hospitality supplied specifically to Labour MPs, we would need to examine the diaries of all our Ministers for the last 12 months. This would enable us to identify any meetings where Labour MPs were present and only then could we establish what, if any, hospitality was provided. Understandably, this information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 It is not possible to estimate precisely the total number of women part-time workers who might be affected by the European Court of Justice ruling on access to occupational pension schemes. About 60,000 claims were originally lodged with Employment Tribunals and aspects of the Court rulings are still awaiting clarification. Some claims have been struck out because they were lodged too late; while other part-time workers could still make claims.
<P>

<a name="30519w34.html_para9">In order to be successful, claims have to be lodged in time (ie while the individual is in work or within six months of leaving employment with the relevant employer); it has to be accepted that the part-time worker's exclusion from the particular scheme amounted to indirect sex discrimination; and agreement has been made regarding the appropriate rates of contributions to be paid in respect of the claim.
<P>

 The Government are fully committed to tackling anti-Semitism and racism generally wherever it occurs.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 28 April 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 64W, whether the research study on mandatory drug testing will be assessing the impact of the time that the different types of drug tested for stay in the system on <i>(a)</i> prisoner attitudes to drug taking and <i>(b)</i> the class and type of drug consumed in prisons by prisoners with (i) a history and (ii) no history of Class A drug offences.

<P>
<a name="30519w35.html_spnew7"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The research study considered all of these issues. Patterns, causes and effects of drug taking are, however, complex and analysis of the research findings may not prove straightforward.

 Recorded crime figures do not include details of whether drugs are an aggravating factor in offences, for example for burglary or robbery. Information on the number of recorded drug offences are available only at police force level. This information is not published at Basic Command Unit, or Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership level.

<a name="30519w35.html_para10">There was a change in counting rules for recorded crime on 1 April 1998, which would have the tendency to increase the number of offences counted. Prior to April 1998, the only drug offences recorded were 'Trafficking in controlled drugs', which were recorded within the Other Offences Group. After this date the Home Office Counting Rules were revised and expanded to include the additional drug categories of 'Possession of controlled drugs', and 'Other drug offences'. Numbers of offences for years before and after this date, and figures calculated from them, are therefore not directly comparable.
<P>

<a name="30519w35.html_para11">As a result of some police forces adopting the principles of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) prior to its national introduction across England and Wales on 1 April 2002, percentages given for 2000&#150;01 or 2001&#150;02 may not be comparable with other years.

<i>[holding answer 16 May 2003]:</i> The purpose of the mapping exercise is to determine the extent to which faith bodies with a national remit represent their respective faith communities, so that Government Departments can be confident that they are approaching the most appropriate organisations in future consultations.

<P>

<a name="30519w36.html_para1">However, a number of Councils of Sikh Gurdwaras from areas with large Sikh populations have been included, since we recognise that such Councils can often represent the views of the Sikh community at a national level.

<i>[holding answer 16 May 2003]:</i> Members of the working group were selected either as representatives of Government Departments with a particular interest in consulting the faith communities, or as individuals from the faith communities with significant personal experience of having been involved in such consultations by Government. The need to restrict the group to manageable size meant that only one such individual could be included from each of the five largest faith communities, as well as two further members to represent the Black-led Churches and the smaller faith communities.

<a name="30519w36.html_spnew7"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme (ISSP) is the toughest community intervention for persistent young offenders. ISSP is being evaluated by Oxford University who will report in March 2004. It does not have a separate reconviction target but we do expect it to contribute to delivery of our new overall Public Service Agreement target of reducing juvenile re-offending by five per cent. by March 2006 compared to 2000.

 The French Government first submitted a request for Mr. Auchi's extradition in December 2000. There followed a number of detailed but otherwise routine exchanges with French authorities about matters raised in the extradition request. The Secretary of State decided on 18 March to issue his authority to proceed in the case. Mr. Auchi was arrested on 31 March. He has since submitted himself voluntarily to the French courts.

 Between September 2000 and October 2001, the Home Office received a number of representations on Mr. Auchi's behalf. In the main, these were to the effect that the Secretary of State should decline to issue his authority to proceed in respect of any extradition request he might receive.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what reasons underlie his policy that officers of adjacent police forces carrying out the same duties and responsibilities may receive different levels of remuneration.  [112437]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w36.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Special Priority Payment (SPP) Scheme, under which extra rewards may be paid to officers in the most difficult and demanding posts, was agreed by all parties in the Police Negotiating Board (PNB) as part of a ground-breaking package of reforms to police pay and conditions of service. The parties in PNB include representatives of the Association of Chief Police Officers, of police authorities and of the Police Federations. PNB decided that posts might qualify for a SPP where they: carry a significantly higher responsibility level than the norm for the rank; or present particular difficulties in recruitment or retention; or have specially demanding working conditions or working environments.
<P>

<a name="30519w36.html_para8">PNB agreed that chief constables and police authorities should draw up a local scheme of payments in line with the national criteria. This was because PNB believed that the chief constable and police authority were best placed to decide locally which posts in their force met the national criteria. Consequently, the decision as to which posts in a given force qualify for a SPP is for the chief constable and the police authority, not for the Secretary of State. Where, therefore, a post qualifies for payment in one force but not in an adjacent force, it is due to the decision of the chief constables and police authorities of the forces concerned.
<P>

<a name="30519w36.html_para9">All federated ranks officers, regardless of whether they get a special priority payment, received an increase in basic pay of at least &#163;402 from 1 April. This increase comes on top of the annual police pay award this September.

 There are no current plans to market test prisons in England or Wales. The Prison Service has, however, set up a programme of performance testing under which under-performing public sector prisons are required to deliver improvements. Failure to deliver improvements may ultimately lead to the prisons being contracted out to the private sector in a competition without a Prison Service in-house bid. Two prisons have been awarded service level agreements (Reading and Leicester) and two are being performance tested at present (Dartmoor and Liverpool); two more will be performance tested later in 2003 and a further six in 2004.

 In its White Paper, Justice for All (CM 5563) the Government said that they were developing a national strategy that would consider the availability of restorative justice across all age groups and all stages in the criminal process. The Prison Service, in conjunction with the National Probation Service, and other stakeholders, is contributing to the development of that strategy. The Government will issue a consultation document on the development of Restorative Justice in the criminal justice system during the summer.
<P>

<a name="30519w37.html_para2">While awaiting the results of the consultation the Prison Service will continue to support the diverse range of restorative practices that are already taking place within prisons. The Prison Service is participating in Home Office funded pilot projects under the Crime Reduction programme which are testing the effectiveness of restorative justice at different stages, from caution through to custodial sentences. The final reconviction studies will be produced at the end of 2005 and these results will play an important role in the development of the long-term restorative justice strategy. Outside the pilots, direct victim-offender mediation work is taking place in a small number of prisons, victim awareness courses are also taking place

<a name="30519w38.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Home Office publishes an annual Car Theft Index showing which models and makes of car are most at risk of being stolen in England, Scotland and Wales. The following tables are based on data used to construct the Car Theft Indices published in 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002. No such index was published in 1998. The 2003 Index will be published towards the end of this year.

<a name="30519w38.html_wqn1"><B> Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what percentage of victims of crime for which an offender is brought to trial are informed of <i>(a)</i> the date of the trial and <i>(b)</i> the outcome of the trial.  [112105]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w38.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 No statistics are gathered on the percentage of victims of crime who are kept informed of the trial date and outcome of the trial. The 1996 Victim's Charter states that, if a victim chooses, the police will give them this information. There are pilots taking place, or planned, in several parts of the country to establish better ways in which the police and the Crown Prosecution Service can keep victims better informed and to provide better services to them generally.
<P>

<a name="30519w38.html_para2">One of our 2001 manifesto commitments was to legislate for a Victims of Crime Bill during the course of this Parliament. The Bill, which will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows, is likely to include a statutory victims' Code of Practice to replace the Victim's Charter. The Code will place some 70 to 80 obligations on criminal justice agencies to deliver specific services to victims and within prescribed deadlines. The obligations will include the police informing victims of trial dates and their outcomes. If the obligations in the Code are not delivered, victims will have an avenue of complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. We plan also to legislate for a Commissioner for victims, not only to oversee the effectiveness of the Code and protect victims' needs within the criminal justice system as a whole, but also to promote their interests across Government more widely, in areas such as, for example, health, housing and social security.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what further measures are planned to reduce the reconviction rate of young offenders in <i>(a)</i> the UK and <i>(b)</i> the Jarrow constituency.  [111671]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w38.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 For England and Wales we have made a number of proposals on juvenile offenders in the Criminal Justice Bill and the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill both of which are under consideration by this House. We believe these will help to strengthen the youth justice system's work to reduce reconvictions which is already showing good results. Our most recent results, published in February this year for offenders dealt between January and March 2001, show a 22.5 per cent. reduction in reconvictions compared to 1997. In addition, we plan to publish further proposals in the next few months new proposals in a Children's Green Paper. Youth justice in Scotland and Northern Ireland do not fall within my responsibility.
<P>

<a name="30519w38.html_para4">These proposals will apply in the same way to Jarrow as to other areas. However I understand a local Youth Crime Prevention Strategy Group has been established. It is carrying out a Young People and Crime Audit which will help the development of a future local strategy.

 The Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA) held 8,399 bail hearings in 2002; and 1,494 between January and March 2003. Outcomes on the IAA database show that 57 per cent. were granted, 22 per cent. refused and 14 per cent. withdrawn in 2002: between January and March 2003, the figures were 58 per cent., 22 per cent. and 15 per cent. respectively. No record is kept on the proportion of applications for the same individual.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department pursuant to her answer of 8 April 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 125&#150;26W, on departmental pay, if she will place copies of her forthcoming action plans in the Library.  [112318]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w39.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 It is anticipated that action plans relating to equality audits of pay and related systems in the Lord Chancellor's Department, and the other departments, and non-departmental public bodies for which the Lord Chancellor is responsible, will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses in due course, following discussion with the Cabinet Office.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what assessment she has made of regional variations in staff turnover in the Department.  [112755]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w39.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Staff turnover is reviewed on an on-going basis. For the year ending 31 March 2003 the turnover rate of the total workforce was 8.63 per cent. compared to 10.60 per cent. for the previous year. This reduction was reflected across all regions (apart from Wales where the rate increased slightly from 8 per cent. to 8.8 per cent.) due to a number of transfers to other Government Departments. The north west has the lowest turnover rate at 6 per cent. London has the highest rate, at 11 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30519w39.html_para0">Resignations remain the highest single factor for leaving and this is consistent across all regions followed by transfers to other Government departments and retirements. There is no single factor behind the reasons for resigning.

<P>
(5) when the Department last reviewed the National Land Information System business plan; and what assessment she has made of the viability of its future operations.  [114370]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30519w39.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The National Land Information Service (NLIS) is ultimately intended to be a one stop electronic shop for information about land and property in England and Wales. It was developed and piloted in the 1990s by a group of public sector bodies led by the Land Registry. The work was then taken forward by the Local Government Information House Limited (LGIH), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Improvement and Development Agency.
<P>

<a name="30519w39.html_para1">NLIS is now financially independent and receives no state aid. It comprises LGIH; a hub operated by Macdonald Dettwiler Associates (MDA); and three competing service channels, operated by NLIS Searchflow, Transaction Online and TM NLIS Search respectively. There is no NLIS board. Central Government were not a party to the contract and licence negotiations between LGIH and the hub and channel service providers and are not a party to NLIS now.
<P>

<a name="30519w39.html_para2">Following criticism of the governance arrangements for NLIS in the Quinquennial Review of the Land Registry in June 2001, a Central Government Stakeholder Group (CGSG), chaired by the Land Registry, was set up to provide such assistance as central Government could to help NLIS become an established feature of the conveyancing process and to provide a means of communication between the NLIS partners and those stakeholders. We are reviewing the role of the CGSG. But the operation or governance of NLIS, the business plans of the NLIS service providers and their future viability are not matters for government. Any questions of possible infringement of competition law should be pursued with the Office of Fair Trading in the normal way. The Government continue to encourage local authorities to transfer their land and property information to electronic local land and property gazetteers so as to improve access to information.
<P>

<a name="30519w39.html_para3">Since September 2001, when the commercial NLIS service was launched, neither I nor my ministerial colleagues at the Lord Chancellor's Department have received any external advice on the operation of NLIS or any representations from local authorities about its operation. In the same period, we have received a small number of letters from Members of Parliament and others commenting on a range of matters relating to the operation of NLIS.

 Public funding for the civil courts is available to applicants provided that the case is within the scope of the Community Legal Service scheme and that they satisfy the Legal Services Commission's means and merits tests for funding.
<P>

<a name="30519w39.html_para4">Families bereaved by the Potters Bar rail crash have the same access to public funding as others wishing to bring, defend, or be party to, civil proceedings. Individual claims would be expected to be pursued privately if the claimant's means exceed the financial eligibility criteria for public funding. However, the Commission also has discretion to waive the upper financial eligibility limit in order to fund a case where funding relates to the generic issues in a multi-party action, where there is likely to be a significant wider public interest in doing so.

 My noble and learned Friend, the Lord Chancellor, regards Queen's Counsel as a working rank within the profession. Only lawyers who have, and are entitled to exercise, full rights of audience in the High Court or Crown Court, and who regularly appear as advocates in appropriate courts and tribunals, are eligible to apply for appointment. He also recommends to Her Majesty the Queen the appointment of a small number of lawyers who are not in private practice, but who have made a significant contribution to the law, as Queen's Counsel 'honoris causa', a purely honorary appointment.
