 In the light of the European Commission rejection of the UK case for an emergency closure of the pelagic pair trawl fishery for bass in the Western Channel, which was copied to Fisheries Directors of all member states, I announced that the UK would introduce a prohibition on the UK fishery within 12 miles of the south west coast of England. I intend to put a request to the European Commission to have the 12 mile prohibition applied to vessels from other member states operating in this area. In practice, other than UK vessels, the ban would only impact on a small number of French vessels who pair trawl for bass in the 12 mile area. I have passed in person a letter to the French Minister setting out the UK case and seeking his support for the prohibition. Officials have also discussed the measures with their French colleagues at a recent Commission meeting on this issue.

 We take very seriously the need to conserve fish stocks, and thus provide a good basis for a viable fishing industry. We continue to believe that managing fish stocks on the basis of precautionary reference points designed to keep biomass and fishing mortality well away from levels at which stocks risk collapse is the best way to proceed. The precautionary principle is an integral part of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) but the commitment of the member states and the Commission is required to make sure it is applied. It also underpins the advice produced by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea in which the UK participates.

 Prior to the start of the Supporting People programme in April 2003, Supporting People teams were set up by local authorities, with a remit to drive forward the programme. The Supporting People teams are responsible for the day to day administration of the programme which includes the service review programme and ensuring all stakeholders are kept informed and consulted. The teams also facilitate the development of the Supporting People five-year strategy; identifying local strategic priorities and highlighting gaps in provision. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has allocated administration grants to administering authorities to contribute towards staff and IT costs of the Supporting People teams in delivering the programme.

<a name="stpa_55">Supporting People is a local programme delivered through local partnerships with local government, probation, housing, social services, service providers and users. Local authorities are responsible for deciding which department takes the lead for Supporting People and how work is divided between county and districts. The Supporting People teams should, therefore, forge links with the appropriate commissioning managers (including social services), and social services should be an active partner on the core strategic group and commissioning body.

 The levels of per capita spend on health in many low income countries are pitifully low, often government expenditure may be as little as US$5 per capita annually. DFID works with many countries to highlight the contribution of better health to development, advocates for increased allocations, and supports efforts to strengthen health systems and use available funds more effectively to deal with the major causes of ill health, disability and death. Health needs more resources, both from domestic revenue and through major increases in donor funding. However decisions on budget allocations across sectors are the responsibility of sovereign governments. Allocations will increase as economies grow wealthier. That requires more rapid progress on increasing aid volumes, in dealing with debt and in ensuring fairer trade regime.

Under the terms of the Spending Review 2004, total UK official development assistance (oda) will rise from &#163;4.14 billion in 2004&#150;05 to &#163;6.46 billion by 2007&#150;08, The UK is making progress towards the UN 0.7 per cent. target for official development assistance (oda) as a proportion of gross national income. On current plans this will rise to 0.39 per cent. in 2005&#150;06 and 0.47 per cent. in 2007&#150;08, and this represents a real terms increase in UK oda of 140 per cent. since 1997. The Government wishes to continue to raise UK oda at the rate of growth achieved in 2007&#150;08 in the aid ratio, which on this timetable would rise beyond 0.5 per cent. after 2008 and reach 0.7 per cent. by 2013. The UK has proposed an International Financing Facility (IFF), designed to deliver an additional US$50 billion annually in aid in the period to 2015. The UK, and France, will demonstrate the practicality of the IFF by launching the

 I am not aware that the US Administration has made a formal offer on debt relief to the Government of Sudan at this time. In common with other creditor countries including the UK, DFID would expect the US to extend debt relief to Sudan through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative once a Comprehensive Peace Agreement is in place and the situation in Darfur has improved. The UK Government, together with our G7 colleagues, goes beyond the requirements of the HIPC Initiative and writes off 100 per cent. of all bilateral debts for HIPC countries when they qualify. DFID also plans to assist Sudan in the process of normalising its relations with the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) through chairing a Support Group focused on clearing arrears to the IFIs.

Insecurity continues to be the main constraint on delivery. For example, the recent attack on Save the Children which killed two of their staff on 12 December, led to their humanitarian operations in South Darfur being suspended. We continue to work urgently with the AU and others in the international community to address the security situation both through protection measures on the ground and pressure on all parties to use the political process in Abuja to resolve the issues underlying the conflict.

They have directly intervened in some areas to defuse tensions and have secured the release of some hostages. DFID is working with other donors to ensure the AU has the support it needs.

 The provision in the National Lottery Bill which alters the basis on which investment earnings on the National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF) balance are shared between distributing bodies may have some effect on the Heritage Lottery Fund&#039;s (HLF&#039;s) income.

 Ofgem has now announced its conclusions on its investigation into gas price increases in 2003 and 2004. It has concluded that the main causes of rising UK gas prices are high oil prices feeding into gas prices and declining UK gas supplies. Ofgem is taking two courses of action. It is asking the European Commission to put more resources into making gas competition work, and is continuing to examine why some UK gas supplies did not reach the market.

<a name="stpa_131">While the cost of gas to industry has been rising recently, this should be seen in the context of historical trends. In real terms gas prices for industrial users in 2003 were nearly 30 per cent. below their level in 1990 and well below their average over the last 30 years.

 Manufacturing in the region is a complex picture with DTI and its partners providing a wide range of support. In 2002, the regional development agency for the West Midlands, Advantage West Midlands (AWM), produced a strategy for manufacturing, aimed at modernising skills and the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Dec 2004 : Column 1279W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
various supply chains within the region to help its long-term future. Some initiatives we are supporting to take forward this strategy are:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">Giving &#163;37 million towards the setting up of an International Automotive Research Centre in partnership with Ford&#039;s Premier Automotive Group and Warwick University.

</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">As part of AWM&#039;s Modernisation Programme, the &#039;Accelerate&#039; Programme, with support from Europe, offers further help to automotive suppliers in the region. Up until 2003, over 1,500 companies have been assisted with advice on production efficiencies and best practice resulting in over 16,000 jobs being created and safeguarded. 16 companies in the Hodge Hill constituency are currently participating in the programme.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">AWM&#039;s diversification programme also helps companies with new product development, improving business processes, supporting start-ups and improving access to finance. Its initial target to assist 800 businesses in the region by March 2005 has already been exceeded.</p>

Based in Wolverhampton, it has assisted over 900 businesses so far (against a three year target of 1,050) including 31 in the Hodge Hill constituency. As a result, over 70 per cent. of businesses invested money on improving their businesses. Nationally, manufacturing has been boosted by over &#163;53 million as a result of MAS activities with an average of &#163;100,000 added value to each participating manufacturer.</p>

<sup>(14)</sup> Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999&#150;2000.<br>

<sup>(15)</sup> 1999&#150;2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DfES. 2002&#150;03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the dotted line.<br>

<sup>(16)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>

<sup>(17)</sup> The 2002&#150;03 school based expenditure calculation is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001&#150;02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses, while in 2002&#150;03 only the schools element of these categories is included. In 2001&#150;02 this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil of the England total, while the schools element of these categories accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the England total in 2002&#150;03. Also, for some LEAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LEA part of the form in 2002&#150;03 and would therefore be excluded, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>

<sup>(18)</sup> The combined LEA and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LEA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LEA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and ail elements of central LEA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). A sector breakdown for combined LEA and school based expenditure is not available in 2002&#150;03.<br>

<sup>(19)</sup> Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within the primary and pre-primary sectors and are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census. For 1999&#150;2000 onwards, the combined LEA and school based expenditure for pre-primary also includes private voluntary independent (PVI) under five pupil numbers drawn from the Early Years Census. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(20)</sup> Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99.<br>

<sup>(21)</sup> The 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of grant maintained schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

<sup>(22)</sup> School based expenditure in nursery schools was not recorded in 2002&#150;03.<br>

Note: Figures are reported in cash terms and rounded to the nearest &#163;10 as reported by the LEA.<br>

 If a school wishes to expand its physical capacity by 25 per cent., or by 27 places annually, it must consult interested parties in the area and then publish details of its proposals in a local newspaper. Following publication people can submit comments or objections. Proposals are decided by the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) or by an independent adjudicator if the SOC cannot decide unanimously. For popular and successful schools, there is a presumption that proposals for expansion should be approved so that as many parents as possible are able to gain a place for their children at the school.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are taken from a 5 per cent. sample and are therefore subject to a high degree of sampling variation.<br>

2. Data is rounded to the nearest 100. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

3. Local authorities are assigned by matching postcodes against the relevant Office for National Statistics postcode directory.<br>

4. Population figures are taken from mid-2003. Percentages shown as 100 may actually have been calculated as slightly higher than 100 i.e. the benefit caseload is apparently at least as high, if not higher, than the corresponding population figure.<br>

5. The relevant population refers to all males aged 65 and above and females aged 60 and above living in the specified areas.<br>

6. A full basic State Pension (&#163;77.45 in 2003&#150;04) is paid to those who fully satisfy the contribution conditions either in their own right or where applicable, on the basis of their late or former spouse&#039;s contributions.<br>

Those targets were achieved. The average rate of generic prescribing in England has reached 78 per cent., and some primary care trusts are achieving rates in excess of 85 per cent.

It is clear that daily variations in concentrations of air pollutants, including particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide are associated with changes in daily rates of heart attacks and other acute cardiovascular events. The exact mechanisms of effects are not, however, yet clear. Long-term exposure to fine particles and to sulphur dioxide is associated with an increased risk of death from cardiovascular causes: again, the mechanisms of effect are unclear.
