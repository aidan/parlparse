<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51212w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 We have no statistics for the number of animals currently requiring re-homing. However the introduction of the welfare offence is not expected to increase overall numbers significantly. We believe that 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Dec 2005 : Column 1585W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the majority of sanctuaries are run satisfactory, providing a valuable service to animal welfare. However, there is evidence that a minority pose a risk. The Animal Welfare Bill will enable this risk to be addressed through the introduction of secondary legislation. The Regulatory Impact Assessment published in conjunction with the Bill proposes that all sanctuaries should be required to register with local authorities on the basis of a veterinary assessment and be subject to a code of practice by 2009. The regulation of animal sanctuaries under the Animal Welfare Bill will enable reliable data to be built up by local authorities so that high-risk establishments can be identified and inspected.

<p>
<a name="51212w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">We propose to work closely with welfare organisations and representatives of animal sanctuaries in preparing secondary legislation. This consultation will enable us to refine our thinking on key issues such as the criteria for regulating a sanctuary and the guidance which the code will give on rehabilitation and re-homing. The draft regulations and code will be subject to public consultation and there will also be the opportunity for discussion in Parliament.

 Advice on food safety is a matter for the Food Standards Agency. They have already issued clear advice that, on basis of current scientific evidence, Avian flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers. For people, the risk of catching the disease comes from being in close contact with live poultry that have the disease, and not through eating cooked poultry. The Agency will continue to monitor the most up-to-date information and evidence, as it becomes available and will keep an open mind as to any information that may lead to its advice being updated.

The Central Science Laboratory carried out two studies. The first, in 2002, looked at the prospects and potential impacts of liquid biofuels on UK agriculture, the farmed environment, landscape and rural economy. The second, in 2003, looked at industry support, cost of carbon savings and agricultural implications. Cambridge university is currently carrying out a review of the economics of energy crops, including those used for biofuels.

<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51212w03.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The evidence in this area is complex. It is difficult to pinpoint sources of infection for individual herd breakdowns, particularly when infection by wildlife is a possibility, and the regional variation in the incidence of the disease complicates the overall picture. It is, therefore, not possible to put a precise figure on the number of cases of bovine TB (bTB) that can be attributed to cattle-to-cattle transmission (or to any other source of infection). It is clear, however, that &quot;cattle-to-cattle transmission is of critical importance&quot; (Independent Scientific Group on cattle TB, 3rd report, p41) and in low bTB incidence areas there is evidence that it could be responsible for around 80 per cent. or more of cases.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51212w03.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_17">The evidence from work recently submitted for publication does suggest that cattle-to-cattle transmission is the main cause of TB spread in areas currently free, or relatively free, of cattle TB.

<p>
<a name="51212w03.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_18">But the situation is quite different in the high incidence areas of the country where 85 to 90 per cent. of all confirmed breakdowns occur. Some herds in these areas are also infected by purchased cattle, but wildlife is a major source of new herd infection and in some counties it may be a more important source than cattle.

Notes:<br>

<sup>(1)</sup> Provisional data downloaded from the State Veterinary Service Data Warehouse on 2 December 2005. Subject to change as more data becomes available.<br>

<sup>(2)</sup> In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak. When testing resumed in 2002, resources were concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds tested immediately after the FMD outbreak was greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, data for 2001 and 2002 are not comparable with other years.<br>

 Section 27 of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 came into force on 7 June this year, and provides clarification that chewing gum and smoking-related materials are litter for the purposes of Part 4 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. It has always been the case that Defra considered these items to be litter but the legislation now confirms this for the avoidance of any doubt among practitioners.

Tackling these forms of litter is particularly important given the huge cost to local authorities of removing gum once it has become impacted, and the findings of the Local Environmental Quality Survey of England (LEQSE) which show that in both 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 smokers materials were found on 79 per cent. of the sites surveyed and so is one of the most widespread types of litter. Section 27 operates so as to encourage action to be taken by local authorities against these forms of litter through awareness-raising, public campaigns and enforcement action including the use of fixed penalty notices.

This is an interesting proposal, although significant technical issues remain, including on how baselines would in practice be defined and reductions relative to them measured.

 Figures are available for the estimated total amount of paper and plastic materials consumed within the UK and therefore likely to become waste.

The British Plastics Federation estimate that the total amount of plastics consumed within the UK in 2001 was 4.7 million tonnes and this is expected to steadily increase to 5.3 million tonnes in 2005. All plastics are potentially recyclable, but the extent to which this occurs will depend on economic and logistic factors.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to develop a quality protocol for certified compost material to enable it to be defined as a product rather than waste.  [31618]</p>




<p><a name="st_74"><a name="51212w07.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The definition of waste in force in the United Kingdom is the definition in Article 1<i>(a)</i> of the Waste Framework Directive (as amended). Whether or not a substance is discarded as waste, and when waste ceases to be waste, are matters which must be determined on the facts of the case and the interpretation of the law is a matter for the courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued several judgments on the definition of waste which are binding on member states and their &quot;competent authorities&quot;. The composting of waste is classified as a waste recovery operation under the Directive. This means that composting must be carried out under the terms of a waste management licence issued by, or a waste management licensing exemption registered with, the Environment Agency (England and Wales).
</p>


<p>
<a name="51212w07.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_42">The ECJ has ruled that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;..whether [a substance] is waste, must be determined in the light of all the circumstances, regard being had to the aim of the Directive and the need to ensure that its effectiveness is not undermined.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51212w07.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_43">In practice, this means that waste does not cease to be waste until it has undergone a complete recovery operation and has been fully recovered within the meaning of the directive. A complete recovery operation is one which has the effect of transforming waste into a product which is wholly interchangeable with another 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Dec 2005 : Column 1610W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
product and requires no additional regulation or supervision beyond that applicable to the product which it is replacing. Waste has not undergone a complete recovery operation if, after the operation has been carried out, it continues to present a danger typical of waste (e.g. it continues to be contaminated).

<a name="stpa_44">The Environment Agency considers that <i>(a)</i> source-segregated waste which, after composting, meets a recognised and suitable quality standard (e.g. BSI PAS 100) is likely to be fully recovered within the meaning of the directive; and <i>(b)</i> mixed waste which is composted is likely to remain waste until it is used in a further recovery operation (e.g. land treatment resulting in agricultural benefit or ecological improvement subject to control by the Agency under a licence or registered licensing exemption). These considerations are being taken into account in work currently being undertaken by the Environment Agency and the Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP) on the development of a quality protocol for waste composting.

<a name="51212w07.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_45">The Department supports the development of such protocols at national level and advocates their development at a European Union level. A key objective of our doing so is to enable our competent authorities, and those engaged in the recovery of waste, to determine with a high degree of certainty the point at which waste has been fully recovered for the purposes of the Waste Framework Directive and has ceased to be waste. This was reflected in the UK&#039;s response of 15 February 2005 to the European Commission&#039;s questionnaire on possible amendments to the directive linked to the Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Dec 2005 : Column 1611W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
waste. In its response, the UK identified municipal/household waste which is recovered by means of composting or other biological transformation processes as a priority waste stream in this context. The UK&#039;s response is available at http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/thematicstrat/questionnaire-ukresponse.pdf

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the quality of the water supply in Tamworth.  [35673]</p>




<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51212w08.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Tamworth constituency is situated in the centre of the Glascote water supply zone of South Staffordshire Water plc. I am advised by the independent Drinking Water Inspectorate that all of the 1,384 tests carried out by the water company in this zone in 2005 have met the strict European drinking water standards.

<a name="stpa_46">The water supply to Tamworth is artificially fluoridated and there have been no breaches of the health based standard for fluoride of 1.5 mg/l in 2005.

<a name="51212w08.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_47">Although unrelated to the quality of the drinking water supply, there has been recent local concern about the Glascote service reservoir which stores treated water. A nearby residential property is the subject of flooding and, as a consequence, the structural integrity of the reservoir was questioned. South Staffordshire Water plc have inspected and tested the reservoir and 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Dec 2005 : Column 1612W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
there is no evidence of leakage or damage. The flooding problem at the property is now being dealt with by Tamworth borough council.

<p><a name="qn_76"><a name="51212w08.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what discussions she has had with water companies on their ability to protect vulnerable individuals in the event of a breakdown in water supplies; and if she will publish <i>(a)</i> the protocol for identifying such individuals and <i>(b)</i> guidance on how support will be provided to them.  [35776]</p>




<p><a name="st_76"><a name="51212w08.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, issued a Security and Emergency Measures Direction in 1998 which sets requirements on water companies in relation to emergency planning and in dealing with water emergencies. In the event of a failure of the piped water supply, water companies are required to give priority to the domestic needs of the sick, the elderly, the disabled, hospitals, schools and other vulnerable sectors of the population. The minimum amount of water to be provided to all domestic customers when such a failure occurs is 10 litres per head per day. Those vulnerable customers who are housebound will be provided with supplies of bottled water. Water companies maintain a list of their vulnerable customers based on information provided by the customers, and in liaison with local authorities, health agencies and other support bodies.
