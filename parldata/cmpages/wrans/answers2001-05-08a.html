<P>
<a name="10508w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment has stated in his reply of today (UIN15779), the United Kingdom is taking a leading role in preparation for the World Summit on Sustainable Development to be held in South Africa in September 2002. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is actively engaged in these preparations.
<P>

<a name="10508w01.html_para3">Once the agenda for the summit has been agreed, we shall decide on how best to contribute.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w01.html_wqn3"><B> Ann Clwyd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what the average length of time was between a case referred to the European Court of Human Rights and a judgment in a case in the last 12 months; and when he expects a judgment in the cases of <i>(a)</i> Leyla Zana, <i>(b)</i> Selim Sadak, <i>(c)</i> Hatip Dicle and <i>(d)</i> Orhan Dogah.  [160383]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The new European Court of Human Rights came into existence on 1 November 1998. The Court has set itself the objective of reaching a final judgment on the merits of a case within two years of that case being introduced. However, due to the considerable backlog of cases that the new Court inherited from the previous 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2001 : Column: 2W</I><P>
European Court and Commission, the Court is not at present in a position to meet that objective. The Government have provided additional assistance to the Court to help in clear that backlog. The majority of cases that do not go for judgment are decided within one year.
<P>

<a name="10508w01.html_para4">Judgments are expected shortly in the cases of Leyla Zana, Selim Sadak, Hatip Dicle and Orhan Dogah, and probably by the beginning of June.

<P>
<a name="10508w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Corbyn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations he will make to the Colombian Government over the recent threats made by Army and paramilitary personnel against the Peace Community of San Jose de Apartado.  [160641]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We are concerned about the recent threats that have been made by armed groups against the Peace Community of San Jose de Apartado. Representatives of Peace Brigades International and Christian Aid met officials from the Latin American and Caribbean Department at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on 5 and 26 April respectively to discuss this problem, and what further steps might be taken to protect the Peace Community and other vulnerable groups in Colombia.
<P>

<a name="10508w01.html_para5">The British embassy in Bogota has raised our concern about the safety of the San Jose de Apartado Peace Community with the Colombian authorities, most recently with the Head of the Human Rights Unit of the Prosecutor-General's Office on 24 April. We have been promised a response soon.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Corbyn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations he will make to the Colombian Government concerning the rights of the peace communities in Colombia not to be intimidated by military and paramilitary units.  [160642]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 As I made clear in my statement on 13 February, we are very concerned about the increasing levels of violence in Colombia, and the threats and intimidation that continue to be directed against the civilian population, including the peace communities.
<P>

<a name="10508w01.html_para6">The Minister for the Cabinet Office visited Colombia again in March in order to support the Colombian Government's efforts to advance the peace process and protect human rights. She repeated the concerns that we both raised with the Colombian Government during our joint visit in September 2000 about paramilitarism, and strongly urged the authorities to increase their efforts to tackle paramilitary groups. On 20 April, I wrote to the Colombian Ambassador in London reiterating our concern about the human rights situation in Colombia, especially with regard to the protection of vulnerable groups, paramilitarism, and bringing members of the armed forces linked to paramilitaries to justice.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We have raised our concerns about the reported detention of Bishop Shi Enxiang on 27 April with the Embassy of the People's Republic of China, and will continue to follow this case closely.
<P>

<a name="10508w01.html_para7">We regularly raise concerns about the harassment of Christians in our Human Rights Dialogue with China, the latest round of which was held in Beijing on 12-14 February. We made it clear that such harassment was unacceptable and not in keeping with the provisions of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which China signed in October 1998.

(UN Convention)
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what obstacles remain to his signing the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.  [160322]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The UK ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1986 and is fully committed to its implementation. The Optional Protocol to the Convention was opened for signature on 10 December 1999. In 1999, following a review of our obligations under international human rights treaties, the Government concluded that priority should be given to the Human Rights Act 1998. The Government would prefer to give the Act, which has been fully in force only since 2 October 2000, longer to bed down before returning to the question of whether our citizens need an avenue of complaint to the UN human rights committees. The Home Secretary has said in a recent letter to the Law Society that we can return to the issue later in the year, but cannot give a precise timetable just yet.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on recent discussions he has had with the Chinese Government concerning animal welfare.  [160074]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We have made clear to the Chinese authorities the British public's opposition to the exploitation and cruel treatment of animals in China.
<P>

<a name="10508w01.html_para8">The UK is at the forefront of international efforts to protect animals. We are closely involved in the work of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). We support the work of non-governmental organisations in the field of animal welfare.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if he will make a statement concerning the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to prosecute any person arising out the death of Colin Griffiths.  [160360]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 A full investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Griffiths' death was undertaken by the Staffordshire police. The findings of that investigation 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2001 : Column: 4W</I><P>
have been carefully reviewed by a senior lawyer in the Casework Directorate of the Crown Prosecution Service. In addition, advice has been taken from experienced, independent counsel. Both have come to the firm conclusion that there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction against any person arising out of the tragic death of Mr. Griffiths. Mrs. Griffiths has been informed of the decision and she has also had a meeting with the CPS lawyer during which the basis of the decision was explained to her.

<P>
<a name="10508w02.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 For the year 2000, CDC made a pre-tax operating surplus of &#163;72.3 million. However, after provision on its investment portfolio of &#163;133.4 million it made an overall loss of &#163;61.1 million before tax (&#163;51.5 million after tax).
<P>

<a name="10508w02.html_para0">With regard to its investment policy in the year 2000, CDC exceeded the target of directing 70 per cent. of investments by value to poorer countries. However, in 2000 it again did not meet the aim of directing 50 per cent. of its investments by value to Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. CDC is focused on meeting this aim in 2001.
<P>

<a name="10508w02.html_para1">CDC made important progress during last year to establish the basis for a beneficial public-private partnership that will demonstrate that it is possible for private investors to make adequate returns in poor countries in a socially responsible way.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The benefit fraud inspectorate (BFI) has produced an assessment report in respect of Kingston upon Hull city council. The report was published today and copies have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10508w02.html_para3">The inspection coincided with my right hon. Friend's announcement on the setting up of an Expert Help Team to help local authorities improve their benefit administration. The council offered to be the first local authority to work with the expert help team.
<P>

<a name="10508w02.html_para4">BFI therefore produced a short assessment report to help the council identify the extent of deficiencies in key areas of benefit administration and security, and to help inform the focus of the expert help teams visit.




<P>
<P><I>8 May 2001 : Column: 6W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10508w02.html_para5">This report identifies a range of problems that hinder the delivery of an efficient service and notes the council's commitment to improve, demonstrated by some encouraging work including the introduction of the verification framework and a good claim form designed in line with BFI guidance.
<P>

<a name="10508w02.html_para6">I commend the Council for its openness, good work and on-going effort undertaken in conjunction with the expert help team to improve its standard of administration and counter-fraud activity.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Single pensioners (non-cohabiting) are defined as men aged 65 and over or women aged 60 and over.<P>

2. Pensioner couples (married or cohabiting) are defined as couples where the man is aged 65 or over.<P>

3. Incomes are defined as net weekly income from all sources, before housing costs, expressed in July 1998 prices.<P>





4. The numbers of pensioners are rounded to the nearest 10,000 and the percentages are rounded to the nearest 1 per cent though they are not necessarily accurate to that degree.<P>

5. Estimates are based on survey data and are subject to sampling error. A dash represents sample sizes that are too small to provide reliable estimates. Extreme caution should be exercised when using these figures to estimate the number of pensioners falling within a given &#163;5 band of income, since the resulting estimate may not be based on a sample size large enough to produce reliable estimates.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many <i>(a)</i> children, <i>(b)</i> adults and <i>(c)</i> pensioners lived in poverty in the north west in each of the years from 1997 to date.  [160084]<P>

<a name="10508w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Poverty and social exclusion are complex multi-dimensional issues, affecting many aspects of people's lives--including income, health, housing, the quality of their environment and opportunities to learn. There is no single measure that can capture the complex problems that need to be overcome.
<P>

<a name="10508w03.html_para0">However, a number of these aspects have seen significant improvement in the north west since 1997. For instance, the proportion of children achieving at least level 4 at key stage 2 has risen from 63 per cent. in 1997 to 75 per cent. in 2000 in English. In maths the proportion rose from 63 per cent. to 73 per cent. The numbers claiming Unemployment Benefit have fallen by over 35 per cent. since the election to 125,000 in March 2001. Unemployment has not been as low in the north west since May 1975. The percentage of pensioners in 1998-99 in low income households in the north west Government office region was 24 per cent. on the before housing costs measure and 27 per cent. on the after housing costs measure. This is similar to the level for Great Britain as a whole.
<P>

<a name="10508w03.html_para1">The annual report, "Opportunity for all" (CM4865), available in the Library, sets out and monitors the Government's strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion.

 <i>[holding answer 3 May 2001]:</i> The only reason there have been victims of the NIRS2 computer system is because of the terms on which the system was purchased by the previous Administration. We are dealing with the consequences to ensure people do not lose out.

 <i>[holding answer 3 May 2001]:</i> The position on premiums for the earnings related Minimum Income Guarantee prior to this April's changes is given in the table. The two lower rates of the Minimum Income Guarantee were abolished on 9 April and all claimants now receive the highest rate of &#163;92.15 for a single person and &#163;140.55 for couples. The number of pensioners claiming are expected to increase by 140,000 as they become newly entitled to the guarantee because of these increases and increases in the lower and upper capital limits.

 The repairs to the SSNs recalled last October are progressing well. Although straightforward in engineering terms, the work has involved the development of engineering techniques. This has been given the highest priority and I am able to say that the repairs to HMS Torbay and HMS Tireless have been completed successfully. HMS Torbay remains in refit and HMS Tireless, sailed yesterday from Gibraltar to return to duty.

 The investigation by the Royal Military Police special investigation branch into the death of Guardsman King concluded on 29 February 2000. As a result, eight senior non-commissioned officers and two junior non-commissioned officers were reported for neglect of duty. The Army Prosecuting Authority, an organisation similar in role to that of the Crown Prosecution Service and wholly independent of the chain of command, subsequently concluded that there was insufficient prospect of securing a conviction at a court martial to warrant trial.
<P>

<a name="10508w04.html_para9">The Secretary of State has had no direct contact with the family of Guardsman King, although officers from Guardsman King's unit have insisted the family and a number of officials from the Ministry of Defence have also been in correspondence with them. The associated Army Board of Inquiry was convened on 15 January 2001; it is still on-going and the family will continue to be informed of developments.

 I announced on 4 May that I had reached agreement with the Commissioner of Transport for London, Robert R. Kiley, on a way forward which will provide a secure basis for progressing the PPP. This should enable the PPP to be completed by the autumn, with the Underground transferring to the control of Transport for London once the first deep tube competition is concluded.

The way forward protects the key objectives of achieving safety and value for money. The details are set out in a Memorandum of Agreement, a copy of which has been placed in the Libraries of

 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2001]:</i> T25 is the name of a type of genetically modified (GM) maize developed by Aventis. The modification, transformation event 25 (T25) confers resistance to a particular herbicide, in this particular case, Glufosinate Ammonium. Chardon LL is a variety of T25 maize.
<P>

<a name="10508w09.html_para0">Directive 90-220, on the deliberate release of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), recognises two types of release. First, those for research purposes (known as Part B releases) and, second, those for marketing (known as Part C releases). Applications for Part B releases are assessed on an individual basis at Member State level and approved by the competent authorities in that state.
<P>

<a name="10508w09.html_para1">Applications for approval of GMOs for marketing (Part C approvals) are made initially to one of the 15 Member States. The competent authority in this Member State reviews the application and forms an opinion. If favourable, the opinion and application dossier (which includes the risk assessment for the GMO) are passed to the European Commission and the 14 other Member States. Each Member State then examines the application in detail. If there are no objections to the favourable opinion, formal Part C approval is granted by the Member State in which the application was first made, on behalf of the whole European Union (EU). Once granted the Part C consent is valid across the EU.
<P>

<a name="10508w09.html_para2">The French competent authority received the initial application for Part C approval of T25 maize in 1995, which was for both commercial cultivation and for importation. Following consideration by other Member States, the French granted formal approval for T25 maize on 3 August 1998. A number of Member States have also given approval to the cultivation of T25 maize for research (Part B releases). The Statement of the French Competent Authority for T25 maize shows that various Part B approvals were given by the French, Italian, German and United Kingdom competent authorities between 1992 and 1997. I have placed a copy of the statement in the library of the house. This contains the exact details of each release.
<P>

<a name="10508w09.html_para3">Any crop, irrespective of it being GM or not, also requires approval under the National Seed Listing legislation. Varieties may not be marketed until they have been added to the UK National List or EU Common Catalogue. A proposal to add Chardon LL to the UK National List was published in March 2000. A number of affected persons made written representations or asked to make oral representations. A Hearing began on 2 October and was adjourned on 15 November until further notice pending resolution of concerns about the system used in France. Meanwhile, I understand that MAFF has sought the views of the European Commission on the legal status of the French authority's testing procedures. Chardon LL will only be added to the UK National List if all the legal requirements have been met in full.

<P>
<a name="10508w09.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions on what date the original safety assessments were undertaken on Chardon-LL and T25 maize made by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment; and what other bodies were responsible for undertaking such safety assessments.

<P>
<a name="10508w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2001]:</i> Chardon LL is a variety of T25 maize. The original safety assessments for marketing approval of T25 maize under Directive 90/220 were made by the French Authorities (refer to PQ 159994 above) in 1995. The application dossier was then referred to the UK and the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) considered this on 20 June 1996. English Nature, as well as the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Health and Safety Executive and the then Department of the Environment also undertook safety assessments. ACRE was satisfied that the T25 did not pose a risk to human health and the environment. This included consideration of animal feed safety in association with MAFF. The Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes also considered the safety of T25 and advised that the product was safe for use in food.

made allowing charges to be levied on utility companies whose works exceed an agreed deadline. However, the Act did not extend this power to works carried out by highway authorities.
<P>

<a name="10508w10.html_para17">This Government are determined to reduce the disruption which all works, whether carried out by utility or highway authority, cause to road users. The powers under section 74 have been activated with effect from 1 April this year. At the same time a revised code of practice for the co-ordination of works and best practice guidelines were published, which apply not only to works on behalf of utilities but also to works for local highway authorities and the Highways Agency. We are also considering whether further measures may be required.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Works carried out to the highway include "road" works--carried out by or on behalf of highway authorities--and "street" works--involving statutory utilities. Detailed figures are not available on the proportion of overall works carried out by utilities, local authorities and the Highways Agency. However, the Government have recently commissioned Halcrow UK to undertake a study of the extent of utility street works across England. As part of that work, they will also be looking at works carried out by highway authorities. We expect to make the conclusions of Halcrow's research available to the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what his assessment is of the impact on prices paid by consumers for utility services arising from the lane rental provisions of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991.  [160391]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Government took powers in the Transport Act 2000 to make regulations permitting highway authorities to levy daily charges on utilities from the outset of works (so-called "lane rental"). These powers are being kept in reserve at this stage as regards national implementation. However, we have agreed that the London borough of Camden and Middlesbrough borough council may operate pilot schemes for lane rental in their area, starting later this year.
<P>

<a name="10508w10.html_para18">The impact of any national lane rental scheme on utility companies and their customers and the extent to which road users will benefit from reduced disruption will obviously depend upon detailed arrangements, for instance the level at which rental charges were set and the type of works which would attract charges. Should we decide to launch the powers nationally, we will want to look very closely at the effects of the pilot schemes in devising the details of the scheme and in carrying out a regulatory impact assessment.

 <i>[holding answer 3 May 2001]:</i> The size of buses is currently regulated by the Road Vehicle (Construction and Use) Regulations which in turn incorporate dimensions that have to be accepted by all European Union countries through Directive 96/53/EC. Amendments to this Directive to allow longer buses are currently under discussion. In my response of 10 April to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood), <i>Official Report,</i> columns 497-99W, I explained that the Council had reached a general political agreement on allowing the use of buses up to 15 metres long. But owing to UK concerns over the manoeuvrability of these vehicles the text for a derogation for us would be remitted to COREPER for further consideration. It is unlikely that a final agreement will be reached before the end of this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) usually fills construction industry inspector posts internally from its pool of experienced general inspectors of health and safety. HSE is currently running a major campaign to recruit trainee inspectors nationally, the majority to fill the vacancies in the Field Operations Directorate, and this includes those in its London and the South East Division. In order to help address the resource shortfall more quickly, HSE is also seeking to deploy inspectors from other divisions into London for limited periods and is exploring the contribution that could be made by additional specialist inspectors supporting operational construction inspection.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w10.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The county councils which have had no reported cases of foot and mouth disease and which have opened less than 25 per cent. of the total length of their rights of way are: Lincolnshire (0 per cent.), Buckinghamshire (5 per cent.), Hampshire (5 per cent.), West Sussex (10 per cent.), Bedfordshire (12 per cent.), East Sussex (12 per cent.), Nottinghamshire (15 per cent.), and Dorset (22 per cent.).
<P>

<a name="10508w10.html_para19">The county councils which have had no reported cases of foot and mouth disease and which have opened 50 per cent. or more of the total length of their rights of way are: Norfolk (59 per cent.), Surrey (70 per cent.), Suffolk (75 per cent.), and Cambridgeshire (85 per cent.).
<P>

<a name="10508w10.html_para20">These figures show that many local authorities continue to keep rights of way closed unnecessarily. The Government's veterinary and scientific advisers have confirmed that outside Infected Areas there is no justification for keeping so many paths closed. Councils that ignore this advice are failing in their duty to their residents, their visitors, and their local businesses to open rights of way wherever it is safe to do so.
<P>

<a name="10508w10.html_para21">Several authorities lag so far behind public opinion and professional advice that they continue to keep closed even paths across woodland and arable land. This cannot be justified. Local authorities quite rightly wish to take account of the views of farmers and land managers, but they need to balance these with the views of the many other businesses in their communities whose livelihood is threatened, as well as the interests of their residents and visitors. Unnecessary closures mean unnecessary inconvenience, unnecessary economic damage, and in some cases unnecessary danger where people are forced on to busy roads because paths are closed.
<P>

<a name="10508w10.html_para22">In authorities which have taken a more balanced judgment of needs, such as Surrey, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, well over half the path networks have been reopened. There is no reason why the worst performing authorities should not achieve a similar or better performance. I urge all councils, and especially those without infected areas, to make significant progress towards reopening their rights of way wherever it is safe to do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 To date no formal assessment of the costs borne by local authorities in implementing the hardship rate relief scheme has been undertaken. However, we have extended the central Government contribution to the cost of the relief from 75 per cent. to 95 per cent. in cases where the business is located in one of the 151 eligible rural districts and has a rateable value of &#163;12,000 or less.

In his speech at Chatham House on 6 March the Prime Minister reiterated his intention to attend the Summit, the first Head of Government to make such a commitment. The Department for International Development will provide &#163;1.5 million in support of the Summit, most of which will be used to assist the Government of South Africa in their preparations. The Government are also seconding experienced officials to South Africa and to the UN secretariat to strengthen their teams.

<a name="10508w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 My Department is to carry out a major study to reassess attitudes to aircraft noise. This new study underlines the Government's commitment to underpin our policy on aircraft noise by substantial research that commands the widest possible confidence.
<P>

<a name="10508w11.html_para3">Our current understanding of the relationship between annoyance and aircraft noise over 24 hours is based primarily on research that was carried out in the 1980s, in particular the Aircraft Noise Index Study published in 1985. That was based on the largest survey yet carried out of public attitudes to aircraft noise and eventually led the Government of the day to adopt the Leq (equivalent continuous noise) index for daytime noise contours.
<P>

<a name="10508w11.html_para4">The conclusions have been broadly confirmed by other studies here and abroad, and we have no reason to doubt their validity. But in the light of our commitment to develop a new air transport policy, of changes to traffic patterns since then, and the general reduction in noise levels of individual aircraft, it is now timely to commission a fresh study.
<P>

<a name="10508w11.html_para5">We want the aviation industry to meet the external costs it imposes. This new study will give us more information on the value people give to relief from noise, and to focus our policies from a broader range of evidence.
<P>

<a name="10508w11.html_para6">In deciding to commission this further research, I have considered the findings of three recent Government- sponsored studies on sleep disturbance, and the advice of independent experts. I am grateful to those who sat on the steering and technical working groups for their help in shaping those studies. I have concluded that a new full-scale objective sleep study would be unlikely to add significantly to our understanding; and that the way forward is through concentrating instead on further research into subjective responses to annoyance by night and by day.
<P>

<a name="10508w11.html_para7">I am placing copies of the three reports (Adverse Effects of Night-Time Aircraft Noise, Aircraft Noise and Sleep-UK Trial Methodology Study, and Perceptions of Aircraft Noise Sleep and Health) in the House Library. These have been published by the former Department of Operational Research and Analysis (DORA) of National Air Traffic Services Ltd., and by the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research Consultancy Services and Department of Social Statistics at the University of Southampton, respectively. Further information on Government sponsored research into aircraft noise and sleep will shortly be available on the Aviation section of my Department's website.
<P>

<a name="10508w11.html_para8">Invitations to tender for the new study will be issued shortly. We shall ensure that both environmental and aviation interests can contribute to the oversight of the project. It will last three years, with pilot results planned to be available next year to feed into our White Paper on air transport.

 The responsibilities of the sewerage undertaker are prescribed in the Water Industry Act 1991. At the periodic review the Director General of Water Services, sets companies' price limits and within this framework it is for each sewerage undertaker to determine its priorities. Ofwat and my officials are currently discussing the causes of sewer flooding and possible remedies.

 We have decided to give extra assistance this year to those English authorities where the cost of dealing with flood damage to their highways would absorb a high proportion of their available resources for highway maintenance. Officials are writing to authorities seeking up to date information on the cost of flood damage before the final level of support is determined, but on the basis of the information we have received to date it is likely that the total payments nationally will be in the region of &#163;12 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will place in the Library a copy of the programme of actions for the Commissioner appointed under section 67 of the Police Northern Ireland Act 2000 and his timetable for completing his task.  [159472]<P>

 The Oversight Commissioner's first report, which was placed in the Library of the House on 10 January 2001, laid out the Commissioner's programme of action.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w13.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Donaldson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many members of the <i>(a)</i> Provisional IRA, <i>(b)</i> Real IRA, <i>(c)</i> Continuity IRA, <i>(d)</i> INLA, <i>(e)</i> UDA/UFF, <i>(f)</i> LVF, <i>(g)</i> Orange Volunteer Force and <i>(h)</i> Red Hand Defenders have been <i>(i)</i> charged with a terrorist-related offence and (ii) convicted of a terrorist- related offence in relation to crimes committed after 10 April 1998.  [155469]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The table details the number of persons charged with "terrorist-type" or serious public order offences since 10 April 1998. The following points should be noted about this information:
<P>

<a name="10508w13.html_para0">(a) Where a person has been charged with a number of different offences only the most serious is shown. It is not possible to attribute responsibility to specific groups as to do so would incur a disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="10508w13.html_para1">(b) Charges brought during this period may relate to offences committed prior to 10 April 1998.
<P>

<a name="10508w13.html_para2">(c) The "other" category includes a range of public order offences including, for example, riotous behaviour, possession or throwing of petrol bombs, assaulting police, hijacking and obstructing the highway. The offences of membership and withholding information are also included.
<P>

<a name="10508w13.html_para3">I regret that information concerning convictions is not available. The processing of court statistics on the court proceedings database was suspended in April 1998. Court data are therefore not available for 1998, 1999 and 2000. I understand that work to capture this missing data is at an advanced stage, but will be some time before this missing dat is at an advanced stage, but will be some time before this information becomes available.

<a name="10508w13.html_para4">Procedures for discipline and the sending of files to the Director of Public Prosecutions are currently being developed. Consequently, as at 21 April, no cases have resulted in disciplinary proceedings and no cases have resulted in files being sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
<P>

<a name="10508w13.html_para5">However, the Police Ombudsman assumed responsibility for 2,396 cases under transitional arrangements from the Independent Commission for Police Complaints. Of these, five cases have resulted in disciplinary proceedings being taken and a total of 250 cases have been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

of options for tackling these three devastating diseases in developing countries as a contribution, both to the UK Government's thinking and to the international debate.
<P>

<a name="10508w13.html_para6">The report calls for a comprehensive global strategy to: improve and expand coverage of health systems and health promotion; make affordable for those that need them vaccines, drugs, and other products to prevent and treat the diseases; and provide incentives for research into new, more effective health products.
<P>

<a name="10508w13.html_para7">The PIU report proposes a series of measures including: a new Global Fund for Health to finance the purchase of existing health products to tackle the three diseases, substantially scaling up the provision of these products to those most in need but least able to afford them; binding advance purchase commitment to purchase new, more effective products as they become available, strengthening incentives to step up investment in R&D; a framework for tiered pricing and greater local production of patented products under voluntary licences to improve affordability; and clarification of the flexibilities in intellectual property protection under the WTO TRIPS agreement; targeted support including tax credits and public-private partnerships for R&D, and a new platform for clinical trials of new drugs and vaccines; and a scaled-up and better co-ordinated global partnership to halt and reverse the spread of disease.

<P>
<a name="10508w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 As part of the on-going reform of the civil justice system and the review of civil enforcement, we have been reviewing the remedy of distress for rent. We recognise that there are concerns about the current procedure, whereby landlords of (mainly commercial) property can seize their tenants' goods for non-payment of rent, without a court order or any prior notice. The Government accept that some change is necessary and desirable, and the Lord Chancellor has today issued a consultation paper on options for reform of distress for rent. Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The aim of this consultation is to:

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w16.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what progress has been made on the second phase of the enforcement review following the widening of its remit, announced by the Lord Chancellor on 6 March.  [160695]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 A wider remit for phase two of the enforcement review was announced on 6 March 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 212W. The review has identified the need for independent expert advice from the private, independent and public sectors actively involved in enforcement and a market evaluation of the delivery of enforcement services. An advisory group will therefore be established on the delivery of enforcement services to guarantee openness and transparency.
<P>

<a name="10508w16.html_para4">The broader remit of the enforcement review enables us to set better, more wide-ranging public service agreement targets, ensuring that enforcement is carried out to a consistent standard. The current target (to achieve a 10 per cent. increase in the amount recovered per pound under executed warrants issued in the county courts in 2001-04) was due to be reviewed in July 2001. The new target will need to take account of the findings of the enforcement review, to be more closely linked to service delivery and to measure return to the customer. We will now set new targets for civil enforcement by December 2001 and implement them in 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 In his Budget 2001 report, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a number of measures to encourage cleaner road transport, to improve access to cheaper motoring for people who need to use their cars and to enhance the efficiency and environmental sustainability of the UK haulage industry.
<P>

<a name="10508w16.html_para5">This package of measures represents a balance between economic, environmental and social concerns and should help mitigate the impact of fuel costs on rural and cross border transport. All motorists will benefit by an equivalent of four pence per litre cut on fuel duty and hauliers by an equivalent seven pence per litre. The proposed reforms to the lorry vehicle excise duty regime will bring typical duty rates for the cleanest vehicles down to among the lowest in Europe.

<a name="10508w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Government have no plans to scrap or to review the Barnett formula. It has provided stable settlements under successive Governments for over 20 years. The Barnett formula is also flexible. It leaves detailed decisions on the allocation of resources for devolved programmes to the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament. Finally, the Barnett formula is fair, because it gives the same overall increases for devolved programmes per head of population in all four parts of the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 The Government are determined to deliver a safe, modern and high quality railway system. Investment in the railway industry in Scotland, and indeed elsewhere in the UK, is principally a matter for the industry itself. As part of Railtrack's national regeneration scheme, &#163;1.85 million has already been invested in the refurbishment of Kilmarnock Station. Furthermore, Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive has committed funds to extend car parking at Kilmarnock station to 111 spaces, effectively doubling capacity.
<P>

<a name="10508w16.html_para6">The Strategic Rail Authority, under the guidance of the Scottish Executive, has asked Railtrack to cost a number of enhancement options. One option being considered is the creation of a two mile dynamic loop between Stewarton and Dunlop, which would effectively double the single track. This option would have the potential to increase service frequency between Kilmarnock and Glasgow.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how the Government plan to take forward the paid adoption leave announced in the Budget.  [160587]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The Budget announced that paid paternity leave and adoption leave would be introduced in 2003. These were based on options put forward in the Green Paper "Work and Parents, Competitiveness and Choice". The introduction of systems for paid paternity leave and paid adoption leave will be a step forward in meeting the Government's aim to improve choice for parents and enhance competitiveness for business.
<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para1">Paid paternity leave will give working fathers the choice to support their partner around the birth of their child and help adapt to the responsibilities raising a new-born child brings. Paid adoption leave will recognise the commitment given by adoptive families by providing an adoptive parent with the opportunity of 26 weeks leave paid at the flat rate of statutory maternity pay. In addition the Government are to provide a further 26 weeks additional unpaid adoption leave bringing parity with the extension of unpaid maternity leave announced in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Ms Ryan) on 1 May 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 548W.
<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para2">Both paternity leave and adoption leave received strong support from parents, employers and their representatives in responses to the consultation and during discussions with ministers and officials. Employers and parents asked that wherever appropriate the systems should seek to mirror mothers maternity provisions to aid consistency and simplicity. They also stressed that the systems should adopt a light-touch approach and be as simple as possible to administer.
<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para3">I have responded to these calls by today publishing frameworks for paid paternity leave and adoption leave based on suggestions put forward. Both frameworks include an assessment of their likely benefits and costs.
<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para4">The paternity leave framework particularly adopts a number of approaches asked for by employers. To be eligible for paid paternity leave fathers will have to have served a qualifying period. To ease the administration, paternity leave will have to be taken in a single block and taken within the first two months of the child's birth. And the payment mechanism will be similar to that used for SMP.
<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para5">The adoption leave framework builds on the existing support for adoptive parents. It will be available to those parents adopting children of up to 18 years of age and where couples adopt jointly it will be for them to choose who takes the paid adoption leave.
<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para6">I welcome comments on these frameworks and have placed copies of the documents in the Library of the House today.

 I am pleased to announce that the Government have reached agreement for the introduction of Universal Banking Services with 11 major institutions. The terms of a Memorandum of Understanding have been agreed and copies are being placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para7">The banks will make their basic bank accounts accessible through the 18,000 post offices in the network, contribute &#163;180 million to the costs of the Post Office card account, and commit to simple and straightforward account opening for those without bank accounts.
<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para8">This is a major step forward both in ensuring the future of the post office network and in tackling financial exclusion. Universal Banking Services will provide a range of banking services which will enable a new income stream to come into the network and bring those people currently without bank accounts into the financial mainstream.
<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para9">It is the latest in a number of measures the Government have announced recently to help strengthen the post office network.
<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para10">In February I announced a new Government fund to help with the costs of relocating and refurbishing rural post offices. Grants to this fund now being considered include proposals to reopen rural offices near Dover and Cardiff. The Government hope to make several more similar grants shortly and this fund could provide the impetus for reopening up to 200 offices nationwide.
<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para11">In March, we launched the latest phase in order to pilot post offices in Leicestershire and Rutland as "Government General Practitioners"--a new service that will offer a wide range of information and access to Government services aimed at the general public.

<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para14">I am informed by the Post Office that, subject to final verification, a net total of 112 urban offices and 435 rural offices closed in the year ending 26 March 2001 <sup>1</sup> . Of the closures in the year, only four are permanent.
<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para15">The primary reason for temporary closures is the retirement of sub-postmasters.
<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para16">In addition, 123 rural and 46 urban offices reopened in the year. Also, subject to final verification, net closures in the final quarter of the year ending 26 March 2001 were 113.
<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para17">This indicates a significant downward trend in post office closures compared with the third quarter when net closures were 135 and the first half of the year when closures were running at a rate of 150 per quarter.




<P>

<P>

<a name="10508w18.html_para18">This means that during the period April 2000 to March 2001, in the first half of the year net closures were running at 300, whereas in the final half of the year closures were 17 per cent. lower at 248.

 The Competition Commission made an adverse finding in relation to persistent selling below cost of certain frequently purchased goods. However, they concluded that a prohibition of the practice would itself have adverse effects, for example consumers might pay more for their shopping basket overall, and that the degree of intervention and monitoring required by a prohibition would be disproportionate to the problem. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry accepted the recommendation made by the Competition Commission not to prohibit below-cost selling of certain frequently purchased goods.

The Regulations introduce, for the first time, a requirement that seismic surveys must be granted consent by the Secretary of State before they can take place. They also cover the granting of authorisations for pipelines and approval of decommissioning plans. They serve to emphasise the importance of marine habitat and species protection.

<a name="10508w19.html_para2">The Offshore Petroleum Activities (Conservation of Habitats) Regulations (No 2001/1754), which will come into force on 31 May, take account of a number of helpful comments received by my Department following a wide- ranging public consultation on earlier draft proposals.
<P>

<a name="10508w19.html_para3">These Regulations mark a substantial improvement in the transparency of our environmental and licensing regimes.

<P>

<a name="10508w19.html_para4">I am also pleased to announce that the DTI has completed the assessment of the applications made in the Nineteenth Round of offshore petroleum licensing against financial, environmental and technical criteria. Environmental factors have been considered in the light of an independent comprehensive strategic environmental assessment of that part of the UK Continental Shelf between the Shetland and Faroes Islands that is the subject of the round (the 'White Zone'), and as though these Regulations were already in force and fully in accordance with the Habitats and Birds Directives.

<a name="10508w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Government are committed to retaining a viable textile and clothing industry and are keen to ensure that it remains as competitive as possible. With this aim in mind, my Department has worked closely with the industry-led Textile and Clothing Strategy Group (TCSG), which was established in 1999 in response to concerns from the industry about its future. We have extensive contact with the industry but it is through this forum that we receive the most comprehensive representation. The TCSG report, "A National Strategy for the UK Textile and Clothing Industry", was published on 6 June 2000, and includes a series of recommendations for action, directed both at Government and industry.
<P>

<a name="10508w20.html_para0">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry together with my hon. Friend the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities made an immediate and positive response to these recommendations at the launch of the Strategy with an initial 12 Point Plan for the Industry. This package of measures is designed to enable the industry to develop and to adapt to the challenges of the knowledge economy.
<P>

<a name="10508w20.html_para1">The plan includes measures to support design talent, to promote and support the development and exploitation of technical textile materials as well as additional help to exporters. The extended support for exporters includes the temporary relaxation of the rules for trade fair support to enable more textiles and clothing companies to receive assistance at certain events. Trade Partners UK spent &#163;2.8 million on SESA supported events for the financial year 2000-01 in the textiles and clothing sectors. This compares with &#163;1.5 million in 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="10508w20.html_para2">The package also provides programmes to help retrain workers who might be affected by decisions that have been taken on closures. Details of the 12-point plan and its implementation and other support available can be found on http://www.dti.gov.uk/support/textile.htm
<P>

<a name="10508w20.html_para3">The Government fully recognise that for a variety of reasons, including globalisation, new technology and restructuring, the textile industry in particular is under significant pressure. Government assistance in total to the textile and clothing industry since coming into office in May 1997 amounts to more than &#163;75 million, including more than &#163;40 million granted to textile and clothing companies by way of regional selective assistance (RSA). This RSA support has been spread across a large number of companies and has led to investment by the companies concerned of a further &#163;250 million, safeguarding or creating 10,000 jobs in the sector.
<P>

<a name="10508w20.html_para4">The DTI's Consumer Goods and Services Directorate is also currently helping to fund around 30 projects aimed at supporting innovation and boosting competitiveness, and these will also encourage growth in the sector and contribute to safeguarding employment.
<P>

<a name="10508w20.html_para5">Value added of the UK textile and clothing industry represented 4.3 per cent. of manufacturing Gross Value Added (0.8 per cent. of total Gross Value Added) in 1999, the latest whole year for which data are available.

 Recruitment for the post of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Probation has been run under Commissioner for Public Appointments guidelines following advertisements in the national press. The choice of candidates has been guided by an advisory panel including two independent assessors. As we announced on 6 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 357W, these were Baroness Stern, former Director of the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders and now Senior Research Fellow at the International Centre for Prison Studies, and Lord Laming, former Chief Inspector of the Social Services Inspectorate.
<P>

<a name="10508w21.html_para0">From the candidates selected by the advisory panel, I have decided to appoint Professor Rodney Morgan as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Probation. Professor Morgan is Director of the Centre of Criminology, Criminal Justice Faculty of Law at Bristol University and a member of the Parole Board.
<P>

<a name="10508w21.html_para1">I am delighted that Professor Morgan has accepted this appointment, which will take effect from 1 August 2001. Through their expertise and rigour of approach the probation inspectorate has provided a major contribution to building a National Probation Service capable of providing the highest standards of service. I am confident that Professor Morgan will continue that tradition.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w22.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hepburn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the Arson Control Forum new projects bidding exercise.  [160690]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I am very pleased to announce today the award of &#163;1 million of grants by the Arson Control Forum to fire brigades in England and Wales for arson reduction initiatives.
<P>

<a name="10508w22.html_para0">The Arson Control Forum was established last year with the aim of reducing the incidence of deliberate fires by 30 per cent. of the 1998-99 baseline by 31 March 2009; the desired outcome is to cut maliciously set fires from the current figure of 77,900 to 54,500 during this period. To achieve this aim, the Forum has been allocated a budget of &#163;3.5 million over the three year period from April 2001. Some of this money will be used to fund research into the causes and prevention of arson, but most will be used to fund local fire brigade anti-arson initiatives. The size of the budget available to fund local projects this year is &#163;1 million.

<a name="10508w22.html_para1">The Chair of the Forum, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Fire Services, Graham Meldrum, wrote to all Chief Fire Officers inviting bids to be submitted to the Home Office by 31 March 2001. By the closing date for the exercise, we had received a total of 44 bids from 40 brigades, totalling &#163;1,609,320.
<P>

<a name="10508w22.html_para2">The bids were evaluated in accordance with Home Office procurement guidelines. All bids were carefully considered and we have agreed to wholly or part fund 25 of the 44 received, amounting to &#163;996,664. Those bids that were successful met the following criteria:

<a name="10508w22.html_para4">The projects we will be supporting range from those that have been successful elsewhere, such as the establishment of an arson task force comprising the fire, police and social services. Other projects are concentrating upon particular issues, such as arson in schools, vehicle arson or the development of community based solutions. The focus of all these projects has been partnership, either with the police, social services, the local authorities, schools and a range of others.
<P>

<a name="10508w22.html_para5">There has also been a wide geographical spread. There are projects from Wales to Kent, and from the South West and the Midlands to the North West and East of England. The projects also range widely in terms of their target areas, from the inner-cities to rural areas, where the arson problem is often greater than people realise.
<P>

<a name="10508w22.html_para6">The following projects have been supported.

 There is no reliable way of estimating the numbers who have been refused entry clearance on the basis that they were not related as claimed and where subsequent information proves that relationship.

 The Home Office has put in place a number of measures affecting animal welfare throughout Great Britain since 1997. I do not have separate information on the Vale of Clwyd, but I am able to provide details of what the Home Office has achieved at a national level since 1997.
<P>

<a name="10508w23.html_para2">We are continuing to work to ensure that the highest possible standards of welfare are applied to animals used in scientific procedures and that they are used only where it is fully justified--where the benefits outweigh the costs and where there are no suitable alternatives. To this end, we are promoting the fullest application of the 3Rs--the replacement of procedures with others which do not use animals, the reduction of the number of animals used and the refinement of procedures to minimise pain and suffering.
<P>

<a name="10508w23.html_para3">In addition to our commitment to the 3Rs, the other main individual measures this Government have introduced since the election to ensure that animals are used only where fully justified are as follows. We have:

increased the size of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate from 18 to 21, and recruited seven new inspectors to fill these and other vacancies and recently announced plans to further increase numbers to 33 over the next three years;

introduced a requirement that all establishments licensed under the 1986 Act have local ethical review processes as a complement to the existing controls under the Act. We are now reviewing those processes to ensure dissemination of best practice;

</FONT></UL>
<a name="10508w23.html_para6">The number of scientific procedures in Great Britain in 1999 was nearly 2.66 million--very slightly down on 1998. The number of animals used was 2.57 million, about 24,000 fewer than in 1998. With the exception of 1997 this is the lowest number since 1955.

<a name="10508w23.html_para7">The overall reduction in the use of animals reflects the Government's commitment to applying the principles of the 3Rs to all animal testing in the United Kingdom. However, it is very difficult to project the number of animals to be used in future years. Numbers depend on the type of project licence applications that will be made and progress on current project licences, as well as global trends in scientific endeavour.

<P>

<a name="10508w24.html_para6">The new optical gun-sight is set to direct the L21A1 baton towards the lower part of the body, away from the potentially vulnerable areas of the upper thorax and head. At the furthest normal operating ranges, a small proportion of the L21A1 batons may strike the ground just before they hit the lower part of the body. The guidance to firers allows for compensatory action (ie to aim off) at these distances to reduce the risk of ricochet. In the event that a ricochet were still to occur, we would expect baton rounds to ricochet below the vulnerable areas of the head and upper thorax.

<P>
<BR>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Issue guidance to staff to allow pregnant, disabled, or elderly prisoners to sit down for as much of the search as possible providing that this does not reduce the thoroughness and effectiveness of the search.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. Post operative and bedridden prisoners and those who are in severe pain or have recently given birth should be strip searched only in exceptional circumstances. When it is necessary to carry out such a strip search, the procedure should be modified on an ad hoc basis to allow the least discomfort or intrusion. Searches should not be carried out if the healthcare professionals advise that it is clinically unacceptable.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5. Ensure managers set and communicate realistic targets for rub down searches, as part of the local searching strategy, particularly during periods of high movement.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Commission research to identify whether, and if so what, changes can be made in procedures for strip searching to improve its effectiveness.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment pursuant to his answer of 3 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 125W, for what reason the list of 1,140 organisations and 570 postcodes placed in the Library differs from the total of 2,330 organisations to which the consultation paper was sent; and if he will place the full list of the 2,330 organisations in the Library.  [160060]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The discrepancies in the list placed in the Library on 3 April were due to a clerical error. I apologise for the inconvenience caused by this. A full list has now been placed in the Library. I have asked officials to ensure that a full list is also sent to the hon. Member.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what major advertising campaigns his Department is carrying out; and what the cost and duration of each is.  [154263]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wills </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 March 2001]:</i> No advertising campaigns are currently being run by the Department. The Teacher Training Agency is continuing its campaign to recruit teachers.

<a name="10508w26.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Gibson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment (1) what changes in recruitment policy to medical schools there have been in the last five years, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> gender, <i>(b)</i> ethnicity and <i>(c)</i> social class;  [158442]
<P>
<UL>(2) what his policy is for medical student recruitment in the new medical schools in relation to <i>(a)</i> gender, <i>(b)</i> ethnicity and <i>(c)</i> social class.  [158443]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> The number of places at medical schools is set by the Government. However, higher education institutions are responsible for their own recruitment and admissions procedures, which should be transparent and based on published criteria so that selection is on the basis of an applicant's ability and potential.
<P>

<a name="10508w26.html_para0">The number of medical school places was increased by 1,100 in 2000 and by a further 1,000 earlier this year. In both cases, when medical schools bid for extra places they were asked to demonstrate an active commitment to the recruitment of students from a broad range of social and ethnic backgrounds, to reflect the patterns of the population that they serve.

 There is no evidence at this stage to suggest we need more teachers to deliver Curriculum 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if it is his policy to ensure that student contributions towards tuition fees should rise in line with inflation.  [159814]<P>

<P>
<a name="10508w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 May 2001]:</i> The maximum level of student contributions to tuition fees for students at publicly funded institutions is uprated each year to take account of inflation. In the next academic year it will be &#163;1,075. How much students actually pay depends on an assessment of their income. Currently, over 40 per cent. of students make no contribution to their tuition fees and that figure will rise to around 50 per cent. from this September because we have raised the contribution thresholds above the level of inflation. We estimate that from September the average contribution made by students will be just &#163;1,400 over the whole of a three-year course.

 Since May 1997 my Department has introduced and developed a variety of initiatives which will impact on my hon. Friend's constituency which promote our objectives of access, excellence, education, and creativity and employment. We have published strategies to take this forward including "Tomorrows Tourism" and "A Sporting Future for All", which was recently followed up by "The Government's Plan for Sport". We have tackled the issue of social inclusion taking forward the recommendations of Policy Action Team 10 on Arts and Sport and developing social inclusion policies across all our areas which is recognised within the most recent progress report Building on PAT10.
<P>

<a name="10508w29.html_para3">We have given more support to the cultural and sporting infrastructure.

In taking forward our aim to develop the educational potential of culture and sport &#163;40 million has been allocated to developing Creative Partnerships; we have established through lottery funding, the &#163;30 million National Foundation for Youth Music; and secured an additional &#163;130 million for primary schools sports and arts facilities through the Space for Sport and the Arts programme. With &#163;120 million of central Government and lottery funding we will be providing a school sports co-ordinator in one-in-four secondary schools to work with local primary and special schools to improve sporting provision and physical education for children in the most deprived areas. We have delivered free access to national museums for children and the over-60's and additional money will be provided to allow this to be extended to everyone by December 2001. We have commissioned a taskforce which is currently considering the issues facing non-national museums in the regions.
<P>

<a name="10508w29.html_para4">We have made improvements in the way the lottery is spent to ensure a fairer distribution. The introduction of the New Opportunities Fund for spending on health, education and the environment has made a real difference to communities everywhere. For instance it has invested &#163;120 million to support the People's Network, which will enable all 4,300 public libraries to offer free public internet access through UK online learning centres; and a further &#163;50 million to stimulate development of content to support the Network.

From 1 April 1999 Battersea residents under 16 were able to benefit from free admission to the Science Museum, the Natural History Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Imperial War Museum, HMS Belfast, the Cabinet War Rooms, the National Maritime Museum and the Museum of London. From 1 April 2000, Battersea residents over 60 were able to gain free admission to most of the above. Subject to the agreement of their Trustees, we expect very nearly all of the currently charging DCMS sponsored museums in London to introduce universal free admission from 1 December 2001.

 <i>[holding answer 27 April 2001]:</i> The courts decide whether legislative provisions are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. No declaration of incompatibility has been made in the domestic courts under the Human Rights Act 1998 as regards any provision of the Broadcasting Act 1996; nor has there been any finding of incompatibility in respect of that legislation by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. A statement about compatibility with Convention rights of the provisions of new broadcasting legislation will of course be made by Ministers, as required by the Human Rights Act 1998.

 The Department and the English Tourism Council (ETC) have had frequent discussions about additional funding for the Regional Tourist Boards (RTBs). The ETC have recently received &#163;3.8 million in additional funding for an advertising and promotion campaign, as part of the recovery plan following the foot and mouth outbreak. More than half of this funding is being passed to RTBs for public relations and marketing work. The Department has also been involved in discussions with DETR on the use of additional funds being provided to Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) as a response to the impact of foot and mouth disease, some of which the RDAs may choose to use to support promotional activities by the RTBs.

<a name="10508w32.html_para1">In addition to CAP direct payments, farmers in the UK are benefiting from &#163;1.35 billion in short-term financial relief since 2 May 1997. This includes &#163;785 million in agrimonetary compensation, worth some &#163;4,800 per average arable farmer; &#163;3,200 per average dairy farmer; &#163;1,400 per average sheep farmer; and &#163;1,140 and &#163;3,800 per average farmer for agrimonetary compensation related to the beef special premium scheme and suckler cow premium scheme respectively.
<P>

<a name="10508w32.html_para2">Since May 1997, the Government have more than doubled expenditure on agri-environment schemes in England. We now have more than twice as much land covered by countryside stewardship agreements and we have increased the funding of organic conversion from &#163;571,000 in 1997-98 to &#163;12 million in 2000-01 and &#163;18 million in 2001-02. Full-time hill farmers in England will be in receipt of some &#163;6,360 on average following the introduction of the hill farm allowance scheme this year. This compares to &#163;4,048 under the hill livestock compensatory allowance in 1996-97.

<a name="10508w32.html_para3">Truro and St. Austell also fall within an area with an objective 1 designation. This means that under the EU structural funds, the area is eligible for assistance to promote its development and structural adjustment. About &#163;50 million of European funding over the next six years is available for rural development measures in Cornwall and the Scilly Isles. This money will attract an equal amount of national public spending as matched funding, the majority of which will be provided by this Department. Details of these measures, which include

 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2001]:</i> We have no evidence to suggest that the foot and mouth outbreak originated from Chinese food or any other specific food source. Investigations are continuing in co-operation with trading standards but it is too soon to comment on detailed findings. The current outbreak is due to the type O, PanAsia strain virus. This strain is responsible for a number of outbreaks in different countries throughout the middle east, far east, and in Greece, Bulgaria and South Africa. One possibility is that the outbreak might have been caused by pigs eating untreated food originating from one of these countries.

If outbreaks of foot and mouth are still being confirmed in an area the movement restrictions cannot be lifted or relaxed. The area may also be extended to take account of windborne spread, particularly from pig premises. The procedure for lifting infected area restrictions involves a process of checking that there are no infected animals in the area surrounding the infected premises. An infected area may only be lifted 30 days after the preliminary cleansing and disinfection.

<P>

<a name="10508w33.html_para7">When infected areas cannot be completely lifted, because of the number of disease cases, the Ministry will consider reducing the boundaries. Decisions to reduce boundaries are made on a case-by-case basis in discussion with vets, taking into account the number and proximity of any confirmed FMD cases. The northern infected area has been reduced on two occasions, firstly to exclude Ripon (on 2 April) and then to release part of the Yorkshire Dales (on 20 April).
<P>

<a name="10508w33.html_para8">Compensation is payable for the market value of animals slaughtered to control foot and mouth disease. It is not payable for the consequential losses, for example caused by movement restrictions. Farmers in infected areas, whose animals face welfare difficulties as a result of foot and mouth movement restrictions, may be eligible for the livestock welfare (disposal) scheme, operated by the Intervention Board on behalf of MAFF, under which they receive a slightly reduced rate of compensation for all animals slaughtered.

 Immunity to foot and mouth disease is acquired by exposure to the virus or by vaccination. As there has not been a case of foot and mouth disease in Great Britain since 1981, and we do not permit routine vaccination, all susceptible livestock are assumed to be susceptible to foot and mouth disease virus.
<P>

<a name="10508w33.html_para11">During the current outbreak, it is possible that there may be livestock, particularly sheep, which have been exposed to infection but have not exhibited clinical symptoms.

<a name="10508w33.html_spnew13"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 April 2001]:</i> MAFF has posted on its website guidance to all in the rural community wishing to seek help during the foot and mouth disease outbreak. It has also circulated to all livestock farmers in England contact details for organisations which can provide confidential advice, guidance and financial assistance, including the rural stress information network, the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution, the farm crisis network and the Samaritans. Through a rural stress action plan funded by MAFF, details of these organisations have also been widely publicised on yellow contact cards and in magazines.

 The majority of veterinary inspection visits will have been carried out by now although a few final visits may still be being carried out. Some visits may be required for premises where a partial cull is required, for example, where only sheep or pigs are to be killed. If the farms were identified as dangerous contacts, visits will be made to supervise the cleansing and disinfection operations.

<P>
<a name="10508w33.html_spnew27"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Minister announced for England a broadening of the areas of discretion available to MAFF divisional veterinary managers. Under this revised policy, MAFF officials will continue to kill all animals which are dangerous contacts. On other contiguous premises, susceptible animals will be killed. However, cattle may be spared if there is adequate biosecurity. This will be a matter for local veterinary judgment.
<P>

<a name="10508w33.html_para14">MAFF has already published guidance on biosecurity measures which have been agreed with the veterinary profession. Where cattle are not culled they will be subject to regular veterinary patrols.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if <i>(a)</i> officials of his Department and <i>(b)</i> those acting on their behalf, asked participants in the insurance market in December 2000 and January 2001 about the availability, current and potential terms and affordability of insurance to cover losses to insureds consequent upon an event of an outbreak foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom.  [158379]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w33.html_spnew30"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> At the outset of the classical swine fever last year, the Minister established a Government/Industry working party to review ways in which the livestock industry could protect itself against the commercial consequences of any future animal disease outbreaks. The review covered the 14 OIE list A diseases that affect cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. Foot and mouth is one of these 14 diseases.
<P>

<a name="10508w33.html_para15">One area considered by the working group was the extent to which insurance could be used by farmers to cover the business risks associated with becoming caught up in statutory disease control measures. Officials met the Association of British Insurers on 6 December 2000 and on 10 January 2001, Lorien plc were engaged by the 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2001 : Column: 129W</I><P>

<P>
<a name="10508w33.html_spnew32"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Information about the disease and the action the Government have taken has been placed on the Ministry website. This website is updated every day with the latest information and advice. Information is also available from local MAFF animal health offices. Additionally, my right hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w33.html_spnew33"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> There are no abattoirs in Hampshire contracted to slaughter animals under the livestock welfare (disposal) scheme. There is one landfill site in the county that has been identified for the disposal of carcases under the scheme but this would only be used for local on-farm slaughters of pigs and/or sheep.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the possibility of using <i>(a)</i> flame-throwers and <i>(b)</i> napalm as a means of destroying animal carcases.  [159205]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w33.html_spnew35"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Flame-throwers are not in service in this country or in the USA because of safety concerns. Napalm produces very toxic compounds when burnt, so cannot be used because of the public and environmental health risks.
<P>

<a name="10508w33.html_para17">We recognise that burning at higher temperatures is more efficient and cleaner, and so there is a need to increase the temperature of pyres, particularly at the beginning of the burn while the water in the carcases is

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w33.html_spnew36"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2001]:</i> All livestock are examined by a veterinary surgeon prior to slaughter.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w33.html_spnew37"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> The Ministry has purchased 155 acres of land adjacent to the burial site at Throckmorton. The land was purchased as a buffer against the burial site and additionally as a contingency to provide extra burial capacity should it be needed. The land was purchased for &#163;3,875,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w33.html_spnew38"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2001]:</i> Burial on-farm of animals slaughtered through the Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme is not out of the question on grounds of policy, but is very difficult to implement. Many different organisations and agencies must be consulted to ensure that the site is safe, such as the Environment Agency, communication companies, gas and oil providers and water companies. This prolonged consultation makes on-farm burial too slow to be practical for the large numbers involved.

<a name="10508w33.html_spnew45"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2001]:</i> As there are seven main types of foot and mouth virus (each with many sub-types), it has been necessary to focus attention on the pan-Asiatic O type virus responsible for the current outbreak. Vaccines for this strain come in different forms and strengths and their impact can vary between 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 2001 : Column: 133W</I><P>
individual animals as well as species. However, no vaccine can be relied upon as being 100 per cent. effective against foot and mouth--not because it is in itself ineffective but either because it could be inadequately administered or because a small number of animals may respond a-typically and develop only a low level of immunity.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what conclusions he has reached following the consultations on proposals to protect rare breeds and hefted sheep; and if he will make a statement.  [160778]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w33.html_spnew54"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 On 19 April, proposals concerning the exemption of rare breeds and hefted sheep from the contiguous and 3 km cull were published and views sought. The vast majority of respondents to this exercise welcomed the proposals. Arrangements for exempting rare breeds of sheep and goats, and other pedigree sheep and goats of high genetic value, and genuinely hefted sheep, such as Herdwicks and Swaledales, from contiguous and 3 km culls have now been introduced and guidance issued. The guidance explains what information needs to be submitted to gain exemption. I am placing a copy of this guidance in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="10508w33.html_para32">These arrangements allow for owners of sheep or goats--who think their stock may qualify and are notified it is to be slaughtered as part of a contiguous or 3 km cull--to apply for exemption from their local divisional veterinary manager (DVM). Owners need to show that the animals can be isolated from other susceptible livestock, and managed in compliance with tight biosecurity. Before registration as an exempted flock/herd, the DVM will arrange for blood samples to be taken for testing. The results for these blood tests must be negative for registration to be granted; positive blood tests will result in the flock/herd being slaughtered.

<a name="10508w33.html_para33">The Department of Health's assessment of the risks to health of emissions from pyres burning carcases is published on its website www.doh.gov.uk/fmdguidance/ index.htm. Copies are also available in the Library. This assessment covers all sectors of the population, including pregnant women. Inhalation of smoke from pyres burning carcases is not considered to pose a risk to humans of infection with foot and mouth virus and so no difference in risk is anticipated from burning either infected or uninfected carcases.

 The Ministry has not commissioned any research in this area. The potential risks of releasing GM fish are well understood and are considered in a booklet published by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions entitled "Guidance for Experimental Releases of Genetically Modified Fish" (ACRE Guidance Note 8, February 1997). This is available in the House Library. Anyone proposing the release of a GM fish would have to submit a full dossier of risk assessment data as part of the statutory consent procedure.

 In line with EU directive 90/220, a consent to release transgenic fish would be granted only if a rigorous assessment confirmed there was no unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. The assessment would take into account the likelihood of farmed fish escaping into open waters and look in detail at the potential impact on wild stocks. This policy is fully in accord with the UN/FAO code of conduct for responsible fisheries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w34.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> The Ministry was already contracted partners to the EpiMan project in 1996. The start-up costs were approximately &#163;16,000. An updated version of the system was obtained and installed on Monday 19 February 2001 at no additional cost. The associated hardware was already available and access to expertise and advice, specifically for its use in the current epidemic, was operational from the time of confirmation of the first case. It is not possible to estimate the cost of operating this system.

<P>
<a name="10508w34.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> MAFF does not hold statistical information on a constituency basis relating to the Department's policies. Information on land use, crop areas, livestock numbers, and labour on holdings in England by parliamentary constituency has been produced from 1 June 1999 annual agricultural and horticultural census. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House. Information from the 1 June 2000 census has been placed in the House Library.
<P>

<a name="10508w34.html_para0">As many of the Department's policies flow from measures agreed within the framework of the EU common agricultural policy, statistical data are normally available on a UK or England basis. Farmers in the UK receive approximately &#163;3 billion per year in direct CAP payments. This does not include the significant additional costs to consumers as a result of CAP price supports which keep EU prices above prevailing world prices. The value of direct CAP payments to the average farmer is set out in the table.

<P>

<a name="10508w34.html_para6">One of the most important outcomes of Agenda 2000 was the establishment of the rural development regulation, which is being implemented in England through the England rural development programme (ERDP), investing around &#163;1.6 billion in rural areas over the period 2000-06.

In relation to the Department's responsibility for fisheries policy, our key priority is to protect our fisheries resources for the future and we are taking firm action to ensure a viable future for the fishing industry. The last set of grant schemes, which ended in 1999, invested over &#163;27 million in measures to help the fishing industry in England. Fishermen operating in the Plymouth, Sutton, Plymouth, Devonport and South-West Devon constituencies will now benefit from the &#163;22.5 million aid package announced on 2 April, to help restructure the English fishing industry, to improve the quality and value of the catch, and to retrain fishermen and rejuvenate fishing ports.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the reduction in the number of services for profound and multiple disabilities in the last three years.  [158085]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10508w36.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 It is the responsibility of local statutory authorities to determine the level of services required in their area. Data on services for people with profound and multiple disabilities are not held centrally, but it is widely recognised that the number of children and young people with profound and multiple disabilities who survive into adulthood is increasing. The recently published White Paper "Valuing People, a New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21 Century" specifically recognises the needs of people with profound and multiple disabilities.
<P>

<a name="10508w36.html_para0">It included our target for an additional 6,000 severely disabled children by 2002 to receive support by a co-ordinated care package from health and social services. Additionally integrated health and social services for children and young people with severe disabilities and complex needs will be one of the priority uses of the capital element of the learning disability development fund. Support for families of disabled children is also being given through the Government's "Quality Protects" programme and through the New Opportunity Fund providing grants for projects offering palliative care to children with life limiting illness and their families.

marketing authorisation ('off-label' use) is permitted under UK law where the clinician believes it is justified. This is a matter for clinical judgment, informed by specialist guidance produced by and available to the profession. The Medicines Control Agency and Committee on Safety of Medicines continue to monitor the safety of all medicines, whether used within their product licence or used unlicensed or 'off-label'.
<P>

<a name="10508w36.html_para2">It is our view that children should have access to medicines that have been fully evaluated for use in childhood. As medicines regulation in the UK derives largely from European legislation, an international approach is needed. We have therefore raised the profile of the issue at European level to encourage companies to undertake appropriate trials on the use of medicines in the treatment of children. This formed the basis for an international guideline, operational in the European Union from January, and applicable in the United States of America and Japan. In addition the European Commission has been asked to develop measures for children's medicines. We await their proposals.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many doctors specialising in ME are attached to NHS trusts in the <i>(a)</i> Cambridgeshire/ Peterborough, <i>(b)</i> Lincolnshire and <i>(c)</i> Northamptonshire health authority areas.  [160333]<P>

 The information requested is not available centrally or collected in Lincolnshire. Addenbrooke's national health service trust is reported to have five general neurologists working across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. In Northamptonshire, no one clinician has been identified with a particular interest in CFS/ME, although general physicians and neurologists are available to exclude alternative diagnosis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list for each appropriate English local authority the most recently available average amount which is spent per annum per child on children held in secure accommodation, together with the number of such secure placements in the most recent period for which figures are available.

<a name="10508w38.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 At 31 March 2000 there were 436 approved places in local authority secure accommodation. Information on numbers of children admitted to secure units and numbers of days that each child spends in secure units is not available. Information on numbers of children accommodated on 31 March is available but because the numbers are so small, and because of the likely variations in numbers in secure units on each day of the year, this would not produce reliable calculations of average spend per annum per child.

<a name="10508w39.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The United Kingdom national screening committee's proposals for a type 2 diabetes development project were approved on 2 April. Officials are now developing more detailed plans including a specification

 for the sites, finalised costings and a timetable for the project. The project is being designed to dovetail into existing research projects on screening for type 2 diabetes and should ensure that we have a clear picture of whether or not screening is the most appropriate way to improve identification of this condition. I expect to receive further updates from the UK national screening committee as the work progresses.
