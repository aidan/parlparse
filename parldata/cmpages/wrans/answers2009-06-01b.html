 British farmers work extremely hard in challenging circumstances and the competitiveness of the industry is a key concern of the Government. Between 1973 and 2008, the productivity (measured as total factor productivity<sup>(1)</sup>) of UK agriculture grew by 55 per cent.<sup>(2)</sup> In addition to productivity, the international competitiveness of UK farming also depends, at least partially, on the strength of sterling against the currencies of our major competitors. The recent weakening of the &#163; against the euro since mid-2008 has meant that British agricultural exports are priced more competitively against our European competitors thereby strengthening our position on the EU export markets. However, in order to maintain competitiveness in the longer term, the industry must improve its productivity performance relative to the farming industries in our main competitor countries, and the Government are committed to helping them do so.</p>

 For intra-community trade in live animals, there are no checks at point of entry. There are risk based post-import checks at point of ultimate destination (e.g. farm, market), which are carried out by Animal Health for diseases that are notifiable under EU and UK law.</p>

 The tables provided show the numbers of personnel in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force that have been compulsorily discharged in each year since 2006-07. The Army is unable to provide this information as it is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The Navy figures are for administrative and disciplinary discharge only as all other information could be provided only at disproportionate cost. During this period, the RAF was engaged in a significant redundancy programme to meet manning targets and this is reflected in the table. The RAF figures include personnel who have been discharged under the following exit methods; Administrative and Disciplinary, Medically Unfit and Compulsory and Voluntary Redundancy.</p>

 A very wide range of civilian and military staff carried out work on the 1998 Strategic Defence Review.

 In February 2006, The Future Role of Crombie Study made recommendations as to the future role and manpower requirements at DSDA Crombie. These recommendations were approved by the then Minister of State for Armed Forces. At the time it was determined that 26 posts would enable the safe and effective running of DSDA Crombie, as the site was to reduce to that of a jetty/waterfront support operation upon the intended drawdown of explosive storage and processing activity by 31 March 2010. Prior to the full implementation of the recommendations, additional work was transferred to Crombie from other DSDA sites, which brought with it an increase in manpower of 14 posts, although future manpower requirements at the site are still being considered.

 The illustrative mix (a scenario produced for impact assessment purposes) published alongside the CERT Order, demonstrated that 2.9 million cavities could be insulated by 2011. This has now been revised to a central case (i.e. a mid-range estimate of what suppliers might achieve) of 2.5 million. This is an illustration of what is achievable under CERT, to demonstrate its cost-effectiveness, and is not a plan of measures to be installed, nor an expectation of what suppliers will do. It is based on a variety of factors including our understanding of the energy supply chain. It is at energy suppliers&#146; discretion which of the eligible measures they promote, with levels of consumer demand a key factor in determining the number of measures installed.</p>

 The OECD-Development Assistance Committee produces statistics about past aid flows. However, research shows developing country governments and citizens face challenges in finding out how much aid their country receives. The Department for International Development (DFID) leads the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) which was launched in September 2008. It brings together donors, developing country governments and Non-Governmental Organisations to agree common information standards so they can share more and better information about aid. Agreement on essential elements of the standards is expected by the end of 2009. Further information on IATI is available on the DFID website:</p>

 Non-payment of a penalty notice for disorder (PND) does not of itself result in prosecution for failing to pay. Recipients of PNDs may either pay the penalty or opt for a court hearing, when they may be prosecuted for the original offence. If they do neither, a fine of one and a half times the amount of the penalty is registered against them, this is enforceable in the normal way for fines. Of the 45,146 penalty notices for disorder issued for shop theft in 2007, the latest year for which figures are available, 172 chose to have their case heard by a court and 24,344 fines were registered. Currently it is not possible to provide separate enforcement rates for fines arising from unpaid PNDs.</p>

 Evidence from the Labour Force Survey 2006-08 shows that there are around 40,000 people who have two jobs each paying below the lower earnings limit but when aggregated their earnings are at least equal to the lower earnings limit. Around half of these people are estimated to already be accruing entitlement to contributory benefits through other interactions with the system and represent less than 0.1 per cent. of all people accruing entitlement to state pension in those years.</p>

Reforms in the Pensions Act 2007, including the reduction in the number of qualifying years to 30 for a basic state pension, mean that from 2010 people reaching state pension age will have far greater opportunity to build up a full basic state pension entitlement.</p>

The 2004 Finance Act increased considerably the amount that could be trivially commuted from &#163;2,500 in 2005-06 to &#163;15,000 in 2006-07. This change benefits those with individual funds above the old limit. However, the limit applies to the aggregate value of all funds held by an individual (to ensure trivial commutation is not exploited for tax reasons) and so can still result in an individual with several pension funds facing one or more stranded pots.</p>

These amend rules so that small occupational pension pots of less than &#163;2,000 can be commuted as a trivial lump sum irrespective of the total value of funds held by the individual. This will help to ease the problem of stranded pensions.</p>

 In assessing entitlement to housing benefit and council tax benefit, regard is had to all forms of income. This includes taking into account in full any working tax credit and child tax credit in payment.</p>

Where a student does not have a student loan and is not treated as having one, a standard amount towards the costs of books and equipment is deducted from the student&#146;s annual grant income. From the start of the 2008-09 academic year, this amount is &#163;380 for books and equipment and &#163;295 for travel. Any part of the grant paid for child care is disregarded. Additionally, if a student was to receive grants paid specifically for any non-maintenance elements, such as books and travel costs, these are also completely disregarded.</p>

 Under the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, control of fluid intake is used to motivate monkeys so that they will perform extended sequences of behaviour in behavioural neuroscience experiments. The monkeys are trained to perform simple or complex tasks for which small amounts of a fluid, referred to as rewards or reinforcers, are used to motivate the animals and maintain behavioural or cognitive performance. The fluid control may involve limiting the time fluid is available, or may involve reducing the total amount fluid provided per day. Ultimately, thirst and the food reward for continuing the task, becomes a motivator for reliable performance.</p>

<i> [holding answer 12 May 2009]:</i><i> </i>There is no authoritative definition of the term &#145;household products&#146; and it is not defined in any national or international legislation. However, in the context of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, regard is paid to the definition of finished household products as set out in the 2002 publication on &#147;The Use of Animals in Testing Household Products&#148; produced by the Boyd Group, a forum encompassing a wide rage of expertise and perspectives concerned with the use of animals in scientific procedures. All products that are primarily intended for use in the home fall within the sub-category of &#145;Substances used in the household&#146; and would include such products as detergents and other laundry products, household cleaners, air-fresheners, toilet blocks, polishes, paper products such as infant nappies, paints, glues (and removers), other furnishing and DIY products and household pesticides. The sub-category applies to both finished household products and their ingredients, although in practice mainly the latter are tested.</p>

 The illegal supply of Class B drugs is a serious matter. Trafficking in controlled drugs of all classes needs to be tackled robustly in order to reduce the harm drugs cause to communities and the organised criminality associated with their supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_455"><a name="90601w0036.htm_para2"><a name="0906023000782">The Government&#146;s strategy is to bear down on all points in the drugs supply chain in order to disrupt criminal gangs, stifle drug supply and reduce the harm caused to communities in the UK.

<p><a name="stpa_456"><a name="90601w0036.htm_para3"><a name="0906023000783">The latest figures published show that in 2007-08, there were 8,671 seizures of Class B drugs by the police and HMRC in England and Wales, up 4 per cent. from the 8,304 seizures the previous year. The majority of the Class B seizures in 2007-08 were amphetamines, with 8,412 in 2007-08, an increase of 5 per cent. from the previous year.</p>

 The Government take all fraud seriously wherever it is perpetrated, which is why we have allocated &#163;29 million in new funding over three years to implement the National Fraud Programme which includes establishing a National Fraud Authority; a National Fraud Reporting Centre and a National Lead Force for investigating serious and complex fraud. The National Fraud Authority which brings together Government, law enforcement and industry representatives, became operational in October last year and on 19 March published the first National Fraud Strategy which will benefit all areas of the country. The National Fraud Reporting Centre will equip law enforcement agencies with a powerful intelligence tool, enabling the police to collate information from fraud cases across the country, leading to better intelligence and hence better targeted operations, as well as better prevention advice for businesses and the public.

<p><a name="stpa_508"><a name="90601w0040.htm_para12"><a name="0906023001186">The National DNA Database (NDNAD) plays a key role in catching criminals, eliminating the innocent from investigations and focusing the direction of inquiries. It is also one of the few long-term investigation tools, sometimes identifying criminals many years after they believe they have escaped detection. The purpose of the NDNAD is to match DNA profiles left at crime scenes with DNA profiles from known subjects and thereby provide the police with a lead for further investigation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_509"><a name="90601w0040.htm_para13"><a name="0906023001187">As at 30 March 2009 there were 5,614,411 subject profile records retained on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) from all police forces, relating to approximately 4,856,466 individuals. Of these, 5,258,779 were from English and Welsh police forces, relating to approximately 4,548,844 individuals. In addition, as at 31 December 2008 there were 343,657 crime scene profiles retained on the NDNAD, of which 329,482 were from English and Welsh police forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_510"><a name="90601w0040.htm_para14"><a name="0906023001188">The reason why the number of subject profile records is not the same as the number of individuals is that it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion; that is, some profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names or different versions of their name on separate arrests, or because profiles are upgraded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_511"><a name="90601w0040.htm_para15"><a name="0906023001189">All NDNAD records have the same structure consisting of 36 data fields. However, some of these fields are only relevant to subject profiles, and some are only relevant to crime scene profiles. Therefore, no record will have all data fields completed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_514"><a name="90601w0040.htm_para18"><a name="0906023001192">As at the end of February 2009, the IDENT1 (National Fingerprint Database) Unified Collection of Print Sets contained the verified identities of 7.8 million individuals, with which were associated 16.9 million sets of ten-prints and 6.7 million palm prints.

 The Government have supported the establishment and development of the Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) network since 2003-04.

Sources of funding for SARCs include police forces and primary care trusts, police authorities, hospitals, local authorities, local crime and disorder reduction partnerships and community safety partnerships, local criminal justice boards and donations from businesses and private benefactors. National service guidelines on developing SARCs have been produced jointly by the Home Office and Department of Health which strongly encourage those who commission health and police services to invest in SARCs in line with local assessments of need.</p>

 The Government have committed to ensuring that every police force has access to a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) by 2011. There are 28 SARCs operating and a further nine in development. Every Government office area has a SARC either in operation or in development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_536"><a name="90601w0041.htm_para4"><a name="0906023001389">As part of the 2008-09 SARC funding round the Home Office funded a team of experts led by the Department of Health to assist areas who have yet to develop a SARC with their plans for one. In 2009-10, &#163;1.6 million has been made available for new and existing Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs). &#163;659,000 was allocated in September 2008. A further &#163;941,000 was announced in April 2009 and organisations have until 3 June to submit bids. Priority for funding will be given to areas that do not currently have access to a SARC.</p>

 The Home Office provides core funding of &#163;75,000 each to the two umbrella organisations representing victims of sexual violence: (i) Rape Crisis England and Wales; and (ii) The Survivors Trust. That funding has continued in 2009-10. In addition, the Home Office has contributed to the cross-Government Special Fund of &#163;1.6 million for specialist sexual violence voluntary sector organisations which was announced on 19 March by the Minister for Women and Equality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_537"><a name="90601w0041.htm_para5"><a name="0906023001392">The Special Fund and other central Government funds are provided in addition to local funding which may be provided, for example, from local authorities, health bodies and charitable trusts. Local decision makers are best placed to assess local needs, and Government expect the majority of funding to the sexual violence voluntary sector to come from local sources. The Government recognise the ongoing funding problems experienced by the sexual violence voluntary sector, particularly in respect of accessing local funding. We are working with our delivery partners to consider what more can be done to assist organisations to access local funding. This follows on from the recommendations made by the Home Office's Stakeholder Advisory Group on Sexual Violence and Abuse Funding Sub-group.</p>

 The Government do not maintain a list of recognised faiths. The Equality Act 2006 and the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003 define religion and belief as &#147;any religion or any religious or philosophical belief or any lack of such religion or belief&#148;. This broad definition is in line with that in article 9 of the European convention on human rights, which also stipulates that a religion must have a clear structure and belief system. This is consistent with the guidance notes for applications to the Faith Communities Capacity Building Fund. If there is any question of doubt as to whether or not something constitutes a religion or belief within that definition then it would ultimately be a matter for the courts to determine.</p>

 The framework document for the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) provides that for project-based programmes, prior Community and Local Government (CLG) approval is required for any projects which involve proposed public expenditure of &#163;10 million or over, expenditure that is potentially novel, contentious or repercussive, or an endowment (to support the ongoing maintenance and upkeep of amenity lands). It also provides for CLG approval for any project under the Community Infrastructure Fund, for all PFI projects, and for all novel or major joint venture projects.

In addition EP sought CLG approval to enter into an interest in a number of bodies in recent years, many of which would have led to expenditure for revenue support of the body; all such subsidiary undertakings are listed in EP's annual report and accounts.</p>

 We are confident that the range of initiatives announced in &#147;The Learning Revolution&#148; White Paper will both increase the number of learning opportunities and help people access the many and varied kinds of learning that are already available. Adults want to learn in different ways&#151;through structured classes and through libraries, museums, self-organised groups, membership organisations and online.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_583"><a name="90601w0046.htm_para7"><a name="0906023002307">Our goal is that all adults are able to access a wide range of informal learning opportunities and that learning experiences are better joined-up so that people can pursue their interests. &#147;The Learning Revolution&#148; sets out proposals that will help achieve this goal, including increasing the availability of free and low cost spaces for learning, launching a &#163;20 million Transformation Fund to reach out to new and different learners through partnership and innovation, setting up a support package for local learning champions and harnessing the potential of broadcasting and technology to support and enhance learning.</p>

 Information on whether individual courses are over-subscribed or under-subscribed is not collected centrally. FE colleges and providers are independent institutions and are responsible for determining their own curriculum offer in order to respond to the demand locally from learners and employers. The curriculum offered by colleges will therefore change to respond to this demand rather than being a set offer that learners and employers apply for. Funding for these courses will also reflect demand and reward those colleges and providers that are most effective at meeting local demand. This will include moving funding from under performing colleges and providers in order to support those over performing.</p>

 Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 on the Community Trade Mark makes no changes that have legal effect. Instead it renumbers the regulation on trade marks, and brings into one place the amendments previously made to it. This codification therefore makes it easier for the regulation to be read. We have been told that the codification will necessitate the rewriting of some legal texts and guidance referring to the previous version of the regulation.</p>

 The Russian Security Council published its Arctic strategy, the &#145;Foundations of Russia's Arctic Policy until 2020 and beyond&#146;, on 23 March 2009. It is important to note that the Russian strategy is not just about militarisation. It also includes plans for social and economic development, ecological security, science and technology and international cooperation. With climate change making the region increasingly accessible we support continuing dialogue on this issue between Russia, US, Canada, Denmark and Norway, through the Arctic Council and other international institutions and within international law, most significantly the UN convention on the law of the sea, which provides the framework for the delineation of the Arctic continental shelf.</p>

 Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC) natural resources have the potential to bring prosperity to the country and help improve the quality of life for people living there through better revenue collection and the creation of wealth and jobs. However, a proportion of those resources are controlled by militias and ill-disciplined members of the DRC armed forces who commit many of the abuses suffered by civilians and who fund themselves, in part, by trading minerals. This is one of a range of factors contributing to the poor standard of human rights in DRC. Better regulatory control over the trade in minerals from DRC and effective measures to discourage transactions which benefit militia groups there, will help improve the human rights situation. We are already working with our partners across Whitehall and internationally to identify ways of achieving this.</p>

The work of the Group of Experts is essential to monitor compliance with the terms of the embargo. Individuals and entities who support illegal militias in eastern DRC through illicit trade in natural resources may now be made subject to sanctions.

1. School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>
2. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DCSF (formerly DFES). 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) to schools and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables.<br>
3. The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil. From 2002-03 onwards only the schools element of these categories is included and this accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the 2002-03 total. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>
4. Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within each sector and are drawn from the DCSF School Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>
5. Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place during the mid to late 1990's and those LAs that did not exist either pre or post LGR are shaded out for those years.<br>
6. Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br>
7. Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999-2000.<br>
8. School based expenditure in LA maintained nursery schools was not recorded in 2002-03 and comparable figures are not available for 2003-04 onwards.<br>
9. Figures are as reported by local authorities as at 12 May 2009 and are rounded to the nearest &#163;10. 2007-08 data are subject to change by the local authority.<br>
10. Cash terms figures as reported by local authorities as at 12 May 2009.<br>

 The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has begun a transformation programme, with the creation within its existing powers of interim Ofqual in April 2008; the restructuring of the rest of the QCA as it evolves into the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA); and relocation of QCA to Coventry by early 2010 in line with commitments following Sir Michael Lyons&#146; Independent Review of Public Sector Relocation. Approximately &#163;3 million was spent in 2008-09 on establishing interim Ofqual and relocating it to Coventry by June 2009. These costs include the costs of recruitment, relocation, restructuring, additional staff reflecting the new approach to regulation, and communications. Over the same period, QCA spent &#163;150,000 on restructuring and communications as it evolves into the QCDA.</p>

 We are unable to provide figures for the number of racist bullying incidents in schools as this information is not collected centrally.

 When considering an application to dispose of school playing fields Ministers take into account any authorised community use of the land in question. Where any authorised community users would be displaced if the application were to be approved, we expect the application to include a full account of the effect on those users, particularly whether their activities can realistically be moved to an alternative site on terms which do not adversely affect the users.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families when he expects the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency to be set up; and what mechanisms there will be for the agency to co-operate with specialist independent post-16 institutions. [275806]</p>

 Independent Specialist providers of post-16 education and training play an important role in providing education for learners with learning difficulties and disabilities, often with very specific needs and requirements. We recognise the value of having a diverse mix of high quality providers that ensures that our young people are able to access the right course or provision to help them realise their goals and ambitions. We do not feel it is appropriate to centrally guarantee funding streams for particular institutions. Local authorities will need to work in partnership with each other, providers and young people and their families to assess the level of demand in their area and to commission suitable provision that meets young people&#146;s needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_731"><a name="90601w0062.htm_para3"><a name="09060263004002">Provision has been made in clause 40 of the ASCL Bill to require local authorities, when commissioning provision, to take account of the quality of provision being secured and encourage diversity in the range of education and training on offer to support learner choice. In addition, in deciding whether education and training is suitable to meet young people&#146;s reasonable needs, local authorities will be required to have regard to any learning difficulties the persons may have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_732"><a name="90601w0062.htm_para4"><a name="09060263004003">We believe that the transfer to local authorities will have significant benefits in terms of a more informed and integrated commissioning of their services leading to better outcomes for learners. Arrangements are being developed, in consultation with stakeholders, that recognise that independent specialist colleges will often work across local authority boundaries and nationally, and consideration is being given to the need to minimise bureaucracy for these and other learning providers. These arrangements will feed into the statutory guidance being developed for local authorities in respect of their commissioning responsibilities which the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency (YPLA) will publish when it comes into being in April 2010, subject to the passage of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning (ASCL) Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_733"><a name="90601w0062.htm_para5"><a name="09060263004004">We do not expect the YPLA to be involved in the commissioning of learning provision in the vast majority of cases, although there may be some circumstances where it may need to commission provision directly, for instance:</p>
<a name="90601w0062.htm_brev1"><a name="09060263004177"><ul><p class="tabletext">where a local authority is failing or looks likely to fail in fulfilling its duties under clauses 40 and 47 of the Bill to commission suitable education or training;</p>
</ul><a name="90601w0062.htm_brev2"><a name="09060263004178"><ul><p class="tabletext">with a small number of national providers for whom it may be appropriate to commission at a national rather than local level; and</p>
</ul><a name="90601w0062.htm_brev3"><a name="09060263004179"><ul><p class="tabletext">where the sub regional group (SRG) identifies that they are not yet ready to take on the role.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_734"><a name="90601w0062.htm_para6"><a name="09060263004005">In those cases, the YPLA will need to engage those providers, including specialist colleges, to ensure that they are commissioned effectively in response to the needs of young people.</p>
