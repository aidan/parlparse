This was because the level of these cancers among the control group was lower than would be expected for the general population rather than because it was higher for those who took part in the tests. These findings did not correlate with the risk of exposure from ionising radiation; rather, levels in the controls were inexplicably low. The 1993 analysis extended follow up to the end of 1990. Rates of multiple myeloma and the relevant leukaemias in the additional follow-up years were slightly lower in test participants compared with controls, whose rates were as in the general population. Because the differential increase in incidence of the relevant leukaemias mirrors the likely pattern of radiation-induced leukaemias, it was accepted that a possible slight risk of lymphatic leukaemia (other than chronic leukaemia) in the first 25 years after participation could not be ruled out. The small hazard of multiple myeloma in the 1988 report was not found in 1993 and was considered a chance finding. Both the 1988 and 1993 studies found that presence at the sites had no detectable effect on the risk of developing any other malignancy. A further study, published in 2003, also confirmed these findings.</p>

<p><a name="st_195"><a name="060517124000045"><a name="60517w0010.htm_spnew18"><a name="060517124000124"><b>Dr. Howells:</b> Iran's leaders have said on a number of occasions in recent weeks that Iran might consider withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) in certain circumstances. For example, President Ahmadinejad said on 24 April,</p>
<a name="60517w0010.htm_brev4"><a name="060517124000107"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#145;working in the framework of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the (International Atomic Energy) agency (IAEA) is our concrete policy, but if we see that they are violating our rights, or they don&#146;t want to accept (our rights), well, we will revise&#146;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_430"><a name="60517w0010.htm_para10"><a name="060517124000046">On 7 May, 160 Majlis deputies issued a statement saying that if the United Nations Security Council adopted a Resolution on Iran under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the Majlis would oblige the Iranian government to consider withdrawing from the NPT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_431"><a name="60517w0010.htm_para11"><a name="060517124000047">Such comments are hard to reconcile with President Ahmadinejad&#146;s claim at the UN General Assembly in September 2005 that &#147;continued interaction and technical and legal co-operation with the IAEA will be the centrepiece of our nuclear policy&#148;, and with the commitment of Iran&#146;s Ambassador to the IAEA in August 2005 that Iran would &#147;never&#148; leave the NPT. They have presumably been made to influence Security Council deliberations presently under way. As the IAEA Board and the Security Council have made clear, Iran needs to build confidence that its nuclear programme is for exclusively peaceful purposes, including by reinstating a full suspension of all enrichment-related and reprocessing activity and increasing transparency with the IAEA. Threats to withdraw from the NPT have the opposite effect, undermining international confidence still further.</p>

This process normally takes several years. The next steps will be to establish a working party of WTO members that indicate an interest, and for Iran to submit a memorandum on foreign trade describing its current trading regime and setting out the reforms it intends to make in order to ensure that this regime is compatible with WTO norms. The European Union has traditionally supported the principle of Iran's accession to the WTO, which should promote economic reform, liberalisation, transparency and respect for property rights, and reduce discriminatory trade practices. As part of the accession process, Iran must agree acceptable terms and complete bilateral negotiations with all interested WTO parties before it could finally join.</p>

The Home Office continues to work closely with Centrex on that process and, once options begin to emerge, we will be in a position to engage with local people over the future use of the site. The Centrex estates and facilities management team, along with staff working on behalf of my Department, have already begun preliminary discussions with local planning authorities around all three Centrex sites that are closing and will be focusing more effort on these discussions over the coming months.</p>

Member&#146;s concern at the portrayal of women in some parts of the media. However, I believe there is a significant difference between material which is intended or is likely to stir up hatred and material which may &#147;objectify&#148; a person and it would be a very large step to criminalise material in the second group. Moreover, in practical terms, hatred is a concept well understood by the courts&#151;it includes behaviour which is likely directly to drive up violence and the fear of violence. It is less clear what &#147;sexually objectifying material&#148; is and what the direct effects of such material would be. I believe there would be genuine difficulties for the courts in defining &#147;sexually objectifying material&#148;. This could cover a very wide range of material including much that is commonly available through the media, works of art and comedy material.</p>

The decision will not impact on the Government&#146;s ability to fight terrorism, or change current practices, as the Government&#146;s own stated policy was already not to rely on evidence which we knew or believed to have been obtained as a result of torture. It is not always possible to know where all intelligence information has come from or the precise circumstances under which it was obtained. The Security Service and Secret Intelligence Service receive material from a wide range of foreign intelligence services. The agencies evaluate the reliability of this intelligence against other information available to them. It is then passed, together with an assessment of reliability, to the Government. It may be necessary in some circumstances to rely operationally on material which may have been obtained through the use of torture where it is considered necessary to do so, in particular for preventing terrorist attack and protecting life. The House of Lords judgment confirmed that material which had or may have been obtained through torture could be used for operational purposes.</p>

Courts have the discretion to exclude evidence if it is unduly prejudicial or unfair, and a judicial discretion to stay proceedings if they are considered to be an abuse of the court's process. Defendants also enjoy the protections afforded by Article 6 of the ECHR, the right to a fair trial. Article 3 of the ECHR also prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. In addition, a confession is not admissible unless it meets the requirements set out in sections 76 and 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE). That is, the evidence will not be admissible if it is unreliable or has been obtained by oppression.

Most trades qualify, as long as they are conducted on a commercial basis, but some are excluded, including those involving leasing or hiring.

<p><a name="stpa_559"><a name="60517w0027.htm_para0"><a name="06051866000905">Car clubs are unlikely to qualify under the EIS. Many of them are organised on a not-for-profit basis and so are not trading on a commercial basis with a view to profit.

Early detection and appropriate care management is important for women with multiple pregnancies and will produce a healthier outcome for both the mother and baby. The benefits of early screening also extend to screening for other conditions such as sickle cell anaemia and Thalassaemia, so that screening and the follow on diagnosis can take place at the correct time.</p>

In relation to national screening programmes, an early dating scan is a set standard agreed by an expert working group who recommend that all women prior to Down&#146;s syndrome screening must have a dating scan to ensure the quality of the screening test. Guidance for health professionals on more accurate tests for Down&#146;s syndrome screening was published by the Department in November 2003. This guidance, based on advice from the national screening committee, which advises Ministers on all aspects of screening, complements and supports national health service implementation of the NICE guideline.</p>

Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospitals, including mental health trusts, or private prescriptions.  <i> Prescription Items</i> Prescriptions are written on a prescription form. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item. <i> Exemption Category Estimates</i>  The exemption data is identified from the box ticked on the back of the prescription form and relies on the form being completed correctly which may not always be the case. Information for categories that are not required to pay a charge (e.g. children) is based on a 1 in 20 sample of all exempt prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists, appliance contractors and dispensing doctors. The information we have is therefore an estimate and subject to sampling errors. To reflect this we have rounded the exemption figures appropriately-figures less than 1,000 are shown as "*"; figures between 1,000 and 100,000 have been rounded to the nearest 1,000 and figures between 100,000 and 1 million have been rounded to the nearest 10,000. Data for total of all ages has not been rounded since it is not exemption data. Due to rounding, the sum of the components may not equal the totals.  Children are defined as 0-15 year olds, and as 16-18 year olds in full time education. <i> Dispensing Doctors</i> Data up to 2000 are not strictly comparable with data from later years. Up until September 2000 only patients having their prescriptions dispensed by the community pharmacists and appliance contractors were required to complete the back of the prescription form, but from October 2000 this requirement was extended to patients of dispensing doctors. Therefore data prior to October 2000 do not include prescriptions dispensed by dispensing doctors.<br>

However, there is a degree of flexibility in how this is managed at a local level. SHAs can agree a recovery plan which phases the recovery of deficits over a number of years. This would require other NHS organisations within the health economy to under spend over the same period. Any such arrangements would have to be subject to the agreement of local providers, commissioners and the managing SHA.</p>
