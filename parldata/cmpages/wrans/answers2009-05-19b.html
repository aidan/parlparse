 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reasons the Waste and Resources Action Programme plans to end its support for subsidised composting bins for householders; on what date such support will end; and what estimate has been made of the average change in the cost to a householder of a compost bin as a result. [275761]</p>

<p><a name="st_203"><a name="09051969000543"><a name="90519w0005.htm_spnew1"><a name="09051969001396"><b>Jane Kennedy:</b>
 The Waste and Resources Action Programme's (WRAP's) home composting campaign used central funding to subsidise the sale of home composting bins for five years. In that time two million home compost bins were sold and 40 per cent. of households with gardens are now home composting. It is estimated that, as a result of WRAP'S programme, more than 300,000 tonnes of organic waste have been diverted from the waste stream each year, resulting in significant waste management and disposal cost savings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_423"><a name="90519w0005.htm_para0"><a name="09051969000544">Having demonstrated the benefits of promoting home composting, it was appropriate for local authorities to decide how home composting should fit within their waste strategies and for them to take responsibility for deciding on a suitable level of subsidy. WRAP stopped subsidising compost bins at the end of March 2009. As a result, the full cost of bins to consumers rose by an average of &#163;8, except where the local authority decided to offer its own subsidy. A total of 37 waste disposal authorities are currently offering varying degrees of subsidy. WRAP will continue to promote home composting to the public and provide practical advice and support as part of a wider waste reduction programme.</p>

 The UK Border Agency is continuing to increase the number of identity cards issued to foreign nationals granted further permission to stay in the country. In time, card readers will be made available so that the cardholder&#146;s biometric and biographical features can be checked against the card, although a timetable for their introduction has not been established. At present, cards may currently be verified using the card verification phone line and as the volume of cards in circulation increases other forms of verification will be introduced.</p>

Any wider introduction of readers would be linked to the incremental rollout of the National Identity Service as detailed in the National Identity Service Delivery Update 2009 published on 6 May 2009.</p>

 The facilitated returns scheme was launched in October 2006 as an incentive to persuade foreign prisoners to return voluntarily to their own country. The scheme offers a package of reintegration assistance to the individual, however no financial incentives are offered. The only cash the individual receives is the standard &#163;46 discharge grant provided to all prisoners, including British nationals. The level of assistance offered is variable and is dependant upon the individual circumstances of each case. Around half of those who are removed under the provisions of the scheme receive reintegration assistance. There has been only one instance where an individual who has been transferred to a prison within the country of origin has been provided reintegration assistance.</p>

It remains open to them to make such an application. Once removed from the UK under the scheme's provisions, they are excluded from re-entering the UK.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what procedure his Department follows for dealing with complaints received <i> (a)</i> by e-mail, <i> (b)</i> by post, <i> (c)</i> by telephone and <i> (d)</i> via his Department's website. [274514]</p>

 The Department for Work and Pensions and its agencies deal with all complaints on an equal basis, however they are made. How they are dealt with will depend on whether the complaint is about a decision on entitlement, for which there is generally a right of appeal, or about the manner in which the service is delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_465"><a name="90519w0009.htm_para9"><a name="09051969000855">For example, customers who are dissatisfied with any statutory decision made by Jobcentre Plus can appeal. In the first instance, the decision is reviewed by another decision-maker. If the decision remains unchanged after the review, Jobcentre Plus sends the case to the Tribunals Service as part of the appeal process. The Tribunals Service are responsible for administering the appeals process and contact customers about the hearing, which may be held in person or by correspondence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_466"><a name="90519w0009.htm_para10"><a name="09051969000856">Jobcentre Plus treats decisions complained about in correspondence as an appeal and automatically reconsiders the decision. Where appropriate, Jobcentre Plus contacts the customer for further information to support the appeal process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_467"><a name="90519w0009.htm_para11"><a name="09051969000857">Most complaints about the service provided can be resolved straightaway by the person dealing with the customer and each of the Department's agencies seeks to achieve this. Each has a clear and simple process for dealing with customer complaints and details of this are contained in their leaflets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_468"><a name="90519w0009.htm_para12"><a name="09051969000858">Where failings are identified we provide appropriate redress, which might typically include an apology, correction of any error and, where appropriate, financial redress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_469"><a name="90519w0009.htm_para13"><a name="09051969000859">Where a customer is not satisfied with the response given to their complaint they can ask for a review of the complaint and any redress given. This will first be by a senior manager and, if the customer remains dissatisfied, by the chief executive of the agency concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_470"><a name="90519w0009.htm_para14"><a name="09051969000860">If the customer remains dissatisfied, he or she can ask the independent case examiner (ICE) to review matters. A request for ICE to investigate should be made within six months of the chief executive's response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_471"><a name="90519w0009.htm_para15"><a name="09051969000861">The ICE will consider complaints about service delivery, though not matters of law or Government policy. He will review the papers and attempt to mediate. If this is not possible he will report his findings and inform the customer of their right to ask a MP to refer the matter to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.</p>

 The UK Government continue to monitor the humanitarian situation in Abyei and Southern Kordofan closely. The population of Abyei (and surrounding areas) is fewer than 50,000, most living in displaced camps in Agok, with 650 in Southern Kordofan. United Nations (UN) sources indicate that the humanitarian system is stable, although the situation remains tense, with the coming rains posing an increased risk of disease and logistical challenges in the delivery of assistance. We are also expecting the results of a recent joint UN/Government assessment of the NGO expulsions impact on the transitional areas, which should provide a more comprehensive picture of any gaps in the humanitarian response and impact on future recovery programmes.</p>

Our 2008 share of the CHF was around 50 per cent. at &#163;40 million. For 2009, we have provided a further &#163;36 million. In addition, the UK Government are supporting recovery in the police (Abyei) and education sectors (up to &#163;5.7 million), and through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) which has provided $28.67 million in funding for Southern Kordofan.</p>

However, further major support from the AfDB, from other institutions such as the IMF and World Bank and from the wider donor community will only be made available when we begin to see evidence of a commitment to political and economic reform. Establishing a track record on strong and competent fiscal management and tackling debt arrears will be key issues for the Inclusive Government in building confidence with the international community to support recovery.</p>

 In the financial year 2008-09 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spent &#163;26 million on centrally funded telecommunications services, net of VAT. The contract with the current supplier, Global Crossing, was signed on 10 May 2000.</p>

Savings arising from changed technologies and market conditions have been identified and passed on by the supplier as an agreed series of cost reductions. As a result the amount paid in 2008-09 was &#163;26 million, not the &#163;32 million originally agreed. This mechanism will operate for the remaining duration of the contract.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary regularly discusses the situation in Sri Lanka with his counterparts in the UN Security Council, most recently on 11 May 2009.

Once a programme is presented, it will be assessed on its merits and the situation on the ground in Sri Lanka at the time to decide whether it will help the people of Sri Lanka.</p>

Under the decision, Spain has put forward a site of community importance under the Habitats Directive which encompasses BGTW, including an existing site designated by the UK under the same directive. As the UK is the only member state competent to propose a site covering BGTW, we do not recognise the validity of the adopted site. The UK is deeply concerned that Spain should seek to designate an area of BGTW and that this designation should have been approved.</p>

Students in this table applying to English institutions may also have applied to institutions in one or more of the other home countries, and some may have been accepted to institutions in those countries.<br>
2. In 2008 the Nursing and Midwifery Admissions System (NMAS) was subsumed in to the UCAS application system and part of the increase from 2007 to 2008 can be attributed this factor. There were 14,184 applicants who were accepted to former NMAS courses, the majority of whom were English domiciled (and NMAS was only for English institutions).<br>

<i> [holding answer 15 May 2009]:</i> The Government provide generous pensions tax relief to support saving to produce an income in retirement. These generous reliefs include the ability to take up to 25 per cent. of a pension fund as a tax free lump sum. The remainder should be used to produce an income throughout retirement. Where funds are considered small the member may be able to take the whole fund as a lump sum. These rules are regularly reviewed.</p>
