<a name="91220w01.html_wqn0"><B> Valerie Davey: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if he will make a statement concerning the consideration by the Crown Prosecution Service of the five cases covering the Mitrokhin archive and related matters which were referred to by the Home Secretary in his oral statement of 21 October 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 587-99.  [103901]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 In his statement of 21 October, the Home Secretary informed the House that, in the light of Mrs. Melita Norwood's recent statements, the papers in her case were being studied again by the prosecuting authorities. He also stated that four other cases were being considered. Those cases included those of Robin Pearson and John Symonds.
<P>

<a name="91220w01.html_para0">I can now inform the House that the CPS has decided not to refer the papers in any of the five cases to the police for investigation. The reason in each instance is the same, namely, that sufficient is known about the case to make it clear that any prosecution would fail. Having reached that view, it would be quite wrong for the CPS to ask the police to undertake a criminal investigation.
<P>

<a name="91220w01.html_para1">In the case of Mrs. Norwood, the intelligence information about her case would not be admissible as evidence; her statements to the media would probably be ruled to be inadmissible as evidence; there is little prospect of obtaining admissible evidence; and in any event any prosecution would probably be stayed on the ground of abuse of process. Similar considerations apply to the case of Mr. Pearson. In the case of Mr. Symonds, an immunity, granted by the DPP's office in 1984 in connection with inquiries into other matters, precludes a prosecution.
<P>

<a name="91220w01.html_para2">The Law Officers have been consulted about each case, and we agree with the conclusions reached by the CPS. Each decision has been made only after careful and detailed consideration.
<P>

<a name="91220w01.html_para3">It is not usual for the Law Officers to make announcements concerning their consideration of individual criminal cases. The rationale for this is straightforward. If it is considered that there is a case against an individual, and the public interest is in favour of a prosecution, then the proper course is to put the facts before the court and let justice take its course. If it is considered that there is no case against an individual, or the public interest is against a prosecution, then to give publicity to that decision will inevitably draw attention to the individual, attention which he or she may not welcome and which will not often be deserved.
<P>

<a name="91220w01.html_para4">In this instance, a different course is being followed because the allegations against the three individuals named in this answer have been given extensive publicity, 



<P>

and not to name them could only prompt speculation about whether a case against them is still being considered.

<P>
<a name="91220w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what other methods of consulting solicitors as part of the "secret soundings process" for applicants to the judiciary and for silk he proposes to adopt following the withdrawal by the Law Society and other solicitors' bodies from that process.  [103581]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The arrangements for consultation on candidates for judicial and Queen's Counsel appointments do not in any way constitute a "secret soundings process". The identities of consultees are published. The arrangements are a system for obtaining assessments of candidates against the stated criteria for appointment, and were substantially endorsed by Sir Leonard Peach in his recent Report. The Lord Chancellor is disappointed that the Law Society decided to withdraw from the consultation process and did so before the publication of the Peach Report. In fairness to solicitor candidates the Lord Chancellor will continue to consult such representative bodies as the Solicitors' Family Law Association, the Solicitors Association of High Court Advocates and the London Criminal Courts Solicitors' Association. The Lord Chancellor also proposes to develop other channels of consultation, potentially including solicitors' firms, senior practitioners and local and regional Law Societies.

<P>
<a name="91220w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Hawkins: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what discussions the Lord Chancellor's Department has had concerning the interpretation and application by Greek courts of Articles 7, 11, 16, 24 and 30 of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.  [103080]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w01.html_spnew1"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor's Department has no concerns about the interpretation and application of the 1980 Convention by the courts in Greece. As a result there have been no discussions on this topic between the Department and its counterpart in Greece, the Ministry of Justice. There have, of course, been discussions about particular cases, but these have not revealed any points of more general concern about the application of the Convention in the Greek courts.

<P>
<a name="91220w01.html_spnew2"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 A Public Sector Comparator has been prepared and this value-for-money study will be used to evaluate the bids when they are received. I have no plans to publish this value-for-money study or details of the bids received due to their confidential nature.

<P>
<a name="91220w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. David Atkinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations he has made to the Chinese Government concerning <i>(a)</i> religious liberty in China and <i>(b)</i> the treatment of house church leaders in China.  [102684]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We raise our concerns about freedom of religion in China during our regular high level bilateral human rights dialogue with the Chinese Government. This includes specific references to the treatment of house church leaders and followers of other religions on China. Freedom of religion was a particular focus of the last round of the dialogue held in September, which included a special session devoted to the subject of freedom of religious belief at which British and Chinese specialists exchanged views. The treatment of Falun Gong adherents was discussed during the State Visit and I raised this subject with the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister in 



<P>
<P><I>20 Dec 1999 : Column: 316W</I><P>
November. I also made clear our concerns about the freedom of religious belief in Tibet, and raised individual cases.

<a name="91220w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement about the role of the British Government in encouraging China to continue its process of political reform.  [102702]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Since 1979 China has been engaged on a programme of economic modernisation and reform. This has led to wide-ranging changes in the economic and social structures of the country and has resulted in impressive improvements in the living standards of the people. While the focus has been primarily on economic reform there have also been reforms in the political and legal areas, with moves beginning to take place towards the greater democratic supervision and participation in decision making. These have included the strengthening of the role of parliamentary type institutions such as the National and Local People's Congresses, the introduction of direct elections at the village level, and the building up and strengthening of a more effective legal and judicial system. We encourage these processes and want to see the human rights of Chinese citizens properly protected in accordance with the international Covenants which the Chinese have recently signed. We have developed a number of co-operative programmes and projects with the Chinese, especially in the legal and judicial fields, designed to help strengthen the rule of law in China. We also encourage parliamentary and other exchanges in order to expose China to the example of democratic institutions and practices.

<P>
<a name="91220w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what plans he has to promote tourism in Britain by Chinese citizens.  [102700]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 China is not considered a large potential market for tourism to Britain in the short term. The British Tourist Authority are keeping this under review. We welcome the increasing number of Chinese visitors to this country, both business visitors and students, and hope that eventually the Chinese will be able to enjoy Britain's tourist resources.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the progress in China's observance of human rights after the UK and China's human rights dialogue in September.  [102703]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The last round of the bilateral human rights dialogue with China produced some useful and frank discussions, particularly on the rule of law and the death penalty. We remain concerned about China's record over human rights. We continue to believe that a policy of dialogue, combined with practical programmes of co-operation in areas such as the law and the judicial system, is more likely to bring about improvements in China's practice over the longer term. We make regular representations on human rights. Both my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary discussed human rights with the Chinese during the State Visit. I had lengthy discussions on these subjects (including Tibet) with the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister during my visit to Beijing in November.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps his Department has taken to ensure that UN sanctions against UNITA in Angola are implemented effectively.  [102492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We fully support UN sanctions against UNITA, the work of the UN Sanctions Committee on Angola, chaired by Ambassador Fowler, and the Expert Panels, established to look at ways to tighten implementation of sanctions. We are contributing US$200,000 to the Panels' work.
<P>

<a name="91220w02.html_para0">We have also called for stricter enforcement of sanctions by all UN member states. We are investigating UNITA's re-supply routes and will pass on what we learn to Ambassador Fowler.

We have recently frozen funds in the UK, in accordance with UNSCR 1173.

 From the outset we have urged Pakistan's military authorities to respect the safety and legal rights of those detained. We have also urged that former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his co-defendants be given a free, fair and transparent trial before a civilian court. Our High Commissioner in Islamabad reiterated those points

 <i>(a)</i> Capital punishment for murder has been abolished in all Overseas Territories (OT) save Bermuda, which announced in July of this year its intention to do so. Capital punishment for piracy and treason remains on the statute books of all OTs except BIOT, BAT and the Falkland Islands.
<P>

<a name="91220w02.html_para3"><i>(b)</i> There is currently legislation in Anguilla, Montserrat, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands which effectively makes homosexual acts between consenting adults in private a criminal offence.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary again met his Iranian counterpart Dr. Kharrazi at UNGA on 21 September. During this meeting they agreed to exchange visits.

<a name="91220w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We have repeatedly urged the Indonesian Government to accelerate the return of those displaced East Timorese who wish to return home. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has opened a processing centre in Kupang, West Timor for those wishing to return, and the International Organisation for Migration is handling repatriations. Over 120,000 have now returned.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if the compensation paid to ex-coalminers or to their widows, on account of their suffering from emphysema or chronic bronchitis, will be liable to reduction on the basis of their receiving extra social security benefits <i>(a)</i> after giving up work and <i>(b)</i> for their loss of earnings.  [103062]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The provisions of the compensation recovery scheme applies to all victims of accident, injury or disease who have received both state benefits and compensation for the same need. The scheme will, therefore, apply to miners who have recently been awarded compensation for emphysema or chronic bronchitis. Under the provisions of the scheme, a compensator is liable to repay benefits paid up to the date of the final compensation payment, subject to a five year maximum. In turn, they must reduce the compensation to take account of the amounts repaid, but only where compensation and benefits are paid for a like need. Under no circumstances can compensation for pain and suffering 



<P>

be reduced. In the case of widows, where the compensation claim is made under the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976, or would have been had an action been brought, any payments are exempt.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what estimate he has made of <i>(a)</i> the cost of benefit fraud in the last financial year and <i>(b)</i> the surplus on unclaimed benefits in the last financial year.  [103191]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Previous estimates have shown that &#163;2 billion a year has definitely been lost through fraud. A further &#163;3 billion may have been lost in cases where fraud is strongly suspected and a further &#163;2 billion where there is some suspicion of fraud.
<P>

<a name="91220w03.html_para7">We are now measuring the level of fraud and error in Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance, the two most vulnerable benefits, by thoroughly investigating a monthly random sample of cases in each Benefit Agency area. Staff error is measured separately by a special team within the Benefits Agency. The latest period for which figures are available is the 12 months ending September 1998 where the level of fraud and error in these benefits was &#163;1.4 billion or 9 per cent. of the total benefit paid.
<P>

<a name="91220w03.html_para8">The latest figures available show the amount left unclaimed in Income Related benefits was between &#163;1,580 million and &#163;4,110 million in 1997-98.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to her answer of 29 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 56W, on what is based his estimate of the total amount of extra social security expenditure necessary to achieve average increases in household income of <i>(a)</i> &#163;46 per week before housing costs and <i>(b)</i> &#163;52 per week after housing costs.  [102814]<P>

<a name="91220w03.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 My written answer of 29 November 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column 56W, provided estimates for the additional incomes required to ensure that all children were in households with at least half average income. Any implications for increased Social Security 



<P>
<P><I>20 Dec 1999 : Column: 324W</I><P>
expenditure would be dependent upon how the increase in incomes was achieved. Increases in Social Security expenditure can be used to increase household incomes through improving incentives to work and helping people find work as well as through directly increasing benefit payments. Action on a wide range of fronts can boost incomes through increasing the earnings potential of those on low incomes and helping people to achieve their potential. Different approaches would require different levels of Social Security expenditure.
<P>

<a name="91220w03.html_para9">Our strategy for eradicating child poverty within 20 years involves tackling the main causes of poverty and social exclusion. This means helping parents find work, making work pay and ensuring that every child gets the best possible start in life as well as providing additional help for families through the tax and benefit system.

<P>
<a name="91220w03.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) how many pensioner households qualify for the 1999 winter fuel payment; and how many of those households had received this payment by 6 December;  [102636]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans are in place to ensure that households qualifying for the 1999 winter fuel payment receive it on, or before, 15 December.  [102637]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w03.html_spnew10"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 To ensure that pensioners received their winter fuel payment before Christmas, those eligible were identified during the week commencing 20 September. Over 7.5 million pensioner households qualified for winter fuel payments this winter. By 6 December all those households should have been issued with a winter fuel payment. However, in case some pensioners may not have received their payment, a national and regional press advertising campaign was run from 9 to 15 December inclusive. This advised pensioners that they could ring the National Winter Fuel Payment Helpline with any concerns that they had about their payment.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w03.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Fearn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security for what reasons the cut-off date for eligibility to receive the winter fuel allowance has been set at 12 September 1999.  [102682]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w03.html_spnew11"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 In order to make Winter Fuel Payments automatically, without incurring disproportionate administration costs, it is necessary to identify those in receipt of qualifying benefits through official departmental computer records. Therefore, entitlement is based on being in receipt of one of the qualifying Social Security benefits for at least a day during a specified qualifying week.
<P>

<a name="91220w03.html_para10">The process of identification and determination of the amount payable takes around 10 weeks, therefore to ensure receipt of the payments before Christmas the qualifying week chosen for this winter was the week beginning 20 September. If the qualifying period was extended or a later week used, the exercise would not have been completed in time for payments to be made before Christmas.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make a statement on winter fuel payments following the judgment made by the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Taylor.  [103839]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w03.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 In 1997, we decided to make Winter Fuel Payments payable to elderly people in receipt of qualifying benefits--principally Retirement Pension. We did this because this meant that payments could be made quickly, automatically and at the right time.
<P>

<a name="91220w03.html_para11">Following the Court's judgment in the Taylor case, help through Winter Fuel Payments will be extended to everyone aged 60 and over, regardless of whether they are claiming a pension or are on another qualifying benefit.
<P>

<a name="91220w03.html_para12">By equalising the age of entitlement for Winter Fuel Payments at 60 for men and women, the number of people who will benefit will increase by up to 1.5 million. This will have an estimated annual programme cost of &#163;85 million. It will mean that next winter, up to 11.5 million people in up to 8.5 million households will benefit from these payments.
<P>

<a name="91220w03.html_para13">In line with the judgment, the Government will also make backdated payments to the start of the scheme for up to 1.9 million people. This will have an estimated one-off programme cost of &#163;125 million.
<P>

<a name="91220w03.html_para14">The age of entitlement for Winter Fuel Payments will initially be set at 60. Thereafter, however, it will move in step with entitlement for State Retirement Pension. It will therefore start to rise in 2010 and reach 65 in 2020.
<P>

<a name="91220w03.html_para15">We will need to find out the names and addresses of the people who are newly eligible for these payments. As the information we hold may not be up to date, we will therefore need to introduce a claims process for Winter Fuel Payments. This process will need to be developed carefully and appropriate IT systems built to deal with claims.
<P>

<a name="91220w03.html_para16">There is no need for people newly eligible for Winter Fuel Payments to contact the Benefits Agency now. A further announcement will be made early next year to advise people how to claim.

 Personal advisers in the ONE service provide help and advice on work and benefits to individuals according to their own particular circumstances. We recognise that everyone is different and needs vary from one client to another. ONE pilot offices have trained staff and special facilities to aid people with special communication needs. For example, textphone facilities are available for people with severe hearing impairment and advisers are trained in their use. The services of a qualified interpreter or lipspeaker are available to clients attending a meeting with their personal adviser. All clients, including those with communication difficulties, will be offered a prompt initial meeting in order that claims can be dealt with quickly.

 Appeal tribunals are independent and the Department has no powers to override their decisions.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The information comes from the "Households Below Average Income" (HBAI) series. The estimates are presented on household income both Before Housing Costs and After Housing Costs in line with HBAI conventions. All the estimates in the table relate to families with an adult in paid work rather than households with an adult in paid work.<P>

2. People living in families which include a self-employed adult have been included in the tables. Self-employment income data is known often to be a poor guide to households' living standards. In 1997-98, around 600,000 to 700,000 of the children in households below half average income had a full-time self-employed person in the household.<P>

3. The column headed "Total people in couple families" does not include couples without children.<P>

4. The estimates based on the Family Expenditure Survey (FES) are for the United Kingdom. For 1988-89 and subsequent years, two years' data have been combined to improve the robustness of the results. For 1994-95 onwards, estimates are available from the larger Family Resources Survey (FRS) and relate to single financial years. The FRS results are for Great Britain.<P>

 Comparisons between the average incomes of households can be misleading if not fully explained. The most appropriate income measure when comparing different types of households is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the size and composition of the household). It is standard HBAI practice to give results for income both before and after housing costs, in

<i>Notes:</i>
<BR>
1. All equivalised figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data set which is based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS does not include Northern Ireland. 1997-98 is the latest year for which information is available. All estimates are subject to sampling error.
<BR>
2. The retired are defined as those in benefit units where the head or spouse is aged 60 or over and no adult is in work.
<BR>
3. All unequivalised figures are taken from The Pensioners' Incomes Series 1996-97 publication (PI), based on the Family Expenditure Survey (FES). Pensioner benefit units are defined here as single people over state pension age (65 for men; 60 for women) and couples (married or cohabiting) where the man is over state pension age.
<BR>
4. The PI figures for pensioners cannot be directly compared to other groups of the population since they are not equivalised (i.e. they do not take account of differences in size and composition of each household).
<BR>
5. The PI figures for pensioners cannot be compared directly to HBAI figures for pensioners for several reasons. In addition to the fact that HBAI figures are equivalised, the PI figures relate to a different period (1996-97 compared with 1997-98) and a different geographical area (UK compared with GB). The PI figures are expressed in July 1996 prices and the HBAI figures in April 1999 prices. The PI figures relate to income at the benefit unit level, averaged over all benefit units, while HBAI figures relate to household income, averaged over all individuals.
<BR>
6. The average net unequivalised income of single pensioners in 1996-97 was estimated at &#163;129 per week BHC and &#163;108 per week AHC (in July 1996 prices). The corresponding estimates for pensioner couples were &#163;248 BHC and &#163;229 AHC.

 The Department has not specifically commissioned any research on the impact of GM pollen on wild or feral bee populations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what were the reasons for the resignation of the Director General of Ordnance Survey; what advice he has given

Ministers as to working relationships between Ordnance Survey and local government; and if he will make a statement.  [103135]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w07.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Dr. Robinson's decision to resign as Director General of Ordnance Survey was sudden and unexpected. His stated reason for resignation was difficulty in reaching agreement with local government over a number of important national initiatives. Dr. Robinson decided it was time for someone else to lead these issues to a successful conclusion.
<P>

<a name="91220w07.html_para7">The acting Director General has advised me that there are many positive aspects to the relationship between Ordnance Survey and local government. All local authorities have access to, and gain great benefit from, a wide range of Ordnance Survey data through a centralised agreement. Working in closer partnership to realise benefits made possible by recent technological developments does present a significant new challenge for Ordnance Survey and local government. Ordnance Survey remains committed to meeting this challenge and finding practical, co-ordinated ways forward. For example, the Director General of Ordnance Survey has jointly commissioned with the Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA) an independent review of the relationship between Ordnance Survey and local authorities. This review specifies opportunities for developing the relationship, which are now being jointly pursued by Ordnance Survey and IDeA.
<P>

<a name="91220w07.html_para8">For my part, I fully endorse the vision for the future of Ordnance Survey that was articulated by Geoff Robinson. It has also been greeted with considerable enthusiasm by a broad spectrum of members of the geographical information community and is being vigorously pursued by Ordnance Survey staff.

 The current rules that regulate highway inquiries in England and Wales were made by Statutory Instrument in 1994. They came into force on 10 January 1995. There are no plans to update them.

 I have today published a consultation paper on the rating of telecommunications masts which are shared by multiple operators. We are encouraging the sharing of masts and mast sites to keep environmental intrusion to a minimum. However, the growth of shared sites has caused uncertainty in their rates assessment. Our proposals would remove that uncertainty by providing that shared sites receive only one rates bill.

 Both the Minister for Transport and I meet representatives of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) from time to time to discuss a wide range of aviation safety issues.
<P>

<a name="91220w08.html_para10">The UK is unique in having an airworthiness requirement for minimum seat space. The CAA, which is responsible for the safety regulation of UK registered passenger aircraft, has set minimum requirements for seating space because it is one of a number of factors which can have an effect on the evacuation of an aircraft in an emergency. The specified minimum space between seats applies for the seat backs in the upright position, as required for take-off and landing. Providing that the minimum standards are adhered to, the seat spacing and the amount of recline available and their effect on passenger comfort is a matter for the operators.

 My right hon.

A total of 5.2 per cent. of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions current workforce (including its Agencies) are from an ethnic minority.

We have taken on ethnic minority students on Windsor Fellowship summer placements for a number of years and plan to increase the number of placements from two to six next year. We also want to bring in senior and professional people from the ethnic minorities on secondment. In addition to this, we advertise in Job Centres and newspapers with a large ethnic minority readership, for example <i>The Voice</i> and <i>The Eastern Eye</i>, to attract potential ethnic minority recruits.

The package will amend Directives 91/440 and 95/18 and replace Directive 95/19. It will: provide open access for rail freight operators to a Trans-European Rail Freight Network (TERFN), which includes all major terminals and ports; broaden the scope of existing provisions for separation of accounts and certain essential functions between infrastructure management and train service operations; extend Community-wide recognition of train operators' licences to all railway undertakings established in the Community; and establish rules for allocating capacity on railway infrastructure and charging for its use.

<a name="91220w09.html_para3">There was a debate on the establishment of a European Aviation Safety Authority. The Commission proposed that the new authority should be set up as a Community agency. The UK and some other member states argued that an international body was preferable, as the Council had previously agreed.

Following the debate, the Presidency asked the Commission to produce an analysis of its proposal for a Community agency, but also to begin exploratory talks with third countries.

 The Government Office for the West Midlands is maintaining an objection to policy M16 (Crushed Rock Aggregates) in the Shropshire, Telford & Wrekin Minerals Local Plan. The objection is to the effect that the policy on crushed rock extraction should be more flexible to enable proposals to come forward, in exceptional circumstances, for new as well as extended sites. Any application for a new site for crushed rock extraction would be determined in the light of all material planning considerations, including the extensive nature of existing reserves. A proposed modification meeting the Government Office's objection was placed on deposit by the joint minerals planning authority on 3 December.

 A variety of new and exciting gardens and landscape installations are being constructed on and around the Millennium Experience site. Some of these are being constructed by NMEC, and some by English Partnerships as part of the long-term legacy of the site. In the case of soil mixes and topsoil, 'greenwaste' is being used. This is based on recycled cuttings, taken in spring/ autumn and mulched, then composted for 4-6 months and does not contain peat. In the case of mulch and hydroseed, this is specified as peat free. Suppliers are able to propose their own product to meet this specification, so a variety of options have been used, but generally products based on chopped paper or something of this nature will be the most common solution. NMEC cannot make an absolute commitment to be "peat free", as soils attached to plants procured from commercial nurseries could contain small quantities of peat.

<P>
<a name="91220w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Sheldon: </B> 
 The Commission last met on 2 December to consider the estimates for the National Audit Office. Clearly, the evaluation of public-private partnership schemes, including projects under the Private Finance Initiative, is a major priority for the National Audit Office. Within the past two years, the NAO has published 10 reports on such projects and a further report setting out its criteria for evaluating public-private partnerships. More work in this area is planned and, while the Commission will continue to monitor the situation, I am satisfied that at present the current level of funding for this work is adequate.

 In 1998 (the latest year for which figures are available), the Commissioners spent &#163;85 million on clergy pension benefits. They also contributed &#163;23 million to help dioceses take on the cost of pension contributions under the new clergy pension scheme established in 1998, as well as paying the contributions for clergy for whom the Commissioners are responsible. The total expenditure on pensions and pension contributions was &#163;110 million, which was 69 per cent. of the Commissioners' overall expenditure.

 The Ministry Division of the Archbishops' Council is responsible for monitoring clergy numbers. No assessment of the likely numbers of full-time stipendiary clergy has been made for 2020 but work is currently being undertaken on long-term projections. Stipendiary clergy men and women are not the only resource for ministry available to the Church. At the end of 1998 there were, in addition to the 9,636 stipendiary clergy men and women, 1,206 non-stipendiary ministers and nearly 10,000 Readers. There are also 1,304 chaplains ministering in hospitals, schools, prisons and to the armed forces.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The potential hazards caused by depleted uranium are well understood and are widely documented in existing scientific literature. The Defence Evaluation and Research Agency's Radiation Protection Service, then the Defence Radiological Protection Service, published in 1993 a summary report of its assessment of the radiological and chemical hazards of depleted uranium. The report explained that there are two types of hazard posed by the use of depleted uranium: a radiation hazard, although depleted uranium is a low specific activity material (as defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency); and a chemical toxicity hazard, which is similar to that posed by other heavy metals, such as lead. A copy of the summary report has been placed in the Library of the House.

<a name="91220w11.html_para3">In addition, on 19 March, the then Minister of State for the Armed Forces published a detailed paper "Testing for the presence of depleted uranium in UK veterans of the Gulf conflict: The Current Position". This paper describes the scenarios in which UK troops may have been exposed to DU in the Gulf and outlines the possible health effects of such exposures. It also includes reference to the case narrative "Depleted Uranium in the Gulf", published by the US Department of Defense; this case narrative sets out details of the programme of testing being conducted in the United States in the context of veterans possibly exposed to depleted uranium during the Gulf conflict. Copies of the paper have been placed in the Library of the House.

 No assessment has been undertaken by my Department of the incidence of birth deformities where ammunition containing uranium has been used.

My Department would consider carefully any such studies or data if these became available.

<a name="91220w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 Discussions have taken place throughout the year between Ministry of Defence officials and British Aerospace and Royal Ordnance managers, to determine the potential for a partnering arrangement with Royal Ordnance for the supply of a range of ammunition products. We are seeking arrangements which will provide better and improving value for money for the taxpayer, represent a viable business for Royal Ordnance, and enhance the future supply of ammunition for the British Armed Forces. We hope to conclude discussions shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Seven routine port visits were programmed in to HMS Ocean's recent lengthy deployment and, as with all port visits, the opportunity was taken to carry out routine maintenance and repairs. No visits were specifically arranged for repairs, but two of the scheduled visits were extended slightly to enable routine maintenance checks and some defect repairs to be undertaken while the vessel was alongside. The work carried out included main engine air charge cooler defect repairs and to change a rotating joint on a radar. This work cost approximately &#163;114,000. These repairs have had no significant impact on the operational programme of the vessel.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many service families receive working families tax credit.  [102240]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 From October 1999 (in the UK), working families tax credit (WFTC) is being paid direct to the claimant (including UK service personnel or their spouses). Although WFTC is administered by Inland Revenue (IR), it was enacted by DSS legislation. Consequently, since claims are made direct to the IR by either service personnel (or their spouses), the MOD has no overview of the total number of claimants. However, 



<P>
<P><I>20 Dec 1999 : Column: 361W</I><P>
from April 2000, WFTC (in the UK) will be payable to claimants, including service personnel, through their salary if they wish. As the credit may be paid to the spouses of service personnel, however, our information about which service personnel in the UK receive the credit will not be comprehensive. Overseas, MOD is required to make separate arrangements for payment of most DSS benefits, including WFTC, to service (and civilian) personnel as they are at present disqualified by the DSS by virtue of their residence outside the UK. The total number of service claimants overseas will not be known until after April next year when the transfer from FC to WFTC is complete. I regret, therefore, that MOD is unable to provide the information requested.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 We do not hold records about former MOD housing. For current MOD-owned housing in Hampshire, including those which have been leased back from Annington Homes Limited, the position at 1 December 1999 is that there are currently 7,121 families quarters, of which 6,095 are occupied and 1,026 are unoccupied.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 Peat is not directly used by the MOD in its operations and activities. However, it is possible that some ground maintenance contractors may use peat on the Defence estate. In line with the MOD's Departmental Plan on the Greening Government Initiative, my Department will be looking at bringing in measures to ensure that any use of peat in the maintenance of its grounds is substituted by organic waste. This reflects the advice within the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions Greening Operations Guide.

 We have no record of any recent military aircraft incidents relating to the use of organophosphate lubricants.

<P>

<a name="91220w14.html_para3">We are now strengthening bail support, through &#163;35 million Youth Justice Board grants and a statutory duty from April on local authorities to operate appropriate bail support schemes. The Prison Service is investing more than &#163;50 million in creating a distinct juvenile estate which will be able to hold young people on remand where they would be reasonably near to courts. The Youth Justice Board will take over the purchasing and commissioning of secure juvenile accommodation from April, to ensure effective use of available places and to plan for future needs. How far we can reduce remands to prisons in the short-term depends on the total numbers remanded and on overall demands on available accommodation. In the light of proposals from the Board, we will make clear in the New Year what we expect to achieve by when in removing young people on remand from prison accommodation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what percentage of the total work force in his Department is of ethnic minority origin; and what steps he is taking to encourage the employment of people from the ethnic minorities in his Department.  [102733]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary for the Cabinet Office set out in his reply on 16 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 264W, the corporate action that we are taking to encourage the employment of people from ethnic minorities.
<P>

<a name="91220w15.html_para0">The percentage of permanent staff of ethnic minority origin in the Home Office, including the Prison Service, was 5 per cent. on 1 April 1999. The percentage is of those whose ethnic origin was then centrally recorded. More detailed figures are given in the table. Staff provide information on their ethnic origin on a voluntary basis and can choose not to disclose their origin if they so wish.
<P>

<a name="91220w15.html_para1">As part of our commitment to encouraging employment of people of ethnic minority origin, the Home Office published on 28 July 1999 targets for the recruitment, retention and progression of ethnic minority staff over the next ten years. (These cover the core Home Office, Agencies and Services).
<P>

<a name="91220w15.html_para2">To achieve its targets, the Home Office has revised its recruitment literature and attends recruitment fairs specifically aimed at minority ethnic communities. It has and will continue to advertise a number of posts in the ethnic minority press, for example <i>The Voice, the Ethnic 



<P>
<P><I>20 Dec 1999 : Column: 368W</I><P>
Media Group,</i> and <i>Muslim News</i>. The Home Office participates in the National Mentoring Consortium Scheme for ethnic minority undergraduates and is involved in an informal mentoring scheme for potential ethnic minority Fast Stream candidates. The Department also sponsors the Windsor Fellowship which supports Black and Asian students.
<P>

<a name="91220w15.html_para3">The Prison Service launched the RESPOND programme to promote racial equality for staff and prisoners in February 1999. This includes targets to recruit more staff from the minority ethnic communities. To secure this, a national recruitment outreach team has been formed which will work in partnership with local prisons, for example attending recruitment fairs. The Prison Service will also review its career literature and continue to advertise in the minority ethnic media.
<P>

<a name="91220w15.html_para4">The Home Office recognises that unless it is seen as a fair place to work and in which diversity is valued, recruitment initiatives alone will not encourage people from minority ethnic communities to join the Department. The Home Office is committed to a Race Equality Action Plan that includes race awareness training, a mentoring scheme involving Management Board members and ethnic minority staff and evaluating and monitoring of all Human Resources systems. An Ethnic Minority Network was launched for staff on 24 November 1999 and already has over 500 members. The Home Office also participates in Cabinet Office initiatives on diversity and equality proofing.

<P>
<a name="91220w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Against the background of the continuing shortfall of the Fire Service College in meeting its financial targets, I commissioned a prior options review in March 1999. I asked the review team to evaluate the performance of the College; and taking account of developments since it was established, reappraise the options for achieving best value for money in the provision of central training for the United Kingdom fire service.
<P>

<a name="91220w15.html_para7">I have now received the Report of the review and arranged for its publication. Copies of the Report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="91220w15.html_para8">The review considered various organisational options for providing central training for the United Kingdom fire service. They took account of the College's track record as an Agency; its shortage of key skills and experience; and the need for decisive action to tackle the problems identified, including the requirement for significant capital investment if we are to keep the College viable. The review was conscious of the need to increase training throughput at the College and suggested that there would be additional significant benefits from joining up the activities of the Home Office and Ministry of Defence (MOD) Fire Services Central Training Establishment, at Manston.
<P>

<a name="91220w15.html_para9">The review concluded that the option most likely to restore the College to viability would be to end the College's Agency status and replace it with a partnership with the private sector. The Report therefore, recommends that a three way partnership should be established between the Home Office, the MOD and the private sector for the delivery of fire service training and to exploit fully the College site and facilities.
<P>

<a name="91220w15.html_para10">The public sector would continue to have a close involvement by having in the College officers seconded from the United Kingdom Fire Service and from the MOD. The Report also recommends that the College should be reviewed regularly by Her Majesty's Fire Services' Inspectorate. This would parallel the arrangements that exist in Scotland for inspecting the Scottish Fire Service Training School at Gullane. It would also provide the Home Office with a source of expertise to assist with the monitoring and management of a future partnership agreement.
<P>

<a name="91220w15.html_para11">I am grateful to the review team for the work they have undertaken. I welcome their findings, their thorough and careful analysis of the College's problems and their recommendations. I am accepting immediately their recommendation that in future the College should be 



<P>
<P><I>20 Dec 1999 : Column: 371W</I><P>
reviewed by Her Majesty's Fire Services' Inspectorate and I have asked the Chief Inspector to inspect and report on the College regularly.
<P>

<a name="91220w15.html_para12">After this thorough review, and years of difficulties, it is very important that the College's problems are now gripped firmly and tackled expeditiously. I have agreed with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence that joining up the activities of the College with those of the Ministry of Defence Fire Services Central Training Establishment, in partnership with the private sector, holds the potential to bring benefit to all parties concerned and should be urgently explored. I am also commencing consultations today with the College, the Fire Service and other stakeholders on this and other recommendations in the report. I will also be seeking advice from the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council.

 A range of initiatives has been taken. Departments have been asked to ensure that their own key systems will achieve independently assessable standards of security. Discussions are being held with a number of private sector organisations in order to identify the systems on which the national infrastructure critically depends, to assess and reduce their vulnerabilities, and to establish contingency arrangements. In order to take this forward, I have established an interdepartmental centre, the National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre, to act as a point of contact for those involved in this work in both government and the private sector.

<a name="91220w17.html_para4">The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS) regulates high cost telephone lines through its Code of Practice, with which Premium Rate Service Providers have to comply. The Code has a number of provisions relating to both the advertising for and the content of services, which are designed to counter fraudulent provision and use of such services.

 On 1 April 1999, the percentage of staff who had notified the Department of a disability represented 4.2 per cent. of all staff. This included staff in DTI Headquarters, but excluded casual staff and staff in Government Offices and Executive Agencies.
<P>

<a name="91220w18.html_para0">The Department's external recruitment is through fair and open competition with selection on merit. We ensure that our recruitment processes are adapted to meet the requirements of disabled applicants.

 Although the recent WTO meeting in Seattle did not launch a new round of trade negotiations, the UK, alongside its EU partners, will continue to press for negotiations to clarify the relationship between Multilateral Environmental Agreements and WTO rules; to clarify the rules on environmental labelling; and to examine the scope for taking into account the precautionary principle in WTO rules in relation to environmental risks. The UK will continue to press for a joint forum of the ILO and WTO to consider trade, globalisation and labour issues.

<a name="91220w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Decisions on the form and level of price controls are matters for the sectoral regulators. In telecommunications, electricity, and gas, the independent industry regulators have statutory duties which govern the way in which they conduct their business. These are set out in the relevant legislation. Decisions taken by the regulated companies in response to proposals by the regulators are for the commercial judgment of the companies. If companies are not prepared to accept the regulator's proposals, they can reject them, and the regulator can then refer the proposals to the Competition Commission for a full review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Figures from the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) indicate that in the first nine months of 1999 there were 15,500 gas disconnections for debt. Based on this trend the Regulator is hopeful that the total number of gas disconnections in 1999 should not exceed 20,000, representing a large fall compared to 1998 when there were nearly 30,000 gas disconnections. The Regulator will monitor the number of disconnections closely and has, in his Social Action Plan, set out a number of actions which should continue to place downward pressure on the number of disconnections.

 Where the Department is the major or sole occupier of a building provision is made for rest/first aid rooms and in most buildings there is a dedicated smoking room or area. No specific provision is made for religious observance, but staff can and do use meeting rooms for such purposes. Where the Department is a minor occupier of a building, provision of rooms or areas for purposes such as these will often be shared between all the occupiers.

 The automation of the Post Office Counters Ltd. network, which is due for completion by the spring of 2001, will enable the Post Office to extend its arrangements with the high street banks to offer a range of banking facilities at post offices. This will mean that benefit recipients who wish to access their benefits in cash at post offices will continue to be able to do so, both before and after the migration of benefit payments to automated credit transfer from 2003, while other bank customers will benefit from the wider availability of banking facilities, particularly in rural areas.

 The Government are committed to the maintenance of a nationwide network of post offices and will, for the first time, publish access criteria which the new Regulator will have a duty to monitor.

The Government are making a substantial contribution to the costs of automating the counters network to strengthen the viability of the network in the longer term and the Performance and Innovation Unit in the Cabinet Office is carrying out an urgent study on the post office network.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer given by the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office on 1 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 255W, detailing Government Car Service costs in each of the past two years. In addition to these costs private car hire costs for Scotland Office Ministers were &#163;25,000 in 1997-98 and &#163;45,000 in 1998-99 respectively.
<P>

<a name="91220w19.html_para2">The estimated total expenditure on Scotland Office civil servants' transport was &#163;3,916,000 in 1997-98 and &#163;3,126,000 in 1998-99. All travel undertaken by civil servants complies with the requirements of the Civil Service Management Code.
<P>

<a name="91220w19.html_para3">Most of this expenditure relates to functions which, since 1 July, have been transferred to the Scottish Executive.

[99550]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Department uses post offices on an occasional basis only, for the delivery of specific public messages. This can take the form of displaying leaflets for the public to select or be issued by counter staff, to putting out rolling messages through television or digital displays inside main posts offices.
<P>

<a name="91220w20.html_para1">The frequency of using post offices for communicating with the public in this way is dependent on both the content of the message and on the target audience. It is not clear therefore whether this type of activity will increase or decrease over the next five years. What is likely, in terms of communications generally, is a gradual decrease in paper communications such as leaflets and a corresponding increase in digital/electronic forms of communication.
<P>

<a name="91220w20.html_para2">We do not provide any other business for post offices and this is unlikely to change in the future. We do however have significant business with Royal Mail and Parcelforce who provide the bulk of our mail collection and delivery service.

 <i>[holding answer 13 December 1999]:</i> The current network of City Technology Colleges (CTCs) is an important part of the Government's strategy to promote diversity with excellence within a modernised comprehensive system. That strategy includes the provision of new and exciting ICT rich learning environments for our city children through the expansion of the specialist schools programme and the establishment by September 2000 of 32 City Learning Centres under our Excellence in Cities initiative.
<P>

<a name="91220w21.html_para0">The role of existing CTCs will continue to develop, in particular by helping to spread innovation and best practice more widely to schools and communities.

<a name="91220w22.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment in relation to a petition needed to trigger a ballot on the future of grammar schools in Barnet, <i>(a)</i> what is the total number of signatures required for a petition, <i>(b)</i> what methods exist (i) for the parents seeking change, to validate the total required and (ii) for independent validation of the total required and <i>(c)</i> who has provided the data on which the number of signatures required is based.  [102757]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w22.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The School Standards and Framework Act 1998 and the Education (Grammar School Ballots) Regulations 1998 define the number of signatures required to trigger a ballot on the future of selective admissions to grammar schools (the petition threshold) as 20 per cent. of the total number of eligible parents. The Secretary of State has appointed an independent ballot administration company, Electoral Reform (Ballot Services) Ltd. (ERBS), to receive and check petitions and run any ballots. The ERBS has calculated that in Barnet the petition threshold is 7,209. The legislation does not require the ERBS to submit the number of eligible parents to scrutiny by (i) parents or (ii) any other body.
<P>

<a name="91220w22.html_para0">In order to calculate the petition threshold, the ERBS required the three grammar schools in Barnet to provide details of all schools from which pupils came in the last three years. Those schools where a total of five or more children had transferred, over the last three years, to a grammar school in Barnet qualified as feeder schools and had to provide the ERBS with lists of eligible parents. From this information, the ERBS calculated the total number of parents entitled to sign a petition or vote in a ballot, and subsequently the petition threshold.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w22.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list, in relation to petitions needed to trigger ballots on the future of grammar schools in Barnet, <i>(a)</i> the names of the schools in respect of which parents are eligible to be balloted and <i>(b)</i> the number of parents eligible to be balloted in each of these schools; and how many children transferred to each of the Barnet grammar schools from each of the primary schools in each of the last three years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will take steps to ensure that local education authorities do not promote policies of encouraging schools to form group foundation bodies.  [102827]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w23.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The group foundation mechanism enables schools without existing foundations to enter the Voluntary sector. It is for governing bodies themselves to decide whether they should apply to establish or join a foundation body for their schools. If they do so, the foundation body will hold the schools' land for the purposes of the schools, appoint foundation governors for those schools and promote co-operation between member schools. Local education authorities have no major role in any decision by governing bodies considering membership of a foundation body.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make it his policy to prevent party political appointments, other than local education authority nominations, to school organisation committees.  [102821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w23.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The local authority has no control over membership of three of the groups on the committee, and is prevented by regulation from appointing governors who are elected members to the schools group. Since decisions on plans or proposals can be reached only if all groups vote unanimously, party politics should not be a determining factor in local decision-making. Where the groups cannot agree, the case is referred to the Schools Adjudicator for decision.

<P>
<P>

 School organisation committees must be set up in accordance with The Education (School Organisation Committees) (England) Regulations 1999. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would consider any complaints or other evidence that a local education authority had failed to comply with the regulations, or exercised its functions unreasonably.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has to ensure that school organisation committees are representative of local community interests.  [102819]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w23.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The composition of school organisation committees is set out in The Education (School Organisation Committees) (England) Regulations 1999. Committees comprise the main partners in the provision of education locally: the local education authority, Church of England and Roman Catholic diocesan interests, post-16 interests and schools. The regulations allow for a sixth group representing local community interests to be set up, but this is at the discretion of the local education authority and not a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w23.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Training grants are paid to recommending bodies who are responsible for organising individual training programmes for trainees. The recommending body can be the school where the trainee is employed or another organisation capable of organising a training programme. The Teacher Training Agency (TTA) employs two contractors to administer the employment-based routes to Qualified Teacher Status including approval of training programmes, administration of funding and assessment arrangements and matching potential trainees with jobs. Neither of these organisations acts as a recommending body.

 Data on the number of children educated otherwise than at school are not collected centrally. Under the Education Act 1996, parents can opt to educate their children otherwise than at school. In such circumstances, pupils can only be removed from a school roll where the school has received written notification from the parent that the pupil is receiving education otherwise than at school.

 Local Education Authorities have a duty to monitor the quality of home education being provided and we expect them to carry out this duty. If home education is not being provided or is not of a satisfactory standard, Local Education Authorities can apply to the courts of an Educational Supervision Order. Alternatively they should pursue a School Attendance Order.

 <i>[holding answer 16 December 1999]:</i> We are aware that truancy is a complex problem with no one single cause or solution. Last year, the Government published "Truancy and School Exclusion" which set out major research findings on the causes and activities needed to address the issue. This publication drew upon research commissioned by the Department including "Truancy in English Secondary Schools" by D. J. O'Keefe and the Audit Commission Report "Misspent Youth; Young People and Crime". In July 1999 we issued new guidance to schools on attendance. On 1 November, we launched "Tackling Truancy Together" which set out our strategy in further detail including evidence of what works in increasing attendance.

 With the exception of London--where all learning partnerships are re-assessing their boundaries--there are only two instances of learning partnerships crossing the boundaries of local learning and skills councils. In both cases, Government Office staff are working closely with local partners to ensure a smooth transition. In addition, support funding is available both to Government Offices and learning partnerships to facilitate the process of change.

<a name="91220w24.html_para4">Learning partnerships have a key role in the new post-16 arrangements; they are very well placed to provide the in-depth understanding of local needs that will be needed to inform the work of local learning and skills councils. In general, learning partnerships are being advised to ensure that they have a sufficiently local focus to enable them to identify local needs and co-ordinate effective local action.

 We have not made separate estimates of the costs of providing education and training for 16 to 19-year-olds by sector.

 The Education Act 1997 confers powers on the ACCAC and QCA to keep under review all aspects of external vocational and academic qualifications. This year, Ministers endorsed detailed arrangements, developed by the ACCAC, CCEA and QCA, for the regulation of external qualifications. These arrangements set out the criteria which these bodies are applying to accredit qualifications to a national framework and will use to monitor the performance and practices of examining bodies in the delivery of these qualifications.

 All the AS/A level and GNVQ specifications to be introduced for teaching from September 2000 will have to meet the demanding criteria set out by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. These are designed to ensure that the rigour of the qualifications is at least fully maintained. In approving these criteria, Ministers took steps to strengthen the rigour of the new A levels by requiring all candidates to take a demanding synoptic test at the end of the course covering the who syllabus, and by allowing only one opportunity to re-take individual modules. Ministers have also taken steps to upgrade the GNVQ assessment regime.

 It is our intention that the Learning and Skills Council should take over the lease on the Further Education and Funding Council's main premises in Coventry.

Our priority will be to work closely with TECs to make the most cost effective use of existing premises wherever possible, either for the LSC, for a franchisee of the Small Business Service or for other local activities. It is too early at this stage to estimate the net costs of transfers, sales and reprovision.

<P>

<a name="91220w25.html_para0">In relation to recommendation 20, the RUC is acutely aware of the importance of effective co-ordination of police resources and activity at major incidents. Consequently all existing Force orders, manuals of guidance and policy are being distilled into generic procedures which will ensure clear roles and lines of responsibility.
<P>

<a name="91220w25.html_para1">On recommendation 21, the experience gained by the RUC in three decades of investigating major crime has resulted in tried and tested procedures. There are current RUC Force instructions concerning records made by individual officers and specialist units in relation to their functions and strict rules require the retention of all such records as long as an investigation remains open.
<P>

<a name="91220w25.html_para2">As for recommendation 22, the RUC in line with GB constabularies is to obtain an updated version of HOLMES (Home Office Large Major Enquiry System) and the resourcing requirements are addressed in the draft ACPO Major Incident Room Standardised Agreed Procedures (MIRSAP). These guidelines, which should be confirmed early in the new year, will define the resources necessary to operate HOLMES investigations.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 1999]:</i> Police actions in relation to such parades are constrained by the need to minimise disruption to the wider community. In many instances such parades are short-lived affairs where police intervention to arrest participants would exacerbate the situation.
<P>

<a name="91220w26.html_para3">The primary aim of police is therefore to monitor such parades in order to prevent serious disorder. The secondary aim is to gather sufficient evidence to allow the identification/prosecution of participants. If sufficient notice of the parade is obtained, technical resources can be deployed to gather video and still photographic images. These efforts can however be frustrated by a number of factors such as:
<P>

<a name="91220w26.html_para4">Furthermore, in order to be able to substantiate a prosecution, police must be in a position to prove that individuals knew the parade to be illegal. Often such parades can be over before the police can respond and for operational reasons police may be deployed at some distance from the parade.

 The Cabinet Office published on 5 July 1999, for public consultation, a "Statement of Practice for Staff Transfers in the Public Sector", <i>Official Report</i>, column 388W. The Statement of Practice sets out the Government's policy for the application of TUPE where the public sector is the employer or client in a contracting-out or subsequent retendering situation. These should be conducted on the presumption that the protections of TUPE will apply, unless there are genuinely exceptional reasons not to do so. This includes second and subsequent round contracts that result in a new contractor and should ensure that all staff involved are treated fairly and consistently and their rights protected. Employees or employee representatives who consider that their rights under the Regulations have been infringed may seek legal redress. The response to the public consultation on the Statement of Practice was extremely positive with strong support from public and private sector employers and employee representatives. I aim to publish a final version of the Statement early in the New Year.

 I can only answer for the period since May 1997. We always made it clear that, if elected, we would have a strengthening of the centre to ensure a firm political focus and greater co-ordination to the work of this Administration. This is what we have done, and this accounts for some of the increase. The costs also include the Standards and Effectiveness Adviser to the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the three members of the Council of Economic Advisers and the appointments of the UK anti-drugs co-ordinator and his deputy. These appointments are new to this Administration and are not covered by paybill figures for the years before May 1997.

<a name="91220w29.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 All medical devices when first placed on the market have to be CE marked by the manufacturer or supplier to demonstrate they are safe to use and conform with the requirements of the Medical Devices Regulations. These Regulations are enforced by the Medical Devices Agency (MDA). The MDA distributed the good practice guide "Medical Device and Equipment Management for Hospital and Community-based Organisations" to the National Health Service and social services in January 1998. This included guidance on record-keeping for good equipment management, including the tracing of products. This guidance was referred to in the later publication "Good Practice in Disability Equipment Services", which was commissioned by the Department from the Disabled Living Centres Council and distributed to the NHS and to social services in October 1998.

 Food and fluids should always be offered to patients who are capable of swallowing them. Where nutrition and hydration have to be provided by artificial means, their possible withdrawal is in all cases a matter of clinical judgment which is undertaken in accordance with professional advice provided by a responsible and recognised body of medical opinion and the general law.

 Information about the number of staff in individual hospital departments is not collected centrally.

 For England and Wales, information about the current numbers of higher specialist trainees holding Certificates of Completion of Specialist Training (CCST) is not collected centrally. Information from the Regional Postgraduate Deans suggests that around 20 higher specialist trainees in accident and emergency medicine should have gained their CCST in 1999. We anticipate that around 40 should qualify in 2000 and there will be around 320 qualifying for consultant posts in accident and emergency medicine between now and 2004.

We take account of gender equality issues as a matter of course in our bilateral development assistance, which has focused upon reducing poverty and increasing basic rights and access to essential services--especially for women and girls.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The attached table presents the information you require. The estimates of internal population movements are based on the movement of NHS doctors' patients between the former Family Health Services Authority Areas. They should not be regarded as a perfect measure of migration as there is variation in the delay between a person moving and registering with a new doctor. Additionally, some moves may not result in a re-registration: for example, individuals may migrate again before registering with a doctor. Conversely, there may be others who move and re-register several times a year.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Moves between the individual Government Office Regions (GORs) of England and the rest of the United Kingdom are now published in <i>Key Population and Vital Statistics,</i> which is available in the House of Commons Library. Prior to 1997, the analysis related to moves within England and Wales only.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The estimates of international (external) migration are derived from the International Passenger Survey (IPS), a sample survey of passengers arriving at and departing from the main air, sea and Channel Tunnel routes. Estimates derived from the IPS are subject to both sampling and non-sampling error. Some types of migrants are not covered by the IPS as it does not cover routes between the UK and the Irish Republic, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. All movements of diplomats and armed forces personnel are also excluded, as are asylum seekers and visitor switchers--persons admitted as short-term visitors who are subsequently granted a stay for a year or longer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w33.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government believe that all sectors of the economy must play their part in helping tackle the problem of climate change. So there will not be complete exemptions from the climate change levy for particular firms or sectors. However, like other sectors, firms in the horticulture sector will be able to take advantage of the proposed exemptions from the levy for electricity generated from 'new' forms of renewable energy and in 'good quality' combined heat and power plants, and the enhanced capital allowances for firms making energy saving investments. All sectors will also benefit from the lower overall rates for the levy announced by the Chancellor in his Pre-Budget Report.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w33.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The climate change levy is designed to be revenue neutral for the private sector as a whole, with all the revenues raised being fully recycled back to business through a cut in employers' National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and additional support for energy efficiency measures. The levy package is also expected to be broadly neutral between manufacturing and services.
<P>

<a name="91220w33.html_para0">It is not possible to say what the exact final impact of the levy package on specific regions will be.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w33.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Public service pension schemes first received receipts in 1996-97 to pay for the reinstatement of employees identified under Phase 1 of the mis-selling review as having been mis-sold personal pensions. Receipts from this source, which are matched by future benefits to pensioners, have been received in all subsequent years but not all of the unfunded schemes financed from the Exchequer have separately identified receipts from this source throughout this period. With the exception of the NHS Pensions Scheme, the profile of Exchequer receipts relating to the main public service pension schemes is estimated as follows:

<P>
<a name="91220w33.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The estimates given in my earlier answer, of receipts of &#163;100 million to 160 million in this financial year and each of the following three financial years, were global estimates as detailed forecasting would not be productive given the uncertainties about the number of cases of mis-selling which Phase 2 of the review will identify, how restitution will be made and how fast cases will be dealt with. Receipts relating to reinstatements, mainly from Phase 1 of the review, in the current financial year are now expected to be approximately &#163;195 million, bringing cumulative receipts up to the end of 1999-2000 to about &#163;850 million. The latest estimate of receipts in the following three years is &#163;100 million to 200 million a year. This is based on an expectation of receipts of about &#163;95 million next year from schemes other than the NHS, with no certainty about the level of receipts thereafter. In addition, it is estimated that the NHS Pensions Scheme will receive about &#163;300 million in respect of Phase 2 cases, based on an expectation that some 50,000 cases will require reinstatement to the NHS Pensions Scheme at an average cost of &#163;6,000 each. The NHS Phase 2 receipts are assumed to be spread evenly over the next three years.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what was the outcome of the Agriculture Council held in Brussels on 14 to 15 December; and if he will make a statement.  [103470]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w34.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 I represented the UK at the Agriculture Council meeting in Brussels on 14 December, accompanied by Ross Finnie, Minister for Rural Affairs in the Scottish Executive.
<P>

<a name="91220w34.html_para0">The Council agreed to postpone for 12 months the introduction of compulsory labelling of beef in the light of evidence that the majority of member states would be unable to guarantee the integrity of such labels. Only France voted against. The precise legal form of the measure would depend upon the terms of the European Parliament's opinion on the Commission proposal, due to be delivered later in the week.
<P>

<a name="91220w34.html_para1">The Council also decided by QM (Portugal voting against) to defer for six months implementation of a 1997 Decision on Community-wide measures controlling Specified Risk Material pending agreement on a new Decision.
<P>

<a name="91220w34.html_para2">The Council agreed that adjustments to export refunds for processed agricultural products in order to meet budgetary and WTO limits should in future be governed by a strategic and targeted approach rather than via across the board cuts in refund rates. Officials were mandated to develop this strategy urgently with a view to adoption by March 2000 at the latest. I pointed out that in the medium term, the solution was to bring down CAP support prices. Meanwhile I endorsed the Council's proposed approach and expressed regret at the Commission's decisions to apply across the board refund cuts to date.
<P>

<a name="91220w34.html_para3">Commissioner Byrne updated the Council on developments in response to last summer's dioxin crisis and on the Commission's plans in relation to food safety. Commissioner Fischler reported on his participation in the recent WTO Ministerial meeting in Seattle and on new Commission proposals for reform of the CAP cotton regime.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what was the outcome of the Fisheries Council held in Brussels on 16 and 17 December; and if he will make a statement.  [103840]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w34.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the EU Fisheries Council in Brussels on 16-17 December, together with Mr. John Home Robertson, Deputy Minister for Rural Affairs in the Scottish Executive and Mrs. Brid Rodgers, the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, the first Minister from the newly devolved administration to attend an EU Council.
<P>

<a name="91220w34.html_para4">The Council agreed by qualified majority, with France voting against, the total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas to apply in 2000 in Community waters and for 



<P>
<P><I>20 Dec 1999 : Column: 438W</I><P>
Community vessels fishing in waters where catch limitations apply. Details of the final TACs are given in the following table.
<P>

<a name="91220w34.html_para5">Following from the advice of fisheries scientists in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), the Commission had initially proposed substantial cuts in many TACs, reflecting the poor state of some stocks, reduced recruitment to them or the need to bring fishing effort back to levels which will help to sustain the future availability of stocks. Working on the basis of the scientific advice but using some of the precautionary management options identified by the scientists, we were able to secure smaller cuts than originally proposed for a number of TACs including nephrops in Area VII, anglers (monk fish) in West of Scotland, the North Sea and in Area VII, and in some flat fish TACs. As a result, at the end of the negotiations, the total UK quotas agreed were some 95,000 tonnes higher in cod equivalent tonnes than in the Commission proposals. This increase reduces the estimated loss of quota value to the industry in 2000 from &#163;70 million to &#163;40 million.
<P>

<a name="91220w34.html_para6">Recognising the need to take steps to promote the recovery of the badly depleted cod stock in the Irish Sea, we were able to secure a Council and Commission commitment to introduce a recovery programme, after consultation with a new regional group made up of fishermen, scientists, and administrators involved in this fishery. The Commission will for the first time use the emergency conservation powers available to it to bring forward measures closing those areas in the Irish Sea in which spawning cod congregate from February to April 2000, as a way of protecting the stock. This commitment to an EU recovery programme, which followed intensive preparatory discussions between us, the Irish and the Commission, sets an important precedent for regional co-operation under the Common Fisheries Policy and the involvement of the industry in management decisions on stock recovery.
<P>

<a name="91220w34.html_para7">The Council also agreed on the closure from 1 January 2000 of the sandeel fishery off the Firth of Forth in the interests of protecting seabirds dependent on sandeels. This measure which is in line with scientific advice resulted from close co-operation between us, Denmark and the Commission.
<P>

<a name="91220w34.html_para8">The Council further agreed not to reduce in 2000 the minimum landing size for plaice to 22 cm. As a result, I am pleased to confirm that this will remain at 27 cm.
<P>

<a name="91220w34.html_para9">I successfully invoked the Hague Preference on all those stocks where it was in our overall interest to do so.
<P>

<a name="91220w34.html_para10">The Regulation on TACs and Quotas adopted by the Council incorporates for the first time in a single Regulation the outcome of all the Community's international fisheries arrangements for 2000 between the Community and Norway, Faroes, Greenland and Iceland, and under the North West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation and the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission.
<P>

<a name="91220w34.html_para11">The Council also adopted unanimously, with Portugal abstaining, the Regulation applying control measures for Community vessels in 2000 required under the North East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation arrangements.
<P>

<a name="91220w34.html_para12">Commissioner Fischler confirmed that he would be meeting the Moroccan Minister of Fisheries on 20 December to initiate negotiations on a new fisheries

agreement between the EU and Morocco. He also made brief presentations on a Commission report on regional meetings, which will become available and be considered from January 2000, and the Commission's proposals for further amendment of the Technical Conservation Regulation, which includes provision for a three year closure of the Firth of Forth sandeel fishery.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many representations he has received in response to the Government paper, The Hill Farm Allowance Scheme in England; how many of them were from the West Country; and how long was the consultation period.  [102172]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w35.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The consultation paper was published on 5 November, and the deadline for responses was four weeks later on 3 December. By then we had received 48 responses. Most were from national organisations, but seven were sent from south-west interests.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what <i>(a)</i> economic and <i>(b)</i> environmental impact studies he has undertaken with regard to the effect on less favoured areas of the proposed Hill Farm Allowance Scheme; and if he will make a statement.  [102173]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w35.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 In formulating the proposals account was taken of the evaluation report on the Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowance scheme in England which was published in April 1998, of the latest data on hill farm incomes, and of management reports on the less favoured areas overgrazing controls and other advice from the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency. The proposals also reflect an assessment of their likely redistributive effect. The impact of the new scheme will be monitored, and it will be reviewed in 2003.

<P>
<a name="91220w35.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The proposed Hill Farm Allowance Scheme will apply only in England, and the first payments will be made during the early months of 2001.

<P>
<a name="91220w35.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1999]:</i> We intend to continue to process National List applications for GM varieties. However the Government have decided not to grant a commercial level of approval to any herbicide for use on a crop genetically modified to be tolerant to that particular herbicide unless and until such a time as the crop itself is legally on the market. In the meantime, approvals for such use will be restricted to experimental approvals to allow for the use of the pesticide in question on a limited scale so that research work may be carried out.

 <i>[holding answer 13 December 1999]:</i> The Government announced on 7 December their intention to introduce modulation of farm payments as from 2001 and to use the funds released, with Government match funding, towards the seven-year Rural Development programme. In 2001, 2.5 per cent. of payments will be modulated, rising to 3 per cent. in 2002, 3.5 per cent. in 2003 and 2004 and 4.5 per cent. in 2005 and 2006.

<P>
<a name="91220w36.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Gibson: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to assess the Committee on Toxicity report on organophosphates.  [103250]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91220w36.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 We are today publishing the advice Ministers have received from the Veterinary Products Committee (VPC), the Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) on the regulatory implications of the report on organophosphates (OPs) by the Committee on Toxicity (COT). Copies of this advice have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="91220w36.html_para3">This Government have ensured that OPs have been subject to a more rigorous and transparent scrutiny than ever before. Publication of this advice, and our conclusions on it, marks the end of a key stage in that process.
<P>

<a name="91220w36.html_para4">The regulatory committees all take note from the COT report that any ill-health effects from prolonged low-level exposure to OPs remain unproven, although there remains a question over whether there may be a small group of 



<P>
<P><I>20 Dec 1999 : Column: 447W</I><P>
individuals particularly susceptible to OPs. They endorse the need for further research to address this and the other areas of uncertainty identified by COT.
<P>

<a name="91220w36.html_para5">On the basis of current scientific knowledge, the regulatory committees advise against any general withdrawal of OPs from the market. However, in the light of the research by the Institute of Occupational Medicine, which identified the main risk of exposure to OP sheep dips as coming from the concentrate, the VPC has advised that all OP sheep dips should be withdrawn from the market pending the introduction of new containers which would minimise operator exposure.
<P>

<a name="91220w36.html_para6">The Government accept this advice. We shall be implementing the committees' advice and carrying forward work on OPs through a four point plan.
<P>

<a name="91220w36.html_para7">Firstly, we are taking immediate action on OP sheep dip concentrate containers. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) has today written to all holders of marketing authorisations for OP sheep dips requiring the withdrawal of these products from the market until containers are introduced which will minimise operator exposure to OP concentrate. Product recall from distributors and farms will also be implemented. The issues surrounding packaging of OP pesticides are rather different. However, in line with the ACP advice, the Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) is taking urgent action to confirm that all containers of OP pesticides concentrates comply with modern standards; and PSD will take regulatory action if they do not.
<P>

<a name="91220w36.html_para8">Secondly, we are ensuring that data packages for OP compounds enable full evaluations in line with modern safety standards through the continuing reviews of OP veterinary medicines other than sheep dips (by the VPC) and of anticholinesterase pesticides (by the ACP). The ACP has recommended that regulatory action should be taken against approvals for products containing three OP 



<P>
<P><I>20 Dec 1999 : Column: 448W</I><P>
compounds for which supporting data have not been submitted under the anticholinesterase review. Revocations of the approvals are being sent immediately to approval holders. This means that in all 14 OP compounds (more than half the OP compounds formerly approved) have now been revoked as a result of this major review.
<P>

<a name="91220w36.html_para9">Thirdly, we shall be implementing measures aimed at continuing to promote best practice. For sheep dip, we accept the advice from the Health and Safety Commission that extension of mandatory certification would not be appropriate. Best practice will be promoted through a range of measures including further improvements to labelling to highlight necessary precautions in the light of the IOM report; a continuing programme of targeted inspections by HSE inspectors to reinforce messages on risk control and training and competence for sheep dippers; and supply of protective gloves with sheep dip. We have also decided not to further extend mandatory certification for pesticides uses in the light of the advice we have received and comments on the consultation we conducted earlier this year. We shall, however, be improving the guidance and the syllabus for the certificate of competence in this area.
<P>

<a name="91220w36.html_para10">Fourthly, MAFF, acting jointly with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Department of Health, intend to develop a targeted research programme to take forward the research recommendations from COT and the regulatory committees. We want to involve expertise from the wider scientific community in this process. We therefore plan to hold a broadly based seminar in the new year to determine the scientific input and approaches required to meet these defined research needs. In addition, we are currently discussing a proposal to investigate databases of people who believe they are suffering from the effects of OPs. We hope to conclude contractual negotiations with a view to the project starting as early as possible in the new year.
