 The information on overseas offices of the Defence Export Services Organisation (DESO) is set out in the following table. The entries for Kuwait and Saudi Arabia refer to trade promotion offices. These are separate from the Project Offices in those countries, information about which I gave the hon. Member in a written answer on 9 October 2007, <i> Official Report,</i> column 504W. The two project offices were established in Saudi Arabia in 1987, and in Kuwait in 1993.

These vessels are purpose built and more effective and efficient for the equivalent time at sea than the Hunt Class vessels, which provide some of the current patrol time.</p>

 The House is not within the scope of the relevant sections of the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. However, the staff handbook, which is available on the parliamentary intranet, does contain sections on safeguarding official information (section 5.18), crises of conscience (section 5.28) and grievance (section 6). These are supported by a core values statement on integrity, in serving the House of Commons, its Committees and Members, and the public with honesty, probity and political impartiality. The statement can be found in House of Commons corporate business plan 2007 which is also available on the intranet.</p>

 Escalators of this type would be expected to have a life expectancy of about 10 years&#151;those in Portcullis House were installed in 1999 and replaced after eight years in 2007. The tender cost was &#163;327,000 and the project was completed on budget.

 The refurbishment of the Press Gallery has been a project to modernise accommodation used by the journalists and political correspondents based in the Palace of Westminster for the purposes of reporting on the business of Parliament. The press have had a recognised presence in the House of Commons since 1803, when Speaker Abbott ruled that they should have privileged access to the Gallery.</p>

The second and final phase of works was completed over the 2007 summer recess, during which the entire Press Gallery was decanted. The project also involved refitting and updating the catering facilities in that area of the Palace in order to make more efficient use of the space. The final handover of office accommodation and the new catering facilities took place on 15 October.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="71016w0004.htm_para4"><a name="07101677000749">The project was completed at a total cost of &#163;7.71 million to the House.

4. The total awarded and refused does not constitute the figure for claims received.<br>
5. It is not possible to deduce proportions of the total claims received that are successful or unsuccessful as claims received in a given year may not necessarily get a decision in that same year.<br>
6. The percentage awarded figures represent the proportion of awarded decisions of all decisions i.e. of the total of awarded and refused combined. These percentages represent the best view of the award success rate, but only reflect decisions that are recorded in the counts that can be extracted from MISP.<br>
7. There is limited information available about how the counts are derived, and so there may be some claims excluded from these results, and some claims included twice e.g. if a claim is initially refused, goes to appeal and is then awarded, it could be counted in both the awarded and refused volumes.<br>

The next steps in the National Alcohol Strategy', the Government are committed to carrying out an independent review of the relationship between alcohol price, promotion and harm, and following public consultation, will consider the need for regulatory change in the future, if necessary. This review is being led by the Department of Health and has gone out to tender. We anticipate publishing the review's findings in the summer of 2008. In addition, the Government are also committed to carrying out a review and consultation on the effectiveness of the alcohol industry's Social Responsibility Standards document in contributing to a reduction in alcohol harm, and following public consultation, will consider the need for regulatory change in the future, if necessary.

Failure to maintain records in a format that is acceptable to the Secretary of State is in breach of the terms and conditions of authorities issued under the 1986 Act.</p>

 SOCA and its predecessors receive intelligence from numerous sources and in a variety of forms. This is assessed, analysed and acted upon in different ways depending on the content. It is not therefore possible to quantify "intelligence referrals" as a unit of measurement.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 October 2007]:</i> The allocation and deployment of resources are operational matters for individual chief officers of police. It is right that day to day decisions should be taken at the local level in the light of changing situations and circumstances and public concerns at different times and in different places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_416"><a name="71016w0011.htm_para4"><a name="07101677001444">We have made clear on numerous occasions our view of the importance of roads policing, including by references in National Policing Plans and the National Community Safety Plan. In January 2005, the Home Office, Department for Transport and ACPO issued a jointly agreed national Roads Policing Strategy to set roads policing in the context of over-all police work, establish continuing priorities and identify under- pinning principles for operational practice and the development of policy. Ministers wrote earlier this year to all chief officers stressing the importance of roads policing and of treating offences on the roads as seriously as other offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_417"><a name="71016w0011.htm_para5"><a name="07101677001445">We do not believe it helpful to focus exclusively on numbers. More effective roads policing is in general delivered chiefly by better use of intelligence, more targeting and more efficient use of resources. The Government have, moreover, increased the number of police over-all by more than 14, 000. This means more officers available for all aspects of police work, including roads policing. All police officers can enforce road traffic legislation as appropriate, whether or not they are dedicated to roads policing.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 October 2007]:</i> The Home Office does not routinely collate this information and people are expected to return home if they have a spouse visa and their marriage fails during the probationary period as the reason for entry no longer exists. However, if the marriage fails due to domestic violence, an individual can apply for indefinite leave to remain under the Immigration Rules as a victim of such abuse. Steps have been taken to improve the timeliness and effectiveness of application processing and evidence-gathering in these cases.</p>

In these contexts the Chinese Government are regularly made aware of our strong endorsement of the principles of the International Conference on Population and Development. Although the one child policy remains in place, China has made good progress in ensuring reproductive health rights more generally, especially through its implementation of the 2002 Law of Population and Family Planning.

 DFID has not made any specific assessment of UNFPA effectiveness in China since July. However, DFID works closely with UNFPA on reproductive health issues in China, especially in relation to HIV and AIDS prevention, the reduction of maternal mortality and the promotion of gender equity in China's health system. UNFPA programmes in China seek to influence China towards the full acceptance of the principles of the International Conference on Population and Development. The focus of UNFPA support is on improving the quality of care and increasing equity of access to reproductive health services.</p>

 The poorest countries are eligible for 100 per cent. debt cancellation on their bilateral debts under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, as well as 100 per cent. debt cancellation on their debts to the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and African Development Bank under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The UK is at the forefront of debt cancellation for poor countries and international poverty reduction. We exceed our commitments under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives (MDRI), providing the poorest countries with 100 per cent. cancellation on their bilateral and multilateral debts. The HIPS and MDRI systems have cancelled billions of pounds worth of debt and we continue to believe that they are the most appropriate way to tackle sovereign debt problems. Unpayable debts should not hinder the poorest countries from making progress towards the millennium development goals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_421"><a name="71016w0011.htm_para9"><a name="07101687000051">All of our loans are made to internationally recognised governments, are bound by legal contracts and are recognised in international law, we do not therefore consider them to be &#147;illegitimate&#148;. We believe that debt relief should be provided on the basis of a country's economic situation rather than their history of poor or corrupt governance. Many countries that have a history of poor governance are now middle-income countries. If we cancelled so-called &#147;illegitimate&#148; debts for such countries, the full cost would have to be met from DFID's aid budget, diverting vital resources away from poorer countries. It is also likely that creditors and investors would take a negative view of the credit worthiness of developing countries in case the loans were later repudiated. This would be damaging for developing countries trying to strengthen their economies and reduce poverty through access to international investment and financing.</p>

 This Department does not estimate the amount of electricity that will be available from individual renewable energy technologies. The renewables obligation is designed to bring forward the most cost effective means of generating electricity from such sources. However, in modelling likely future scenarios, there are conditions where future generation from landfill gas could be 10 per cent. higher than the 4.4 TWh achieved in 2006. Under the RO generation from landfill gas in the UK has increased by 65 per cent. over the last four years and in 2006 represented 24 per cent. of all generation from renewables in the UK or 1.1 per cent of total UK electricity generation.</p>

Other human rights concerns include: the restrictions on media freedom and increased risk to journalists safety; the rise in attacks on ethnic, racial and religious minorities; the increasing use of forced psychiatric treatment and detention; and the ongoing reports of extra-judicial killings, torture, abduction and arbitrary detention in Chechnya and elsewhere in the North Caucasus.</p>

 Engagement in learning, and educational attainment, are critical if young people are to achieve good outcomes, and fulfil their potential. My Department has a number of initiatives already in place to ensure that 16 to 19-year-olds have access to education and employment with training. Our 14-19 reforms, that include an entitlement for every young person to access a Diploma programme from 2013, will ensure that all young people have the opportunity to choose a learning pathway which suits them and which can be the basis for progression to further learning, higher education and employment.</p>

By 2013 we will introduce an entitlement to an apprenticeship place for all school-leavers who meet the entry criteria. It will mean that every young person leaving school who wants to continue their learning in a work-based environment can do so.</p>

 The EU institution, European Schools, was established by an intergovernmental agreement in 1957. Its purpose is to provide an education based on mother tongue teaching for the children of officials of the EU institutions and its agencies. There are 14 schools in various countries across Europe. The Government are committed to the future of the European Schools and fulfils their obligations under the 1994 Convention Defining the Statute of the European Schools through its membership of the governing body. The United Kingdom has one school in Culham in Oxfordshire. It was established in the late 1970s to support the employees of the EFDA-JET project based at Culham Laboratories.</p>

The decision allows Culham to stay in the system until at least 2010, but its transition into either the state or private sector must be completed by 2017. The EFDA decision to phase out its project at Culham and move the remaining work to its other base in France has contributed to this decision.</p>

But early indications are that the total of balances has increased again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_499"><a name="71016w0019.htm_para1"><a name="0710173000457">It is right that schools should be able to accrue revenue balances from one year to the next in support of strategic, long term, financial planning. However, I am clear that it is not acceptable for Government to allow balances to continue to accumulate. At the end of 2005-06, total net revenue balances were 5.3 per cent. of schools' total income. For schools with a positive balance, the figure is 6.7 per cent. of total income. Moreover, around 17 per cent. of schools had held an excess surplus for each of the last five years. This is taxpayers&#146; money voted by Parliament for the education of the pupils in schools in the year in question and it should not be steadily accumulating in schools' bank accounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_500"><a name="71016w0019.htm_para2"><a name="0710173000458">We are therefore taking action on two fronts to bring the total down. We have introduced a requirement that, from 2007-08, all local authorities must, where they do not already, operate a balance control mechanism enabling them to claw back excess surplus balances. These are defined in the guidance as uncommitted revenue balances above 8 per cent. of total income for primary and special schools and 5 per cent. for secondary schools. The guidance is available in the Library of the House and can be viewed at:</p>
<a name="71016w0019.htm_brev0"><a name="0710173001785"><ul><p class="tabletext">www.teachernet.gov.uk/schemesforfinancingschools/</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_501"><a name="71016w0019.htm_para3"><a name="0710173000459">To be effective, claw-back requires local authorities to scrutinise schools' plans for using their excess surplus balances and reach a judgement on whether the balance is genuinely committed to be spent for a specific purpose within a specified timescale. Claw-back is only as effective, therefore, as the local authority's scrutiny is rigorous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_502"><a name="71016w0019.htm_para4"><a name="0710173000460">In 2005-06, local authorities reported that &#163;988 million or 62.9 per cent. of balances was committed for specific purposes. However what is defined as a committed revenue balance varies from one local authority to another and the split of total revenue balances into committed and uncommitted balances is not reliable. For example, in 2005-06, 37 local authorities reported less than 25 per cent. of their total revenue balances as committed whereas 62 LAs reported more than 75 per cent. of their total revenue balance as committed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_503"><a name="71016w0019.htm_para5"><a name="0710173000461">The Government expect claw-back to have some impact but we believe it is right to take further action on all balances to ensure that their overall level reduces so that some of this money is used to support the education of today's pupils. We proposed in the consultation on the school, early years and 14 to 16 funding arrangements in spring this year to require all local authorities to redistribute locally 5 per cent. of all positive revenue balances from 2008-09. Local authorities will decide with their Schools Forum how the money is to be redistributed locally to support local needs and priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_504"><a name="71016w0019.htm_para6"><a name="0710173000462">I announced in my statement of 25 June 2007, <i> Official Report,</i> column 2WS, our decision to proceed with this proposal, and in September my Department published an Explanatory Note for local authorities and Schools Forums on the school funding arrangements for the next three years, including further detail on how the balance redistribution would work in practice.

The proposition is that local authorities should calculate 5 per cent. of the most recent positive revenue balance for all schools, and add this sum to the total Schools Budget for the coming year. For 2008-09, it is proposed that this should be final balances at the end of 2006-07 since final balances for 2007-08 will not be known before authorities notify schools of their budgets by the end of March. Consultation closes on 26 October and I will announce our final decisions on the redistribution in the light of the comments received. Details of the consultation can be viewed at:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_507"><a name="71016w0019.htm_para9"><a name="0710173000465">It is clear from early responses that schools are particularly concerned about the use of 2006-07 balances.

<p><a name="stpa_508"><a name="71016w0019.htm_para10"><a name="0710173000466">Local authority claw-back mechanisms and the proposed balance redistribution apply to all local authority maintained schools including foundation and trust schools. Academies and city technology colleges (CTCs) are not subject to the same rules on the carry-forward of balances as maintained schools. Instead, the requirements are set out in their individual funding agreements. The normal provision is that the academy or CTC may carry forward at the end of any year a sum which at maximum is 12 per cent. of the General Annual Grant (GAG) for the year just ended; and within that overall limit only 2 per cent., at most, of the preceding year's GAG can be carried forward for revenue spend; the rest must be for capital purposes. This calculation is not cumulative&#151;that is, the total sum carried forward should never grow larger than 12 per cent. of the preceding year's GAG. Adherence to these limits is monitored by the Department and GAG may be clawed back if they are exceeded, although the Secretary of State is empowered under the funding agreements to approve a higher limit in individual cases. There are no plans to change these provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_509"><a name="71016w0019.htm_para11"><a name="0710173000467">Standards Fund grants are paid under sections 14-18 of the Education Act 2002.

A redistribution of 5 per cent. of all positive balances in all authorities would deliver in the region of &#163;85 million in 2008-09 to support locally agreed priorities. As total balances reduce over the spending review period it is anticipated that the income generated through the redistribution will be marginally reduced, however it is not currently possible to predict the total surplus balances over this period.</p>

 In terms of the development of Clinical Assessment, Treatment and Support (CATS) services in Chorley as part of the phase 2 independent sector procurement in the North West, the Department is currently working with the national health service to review the specifications of the remaining schemes in phase 2 of the central procurement process. This will ensure that future schemes best meet the needs of the local NHS, and are responsive to the needs of the communities in which they will operate. This exercise is ongoing, and expected to be completed in October. Once this process is complete, and all parties involved in negotiations have been informed of the outcomes, further information will be made available.</p>

 Providers of national health service dental services have contracts with primary care trusts (PCTs) that set out the agreed annual contract sum and the corresponding level of services to be provided over the course of the year. These annual service levels are expressed mainly in terms of units of dental activity, which measure courses of treatment according to their relative complexity. Dental providers who under-deliver by up to 4 per cent. may carry this forward and make up the activity in the following year. Where a provider has delivered less than 96 per cent. of the agreed annual service level, it is at the PCT&#146;s discretion whether the undelivered activity is carried forward to the following year or an appropriate proportion of the annual contract sum is refunded to the PCT. This is a matter for PCTs to decide locally in the light of individual circumstances, and their decisions are not collected or held centrally.</p>

 Health claims must be substantiated by scientific evidence, and be well understood by the average consumer. The substantiating science is to be assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Authorisation of the claims will then be by joint decision of the Commission and member states in the appropriate regulatory committee. The Food Standards Agency will support claims that comply with the necessary criteria and will push to ensure that the requirement in the regulation that the Commission and EFSA make available technical guidance and tools to assist small and medium sized businesses in the preparation and presentation of an application is fulfilled.</p>

Links between infection and cleanliness vary according to the specific micro-organism involved, and high standards of hygiene are likely to have a greater effect on <i> Clostridium difficile</i> rates, for instance, than on MRSA.</p>

The final amount will depend on the needs of each hospital, which will inevitably vary. Strategic health authorities (SHAs) will work with their primary care trusts to commission deep cleaning at a locally-agreed cost, and to monitor total spend in their areas. Performance management and evaluation will also be carried out locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_593"><a name="71016w0025.htm_para5"><a name="07101710000225">The deep cleaning programme is an important part of our work in relation to health care associated infections, and will therefore be targeted towards acute trusts. However, all hospitals should be clean, and SHAs have the discretion to include other hospitals, including mental health and learning disability units.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_594"><a name="71016w0025.htm_para6"><a name="07101710000226">Deep cleaning is time consuming and can be disruptive.

Maintenance and works and support staff in hotel, property and estates include caretakers/handypersons, gardeners and grounds, maintenance staff, catering staff and cleaning staff. There is no way to separately identify any of these occupations from the census data.<br>
2. More accurate validation processes in 2006 have resulted in the identification and removal of 9,858 duplicate non-medical staff records out of the total work force figure of 1.3 million in 2006. Earlier years' figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years' figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures. This should be taken into consideration when analysing trends overtime.<br>
