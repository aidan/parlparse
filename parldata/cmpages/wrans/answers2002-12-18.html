To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on her policies to deal with abandoned motor vehicles.  [85930]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21218w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 December 2002]:</i> In October 2001 we published a consultation document on measures to remove abandoned and untaxed vehicles from the streets more quickly and, for the longer term, bring forward changes to vehicle registration and licensing procedures to ensure greater accuracy of DVLA's vehicle record.
<P>

<a name="21218w01.html_para0">Regulations reducing the statutory notice periods after which local authorities can remove abandoned vehicles from the highway and the storage periods for unlicensed vehicles came into force on 9 April. Local authorities can now remove those vehicles that they consider merit destruction from the highway after the expiry of a 24 hour notice placed on them.
<P>

<a name="21218w01.html_para1">We have supported pilot schemes in the London boroughs of Newham and Lewisham in which the local authority was given DVLA's powers to wheelclamp and remove unlicensed vehicles after 24 hours. Following the success of the Newham pilot on 10 April, we announced that all councils who wished could operate in the same way.
<P>

<a name="21218w01.html_para2">In addition, councils have targeted over 6,000 abandoned unlicensed vehicles in multi-agency XOperation Cubits" with over 4,000 vehicles crushed and more operations are planned. To date we estimate that the operations have induced more than 15,700 motorists to relicense their vehicles voluntarily bringing in over #2.3 million in additional revenue.
<P>

<a name="21218w01.html_para3">The Government are currently developing proposals for the reform and modernisation of vehicle registration and licensing, to reduce evasion and to bear down on vehicle crime. In response to the recommendations of a report commissioned by the Department for Transport from the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science, that Department has established a Modernising Vehicle Registration Implementation Board (MVRIB). This includes representatives of motorists' organisations, the motor trade, the police and the insurance industry to advise on and develop those proposals.
<P>

<a name="21218w01.html_para4">The 2002 Finance Act contained provisions under which the responsibility for licensing and taxing vehicles will be placed on the registered keeper, who will remain liable for doing so until such time that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) has properly been notified of a change of keeper. These proposals will also mean that it is not necessary for a vehicle to be detected 



<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2002 : Column 798W</I><P>
on the road for effective enforcement action to take place. The implementation of these new powers is at the heart of MVRIB's agenda.

<a name="21218w01.html_wqn1"><B> Paddy Tipping: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will set out the timetable for the review of land based English rural development programme agri-environment schemes.  [87862]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21218w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The agri-environment schemes review consists of three phases. The first phase centred on an initial consultation, held between March and May 2002. This asked for views on the existing schemes and explored what people would like to see in future schemes. There were over 130 responses to this consultation, which were analysed in a report produced in July 2002. This is available on the DEFRA website at: http://defraweb/erdp/schemes/landbased/review/consultnew.htm.
<P>

<a name="21218w01.html_para5">The second phase of the review is currently in progress. It consists of two main areas of work: the production of a framework document setting out the future direction of agri-environment schemes, and the development of a pilot scheme to test the proposed entry-level scheme. The framework document was issued for consultation on 16 December 2002, and responses are sought by 28 February 2003. I announced the pilot areas for the entry level scheme on 14 November 2002 and the pilot scheme is due to be launched next spring.
<P>

<a name="21218w01.html_para6">The third phase of the review will involve the detailed design and development of the main entry-level scheme and a revised higher-tier scheme, intended to incorporate the best features from both the countryside stewardship and environmentally sensitive areas schemes. It is hoped to complete the review in the summer of 2004, when details of both schemes are sent to the European Commission for approval. The new schemes should open for applications early in 2005.

<a name="21218w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The analysis of replies to the public consultation on this review will be published on the Department's website shortly and a copy placed in the House Library and the conclusions will feed into the wider Agri-environment Schemes Review.

<a name="21218w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The future provisions on relative stability, along with all other elements of the Common Fisheries Policy, are due to be determined by the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers at its current meeting.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make contingency plans to establish a fisheries management committee in the event that no Council of Ministers' agreement is established for European Union fisheries management for 2003 onwards.  [87631]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21218w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government's objective is to secure a meaningful reform of the Common Fisheries Policy at this Council. We shall strive to ensure that an acceptable agreement is reached. Should there be no agreement on a reformed CFP, the current system for Fisheries Management will continue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21218w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Sayeed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) how many voluntary agreements within the refrigeration industry to reduce leakage of hydrofluorocarbons she has made; and what targets exist for future progress;  [86494]
<P>
<UL>(2) if she will make a statement on the progress in securing voluntary agreements within the refrigeration industry to reduce leakage of hydrofluorocarbons.  [86495]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21218w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In 1996, the Government concluded a voluntary agreement on the use of HFCs with the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Industry Board (ACRIB) and its member organisations to ensure emissions to atmosphere were minimised. The agreement took the form of a Xdeclaration of intent" in recognition of the fact that the industry is very widely dispersed and that signatories to the agreement could not make a commitment on behalf of those they did not directly represent.
<P>

<a name="21218w01.html_para8">The UK climate change programme published in November 2000 sets out the key elements of the Government's policy on HFCs. During 2000, discussions with ACRIB led Government to conclude that a national registration and competence scheme for refrigerant handlers would be a more effective way of limiting and minimising HFC emissions from the refrigeration sector. The industry is developing a scheme which it proposes to put to Government in early 2003. The Government's intention is to make registration and minimum competence mandatory for companies and refrigerant handlers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to allow the proceeds from landfill tax to go to local authorities.  [87491]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21218w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Last month's pre-Budget report announced that the Government would consult on a revenue neutral proposal to increase the landfill tax escalator to #3 per tonne in 2005&#150;06 and to increase the rate of tax by at least #3 per tonne in future years, towards a rate of #35 per tonne. The Government will consult with stakeholders on options for the package, including the recycling of revenue, before making its decisions.

<P>
<a name="21218w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Figures from a report by the Industry Council for Electronic Equipment Recycling (ICER) show that in 1998 there were about 915,000 tonnes of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) arising, of which approximately 22 per cent. were plastics. These data are currently being updated.
<P>

<a name="21218w02.html_para0">The WEEE Directive requires that WEEE is recovered and recycled according to 10 categories, with recovery and recycling targets set at between 50 per cent. and 80 per cent. for each category. The plastics content varies considerably between the categories, however, a significant proportion of the plastics in WEEE will need to be recovered or recycled to meet the requirements of the WEEE Directive.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures she is taking to allocate resources to pockets of rural deprivation in the delivery of services; and what resources she is making available.  [87706]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21218w02.html_spnew3"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Deprivation in rural areas tends not to be as geographically concentrated as in urban areas and it is less meaningful to think in terms of Xpockets". DEFRA is currently working with the Countryside Agency and Office for National Statistics to explore a better way to identify rural deprivation. The Countryside Agency has a social exclusion programme worth almost #3 million for the three years 2002&#150;03 to 2004&#150;05 with which to promote demonstration projects and new research to identify and tackle social exclusion in rural areas.
<P>

<a name="21218w02.html_para1">DEFRA and the Countryside Agency are actively promoting the equitable allocation of services in rural areas by helping Government Departments to Xrural proof" their policies and programmes. Following the Rural White Paper we allocated over #47 million through the Vital Villages scheme, which in the first instance runs until 2003&#150;04. This is aimed at tackling the problem of dwindling services at the root, by enabling local people to set up their own enterprises.

 The initiative to offer #50,000 'golden hellos' to consultants in certain key shortage categories and to vocationally trained general medical practitioners, in return for a five year commission, was only announced on 19 November 2002. It is therefore too early for any individuals to have been recruited into the Defence Medical Services.

 <i>[holding answer 17 December 2002]:</i> NATO and the European Security and Defence Policy have clearly-defined and complementary roles. NATO forms the basis of the collective defence of its members and plays an important role in crisis management. ESDP allows the EU to launch military operations where NATO as a whole is not engaged, within the scope of the Petersberg tasks, which are defined in the EU Treaty as

These roles have been reflected in agreed language in both organisations: for example, the conclusions of the 2000 Nice European Council, and the communiqu&#233; from the North Atlantic Council meeting a few days later. On this basis, the EU and NATO have agreed to create a strategic partnership between the two organisations in crisis management.

<P>
<a name="21218w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has fitted Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) to its front line aircraft, ships and land-based air defence systems. The current generation of IFF equipment (IFF Mk 10) is in the process of being replaced by an updated system, the Mk 12 standard, through the Successor IFF (SIFF) programme. The Mk 12 provides additional security by means of high reliability encrypted interrogation of platforms. IFF is one of a number of methods employed by the armed forces to assist Combat Identification and to minimise the risk of friendly fire incidents. Combat Identification is achieved through a triad of measures: Situational Awareness, Target Identification, and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures. These measures are complementary and IFF plays a part in improving situational awareness and contributes to effective identification.

In addition, regular and volunteer reserve forces personnel are offered a range of routine vaccinations as part of an established immunisation programme. Personnel deploying to areas with a specific health hazard, and those in special occupational risk groups, such as medical personnel, may be given additional vaccinations.

 Decisions on vaccinations for service personnel are made on the basis of expert medical advice and take full account of any risk from adverse reactions, balanced against the risks from disease. Routine inoculations given to service personnel deploying to the middle east are licensed products that have been rigorously tested for safety. This includes vaccination against anthrax, which has been offered to personnel deploying to the middle east since May 2001 under the Department's voluntary immunisation programme (VIP). All personnel who elect to receive immunisation against anthrax under the VIP are briefed on, and instructed to report to medical staff, any adverse reactions to the vaccine. No serious adverse reactions have been reported.

 In the UK in the immediate aftermath of September 2001 attacks we immediately tightened the security regime for commercial flights by small aircraft.

That exemption has been removed, and aircraft of any weight are now subject to the programme.

<a name="21218w04.html_para3">The Council agreed on a Regulation providing for new levels of compensation to air passengers in the event of denied boarding, cancellation and delay. A majority of Ministers accepted three levels of compensation: 250 euros for all flights of 1,500 km or less, 400 euros for intra-EU flights of more than 1,500 km and other flights between 1,500&#150;3,500 km, and 600 euros for all other flights. These compensation levels will be reviewed four years after the Regulation comes into effect. The UK voted against the Regulation because in the absence of a link to the ticket price it could damage the interests of consumers of Xno-frills" air services. During the debate, the Minister of State had voiced concern at the impact on the services of no-frills carriers, pointing out that the minimum compensation level was almost four times the average cost of a no-frills ticket. Following a suggestion from some member states that the scope of the Regulation be extended to certain passengers returning to the EU from non-Community airports, it was agreed that the Commission would publish a report on this issue.

The presidency noted the progress that had been made on this package of five proposals, designed to progress the development of more harmonised technical standards for interoperability, harmonise safety regulation processes, to open up access to the market for all rail freight services, and to establish a European Rail Agency. In discussion of the main outstanding issues on the safety and interoperability proposals there was a consensus for member states to be able to maintain safety levels above any harmonised minimum standard, and general support for extending the scope of the interoperability requirements. The presidency concluded that work should continue on the package. Greece made clear that it hoped to reach agreement during its presidency.

The UK's concern was that the EU should not commit itself at this stage to its own fund in the event of failure of negotiations in the IMO, for fear of prejudicing those negotiations, and we secured an amendment to this effect. The Conclusions also include commitments to a faster phasing out of single-hulled tankers and restrictions on those carrying very heavy oil. There is to be an analysis of available double-hull tanker capacity. Also included are: better implementation of port state control obligations, and possible measures by member states to prohibit within 200 miles of their coasts traffic carrying dangerous and polluting goods.

 My Department is still appraising the proposals. As this would be a large and expensive scheme, we have asked independent external consultants to undertake a technical audit of the information received, in order to help us form a view on whether the proposal passes the established tests that determine eligibility for government funding. We will continue to work with the promoters to resolve outstanding issues as soon as possible, and would hope to be able to give them a provisional view of the scheme in advance of the next local transport investment settlement. This would be without prejudice to any statutory approvals that may be required.

There are a further 13 schemes with a rural element where the Strategic Rail Authority are awaiting formal bids. From the total of those approved bids containing a rural element, the average RPP funding awarded is around #100,000.

In the future, in those regions where voters choose in a referendum to have an elected assembly, the RDA will be accountable to the elected assembly in the region, which will appoint the Chair and Board members and publish the regional economic strategy. Elected regional assemblies will also have a significant influence over other bodies such as the local Learning and Skills Councils, Small Business Service, Strategic Rail Authority, Environment Agency and cultural bodies, through making appointments, being consulted on strategies and co-ordinating activity.

 <i>[holding answer 17 December 2002]:</i> Concern is sometimes expressed that the growth of the service sector may slow overall productivity growth because measured productivity growth is lower in the service sector than in the rest of the economy. However this conclusion, which emerged in academic research in the 1960s, has been called into question by later research. Moreover a number of studies show that the UK service sector has considerable potential to catch up with best-practice productivity levels elsewhere. The Government are keen to encourage productivity growth and narrow the productivity gap in all sectors of the economy.

<P>
<a name="21218w08.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Performance and Innovation Unit's 'Renewable Energy in the UK&#151;Building for the Future' report recommended that up to #10 million of support be provided as capital grants specifically for renewable energy schemes that engage local communities or individual households.
<P>

<a name="21218w08.html_para1">The DTI has since undertaken a broad consultation exercise to inform the positioning, design and workings of this scheme. Through the consultation the DTI has revisited the initial recommendations of the PIU. An initial scoping exercise identified schemes, which had potential overlap with the proposed Community and Household Scheme (CHS), and concluded that such a scheme would be beneficial for the advancement of renewables in the UK.
<P>

<a name="21218w08.html_para2">Although the PIU recommended that no restrictions be placed on technology, the DTI has sought to identify which technologies would enhance the public's understanding of renewables. The scheme has also been designed so that it would not duplicate work under way through other Government or Industry initiatives. Although solar PV has a significant contribution to make to enhancing the public's understanding of renewables, it is already supported by the first phase of the PV Major Demonstration Programme (MDP) which has a budget of #20 million. The programme has already supported PV installations by homeowners and local groups. Technologies such as solar water heating, small wind and micro hydro can also make a positive contribution to the public's understanding of renewables. These technologies, in contrast to solar PV, receive little or no Government support.
<P>

<a name="21218w08.html_para3">The scheme also aims to tackle some of the other barriers to uptake such as installer accreditation. Again installer accreditation for solar PV occurs under the MDP and so any such work in the Community and Household would be redundant.

<i>[holding answer 16 December 2002]:</i> We consulted local authorities and local residents groups, as well as representatives of the music industry, following the publication of our proposals for reform of the licensing laws, and considered views on public nuisance and the impact of various forms of entertainment on the community. The comments that were received during the initial review and in response to the publication of the White Paper led to our making the prevention of public nuisance one of the four primary licensing objectives of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21218w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 In the interests of targeting resources to where the need is greatest I have decided that those who can afford to pay for their housing support services should continue to do so. However it is important that the administration costs of operating such an arrangement are kept to a minimum. Rather than spending around #250,000 to develop and administer a specific supporting people means test, I have decided that eligibility for housing benefit or any other means tested benefit, should be the automatic passport to free housing support services. This will be easy to operate with little additional costs in terms of administration.

 Understanding our system of government is an important part of citizenship education, which became a part of the statutory National Curriculum for 11 to 16-year-olds in September 2002. It is for teachers to decide on the most appropriate materials, including visual aids, to encourage teaching and learning in the classroom. Teachers are aware of potential political problems and are professional in their approach. There are safeguards in law to guard against biased teaching. LEAs and schools must take reasonable steps to ensure that where political or controversial issues are covered, teachers offer pupils a balanced presentation of opposing views. The law on this is contained in sections 406 and 407 of the Education Act 1996.

<i> [holding answer12 December 2002]:</i> The Department has no analysis of how much cost is incurred in educating an excluded pupil at a pupil referral unit (PRU).

<a name="21218w10.html_para2">Funding for PRUs is contained in the Social Inclusion: Pupil Support (SIPS) grant. This grant (#176 million in 2002&#150;03) is designed to tackle bad behaviour in schools and to provide education for pupils outside mainstream schools.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the level of schools funding per pupil was in <i>(a)</i> Kent and <i>(b)</i> Medway in each year since 1996; what the predicted spending for the next three years will be in each case; and what the capital investment was each year since 1996.

 The tables show the Department's total education standard spending assessment, recurrent and capital grant per pupil allocated to Kent and Medway local education authorities for the financial years 1998&#150;99 to 2002&#150;03. The local government reorganisation means that data for 1996&#150;97 and 1997&#150;98 does not conform to current boundaries so comparable figures are not available.

<a name="21218w11.html_para1">As a result of our drive to give extra resources to the front line, there will be no increase in central Government spending per pupil but a national average increase of over #540 per pupil in our plans for local government spending over the next three years.
<P>

<a name="21218w11.html_para2">It is not possible to set out now education formula spending shares (EFSS) for Kent and Medway for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06: they will depend on pupil numbers and indicator data at January 2003 and 2004. However, we have provided Kent and Medway with figures for total education formula spending for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06, together with forward projections at national level of pupil numbers for those years. We have also said that there will be minimum and maximum increases for authorities as we introduce the new LEA funding system. Indicator data will be averaged over three years to provide further stability and predictability in future formula spending shares. Kent and Medway will be able to use this data&#151;together with local knowledge about pupil numbers and indicators&#151;to form a good estimate of what their EFSS might be in those years. That will in turn allow them to provide schools with indicative budgets for the next three years.

 Local education authorities (LEAs) and schools are able to use record increases in funding for education made available by the Government, of #12.8 billion between 2002&#150;03 and 2005&#150;06 (of which #2.7 billion is capital) to implement their duties under the SEN and Disability Act 2001.
<P>

<a name="21218w11.html_para4">Increases in the SEN Standards Fund and the Schools Access Initiative have provided specific sources of extra funding for local education authorities and schools to meet the requirements to include pupils with special educational needs and disabilities within schools and to establish local parent partnership and disagreement resolution services.
<P>

<a name="21218w11.html_para5">In 2002&#150;03 a total of #91 million was made available to LEAs and schools to support the needs of pupils with SEN and disabilities and vulnerable children from the Standards Fund and in 2003&#150;04 will remain at this record level. Eligible expenditure from the fund includes training and between 1999 and 2002 the fund has been used to establish parent partnership services, which are now statutory services.

 The Department will not be abolishing the sponsorship requirement for schools applying for specialist school status.
<P>

<a name="21218w11.html_para7">Raising sponsorship is a key aspect of the Specialist Schools Programme. The main rationale behind it is the need for specialist schools to build partnerships with sponsors and the local community. As a task, raising sponsorship links into the enterprising ethos that is integral to the programme as a whole and it serves as a forum for the school's public presentation of its plans for specialist designation.
<P>

<a name="21218w11.html_para8">The Department has already done much to help schools which are having difficulties raising the necessary sponsorship. We grant-aid the Technology Colleges Trust and the Youth Sport Trust, which advise schools on raising sponsorship. The Trusts are often able to help schools with money donated centrally, on the basis of criteria set out by sponsors.
<P>

<a name="21218w11.html_para9">In 1999 we reduced the sponsorship requirement to #50,000, and in May this year we reduced the amount of sponsorship required by small mainstream schools (defined as those with under 500 pupils on roll) to #100 per pupil, subject to a minimum of #20,000, rising to #50,000 for a school with 500 pupils.
<P>

<a name="21218w11.html_para10">In November the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced the creation of a Partnership Fund. The Fund, which will contain #3 million in 2003&#150;04, is designed specifically to help schools which have had serious difficulties meeting the #50,000 sponsorship requirement. The Department is in the process of developing criteria for the allocation of the fund, which will be managed by the Technology Colleges Trust. The criteria will be based around evidence that the school has made a real effort to raise sponsorship and has created valuable links with businesses.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the mean delay for checks on volunteers was under the old system of police checks in the last 12 months of its operation; and what the mean delay for such checks has been in relation to volunteers under the new arrangements instituted by the Criminal Records Bureau in the last 12 months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21218w12.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 November 2002]:</i> Information is not available in the form requested. Under the previous arrangements some volunteers were subject to police checks via local authorities and other organisations but separate statistics were not collected. A number of voluntary organisations accessed police checks through a body called the Voluntary Organisations Consultancy Service (VOCS), covering both volunteers and paid employees. Their last annual report covering the financial year 2001&#150;2002 showed that they processed 13,535 police checks for voluntary organisations of which 6,595 were for paid employees and 6,940 were for volunteers. The average time for responses from the police was 30 days. VOCS' own handling time was additional.
<P>

<a name="21218w12.html_para11">As to the current arrangements, no distinction is made in relation to the profession or status of an applicant. As a result, the IT system is not able at present to extract this data from the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) database (although it is expected to be able to do so in future when the system is updated). They are all subject to the same level of service. However, access to checks by the voluntary sector has been greatly increased with the advent of the CRB and many more volunteers are now subject to such checks.
<P>

<a name="21218w12.html_para12">The average turnaround time for processing applications remains at about six weeks.

 There is provision under the terms of the contract between Capita and the Home Office for penalties for delay or poor performance. Capita has incurred liquidated damages for delay although the details remain commercial in confidence and cannot be divulged. The main priority is for the Criminal Records Bureau and Capita to collaborate in order to achieve further improvement in the quality of service.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what provision is in place to support drug addicts on their release from prison; what information is passed to drug treatment agencies when a drug addict is released into their home community; and if drug addicts are tracked on release from prison to facilitate treatment.

<a name="21218w13.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 17 December 2002]:</i> All prisons have a Counselling, Assessment, Referral, Advice and Throughcare service (CARAT), which seeks to put in place care plans for prisoners, which should identify need for throughcare on release. Prisoners serving sentences of 12 months or less can receive support from CARATs. Prior to release, CARATs will warn of the dangers associated with loss of tolerance in prison and will try to establish a link with a community drug service. When this is not achieved, CARATs will provide a degree of support, where practical, for up to eight weeks after release.
<P>

<a name="21218w13.html_para0">Prisoners serving sentences in excess of 12 months are routinely subject to supervision by the National Probation Service. CARAT workers will advise a supervising probation officer of any continuing, post-release drug treatment needs and will request the establishment of a link with a community drug agency. A prisoner's progress will be monitored until the expiry of the supervision period.
<P>

<a name="21218w13.html_para1">As outlined in the Government's updated Drug Strategy 2002, published on 3 December 2002, the Home Office, alongside the National Treatment Agency, the National Probation Directorate and the Prison Service is working to improve the availability and quality of community support for ex-prisoners with drug problems and to ensure that an effective infrastructure is in place to bridge the gap between prison and community.

<a name="21218w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 17 December 2002]:</i> Estimating numbers of drug addicts is very difficult and figures are not available for Hampshire or England for the years requested. The latest estimates for the number of Class A problem drug users in England and Wales range from 281,125 to 506,025. The first of these figures is closest to previously reported estimates. These figures come from a Home Office study entitled: XThe Economic and Social Costs of Class A drug use in England and Wales, 2000". Copies of this publication will be placed in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action he is taking to reduce the number of suicides in prison.  [87475]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21218w13.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The general prison population contains a large number of prisoners with a combination of psychiatric disorders, alcohol and drug dependency, family background and relationship problems, histories of self-harm and previous abuse, all of which raise their risk of suicide. Good care and support from staff saves many lives but such instances go largely unreported. The current operating environment is very challenging because an increased prisoner population and movement of prisoners puts a strain on resources and makes it harder to prevent suicides. The Prison Service's approach, in close partnership with outside organisations such as Samaritans, better identify and support those who seem at greatest risk with an approach that focuses on relationships, processes and the physical environment.
<P>

<a name="21218w13.html_para5">The Prison Service's suicide prevention and self-harm reduction programme includes a series of inter-related projects to improve pre-reception, reception and induction arrangements; inter-agency information exchange; prisoner care; detoxification; prisoner peer support, and the learning from investigations into deaths in custody.
<P>

<a name="21218w13.html_para6">Piloting of these projects is focused on six establishments&#151;Wandsworth, Feltham, Eastwood Park, Leeds, Winchester and Birmingham&#151;although others are involved in aspects of the work. An investment of #21.69 million over the three year programme from April 2001 is allowing physical improvements to be made at these six sites, for example to reception and induction areas, and through the installation of more first night centres, safer cells, crisis suites and gated cells that enable staff to watch at-risk prisoners closely. The programme will be subject to an independent quantitative and qualitative evaluation. No resources have at present been allocated to work beyond April 2004.
<P>

<a name="21218w13.html_para7">Thirty full-time suicide prevention co-ordinators (SPCs) were trained and located in the most high risk establishments, and a further 99 mostly part-time SPCs are now operating across the estate. There has been a continuing increase in the numbers of prisoner XListeners" being recruited in high-risk establishments,

 At the Paris Donors Roundtable Meeting in December 2000 we stated that although the UK would not become a substantial bilateral donor to Burundi we would play our part in support of others, particularly the multilateral agencies. We stated that we would continue our existing bilateral assistance (mainly humanitarian assistance, work with the media, HIV/AIDS prevention, and peace building). We said we would look favourably on making a contribution to the World Bank Multilateral Debt Trust Fund (MDTF). At the Geneva Round Table Meeting in December 2001 we pledged US$1 million to the MDTF. These funds were transferred earlier this year.

 Between September 2001 and April 2002 we piloted a number of approaches aimed at encouraging greater take up of basic skills provision by people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance. These included testing different mechanisms to identify those with basic skills needs, and the use of financial incentives and/or benefit sanctions to encourage the take up of training.
<P>

<a name="21218w17.html_para5">In North Nottinghamshire we piloted the use of benefit sanctions if a client refused an offer of training or left training early without good cause. In Leeds we combined the use of sanctions with financial incentives of #20 per week on top of their benefit for taking up training and #100 for achieving a basic skills qualification. In the two pilots, 1,623 clients had a possible basic skills need identified. Of these, 18 had sanctions applied, three because they failed to attend a basic skills assessment and 15 because they failed to attend training or left early without good cause.
<P>

<a name="21218w17.html_para6">All the basic skills pilots are subject to an extensive, longitudinal evaluation study. This is looking at both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the pilots. The final evaluation report will be available in summer 2003. We will use the evidence from the evaluation to decide what changes we might make to help encourage more Jobcentre Plus clients to take up offers of help to improve their basic skills.

CAFCASS's corporate plan for 2002&#150;06, agreed with Ministers and published in February 2002, set out CAFCASS's commitment to develop national standards and a new complaints procedure for the service. CAFCASS consulted widely on their proposed national standards and complaints procedure. CAFCASS intend to implement both next year.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what the Government's policy is on the EU proposal for a Council Regulation on Mutual Recognition of Decisions on Parental Responsibility; if he will place a copy of the current text of the Proposal in the Library; and whether the current text will be detrimental to the effective operation of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction between EU member states.  [87246]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21218w18.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Government support the underlying aim of this proposal, namely to extend the principle of mutual recognition to all decisions on parental responsibility by establishing a clear and coherent set of rules for attributing jurisdiction, and putting in place arrangements for co-operation between the courts and central authorities of member states. Agreement was reached at a Council of Ministers meeting on 29 November, on revised provisions relating to child abduction. The Government support strongly these additional measures which will, for intra-EU cases, augment the 1980 Hague Convention without affecting its operation, and have met with approval in the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference. A copy of this agreement has been placed in the House of Commons Library.

<a name="21218w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Up to 13 December the Supporting People helpline has received 2,987 calls. We do not have a dedicated high hedges hotline. However, we estimate that since June we have taken about 100 telephone calls on high hedges and our Trees and Problem Hedges website has attracted almost 5,000 visitors.

<a name="21218w20.html_para1">On 12 September 2002, it was announced that an estimated 596 people are sleeping rough on any one night in England based on data collated from local authorities in the summer of 2002.

<a name="21218w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Under the homelessness legislation, local housing authorities must ensure that suitable accommodation is available for people who are unintentionally homeless and who have a priority need for accommodation. This would include people who are vulnerable and unintentionally homeless on leaving hospital.
<P>

<a name="21218w20.html_para2">In addition, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is working with the Department of Health on its revision of the Hospital Discharge Workbook, due to be published shortly. This emphasises that all acute hospitals should have formal admission and discharge policies, which will ensure that homeless people are identified on admission, and their pending discharge notified to relevant primary health care services and to homeless service providers, so that people are not in a position of being made homeless at this point.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21218w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Homelessness Directorate's report, XMore than a roof", set out a new approach to tackling homelessness, focused on the problems that homeless people face in the places where they live. It identified addressing health needs as critical in helping homeless people as well as preventing homelessness.
<P>

<a name="21218w20.html_para3">In the Cross-Cutting Review on health inequalities, which the Government published on 20 November, inequalities faced by vulnerable groups&#151;including homeless people&#151;were identified as a top-line priority. As part of Government's response to this through measures to improve access to health services for vulnerable groups and others, the Government have put in place more than 1,300 Personal Medical Service Pilots and 42 NHS Walk-in Centres. Local authorities are expected to work with a range of organisations to deliver their homelessness strategies, including Primary Care Trusts on appropriate health services.

 All Drug Action Teams (DATs) and key local authorities and homelessness agencies were e-mailed a letter from the Under-Secretary of State, Home Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) and myself about Drug Services for Homeless People: a good practice handbook on 4 December. They were directed to www.homelessness.odpm.gov.uk/homelessness/pubs/drug-services/index.htm where the document can be downloaded, and were given the opportunity to be e-mailed the document directly. In addition, over 700 hard copies of the handbook are being posted this week to all DATs, Drugs Prevention Advisory Service (DPAS) co-ordinators, local authority Housing Directors and other key contacts. Further free copies are available from my Department's free distribution centre.

[87466]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21218w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be commissioning a major survey of homeless households in temporary accommodation early in the new year. The research will examine the factors that led to homelessness among a representative sample of households placed in temporary accommodation under the homelessness legislation, and the impact of homelessness and life in temporary accommodation on those households.
<P>

<a name="21218w20.html_para4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's procurement guidance strongly advises against releasing the project budget in advance of commissioning the work as this can distort competition. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will ensure that sufficient funding is available to cover the estimated cost of the research which we anticipate will take up to two years to be completed.
<P>

<a name="21218w20.html_para5">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will consult other Government Departments, including the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills, on the research. In taking forward the work, the appointed contractors will be expected to consult local authorities and other interest groups.
<P>

<a name="21218w20.html_para6">In line with the commitment to tackle homelessness more effectively we are also commissioning a project to evaluate different models of family support. The project will examine models led by different agencies, the voluntary sector, Primary Care Trust and a local authority (Hull City Primary Care Trust, Blackpool City Primary Care Trust, Leicester City Council and the Field Lane Foundation in London). All the models chosen demonstrate multi-agency working and have a health focus. The research will examine the effectiveness of the models in preventing repeat homelessness and will identify good practice to influence future delivery of services.
<P>

<a name="21218w20.html_para7">The evaluation will commence in February 2003 with a review of each service by June 2003, and a final paper by December 2003. Again, it is not appropriate to release the project budget at this stage but we will ensure that there is sufficient funding available to cover the estimated cost of the evaluation. In taking forward the work, the appointed researchers will be expected to consult other relevant interest groups and agencies, drawing on other examples of good practice in the field of family homelessness.

 The content of each local authority's community strategy will vary from one area to another, depending on local priorities as established in consultation with the local community and other partner organisations. The recent announcement concerning freedoms and flexibilities for local authorities recommended that local cultural strategies should be subsumed within community strategies. Where this happens, the profile of sport will be raised in forming part of the strategic vision for the area. In addition, the role of all cultural and leisure services within community strategies will be included in the forthcoming evaluation which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will commission early in 2003.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to his answer of 10 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 267W, if he will require the Rough Sleepers Unit to record rough sleepers who are also asylum seekers separately from other rough sleepers for the purposes of the street count.  [87932]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21218w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Information from counts undertaken by local authorities does not identify rough sleepers who are asylum seekers. As rough sleepers are not woken, it is not possible to obtain information on their personal status. However outreach teams are encouraged to get as much information about people sleeping rough in their areas as possible so that individual solutions can be found to their rough sleeping where it is possible.

 Service provision in rural areas is a matter for the delivery bodies in the first instance. For local authorities, the recent provisional local government finance settlement gave every authority a grant increase of at least 3.0 per cent., with education authorities receiving at least 3.5 per cent., Rural shire districts did particularly well, their grant increasing by an average of 7.6 per cent.

 Our policies for improving services for people with learning disabilities, their families and carers are set out in the White Paper XValuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century" (Cm 5086), published in March 2001.
<P>

<a name="21218w21.html_para5">Some #3 billion a year is already spent on health and social care provision for people with learning disabilities. The proposals in XValuing People" will help to ensure that this money is spent effectively and efficiently. People with learning disabilities will also benefit from the general growth in total health and social services spending and from specific initiatives.
<P>

<a name="21218w21.html_para6">The White Paper announced the creation of two new funds, the implementation support fund and the learning disability development fund. The support fund, #2.3 million a year for three years from April 2001, is being used to support a range of initiatives connected with the White Paper's programme of action. These include developing and expanding advocacy services across the country.
<P>

<a name="21218w21.html_para7">The development fund has both revenue (#22.6 million) and capital (#20 million) elements. #2 million of the revenue element is being used to fund the XValuing People" support team and its related activities, with the remainder being distributed to health authorities. It was distributed to the then health authorities (HAs) in March 2002 to support priorities for service change as outlined in joint investment plans they drew up with their partner local authorities. The distribution was based on the NHS general allocation formula except that five authorities received additional money to help them meet the needs of their old long stay population. Where a health authority related to more than one local authority, the allocation was to be divided according to the size of their respective resident populations unless all the parties agreed to an alternative distribution.
<P>

<a name="21218w21.html_para8">The distribution by HA has been placed in the Library.

<a name="21218w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The majority of epilepsy services are provided in a primary or secondary care setting and are not specialised services. The organisations listed in the question are regional specialised commissioning groups whose function is to commission specialised services, generally located in tertiary hospitals; non-specialised services such as epilepsy services are not within their remit. Surgery is appropriate for less than 5 per cent. of epilepsy patients. It is provided in neurosciences centres and is subject to the same access targets as other forms of elective surgery.
<P>

<a name="21218w22.html_para5">We expect to publish an action plan for epilepsy services following the recommendation in the chief medical officer's 2001 annual report that we should improve the standard of services for people with epilepsy. The action plan will also address the findings of the national clinical audit of epilepsy-related death, which was published in May 2002.
<P>

<a name="21218w22.html_para6">In addition to the epilepsy action plan, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence will publish an appraisal of anti-epilepsy drugs next year, followed by a guideline on the diagnosis, management and treatment of epilepsy in 2004. We are also developing the national service framework (NSF) for long-term conditions, which will focus on improving services for neurological conditions, including epilepsy. We expect to publish the NSF in 2004.

<a name="21218w23.html_para0">In 1998, the Social Exclusion Unit's report into rough sleeping stated that 20 per cent. of rough sleepers were misusing drugs. In July 2002, research by the charity Crisis found that 83 per cent. of single homeless people were drug users. Figures for people misusing alcohol were at around 30 to 50 per cent. in the SEU report, and recent anecdotal evidence suggests that this figure is still around the same.
<P>

<a name="21218w23.html_para1">On 4 December 2002, the Home Office's Drug Strategy Directorate and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Homelessness Directorate published new guidance entitled XDrug Services for Homeless People: a Good Practice Handbook", which is aimed at addressing these figures through mainstream and specialised drug services.

<a name="21218w23.html_para2">The Homelessness Directorate's report, XMore than a Roof", set out a new approach to tackling homelessness, focused on the problems that homeless people face in the places where they live.

<a name="21218w23.html_para3">In the Cross-Cutting Review on health inequalities, which the Government published on 20 November 2002, inequalities faced by vulnerable groups, including homeless people, were identified as a top-line priority. As part of Government's response to this through measures to improve access to health services for vulnerable groups and others, the Government have put in place more than 1,300 Personal Medical Service Pilots and 42 NHS Walk-in Centres. Local authorities are expected to work with a range of organisations to deliver their homelessness strategies, including primary care trusts on appropriate health services.
<P>

<a name="21218w23.html_para4">In addition, all local housing authorities are now required, under the Homelessness Act 2002, to conduct a review of homelessness in their district and to adopt a strategy, by July 2003, which must include plans for ensuring that accommodation and support are available for homeless people. As made clear in the statutory Homelessness Code of Guidance for local authorities, published jointly by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department of Health, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects local housing authorities to work with a range of organisations to deliver the aims of the homelessness strategy and ensure that all the support needs of homeless people are taken into account. This includes working with primary care trusts (PCTs), to deliver appropriate health services to this client group.

 Government do not specify the content of the general practitioner training curriculum. This is the job of the joint committee on postgraduate training for general practice (JCPTGP), which is the competent authority for general practice training in the United Kingdom. The JCPTGP is an independent professional body, and it is required by section 9(3) of the Vocational Training Regulations 1997 to determine and publish the curriculum to be followed by a GP registrar, a trainee GP.
<P>

<a name="21218w23.html_para5">The Regulations do specify seven competencies which must be tested, and which the curriculum must therefore teach:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>factual medical knowledge sufficient to enable the doctor to perform the duties of a GP;
<P>
<BR>
the ability to apply factual medical knowledge to the management of problems presented by patients in general practice;

effective communication, both orally and in writing;

the ability to consult satisfactorily with general practice patients;

the ability to review and critically analyse the practitioner's own working practices and to manage any necessary changes appropriately;

clinical skills; and

the ability to synthesise all the above competencies and apply them appropriately in a general practice setting.
