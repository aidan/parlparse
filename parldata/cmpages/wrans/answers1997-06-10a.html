To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list the average class size in each primary and secondary school, grant-maintained and local authority controlled, in the Spelthorne constituency on 31 March or the latest available date before that. [2566] <P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="70610w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Provisional figures on class sizes in maintained primary and secondary schools as at January 1997 are expected to be published in a Statistical Press Notice at the end of this month.

<P>
<a name="70610w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Colvin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will publish the evidence he has received which suggests that small class sizes deliver better educational standards; and if he will make a statement. [2698]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70610w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The electorate have already signalled their support for our policy to bring the educational benefits of smaller classes to all infant pupils, rather than just the few whose parents have paid for smaller classes in the independent sector. Common sense and research evidence here and notably in the United States indicate that class size is a key factor in the early years of education when pupils master the basics. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector has said in the Ofsted report on class size (1995)

<P>

"small class sizes are of benefit in the early years of primary education."

<P>
<P>
</UL></FONT><a name="70610w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Colvin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if the undertaking given by the Minister for School Standards on 22 May, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>824</i>, that the new Education (Schools) Bill will lead to a reduction in class size for every five, six and seven-year-old in the country applies irrespective of the current size of class of which a child is a member. [2704]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70610w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Our pledge is to reduce class sizes for all five, six and seven-year-olds to 30 or below by the end of this Parliament.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many extra staff will be needed in jobcentres to conduct the interviews with single parents announced by the Prime Minister on 2 June; what the gross costs of the exercise will be; and how many single parents are expected to find jobs as a result of it. [2673]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70610w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 Employment Service help is already available to those lone parents who choose to use it. We will consider what additional support should in time be made available to improve the help to lone parents seeking jobs.

<BR>
The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning the reduction in hours of Jobclubs, with particular reference to Frome Jobclub. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.
<BR>
It may help if I explain that we have needed to reduce our overall provision of Jobclubs as a result of the fall in unemployment over the past year and a consequent reduction in funding. In the South West we reduced our Jobclub network at the end of the 1996/97 operational year by 14 from 121 to 107, and a further 4 reduced their hours of operation.
<BR>
A number of factors led to the decision to reduce the hours at Frome Jobclub. During the 1996/7 operational year, because of falling unemployment registers, it became clear that there were no longer sufficient numbers of unemployed people to support a Jobclub presence in Frome for four mornings a week. Between April 1996 and April 1997 registered unemployment at Frome Jobcentre fell by 30% from 1,081 to 757 with a consequential impact on our ability to fill all the places at the Jobclub.
<BR>
I hope this helps to explain the background to our decision. While we have no plans at present to restore Frome JobClub's previous hours of operation, we will review the position very carefully if circumstances were to change.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

 Accurate data on Traveller children are difficult to collect. Through the work of the Traveller Education Services funded under section 488 of the Education Act 1996, significant progress has been made in improving school registration of traveller children. At primary level, in particular, about 80 per cent. of the total number are now registered at school, although an estimated 3-4,000 children are not. The picture at

 As of January 1996, local education authorities in England were arranging education otherwise than at school for 19,133 children of compulsory school age. Included in this total were 1,011 non-statemented children in hospital and 11,055 children attending Pupil Referral Units. Data for January 1997 are not yet available. The Department does not collect information on the number of children whose parents arrange education outside of the school system, as is permitted in law: but it has been estimated that some 10,000 children are educated in this manner.

 Within the United Kingdom, former chemical warfare (CW) sites were decontaminated in accordance with the guidance prevalent at the time my Department vacated the site. Those sites which continue to form part of the Defence Estate are being assessed as part of the Department's Land Quality Assessment programme. This programme is designed to establish the condition of individual sites on the Defence Estate and, where appropriate, make recommendations for remediation. Given the extent of the Defence Estate I am not able to estimate when this work will be completed. As to the costs involved, no central records are maintained. Indeed, as remediation work on former CW sites has been spread over some 50 years it is not possible to quantify the costs involved.

 Fifty-six airmen's quarters at RAF Wroughton have been leased for a period of three years to three housing associations, pending their re-use by the armed forces. I am withholding information on the level of rent being paid for reasons of commercial confidentiality under exemption 7 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. No other facilities have been leased out since the site closed. The former Princess Alexander Hospital is in disposal, and guidelines for its future use are therefore a matter for the local planning authority.

These rounds, which were on issue from early 1994, were withdrawn from all operational use in April this year. Replacement stocks, which do not exceed the specified velocity, have been issued.
<P>

<a name="70610w03.html_para1">Plastic baton rounds and the procedures governing their use will be kept under continuous review. In addition, procedures are being put in place to ensure that stocks in operational use are tested regularly to ensure that they continue to conform to specification. A programme has been put in hand to take advantage of emerging technologies, with the aim of developing improved baton round equipment to meet operational needs but with reduced injury potential. We will continue to look at other effective means for controlling public disorder and riot situations.

 The Government is fully committed to the strong verification regime of monitoring and on-site inspection which is so essential to the successful implementation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The Budget of the Preparatory Commission of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation is determined annually. That for 1997 was finalised last March and amounted to some $US28, of which the United Kingdom contribution, based upon the United Nations scale of charges, is 6 per cent. So far the United kingdom has paid some $US213,00, and the balance will be paid later this year.

 We will give priority to those countries which are eligible for concessional Paris Club relief.

 <i>[holding answer 9 June 1997]:</i> The Scottish Office has no plans to extend to objectors the existing rights of applicants to appeal against the refusal of planning permission. Objectors already have a voice and can make representations to the planning authority before a planning application is decided. In particular, they have the opportunity to submit views to their community councils (which are now statutory consultees for all planning applications) and the Council. Councils are required to take these views fully into account when deciding applications.

 Special advisers are vetted as appropriate to the sensitivity of material they see.

He has previously been positively vetted and his vetting is now being renewed. Some other special advisers in No. 10 are, as a matter of routine, being positively vetted though it is unlikely that they will have access to sensitive intelligence material.

This followed a long period of consideration of possible police use of incapacitant sprays. Expert assessment of all available scientific data concluded that not enough was know about the health effects of pepper spray but that CS, which had been tested to a level similar to that required for a new pharmaceutical drug, did not present any significant threat to health. Trials took place in 16 forces between 1 March and 31 August 1996. Officers felt that the new equipment had brought about a marked reduction in assaults, although assaults data gave a mixed picture on this. The trials confirmed the safety of CS. Seventeen forces, including the Metropolitan Police, currently have CS sprays. Guidance on the use of CS is an operational matter for chief officers. The Association of Chief Police Officers have produced guidelines, copies of which have been in the Library since April 1996.

<P>

<a name="70610w07.html_para2">Special advisers are paid within a range of &#163;24,349 to &#163;73,484. Their salaries are negotiated individually, and are confidential within this range. As under the previous Government, details of current and previous salary are not provided in order to protect the privacy of the individuals concerned.
<P>

<a name="70610w07.html_para3">The only exceptions who are paid outside this range are the two special advisers who have been given additional executive responsibilities under the amended Order in Council, my Chief of Staff Jonathan Powell and my Press Secretary Alastair Campbell. The Remuneration Committee established to advise me on special adviser salaries has decided that they should be paid &#163;87,936. This figure is based on 80 per cent. of payband 7 of the Senior Civil Service range, together with an allowance of &#163;5,000. My current Principal Private Secretary is also in payband 7 and receives an allowance of just over &#163;5,000.

<a name="70610w07.html_para4">Under the previous Government, the highest paid special adviser was the Head of the Number 10 Policy Unit, who was paid at the lower end of the Permanent Secretary range, which from 1 April 1997 is &#163;91,800 to &#163;157,590.

<a name="70610w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government is committed to improving the energy efficiency of the housing stock revealed by the 1991 English House Condition Survey. Despite existing provisions to promote energy efficiency and to improve the stock--through the Home Energy Conservation Act, the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme, the work of the Energy Saving Trust and the Department's best practice programme and through private sector renovation grants and the housing renewal programmes of local authorities and housing associations, there is still a substantial backlog of housing in poor condition and with unsatisfactory energy efficiency characteristics. The Government is reviewing policies to achieve more effective action to remedy sub-standard and energy inefficient housing. New Supplementary Credit Approvals issued as a result of the Capital Receipts' initiative will allow local authorities to proceed more quickly with action to tackle these problems to the extent that they fit with local priorities.

At present we have no immediate plans to meet the National Institute of Medicinal Herbalists, but have consulted relevant UK organisations, including representatives of the herbal medicine sector.

 The Institute of Trading Standards Administration (ITSA) has calculated that each year profits of around &#163;100 million are made through the clocking of vehicles. This is calculated on the basis that the value of a care increases by an average of &#163;30 for every 1,000 miles taken off the clock.

 Delegated driving test examiners have been authorised for the Ministry of Defence (MOD), 26 Police Forces and 53 Fire Brigades, the Royal Mail, Birmingham City Council and 50 bus company groups.
<P>

<a name="70610w13.html_para0">Delegated examiners are normally trained by the Driving Standards Agency, the part of the Department responsible for conducting driving tests generally. The Agency aims to carry out standards supervision visits to the bus companies on a quarterly basis, and has close technical co-operation with the Ministry of Defence on test standards matters. The Agency is currently initiating discussions with the relevant police and fire authorities about test standards issues.

 There are 32 outstanding letters of objection to the draft order to de-trunk the A40 through Cheltenham and to trunk the A436 from the A40 at Shipton Solers to the A417 at Air Ballon roundabout. All object to the trunking of the A436. The objections mainly concern: the unsuitability of the A436 to take extra traffic; the need for improvements to be carried out to the A436; the effects of more traffic using the unimproved A417 at Crickley Hill and congestion at Air Balloon roundabout.

<a name="70610w14.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Government propose to undertake a new and strong drive to develop renewable energy sources in line with our manifesto commitment. To this end I anticipate reviewing policy including considerations of what would be necessary and practicable to achieve 10 per cent. of UK's electricity needs from renewables by the year 2010 and how renewables can make an effective contribution to meeting requirements for future greenhouse gas reduction commitments. I will make a further announcement in due course. In the meantime the Government's new and renewable energy programme, currently underway will continue. I have already announced that I will initiative shortly a consultation exercise with the relevant trade bodies of the renewable energy industry, OFFER, and the Regional Electricity Companies on a fifth Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) Order for renewable energy in England and Wales, leading to an announcement later in the year.
<P>

<a name="70610w14.html_para6">The reduction in the rate of the Fossil Fuel Levy from 3.7 per cent. to 2.2 per cent. with effect from 1 April 1997 was due to reduced payments to the nuclear industry. The reduction had no effect on the level of support for renewable energy projects.
<P>

<a name="70610w14.html_para7">Over the coming months the Government will be considering the balance of activities within the spending plans it inherited to ensure that they reflect the Government's priorities. The results of my reviews of NFFO 5 and renewable energy policy will be fed into this wider exercise. The Department's expenditure plans for the Government's renewable energy; nuclear; clean coal; oil and gas; and environment programmes for the three year's 1997-98 to 1999-2000 may be found on page 37 of "Trade and Industry: The Government's Expenditure Plans 1997-98 to 1999-2000". A copy of the Plans is available in the Library of the House. Historical expenditure information on the Government's wind, solar and wave programmes is also available from my Department.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what submissions her Department has made to the European Commission concerning the review of funds available under objective 2 of European regional aid. [2167]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70610w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Government and local partners have been negotiating since August 1996 with the Commission on the programmes for grant in 12 European structural funds objective 2 areas in Britain for the period 1997-99. The Commission has now adopted the majority of these programmes and is likely to complete the remainder shortly.
<P>

<a name="70610w15.html_para0">For the period from 2000 onwards, the money available under objective 2 and the other objectives depends on Commission proposals for future financing of the EU and for reform of the structural funds. It is likely to put proposals forward after the completion of the Inter-Governmental conference. The Government have not put forward detailed submissions at this early stage, but we are looking for a package which is affordable, simpler and more efficient, and fair.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70610w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 No. Article 2.1 of the Cohesion Fund Regulation restricts eligibility to member states with a per capita gross national product (GNP), measured in purchasing power parities (PPP), of less than 90 per cent. of the Community average and which have a programme leading to the fulfilment of the conditions of economic convergence referred to in Article 104c of the EC Treaty. The United Kingdom does not qualify: its per capita GNP (PPP) has been and is above this level.

 An assessment of environmental impact and a shoreline sensitivity study were carried out by BP in relation to its applications for consent to develop the Foinaven and Schiehallion discoveries. In addition, the largest offshore environmental study ever undertaken in UK waters was carried out to the west of Shetland on behalf of a group of oil companies by the Southhampton Oceanography Centre. An area the size of Wales was surveyed and much valuable information was acquired. The results of this work provide baseline environmental data as part of the work companies must do to satisfy Government environmental requirements.

 The tables set out the reductions in CO2 emissions from various clean coal power generation technologies currently available or under development compared with a reference conventional pulverised coal plant. The information was provided by IEA Coal Research--The Clean Coal Centre and will appear in a report to be published later this year by the Centre. The table indicates some 20-30 per cent. reduction may be possible if clean coal plant replaces existing conventional coal plant. however all coal fired generation releases significantly more CO2 per unit of electricity than combined cycle gas turbine stations and there would be an increase in emissions if clean coal plant replaced such plant. There would also be an increase in emissions of CO2 if clean coal plant replaced oil fired plant, nuclear or renewables sources of energy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70610w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I have noted with concern a report by the World Bank indicating that subsidies for coal in the OECD area are associated with 1.5 per cent. of the total CO2 emissions. German subsidies account for the bulk of 



<P>
<P><I>10 Jun 1997 : Column: 420</I><P>
this. I mean to press for the elimination of all coal subsidies throughout the European coal and steel community by the time the ECSC is wound up in 2002, and I will support the Commission vigorously in ensuring progressive reduction in state aid paid to the European coal industry over this period.
<P>

<a name="70610w15.html_para1">It is not our policy to subsidise UK coal producers, nor to tolerate subsidised imports into the UK, whether from Germany or elsewhere. UK coal is by far the lowest cost coal produced within the ECSC, and is generally accepted as the only ECSC production with a long-term prospect of viability. I am therefore concerned that UK coal exports should not be disadvantaged over the period to 2002 by subsidies given to other ECSC producers; and we will press the Commission to deny approval to such state aids, unless arrangements have first been put in place for removing any consequential market distortions against UK coal available for sale within the ECSC.

 The Department has allocated a total of &#163;199.6 million for HIV/AIDS treatment and care in 1997-98. This represents a seven per cent. increase over the allocation for 1996-97 as a contribution towards new combination therapies and the Department is keeping in close touch with health authorities, clinicians and others on developments in this area and the costs and benefits associated with them.
<P>

<a name="70610w16.html_para5">The treatment and care budget, which is allocated to health authorities in line with the number of AIDS cases, is intended to cover services for people with HIV and AIDS as determined through local needs assessment and priorities.

<a name="70610w17.html_para8">The third criteria will be how well and far negotiations have progressed.

 There have been several studies which have addressed certain aspects of the costs of BSE, but I am not aware of any estimates of the total cost to the meat industry.

 The year 2001 is not a target date for BSE eradication, but an estimate of the time when the BSE epidemic will have reached insignificant levels based on research carried out by Professor Anderson of Oxford University and his team, in collaboration with Wilesmith and others at VLA and published in Nature, volume 382. The purpose of the selective cull is to accelerate the rate of decline in the epidemic by removing animals which are likely to become BSE cases and to comply with the pre-conditions of the Florence Agreement made in June 1996.

The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your Question about a Public Inquiry and the commissioning of an environmental impact statement in relation to a planning application for an abbatoir at Saintfield Livestock Mart.
<BR>
This planning application, which was received in April 1997, has been the subject of a large number of objections. The Department determined that the proposal fell within the scope of Category 7(f) of Schedule 2 of the Environmental Effects Regulations (NI) 1989 and the applicant was requested to submit an Environmental Statement on 2 May 1997. The applicant had until 30 May 1997 to confirm acceptance or appeal against this determination. There has been no appeal lodged and the applicant must now either submit the Environmental Statement or withdraw the application.
<BR>
If an Environmental Statement is submitted it will be publicly advertised and all interested parties will have an opportunity to make representations. A decision on the way forward, including the need for a Public Inquiry, can only be taken once the Environmental Statement has been received and the consultative responses have been fully considered. It is unlikely that any decision on the need for a Public Inquiry will be taken until Autumn 1997, at the earliest.

I do hope you find this helpful and I will, of course, let you know once a decision on the way forward has been taken.

Kennedy II.

 Demand for occupational therapy assessments is rising as increasing numbers of dependent people opt to live in their own homes. The Department of Health and Social Services has been working closely with the Health and Social Services Boards and Trusts and, in the case of housing adaptation assessments with the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, to streamline procedures. Service level agreements are being put in place and a list of minor adaptations not requiring occupational therapy input has been agreed. I have asked the Boards to identify, as a matter of urgency, what further steps they can take to reduce waiting lists.
