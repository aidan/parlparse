 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assistance he is providing for the regeneration of Russia.  [39573]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We provide regenerational support to Russia worth &#163;40 million this year in three ways: as a leading shareholder in the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; as a major contributor to the EU's Technical Assistance programme; and through a substantial bilateral development programme.

 We regularly discuss the progress of the international campaign against terrorism with our partners within the EU.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what discussions he has had with the United States Administration about recent developments in the international campaign against terrorism.  [39587]<P>

<a name="20312w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We regularly and frequently discuss the campaign against terrorism with the United States Administration. For example, the Foreign Secretary met Colin Powell on 31 January and discussed this dossier.

13. <a name="20312w01.html_wqn3"><B> Geraint Davies: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the situation of <i>(a)</i> Mr. Feroz Abbasi from Croydon and <i>(b)</i> other UK citizens being held at Guantanamo Bay.  [39576]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 A team of British officials paid a second visit to Guantanamo Bay between 26 February and 1 March. All five British detainees, including Feroz Abbasi appeared to be in reasonable health. Mr. Abbasi's solicitors have made an application for judicial review in relation to his detention and access to legal representation. As this is currently before the UK courts, It would not be right for us to comment on this further.

<P>
<a name="20312w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if the detaining power at Camp X Ray has indicated to him <i>(a)</i> the status of British nationals held there and <i>(b)</i> whether they will face the

<P><I>12 Mar 2002 : Column 860W</I><P>
tribunals the detaining power has proposed; and what representations he has made to the detaining power over this issue.  [40617]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The status of the British detainees and the legal procedure to which they might be subject is complex. The British Government have asked the US authorities to clarify these matters and will continue to do so. In response to our approaches, the US Government have given us the assurance that they would treat the detainees humanely and consistently with the principles of the Geneva convention.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs whether UK intelligence and security officials have had access to <i>(a)</i> British nationals detained at Camp X Ray and <i>(b)</i> evidence gathered from them by the detaining power.  [40569]<P>

 The Secretary of State has no plans to visit St. Helena during its quincentennial year.
<P>

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary had the first meeting between the new peace coalition and a visiting Foreign Minister when he was in Jerusalem on 14 February. I met peace camps when I was in the region in February. We support efforts to bring people on both sides together in the search for peace.

<a name="20312w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary remains in close contact with his Indian and Pakistani counterparts and discusses a range of issues, including Kashmir, with them. He most recently met the Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh during his visit to Delhi on 27 February. He met the Pakistani Foreign Minister, Abdul Sattar, in Istanbul during the OIC (Organisation of Islamic Conference) Conference on 12 February and during his visit to Islamabad on

 We remain deeply concerned at the continuing tensions between India and Pakistan. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary remains in close contact with his Indian and Pakistani counterparts and discusses a full range of issues, including Kashmir. We will continue to urge both countries to resolve all outstanding issues, including Kashmir through dialogue. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made this clear during his visit to the region in January.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The UK strongly support the Colombian peace process, as I made clear in a press release on 23 January. We are particularly active in the EU. We have invited the Colombian presidential candidates to the UK to exchange views on the situation in Colombia, including prospects for the peace process.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Martyn Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1) if he will use the forthcoming session of the UN Commission on Human Rights to promote human rights in Colombia, with special reference to <i>(a)</i> the safety of human rights defenders and <i>(b)</i> groups at particular risk;  [41619]
<P>

 We are currently discussing preparations for the forthcoming session of the UN Commission on Human Rights with EU partners.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 When he visited Japan from 25&#150;29 January, my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs held a number of meetings on the World Cup. He assured the Japanese Government that we will continue to co-operate closely with them to ensure that preparations are in place for a successful tournament. Our posts in Japan have been in close contact with the Japanese world cup organising committee, stadium authorities, police and security authorities, to provide advice and assistance. They have also facilitated contacts between the Home Office, police and other relevant agencies and their Japanese counterparts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 We regularly raise our serious concerns on child rights issues with all the Governments of Central America, where our Missions monitor the situation closely. We work closely with Casa Alianza, a non-governmental organisation, and support its efforts to protect street children in Central America.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the situation in Nepal since the recent rebel attack in the Accham district; and if he will make a statement.  [39592]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We were appalled by the barbaric attacks on the Nepalese Army and Police by the Maoists in Achham on 16 February. I discussed the attacks with the King of Nepal, the Nepalese Prime Minister and the Nepalese Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs when I visited Kathmandu on 19&#150;20 February. The situation in Nepal is extremely serious, and the UK is supportive of the efforts of the democratically elected Government of Nepal to bring security to its people. Without security, the Nepalese people will not be able to achieve the development and prosperity that they need and deserve.

<P>
31. <a name="20312w02.html_wqn6"><B> Joan Ruddock: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what progress has been made on the implementation of the Bonn agreement with respect to women's human rights.  [39596]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Since the signing of the Bonn Agreement on 5 December, progress has been made in restoring rights to women in Afghanistan. We have encouraged the involvement of women in the Afghan Interim Administration and the Special Commission for the Convening of the Loya Jirga, established under the Bonn Agreement. We welcome the appointment of two women to the Cabinet of the Interim Administration, including Dr. Sima Samar as Vice Chair and Minister for Women, and three women to the Loya Jirga Commission.
<P>

<a name="20312w02.html_para0">Women have begun to return to work and girls are going back to school. We welcome the commitment made at the Tokyo Donor's Conference by Hamid Karzai, Chair of the Interim Administration, to ensure that the needs of women are a high priority in the reconstruction process. Life for women in Afghanistan has always been difficult. Afghanistan has more than a million war widows. NGO and UN run projects to get women back to work will have a huge impact on the lives of many Afghan women and children.
<P>

<a name="20312w02.html_para1">But more needs to be done. We have long said that we would expect any Afghan Government to recognise international human rights norms, including women's rights. We believe that adherence to international human rights norms, including the UN Charter and CEDAW (the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which the then Afghanistan government signed on 14 August 1980, but did not ratify) are key to restoring the rights of women.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B>

 Recent moves by the Iraqi regime include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Demarching the EU to establish high-level EU-Iraq relations. We have made clear that this would not be appropriate while Iraq remains in breach of its international obligations.
<P>
<BR>
Resuming dialogue with the UN. While we commend the UN Secretary-General's efforts to persuade Iraq to comply with relevant Security Council resolutions, including by allowing in the UN weapons inspectors, we note that the Iraqi regime has so far made no concrete commitment to do so.
<P>
<BR>
Announcing, via the Iraqi media, that a British team is welcome to visit Iraq to prove that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. Although we have received no such offer, we have made clear that we regard this as a propaganda stunt. Iraq is obliged to grant full, unconditional access to UN weapons inspectors.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20312w02.html_para2">We regard these moves as diplomatic ploys because we have yet to see any sign that the Iraqi regime is genuinely intending to co-operate with the UN. It will take actions, not words, to persuade us otherwise.

 In the last two months I have visited India once and met twice with India's External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh. We have discussed a number of areas of partnership including terrorism, peacekeeping, defence relations, and Afghanistan and other regional issues. The two Prime Ministers' Personal Envoys, David Manning and Brajesh Mishra, also met on 4 February.

 The India-UK Round Table has produced wide-ranging and constructive recommendations which complement the British and Indian Governments' efforts to develop a strong partnership. HMG, with the British Council, have taken many of the Round Table's recommendations into account, including those aimed at attracting more Indian students to the UK, and developing closer links between Indian and UK universities and research institutions in areas such as information technology. The Round Table meets again in April 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The international fight against the illicit drugs trade requires political commitment, and practical co-operation. We work bilaterally and multilaterally through the EU and the UN International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) in our efforts to combat the illegal drugs trade.
<P>

<a name="20312w03.html_para0">The FCO's Drugs and Crime Fund (&#163;7.3 million in 2001&#150;02, rising to &#163;10 million in 2002&#150;03), supports a broad range of project work overseas, including counter- drugs work and capacity-building for law enforcement in all of the key countries concerned in the supply of heroin and cocaine to the UK and Europe. FCO-funded training for overseas law enforcement agencies and UK operational co-operation with them has led to some notable drug seizures, removing some of the heroin and cocaine consignments destined for the UK and Europe.

<P>

<a name="20312w05.html_para23">In response to earlier parliamentary questions from the hon. Member, the Crown Prosecution Service reviewed its suppliers' use of fair trade products. This review found that, although the supplier was willing to switch to fair trade products as ingredients in foods, this would mean that the overall cost of meals provided would no longer be competitive with other providers in the area. Therefore it was decided that Fair Trade confectionery items would be sold (on a promotional basis), within the canteen facility.
<P>

<a name="20312w05.html_para24">The Crown Prosecution Service's involvement with fair trade is in relation only to its catering supplier, which manages the canteen in Crown Prosecution Service headquarters at Ludgate Hill. There are no other canteen facilities elsewhere in the Crown Prosecution Service. Therefore, the overall value of the contract is very small.

<P>

<a name="20312w06.html_para11">Publication of the "Departmental Report" is mandatory. It is one of the key mechanisms through which Departments demonstrate their accountability to Parliament and the public. The CPS distributes copies to senior management within headquarters, libraries, business managers and to the Chief Crown Prosecutors in the 42 areas across England and Wales. Copies are also sent to the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General and to the Parliamentary Clerk for laying in both Houses, for the benefit of Members.
<P>

<a name="20312w06.html_para12">The purpose of the "Business Plan" is to set out clearly the vision, aim and objectives, and priorities of the CPS, what it wants to achieve with the resources it has been given and the actions it needs to take in order to deliver the plan. They are the blueprint for all other plans in the CPS so that staff know how their day to day tasks fit in with the bigger picture. And, to inform counterparts in other criminal justice departments and their agencies and service, and those with an interest in criminal justice about the direction and priorities of the CPS.
<P>

<a name="20312w06.html_para13">The Crown Prosecution Service's one year "Business Plan"; and the "Director of Public Prosecutions' Annual Report to the Attorney-General" are circulated to all middle and senior managers in the CPS with a summary going to all staff; they are circulated to criminal justice departments and their agencies/services both nationally and locally; to some members of the judiciary; and to those with an interest in criminal justice.

<P>
<a name="20312w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that the Quality Mark is going to be rolled out across the country over a three to four year period. The progressive rollout will begin with urban areas in England and Wales and districts that have already demonstrated interest in the scheme.
<P>

<a name="20312w08.html_para4">The Quality Mark was established to combat the problem of cowboy builders by creating a list of approved tradesmen. Homeowners can call the Quality Mark hotline on 0845 300 8040 or log on to www.qualitymark.org.uk to find an independently assessed tradesman in one of 18 trades to work in their home. The scheme was piloted for six months in Birmingham and Somerset. 150 tradesmen have achieved the Quality Mark and 25,000 consumers have phoned or logged on to access the list of approved tradesmen.
<P>

<a name="20312w08.html_para5">The pilot has been evaluated by a review group including industry, consumer and regulatory interests. The group published their report on 28 February and found that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Quality Mark meets the broad aims of the Cowboy Builders Working Group report which originally recommended the scheme;
<P>
<BR>
the mechanisms, standards and independent audits work and are set at the right levels; and
<P>
<BR>
the partnership with industry and stakeholders works well.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20312w08.html_para6">The review recommended that a shadow ownership group, featuring the main partners, and working with DTI, should be established quickly to drive forward the implementation of Quality Mark. Membership and terms of reference of the group will be outlined shortly. There will also be a launch event in the coming weeks.
<P>

<a name="20312w08.html_para7">Finally I would like to make it clear that reputable tradesmen all over the country can join the Quality Mark scheme immediately through the hotline or website. This is the only scheme that gives reputable tradesmen the opportunity to demonstrate their professionalism and separate themselves from the cowboys. I encourage tradesmen and local authorities to get behind the Quality Mark so that people around the country can benefit from the scheme as homeowners in Birmingham and Somerset have.

A range of leaflets focusing on specific types of business is also available from the DRC. Advice and information on all aspects of the DDA is available via the DRC helpline.

 <i>[holding answer 4 March 2002]:</i> The Government are aware of the importance of the contribution that the engineering and technology community makes to the UK economy and that it has the potential to make a greater contribution in the future. That is why we supported the work led by Dr. Robert Hawley, the last Chairman of the Engineering Council, that has led to the establishment of the Engineering and Technology Board (ETB) chaired by Sir Peter Williams. We are also supporting the ETB in the work it has embarked on to make itself more relevant to the concerns of all in the wider engineering and technology community.
<P>

<a name="20312w09.html_para0">It is also why, in the last Budget, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced that they had commissioned Sir Gareth Roberts, President of Wolfson College Oxford, to undertake an independent study into the provision of skilled scientists and engineers in the UK. Sir Gareth's report is expected shortly.
<P>

<a name="20312w09.html_para1">Many of the matters raised in the Engineering Council's Digest of Engineering Statistics will be considered by the Government in the context of Sir Gareth's Report and I anticipate that they will inform the future work of the ETB.

 The Enterprise Grant Scheme (EGS) has been operational since 1 January 2000. It is available to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) with fewer than 250 employees to support capital investment projects of up to &#163;0.5 million.
<P>

<a name="20312w09.html_para2">The whole of South Yorkshire is covered by the EGS where grant can be awarded of up to 15 per cent. of eligible capital expenditure up to a maximum of &#163;75,000. Since 1 January 2000, 116 EGS applications have been received from South Yorkshire companies resulting in 86 formal offers of grant with a grant value of &#163;2.1 million against estimated capital costs of &#163;18 million. These projects are expected to create or safeguard 530 jobs. Separate statistics are not available for the former South Yorkshire coalfield areas but approximately half of the offers relate to businesses in these areas. Details of the individual grant offers made to companies are commercially confidential.

The specification of a water source heat pump installation at 20 Victoria Street made the best use of the existing risers and plant space.

 The Department undertook a review of its pay systems in 2001 and implemented a range of measures to deal with the historical anomalies of the system which affected both sexes. The major change was the introduction of guaranteed progression for satisfactory performers to the top of the pay range. We now propose to undertake a formal Equal Pay Audit during the next 12 months to identify any other action required to address unjustified gender pay gaps. We have already embarked upon a diversity audit to ensure that all our systems, including those which ultimately link to our pay system such as postings and promotion arrangements, are free of gender and other bias.

 Our policy is to offer support for the additional costs staff necessarily incur in relocating.

Relocation assistance normally includes the costs associated with preparing for relocation, securing accommodation, and a range of travel, freight, storage and other necessary expenses.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what proportion of fuel-poor households in the social rented sector occupy dwellings which comply with the proposed thermal comfort criteria as set out in his Department's consultation paper on the Decency Standard.  [39891]<P>

<P>

 Social landlords are working towards the target to ensure that all social housing is brought up to a decent standard by 2010, which includes a requirement for the dwelling to provide a reasonable degree of thermal comfort. But investment will not be focused solely on bringing non decent homes up to the minimum decent home standard. Where landlords carry out work to heating and insulation, the published guidance will encourage them to maximise the energy efficiency of the dwelling.
<P>

<a name="20312w13.html_para0">The 2001 baseline for the decent home target will come from the 2001 English House Condition Survey, which will be available later this year. This will also provide data on the level of fuel poverty in the social rented sector.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement on the <i>(a)</i> voluntary agreements and <i>(b)</i> legislation in place regarding passenger rights relating to (i) delays, (ii) cancellations and (iii) overbooking for (A) air passengers, (B) rail passengers, (C) ferry passengers and (D) coach passengers; what changes have taken place since 1997; and what further changes are planned.  [40956]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w13.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In respect of air passengers, European Voluntary Commitments on air passenger rights came into effect on 14 February 2002. The commitments include notifying passengers of known delays, cancellations and diversions, assisting passengers facing delays and reducing the number of passengers involuntarily denied boarding. 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 2002 : Column 906W</I><P>
All major full service UK airlines and most airports have signed up to the Commitments. European Council Regulation 295&#150;91 provides a certain level of protection for passengers denied boarding due to overbooking, establishing common rules for a compensation system in scheduled air transport.
<P>

<a name="20312w13.html_para1">The European Commission has recently published a proposal to update the Regulation and to extend it to cover cancellation and delay. In addition, the 1929 Warsaw Convention on air carrier liability, which has been ratified by the UK, provides rights to passengers suffering damage caused by delay. Air passengers travelling as part of an inclusive tour are also covered by a European Council Directive on Package Travel (Directive 90&#150;314) which was implemented in the UK by SI 1992&#150;3288. This Directive provides certain rights relating to delays and cancellation.
<P>

<a name="20312w13.html_para2">The rights of rail passengers to compensation for delays and cancellations are covered through the National Rail Conditions of Carriage (NRCoC), which set the minimum standards, and through individual train operator charters which often provide more generous entitlements. Since 1997 the standard of compensation provided by many train operators has improved through franchise agreements. For the future, the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) is working with the Rail Passenger Council (RPC) and the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) to review Passenger Charter compensation arrangements. They are looking to develop recommendations for an improved comprehensive system of compensation for poor punctuality and reliability that can be applied across the network. The first step in this process is to carry out research among passengers. This is currently being commissioned and should commence shortly.
<P>

<a name="20312w13.html_para3">All ferry passengers have rights under the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982. This requires a trader to carry out a service with reasonable care and skill and, where it is not specified, within a reasonable time. If the trader fails to comply with these requirements the law treats the matter as a breach of contract and a consumer could, if necessary, pursue a claim for redress through the civil courts. No changes in the statutory rights legislation have been taken since 1997 nor are any planned.
<P>

<a name="20312w13.html_para4">In respect of coach passengers, scheduled operators do not operate a policy of overbooking. Passengers' rights in the event of delays and cancellations are covered by the conditions of carriage of the operator concerned. These conditions are governed by fair trading legislation, and have generally not changed significantly since 1997.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if the &#163;8.1 billion of uncommitted public investment in rail in the 10 year plan is intended to meet repayment and interest due as a result of private sector investment in the plan.  [41762]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The &#163;8.1 billion of uncommitted public capital funding, along with the rest of the &#163;33.5 billion of public sector funding, will work in partnership with the private sector investment to deliver our Ten Year Plan objectives for rail. It will be allocated in the most cost-effective and efficient way to deliver much needed investment in the railways.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 None. The European Commission's draft Regulation to establish a European Railway Agency (COM(2002)23 Final) indicates that the Agency will have no autonomous decision-making powers and that its responsibilities will be limited to carrying out technical work on behalf of the European Commission and the member states.

 Yes, with the results of their impact under the basecase and our Ten Year Plan investment case outlined in Chapters 2 and 3 of the Ten Year Plan Background Analysis document.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what proportion of the total 10 year plan spending targets will be taken up by revenue support for private investment.  [41664]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The 10 Year Plan assumes that &#163;8.5 billion of the &#163;134 billion of public expenditure in the Plan provides revenue support for &#163;56.3 billion of private investment. However to avoid double counting when adding public expenditure and private investment together, revenue support for private investment is not included in the 10 Year Plan total of &#163;181.9 billion. Therefore it is not appropriate to provide a figure for revenue support as a proportion of this total figure. However revenue support for private investment represents 6.3 per cent. of public expenditure in the plan.

 The working groups that are responsible for drafting the rail interoperability Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) have been meeting since 1996 when the high-speed rail interoperability Directive (96/48/EC) came into force. These working groups have now started work on TSIs for conventional rail, following adoption of the conventional rail interoperability Directive (2001/16/EC) last year. The interoperability "Article 21 Committee", the committee comprising the European Commission and the member states that formally adopts the TSIs, has also met regularly since 1996.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The working groups to draft the rail interoperability Technical Specifications Interoperability (TSI's) have been set up under the auspices of AEIF, the European Association for Railway Interoperability. AEIF comprises representatives from the UIC (the International Union of Railways), UNIFE (the Union of European Railway Industries) and UITP (the International Union of Public Transport) and the working group representatives are drawn from these organisations based on individual nominations by member companies.
<P>

<a name="20312w14.html_para1">The UK is well represented on these working groups, from both railway companies including Railway Safety and manufacturing industry. The UK is also represented on the interoperability "Article 21 Committee", the committee comprising the European Commission and the member states that formally adopts the TSIs.

 As I said in my answer of 6 February 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1004W, to my hon. Friend, the underlying increase in "formula" rents will be the same for all local authorities.

<a name="20312w15.html_para0">It is possible to make estimates of how average "actual" rents might change in real terms between 2001&#150;02 and 2011&#150;12 if the national average local authority formula rent were to increase by an average of about 1.5 per cent. per year, and each local authority were to move its actual average rent to its average formula rent over that period

<P>

 Modelling by the Department of the results of implementing the 10-year plan, but omitting the eight road user charging and 12 workplace parking levy schemes that the plan assumed local authorities would introduce outside London, shows that congestion would reduce to 5 per cent. below 2000 levels, compared with a 6 per cent. reduction if the assumptions in the plan are met.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 A recent estimate by the Highways Agency suggests that there is very little difference in whole life cost between low and high noise road surfaces. This estimate takes account of both the initial cost and the expected life of the surface, which can both vary between individual products and applications.

<a name="20312w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B>

[41659]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 In developing the 10-year plan, the Department assumed that land use planning would contribute to lower traffic growth (and thus greater use of other modes) by promoting accessibility to development by public transport, walking and cycling. The Government issued Planning Policy Guidance note 13 (PPG13) on Transport in March 2001, setting out national land use planning policy on transport, to support the integrated transport strategy and 10-year plan. Other PPGs support the same objective of promoting sustainable transport choices.

<a name="20312w17.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We estimate that just under two-thirds of the increased passenger rail demand will be from car users switching to rail. However, this shift does not translate directly into a saving in road journeys, as the reduced level of road traffic will be partly offset by other travellers attracted to the less congested roads.

 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) commissions a bi-annual National Passenger Survey. The results are published in "On Track" in June and December. The SRA also publishes information on customer complaints about rail services, quarterly in "National Rail Trends" and six-monthly in "On Track". These documents are placed in the Library of the House each time they are published.

 Modelling work undertaken for the 10-year plan considered the broad strategic impact on crowding on rail and tube services of a Crossrail type link which opened at the end of the 10-year plan period. A later opening date would have no direct impact on these results. The separate modelling work reported in the Background Analysis of the 10-year plan was undertaken to assess growth in passenger kilometres. This did not assume the construction of Crossrail because it is primarily intended to relieve overcrowding, and is not expected to contribute greatly to passenger growth.

 The Shoreham Maritime Regeneration Strategy was set up in May 1998 to foster the regeneration of Shoreham Harbour. The Shoreham Maritime Steering Group is seeking to implement this strategy and has since been holding regular meetings. Although the Government Office for the South East is a partner of the Steering Group, it is not within the remit of the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions to publish the dates and minutes of these meetings.

 No discussions have been held with Shoreham Port Authority regarding the provision of a link road between the A259 and the A27. There is no Government-led study into such a link road but there is a wider local authority study currently taking place. This work includes a variety of separate work streams looking at the regeneration potential for the port area, and the feasibility of facilitating much of the future potential for local and port development.

 One Lottery grant has been made to film production companies in the north-east in the last 12 months of &#163;40,000 to the Northern Production Fund. The Film Council has also funded Northern Film and Media (through its Regional Investment Fund for England), which has enabled that organisation to invest non-Film Council funds in the region. This includes a total of &#163;213,629 to film production companies and individuals for production and development activity.

 In DCMS travel and subsistence administration is contracted out and there is no electronic record of hotel accommodation. To provide this information would involve a manual check of each travel and subsistence claim which could be undertaken only at disproportionate cost.

<a name="20312w21.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 In response to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) Task Force "Just Pay" report the Government have committed Departments and agencies to review their pay systems and prepare any necessary action plans to close any equal pay gaps by April 2003. The Cabinet Office issued comprehensive guidance in January 2002 to assist Departments and agencies in carrying out these reviews. DCMS will be carrying out its review within the next six months and the Royal Parks Agency will be building it into their programme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w21.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The underlying principle of DCMS's policy on the payment of relocation expenses to staff is that reasonable costs associated with a compulsory permanent transfer to a new workplace will be reimbursed; and anyone joining DCMS from other locations does so on purely voluntary terms. To date there has been no call to use this policy primarily because DCMS is a London based organisation.

In the Royal Parks Agency where Parks Managers are required to relocate to Parks Lodges they receive a relocation package of &#163;2,500 and reimbursement for removal expenses.

<P>
<a name="20312w21.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 English Heritage undertook a comprehensive and successful series of regional press campaigns to publicise the "Images of England" project. They made it clear that it was their intention to photograph every building on the statutory list for the project; owners or occupiers will not therefore be informed individually. Owners who do not wish their building to appear should contact English Heritage, but they should bear in mind that information on every listed building is already in the public domain. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has received two letters about Data Protection and Human Rights legislation in this context.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w21.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The heritage economic regeneration scheme was set up by English Heritage in 1998 to boost the country's deprived urban and rural communities. English Heritage issues guidance to local authorities which explains the funding criteria. They advise that this does not preclude them from assisting schemes in areas which do not rank highly in the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Region's deprivation indices, providing there is a clear regeneration need.

 Since its inception, NESTA has made more than 200 awards, totalling over &#163;15 million. These awards range widely across the arts and sciences, and have made some interesting connections between the two. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport takes a close interest in NESTA's progress and believes that it is making a valuable contribution in line with its objectives. I am asking the chief executive of NESTA to write to my hon. Friend as soon as possible with the details of each award made so far and shall ensure that a copy of the letter is placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.

 Section 8 paragraph 8.2.1 of the Civil Service Management Code requires Departments and agencies to ensure staff use the most efficient and economic means of travel in the circumstances, taking account of any management benefit or the needs of staff with disabilities.

 As part of a review of its pay system, DEFRA commissioned two pay equality audits by independent consultants (the Institute for Employment Studies). These were carried out between July and October 2001. The consultants were aware that the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) Task Force "Just Pay" report had been issued. They were provided with a copy of that report and a draft version of the Cabinet Office's Equal Pay guidance (which was subsequently finalised and issued in January 2002).
<P>

<a name="20312w23.html_para1">The purpose of the two audits was to assess existing and any continuing pay equality issues "before and after" implementation of proposed changes to the pay system. The reports provided a range of statistical studies, including pay level analysis by gender.

<a name="20312w23.html_para2">The first audit provided baseline information by assessing DEFRA's current pay system and staff pay levels.

The contractors must design a population model to establish the feasibility of eradication, estimate the cost of such a strategy, carry out population counts at various sites and test methods of control at various habitats and during various seasons, including the examination of trapping as an alternative to shooting at sites where shooting is not feasible.

<a name="20312w24.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 This Department provides grants for flood and coastal defence capital works, and associated studies, which meet essential technical, economic and environmental criteria and achieve an appropriate priority score. Further to increases in spending plans in the last two spending reviews, additional funding of &#163;51 million over the four years from 2000&#150;01 was announced in November 2000 following the severe flooding that year. An increased priority was given to urban flooding defences and the grant rates for all river flood defences were increased by 20 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20312w24.html_para0">Operational responsibility for flood management measures rests with the local operating authorities, normally the Environment Agency and local councils, who decide which projects to promote and their timing. I understand that the initial scoping report for the Lower River Lee Flood Defence Strategy is currently being reviewed by the agency and they plan to publish a summary of it in April this year. The purpose of the report is to identify flooding problems and key issues.

The Secretary of State does not have a specific duty to promote education for asylum seekers in detention and reception centres. The duty is very wide and general and applies to "the people of England and Wales". However, one of the Secretary of

State's roles when exercising this duty is to work with all bodies and institutions with education responsibilities and to assist them to provide effective education. The Department has been in contact with the Home Office and local education authorities and encouraged them to work together to provide facilities and services that are appropriate to meet the educational needs of the residents of these centres.

<a name="20312w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Under the current legislation the national curriculum applies to schools maintained by local education authorities. This Department is working closely with the Home Office on issues relating to the education of children of asylum seekers in accommodation centres. A final decision has yet to be made about the detail of the education provision that will be made available in accommodation centres.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many opportunity bursaries were awarded in each university in England in 2001&#150;02.  [40559]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20312w26.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Of the 6,580 opportunity bursaries allocated to participating institutions, a total of 6,129 had been awarded by December 2001. Information is not held about the number of opportunity bursaries awarded by individual institutions. The following table shows the number of students with an opportunity bursary in attendance at each institution as at December 2001. Students awarded a bursary by one institution who took up an HE place elsewhere are counted within the total for the institution they transferred to.
<P>

<a name="20312w26.html_para0">The 451 opportunity bursaries that were not awarded from the initial allocations were redistributed to institutions in January 2002. We expect all opportunity bursaries available in 2001&#150;02 to be taken up.

 Since it was launched in January 2001, the Teacher Training Agency's "Those who can, teach" campaign has had a positive impact on recruiting teachers. Last September, recruitment to initial teacher training courses rose for a second successive year, while the number of graduates who have applied to train as teachers so far this year is 22 per cent. higher than at the same point in 2001. Last year, the total number of inquiries about careers in teaching received by the agency's Teaching Information Line was 48 per cent. higher than in 1999&#150;2000. Between September 2001 and March 2002, 10 per cent. more inquiries were received than in the corresponding period the previous year. The Teacher Training Agency will launch the next phase of the current advertising campaign later in the spring.

 Support for full-time students is generally provided through the educational maintenance system which is designed for their needs.

<P>
<a name="20312w28.html_spnew8"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Our policy is that local reference rents should reflect the generality of the market and must therefore be based on an area large enough to take account of the bigger picture which reflects a more generalised choice of housing. Localities are intended to reflect the qualities (both good and bad) of an area. Details of Rent Service localities are not published because markets can change rapidly rendering such information out of date and meaningless. Localities are necessarily fluid in order to reflect the housing market. Current Rent Service guidance states that localities should be reviewed on a monthly basis.
<P>

<a name="20312w28.html_para5">Rent Officers determine localities by using their professional judgment, expertise and knowledge of the local housing market. There is no requirement for the Rent Service to consult formally about these arrangements.

 Most people who make powers of attorney do so with help from legal advisers. We have no information about the cost to individuals as this is a private matter agreed between the individual and his or her legal advisers. Where the individual has made an enduring power of attorney, there is a fee to register the power of attorney if the individual becomes mentally incapacitated. The fee for registering an enduring power of attorney was &#163;50 from 1997 and increased to &#163;75 on 1 October 1999. The Public Guardianship Office (PGO) has recently conducted a review of the fees charged, including fees for registration of enduring powers of attorney, as the existing fees policy does not meet the full cost of the service delivered, as required by HM Treasury guidance. Fees charged by the PGO are set by the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the consent of HM Treasury, and will be laid before Parliament shortly.

 Between 21 March 2001 and 3 March 2002, the total amounts deferred in respect of PAYE, VAT and Corporation Tax came to &#163;65.236 million, &#163;109.598 million and &#163;11.954 million respectively. These are gross figures and take no account of amounts subsequently paid. Businesses seriously affected by the foot and mouth outbreak have not been required to recommence payments of deferred liability and we do not have full details of payments received. It is, therefore, not possible to state how much is still owed by businesses in Scotland and England. However, a sample review of these cases in December 2001 suggests that as much as &#163;78.45 million has been paid voluntarily.

 The primary legislation for the aggregates levy was included in the Finance Act 2001. Since the Act received Royal Assent, Customs and Excise have continued to consult the aggregates industry on matters of details, with a view to finalising the secondary legislation, which will be laid shortly.
<P>

<a name="20312w31.html_para0">During those discussions a number of technical issues have been raised, and it is the Government's intention to make a number of small changes in this year's Finance Bill that will facilitate the smooth functioning of the levy. These are:

 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2002]:</i> The Treaty of Amsterdam committed member states to adopt by May 2004 a broad range of measures designed to establish minimum standards for asylum procedures and polices across the European Union. At the Tampere European Council in October 1999 member states agreed to look beyond the minimum standards established by 2004 towards the creation of a common European asylum system. After a slow start there is now increasing momentum on the first stage of the process to establish minimum standards. The United Kingdom has participated actively in this process and has opted in to all measures to date where the three-month time limit from formal presentation of the proposal has already expired.
<P>

<a name="20312w31.html_para6">The following measures have been adopted to date: Council Regulation establishing the EURODAC electronic fingerprinting database (adopted 11 December 2000); Council decision for an agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a member state or in Iceland or Norway (adopted 15 March 2001); Council decision establishing a European Refugee Fund (adopted 28 September 2000); and Council directive on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in event of mass influx (adopted 20 July 2001).
<P>

<a name="20312w31.html_para7">The following measures are under discussion but have not yet been agreed: Proposal for Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status; Proposal for a Council directive laying down minimum standards on the reception of applicants for asylum in member states: Proposal for a Council regulation replacing the Dublin Convention; and a proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards for the qualification as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection.
<P>

<a name="20312w31.html_para8">The Laeken European Council in December 2001 called for the Commission to bring forward revised proposals for the measures setting minimum standards for asylum procedures and the regulation to replace the Dublin Convention by the end of April 2002.

<P>

<a name="20312w33.html_para4">For a decision to be made on whether and on what terms a licence might be granted to produce, breed or use genetically modified animals, the 1986 Act requires the same considerations to be taken into account as for genetically normal animals. These are that the likely benefits of the programme are weighed against the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned (the cost/benefit assessment), and that there are no alternatives which either replace animal use entirely, reduce the number of animals needed or refine the procedures to minimise pain and suffering (3Rs). Licence applicants must also demonstrate that the procedures are for a permitted purpose and are likely to achieve the stated objectives.
<P>

<a name="20312w33.html_para5">It is not always possible to predict the likely welfare effects of novel genetic modifications.

<P>
<a name="20312w34.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Figures for the average payment to the widow of a retired police officer or for the number of such widows are not available centrally. From a survey undertaken in 1996 the Government Actuary's Department has estimated that 7 per cent. of actual pensions expenditure at the time represented payments to widows and widowers of former officers. It is estimated that the present-day figure would be about 8 to 9 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20312w34.html_para0">As the changes to spouses' benefits over the final quarter of the last century feed through into payment, it is estimated that the proportion of pensions expenditure they represent will rise to over 15 per cent. over the next 30 years. The Government Actuary's Department estimates that the present cost of new-entrant benefits accruing to be 32 per cent. of pay of which about a third (11 per cent. of pay) is contributed by the officer in service. The total cost attributable to spouses' benefits is about 5 per cent. of pay.

 <i>[holding answer 11 March 2002]:</i> In England and Wales, some 95 per cent. of criminal cases are conducted in magistrates courts without a jury. Criminal trials in the Crown court are conducted with a jury. Pre-trial issues such as bail or preliminary rulings are heard by the judge alone. He or she can also order an acquittal before the jury is empanelled. Once a trial has started, a hearing to consider the admissibility of evidence or a point of law is invariably heard in the absence of a jury. Sentencing is a matter for the judge alone. In the Coroner's court, the majority of inquests are heard without a jury.

 The child protection provisions in Part 2 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 (CJ) (CSA) provide a new definition of working with children. It includes positions whose normal duties involve caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of children, and positions whose normal duties involve unsupervised contact with children under arrangements made by a responsible person, for example a parent. Anyone whose paid or unpaid work entertaining children meets one of the definitions included in the legislation would already be covered by its provisions.

<a name="20312w35.html_para4">These provisions form part of an integrated system for the protection of children. They enable the courts to disqualify unsuitable people from working with children as part of their sentence or the disposal of their case.

<a name="20312w35.html_para5">The relevant provisions in the CJ and CSA consolidate and strengthen the framework for protecting children. It is none the less important that parents remain vigilant about those circumstances under which they entrust their children to the care of an adult, particularly if they are not present to ensure their children are safe.

<a name="20312w36.html_para5">The national minimum standards require that prior to a service user moving into a home an assessment of his or her needs should be undertaken. In most cases this will have been undertaken either by social workers or nurses depending on where the service user is prior to moving. Where a self funding service user has not had an assessment this should be undertaken by the provider prior to that person moving into the home. Either the provider or at least one other member of staff should be suitably trained in conducting assessments. Since in the majority of cases the cost of assessing service users before they enter a home falls to local authorities or the national health service the cost impact on providers would be marginal. The regular review of assessed needs should be a normal part of the conduct of care homes.

The majority of general dental services is not included in health authority accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. Pharmacedutical services accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority are also excluded. Total expenditure for England in respect of these two services for 1999&#150;2000 was &#163;2,233,288,000.<P>

2. There has been a change of accounting policy agreed after the submission of the 1999&#150;2000 summarisation forms, relating to the treatment of fixed asset impairments. This would have resulted in lower expenditure figures for health authorities than that shown in the table. The amount involved on average is approximately &#163;7 million per health authority.<P>

 I apologise to the hon. Member for the delay in responding to this question. I refer the hon. Member to the reply that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State gave my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) on 5 March 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 192W.
<P>

<a name="20312w49.html_para0">The cause of autism is not yet known and many factors may play a role. The recently completed Medical Research Council (MRC) review of the epidemiology and causes of autism concludes that the strongest evidence to date is for a major genetic component. It says that methodological differences between studies, changes in diagnostic practice, and increased public and professional awareness are likely causes of apparent increases in prevalence but notes that it is not yet clear whether these factors account for it all.
<P>

<a name="20312w49.html_para1">A number of studies, including one commissioned by the Medicines Control Agency have examined the postulated link between measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) and autism and have found no association. Two of these studies (Fombonne et al, Paediatrics, 2001 and Hiejbel and Gillberg, Autism, 1998) have specifically looked at rates of autism in populations who have had MMR and populations who have not had MMR using consistent definitions of autism. These studies did not find an increased reported rate of autism in MMR immunised children when compared with children who had not had MMR. Taylor et al, Lancet 1999, looked at the rate of MMR immunisation in autistic children in north Thames and found no significant difference when compared with the rate of MMR immunisation among all children in north Thames. A follow-up study (Vaccine 2001) showed no temporal association between MMR and onset of autism at any time. In February 2002, the Public Health Laboratory Service published a further study investigating MMR, regressive autism and bowel symptoms. This study compared the proportion of autistic children with bowel

or developmental regression over a 20-year period from 1979, a period when MMR vaccine was introduced in the United Kingdom. They showed that there was no change in the proportion of children with regression or bowel symptoms during this time, irrespective of whether they had had MMR or not (Taylor et al, BMJ 2002, 324; 393&#150;6).
<P>

<a name="20312w49.html_para2">In addition to the above, an ongoing study funded by the MRC and led by Professor Andrew Hall, is investigating possible causes of autism. This study will examine whether autistic children have a history of other conditions or medical problems, for example, problems during birth. This study, which examines a representative sample of health records drawn from over two million people registered with 300 general practices across the UK, will also look at autism and the MMR vaccine.

<a name="20312w49.html_para3">The registration/de-registration of patients with a general practitioner is governed by the Doctor's Terms of Service. We strongly endorse the General Medical Council guidance "Duties of A Doctor" which says that it is unacceptable to discriminate against patients on grounds of lifestyle, culture, beliefs, race, colour, sex, sexuality, age, social status or perceived economic worth. Refusal to accept the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination should not therefore be regarded by a general practitioner as a reason for removing somebody from his or her patient list.

<a name="20312w50.html_para13">The general practitioner (GP) pay system includes incentives for GPs to deliver targets on childhood immunisation and cervical cytology. These have been a feature of the pay system since 1990. The NHS plan sets targets for modernising primary care services where GPs are expected to contribute to their achievement, including in particular, the access target that by 2004 patients should be able to see a GP within 48 hours or another health professional within 24 hours. None of these targets are, however, for GPs to achieve on their own. It is for primary care trusts locally to lead, organise, support and resource delivery of the NHS plan targets for primary care.

Once formal powers are invoked, patients have the benefit of the statutory safeguards which accompany the use of those powers.
<P>

<a name="20312w55.html_para3">There has been concern about the position of patients who are not formally detained but who have not consented to their treatment.

These safeguards will include, among other things, the right to challenge admission and treatment before a mental health tribunal. As, in practice, it is unlikely that such patients will be able to take advantage of safeguards for themselves, the legislation will also provide for a nominated person to act on the patient's behalf. Where such patients demonstrate resistance to detention or treatment, they will only be lawfully detained or treated under formal powers. New rights will also be introduced for young people with serious mental disorders who are, nevertheless, able to give a view about their own treatment.

The Department uses the trend increase in activity and expenditure for individual services as an indicator of likely future increases in costs. For example, the Department uses trend growth in the following categories of services:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Expenditure on FHS drugs;
<P>
<BR>
Non-elective (emergency) hospital activity; and
<P>
<BR>
The number of patient visits by community staff.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20312w55.html_para12">These trend increases include the impact of aging population and health care technology. They also capture the effect of other factors, such as changes in public expectations and changes in the underlying health status of the population.
