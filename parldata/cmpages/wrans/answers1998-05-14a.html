To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the aims of the Government at the Conference of the Parties to the Biodiversity Convention meeting in Bratislava.  [41455]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The UK, along with other Member States of the European Union, has already taken steps to implement the CBD at a national and European level. We are pressing for this Conference to agree further action at all levels in a number of areas. These include decisions on: inland water ecosystems; marine and coastal ecosystems; agricultural biodiversity; forests; benefit sharing; and the Biosafety Protocol. We are also striving to improve the operation of the Convention so that it becomes a much more effective force in the world. I represented the UK at a ministerial Roundtable at the start of negotiations which made recommendations on private sector activities, sustainable tourism, and the integration of biodiversity into policy decisions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list for each year since its creation the number of warning letters issued by HM Railway Inspectorate to Railtrack plc.  [41564]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive's (HSE's) Railway Inspectorate advise that the information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list for each year since its creation prosecutions taken by HM Railway Inspectorate against Railtrack plc.  [41563]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive's (HSE's) Railway Inspectorate has initiated two prosecutions against Railtrack plc since its creation. The first followed an electrical burns incident at Hatton in Warwickshire on 24 July 1995. Railtrack pleaded not guilty but were found guilty. The second prosecution followed a derailment at Bexley on 4 February 1997. This is expected to be heard on 26 May 1998.

<a name="80514w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will place in the Library a copy of the letter issued by HM Railway 



<P>
<P><I>14 May 1998 : Column: 154</I><P>
Inspectorate to Eurotunnel as detailed in Paragraph 63 of the Annual report of the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority 1996-97.  [41560]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 It is not the practice of Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate to make public the contents of private correspondence with duty holders.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will place in the Library a copy of the report produced by the Rail Safety and Technology Working Group relating to signals passed at red in the Channel Tunnel.  [41559]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 I am not in a position to do so.
<P>

<a name="80514w01.html_para0">This report was a working document produced by the Rail Safety and Technology Working Group to inform the Safety Authority and contains information supplied by Eurotunnel. Disclosure would be a breach of Clause 33 of the Concession Agreement of 1986 concerning intellectual property and confidentiality.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the main contractors employed by Railtrack to undertake maintenance work, and the names of any contractors or sub-contractors removed from any approved lists since the creation of Railtrack.  [41568]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 This is a commercial matter for Railtrack.

<a name="80514w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list for each year since its creation the number of occurrences where unqualified staff or contractors have been found undertaking work on railway property on behalf of Railtrack plc.  [41566]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive has no records of the numbers of such occurrences.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list for each of the last five years the number of derailments officially notified to HM Railway Inspectorate and the train operating companies involved.  [41567]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas) on 7 May 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>441-42</i>.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Gordon Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to introduce a comprehensive requirement for secondary treatment to be provided for significant sewage discharges to high natural dispersion areas; and what estimate he has made of the cost.  [42033]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, secondary treatment of sewage discharges is the norm but coastal discharges may receive primary treatment if comprehensive studies establish that there would be no adverse environmental effect. We are, however, very aware of the concerns being expressed by 



<P>
<P><I>14 May 1998 : Column: 155</I><P>
those who are not convinced that anything less than secondary treatment will afford the necessary level of environmental protection and are giving further consideration to the Government's policy options. Decisions will have to be taken in the context of the current Periodic Review of water company price limits, which is the process of balancing the environmental obligations to be placed on water companies in England and Wales with the consequent effect on water bills.

<a name="80514w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will place in the Library the programme of development work within the terms of paragraph 6 of the Annexe to the Commission Decision 94/730/EC of 4 November 1994 in respect of GMO release consent reference 95/R13/6.  [42091]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The programme of development work for GMO release consent reference 95/R/13/6, to which the hon. Member refers, is entirely covered by information which was supplied in support of that particular application for a release consent, which was made under the first simplified procedure regulated by Commission Decision 94/370/EC. This information, as with all release applications in the UK, can be viewed either on the public register at Ashdown House, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions or at the relevant Regional Office in the vicinity of the release. Details can also always be requested from the Biotechnology Unit, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
<P>

<a name="80514w01.html_para1">The information available includes details of the risk assessment; the sites of the releases; the conditions of the releases; and, in fact, all the other information contained on the file which has not been deemed to be commercially confidential. Therefore, as this information is freely and widely available, I do not consider it appropriate to put the programme of development work for GMO release consent reference 95/R/13/6 into the Library.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what statutory provisions govern the conduct of tests and trials in respect of genetically modified seeds; and if he will make a statement.  [41517]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_spnew10"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 All releases of GMOs into the environment are subject to Part VI of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 1992 as amended (1995 and 1997). Accordingly, genetically modified seeds can enter trials and tests only if they have been granted a consent by the Secretary of State. The conduct of each trial is subject to the limitations and conditions of the consent in addition to the general conditions set out in section 112 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in respect of GMOs, and the general conditions relating to National List Trials for any seed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will prevent planting of genetically engineered maize at Hood Barton, near Totnes in Devon, to avoid possible contamination of the neighbouring organic farm.  [42089]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Even if sown now, the genetically modified crop will not be in a condition to produce pollen until July at the earliest and there is therefore no need to prevent planting. If in the light of any new information it appears necessary to terminate the trial this can and will be done before the flowers produce pollen.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if companies releasing genetically modified organisms into the environment are required to pay for post-release monitoring, including the effects within the wider biological environment.  [41481]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_spnew12"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Companies holding a consent to release a genetically modified organism are required to pay the full costs of all monitoring of the release, annual subsistence charges to cover inspection by Health and Safety specialist inspectors, and any enforcement costs.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has <i>(a)</i> to improve public participation in and <i>(b)</i> to increase the transparency of the regulatory procedure for consenting to the release of GMOs.  [42090]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w01.html_spnew13"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Government are currently considering several options to improve public participation in, and transparency of, the regulatory procedure for consenting to the release of GMOs. First, in connection with the forthcoming quinquennial review of the Advisory Committee on Releases into the Environment, the Government will be considering how the deliberations of this Committee might be made more transparent.
<P>

<a name="80514w01.html_para2">Secondly, the Department of Trade and Industry is preparing to undertake a substantial public consultation exercise on the wider--including ethical--issues raised by recent advances in the biosciences, one aspect of which is likely to be the regulatory procedures.
<P>

<a name="80514w01.html_para3">Thirdly, the Government are also looking at improving and increasing the information they place on the Internet in relation to the regulatory procedure for consenting to the release of GMOs, and in doing so, hope to allow greater access to this information. It should also be noted that the current regulatory procedure is already extremely open, with the public able to have access to most of the information supplied in release consent applications.

<a name="80514w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to the answer to the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell), of 11 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>228</i>, when he expects to <i>(a)</i> publish and <i>(b)</i> implement secondary legislation in respect of 20 mph speed limits. [42111]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Consultation on the details of a new system for making 20 mph speed limits was launched on 12 May. Copies of the paper detailing and seeking 



<P>
<P><I>14 May 1998 : Column: 157</I><P>
comments on the proposal have been placed in the Library of the House. Subject to the views of consultees, we will bring forward secondary legislation as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 We intend to consult shortly on a draft of an Order establishing a parish for Beverley. Our intention is to make the Order, which is not subject to parliamentary procedure, to enable elections for the new parish council to be held in May 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w02.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Advisory Committee on Packaging will complete its review of the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 at the end of May. Their report and recommendations to Ministers will be available, as before, to members of the public. A copy will be placed in the Library.

<a name="80514w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Etherington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if support will be given in the current financial year to English local authorities and to the Environment Agency to meet the capital costs of dealing with contaminated land.  [42344]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w02.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Department is continuing the Contaminated Land Supplementary Credit Approval programme this financial year with a budget of &#163;15 million. It provides support for English local authorities for the capital costs they incur in dealing with contaminated land. The programme also supports, in the form of additional grant-in-aid, the Environment Agency where it is carrying out works to deal with water pollution caused by contaminated land.
<P>

<a name="80514w02.html_para0">Most authorities with on-going contractual commit- ments for projects funded in previous years have already received notification that support will be available. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has decided many of the bids it has received to date for new projects and has written today to the successful authorities and to the Environment Agency notifying them of the financial allocations which are being made.
<P>

<a name="80514w02.html_para1">The Department is discussing some bids with the authorities concerned and expects to make some further allocations. It will also decide new bids when they are received.

 The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material requires states who are parties to take measures to protect the confidentiality of information relating to the international transportation of nuclear material of the type imported from Georgia. The United Kingdom also follows the internationally agreed guidance in the document "The Physical Protection of Nuclear Material" published by the International Atomic Energy Agency. This recommends that advance knowledge of transport information should be limited to the minimum number of persons necessary. Advice on these international requirements and recommendations is routinely sought from the Director of Civil Nuclear Security who is the designated central authority for the UK on the physical protection of nuclear material, under the Convention. Furthermore, in this particular case, as I told the House on 22 April 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 818, it would have been most unwise to draw attention to the existence of this material before it could be secured and safely removed from Georgia.

 Under Section 10(1)(b) of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997, magistrates are entitled to receive payments by way of Financial Loss Allowance for loss of earnings and any other expenditure incurred as a result of performing the duties of a Justice of the Peace.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The wild-caught baboons are used in important heart xenotransplantation research. Baboons are used because of their physiological similarity to humans and because primates of a particular size (over 6kg) are essential. Extensive efforts have been made, by the research team, to find suitable sources of captive-bred baboons, but captive-bred animals are not available in sufficient quantities.




<P>
<P><I>14 May 1998 : Column: 166</I><P>

All applications to use wild-caught primates are referred to the Animal Procedures Committee. In this case, the Committee advised in 1994 that there was justification for allowing their use. The Committee has closely monitored and reviewed the work involving these baboons since the licence was granted.

 The export and transportation of animals is primarily a matter for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Home Office does not keep central records of the number of animals exported, nor the purpose for which they were exported.




<P>
<P><I>14 May 1998 : Column: 167</I><P>

<a name="80514w04.html_para2">Animals which have been used in scientific procedures must be discharged from the controls of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 before they can be exported. We have authorised the discharge of transgenic pigs from the controls of the Act so that they might be exported to Holland. This authorisation was contingent upon a number of conditions, aimed at ensuring animal welfare, being met. These required, inter alia, that a veterinary certificate of fitness to travel be obtained and that only those animals which are unlikely to suffer adverse effects be exported. Any unexpected adverse effects experienced by the animals must also be reported to the Home Office.

 On 17 April representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) Drugs Committee, the British Medical Association, the Association of Police Surgeons and the Medical Defence Union met Home Office officials to discuss the difficulties encountered by some police forces in getting doctors to carry out intimate body searches for concealed drugs. It emerged that information and understanding on all sides needs to be improved: the information from police forces about the number of times they would like an intimate search to be carried out but encounter problems is unreliable; but also the understanding of many police surgeons about the full legal and ethical issues involved is unclear. A number of helpful action points aimed at taking matters forward were agreed at the meeting. These include ACPO asking police forces to review their statistics of intimate searches to provide fuller information and the medical bodies reviewing their current guidance and reconsidering the ethical issues. A further meeting to take stock of progress is planned for the autumn.

<P>
<a name="80514w05.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many pensioner households received double the proper payment under the Pensioner Fuel Bills Special Payment Scheme.  [39853]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Winter Fuel payments are one of a number of initiatives the Government have taken to help vulnerable people, especially the elderly, keep warm in the winter. A total of &#163;400 million has been committed for two years (97/98 and 98/99), to help pensioners with fuel bills to pay. This is the first time any Government have provided additional help with heating costs to all pensioners living in the United Kingdom who receive a Retirement Pension or one of a number of other qualifying benefits.
<P>

<a name="80514w05.html_para0">The making of this year's payments has been an enormous and unprecedented exercise. In order to establish all eligible pensioners, correctly identify pensioner households, and determine the amount each should receive, it was necessary to correlate data in around 15 million computer records, involving 15 qualifying benefits, across nine computer systems. Overall, almost ten million pensioners, in over seven million households, have received a payment.
<P>

<a name="80514w05.html_para1">The administration of Winter Fuel Payments is a matter for Peter Mathison, the Chief Executive of the Benefits Agency. He will write to the hon Member.
<P>

<a name="80514w05.html_para2"><i>Letter from Peter Mathison to Mr. Desmond Swayne, dated 13 May 1998</i>:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your recent parliamentary question asking how many pensioner households received double the proper payment under the Winter Fuel Payment Scheme.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The making of Winter Fuel Payments to almost ten million eligible pensioners, in over seven million households, before the end of March 1998 has been a challenging task for the Benefits Agency (BA). This was achieved whilst maintaining normal benefit business.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Around one and a half million of the poorest pensioners, those receiving Income Support (IS) or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA(IB)), received their payment of &#163;50 during January. Almost eight and a half million other eligible pensioners, for example those in receipt of state Retirement Pension, were issued with a payment of &#163;20 or &#163;10. The issue of these payments was completed by 24 March 1998.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>So far we are aware of 645 eligible pensioners who received two &#163;50 payments. This includes 211 who erroneously received two payments due to being in receipt of both Income Support and income-based Jobseeker's Allowance for at least one day in the qualifying week. In accordance with the legislation only one payment should have been made. A further 434 pensioners cashed both an invalid and a replacement girocheque. Due to a computer operator error, 40,801 invalid girocheques were sent out with an incorrect date of issue. The error was quickly identified and all the invalid payments were replaced within 72 hours. The letter which accompanied the replacement apologised for the error and advised the recipient to destroy the invalid girocheque or if they had managed to encash it, to return the replacement to the nearest Benefits Agency office. It appears that in a small number of instances both the invalid and replacement girocheque were cashed. Action will be taken to write to each of those eligible pensioners who received &#163;100 instead of &#163;50 informing of the position and inviting repayment. In the case of the 434 invalid girocheques cashed by the Post Office, where repayment is not offered by any

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of the eligible pensioners, in accordance with agreed contractual obligations and responsibilities, any balance will be sought from the Post Office.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No information is presently available on the other eligible pensioners who received either a &#163;10 or &#163;20 payment. To determine whether &#163;20 or &#163;10 was due it has been necessary to establish whether the pensioner lived alone. Where we identified they were the only eligible pensioner in a household they received &#163;20; where they lived with other eligible pensioners each received &#163;10.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Legislation requires that the decision whether &#163;10 or &#163;20 is due is based on information held within official Departmental records. All the &#163;20 and &#163;10 payments issued have therefore been based on information which originated from pensioners and is held within these official records.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are aware from subsequent enquiries from some pensioners that the official records available and used by my Agency did not always accurately reflect the correct, current address details. For example, two eligible pensioners living at the same address have differing address details held in official records and despite expecting to receive &#163;10 each, have received &#163;20 each. Similarly, there will be pensioners who receive &#163;10 but believe &#163;20 is due. This will be because official records show the pensioner living at the same address as at least one other eligible pensioner, but they in fact are the only eligible pensioner in the household. In these circumstances they can apply to the BA for a review of the decision to pay &#163;10.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, even though we have subsequently updated the address details the payments themselves remain correct in accordance with the legislation. They have been made using official records which were in place at the time eligibility was determined. The legislation is framed in such a way that providing the payments made are supported by records held then there has not been an incorrect payment.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are therefore not aware of any &#163;10 or &#163;20 payments that have been made in error.</FONT></UL>

 The majority of UK assistance to the Sarahawi is provided via the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). A proposal from ECHO for a 7.2 mecu (&#163;4.8m) programme of assistance to the Saharawi refugees in Southern Algeria for 1998 has recently been approved--the UK share of this will be approximately &#163;670,000. Under this programme, funding will be provided to NGOs, UN agencies and the Red Cross for food aid, medical and sanitary assistance and improving drinking water supply.

 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has an important role to play in helping to eradicate poverty in developing countries, and I have taken a close personal interest in the external evaluation of the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF). I have discussed the report with the Managing Director of the IMF, and other senior Staff on a number of occasions, and pressed them to ensure that key recommendations are adopted. The recommendations include the development of a closer working relationship with the World Bank in the design of ESAF programmes, encouragement of stronger local ownership of such programmes through national consensus building and by offering different policy options, and better monitoring of the impact of ESAF programmes on the poor. We have already taken a leading role in promoting greater collaboration between the World Bank and the IMF. The IMF will shortly be setting out how it plans to operationalise these recommendations.

 The British Investment in South Africa Promotion Scheme helps to promote investment in South Africa by making available Pre-Investment Feasibility Study (PIFS) grants to small and medium sized British and South African companies. Training grants are also available but have not yet been used. In 1997-98 the scheme disbursed grants worth &#163;296,761 to seven applicants, with a projected investment value of more than &#163;13 million. A further &#163;473,933 was committed to 13 new applicants during the year but this has not yet been spent. The cost of administering the scheme during the year was &#163;74,951. Since the start of the scheme, a total of 29 grants have been awarded and a further five are at an advanced stage of consideration.

 The most immediate need in limiting the impact of the crisis on the poor is to restore confidence in the Indonesian economy. To help achieve this the Government of Indonesia must implement the programme now agreed with the IMF. In addition, the UK is contributing &#163;5 million to the Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM) Trust Fund which will help affected Asian Governments, including Indonesia, to design interventions to combat the social effects of the crisis as well as to

 Our normal practice is to provide food aid through international agencies, and we stand ready to provide help if needed. We have received a food situation report from the World Food Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organisation and are awaiting a further report from the European Commission which is due shortly. It is possible that the real problem is one of logistics and markets, rather than absolute food shortage. Food aid can damage local production; it is therefore important that we make a proper assessment. Once we have full details we shall take a decision on whether and how best the UK can assist.

 Negotiations on a fifth general capital increase for the African Development Bank have been in progress since February 1997 and were virtually concluded at a meeting on 23-24 March in Abidjan. The increase is not required for lending purposes but to strengthen the Bank's financial base. For non-regional shareholders, such as the UK, the capital increase will provide greater influence in the Bank through an increase in the non-regional shareholding from 33 1/3 per cent. to 40 per cent., and changes to the voting rules. Governors will be invited to adopt a draft Resolution on the capital increase at the Bank's Annual Meeting on 27-29 May. The capital increase will then come into effect in 1999.

The new account will provide savers with an attractive tax-free savings opportunity which will be more widely available, will have no minimum investment requirement and will not lock up their money. Savers will have an unprecedented guarantee of stability as the scheme will run for at least ten years. We anticipate that these features will make the new account very attractive to those who are new to tax-free saving, as well as providing ample reason for existing savers to continue and increase their savings.

A number of different comparisons were made involving more than 300 pupils and, among the findings of the evaluation study highlighted in a recent Home Office Drug Prevention Initiative study paper, are the positive effects the programme appears to have on pupils' skills, attitudes and reported drug use.

 The best large British firms have already begun to prepare but many small and medium businesses have not thought about the issue. To help them do so, the Government have a communications strategy to raise awareness and provide information, including a dedicated telephone line and website supported by a range of literature.

 I have not received any recent representations under the terms of the Petroleum Act 1987. My Department is currently considering Shell's revised proposals for the Brent Spar and has had preliminary discussions with a number of operators about their decommissioning plans.

<P>
<a name="80514w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 I receive many representations as part of the Government's extensive dialogue with business, including on issues that might place burdens on business. The Government's aim is to minimise such burdens, for example by ensuring long-term economic stability and adopting good regulatory practice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Department has a special Innovation Unit which works to spread best practice in and awareness of innovation through events such as the Audience with Innovation recently given by Richard Branson, through publications such as Partnerships with People and through networking both regionally and nationally with companies, with public and private sector bodies and with other parts of DTI.
<P>

<a name="80514w10.html_para0">In addition, last year my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade set up six business-led Working Parties, including one on innovation which I chaired, to make recommendations about how the UK could be made more competitive.

 To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make a further statement on the handling of compensation claims from former miners suffering from respiratory diseases.  [40989]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 At a High Court hearing on 27 March 1998 the solicitors acting for the plaintiffs requested a three month adjournment to allow further discussions to take place with the Department's agents about our settlement proposals for dealing with the many thousands of claims expected. The court granted an adjournment and discussions continue. We trust that agreement can be reached quickly so that valid claims can be paid in full.
<P>

<a name="80514w10.html_para1">I also refer my hon. Friend to my previous answer to him of 30 April 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 235-36, which explained that, as a further three month delay may be unwelcome to some claimants, particularly those who are severely disabled, we are continuing to make interim payments of &#163;2,000 to miners seeking compensation for emphysema who are also in receipt of DSS PD.D12 benefit. Initially offers were made to those over 80 on 



<P>
<P><I>14 May 1998 : Column: 187</I><P>
receipt of PD.D12 certificates from claimants' solicitors. But we are also making offers to claimants below 80 (in descending order) wherever practicable, to ensure that we reach our minimum target of 5,000 offers. Ideally we wish to reach this point by the end of June but, to enable us to do this, we need the co-operation of the plaintiffs' solicitors to submit evidence of receipt of benefit. Unfortunately, PD.D12 certificates are not being sent in to us as quickly as we expected and we trust that plaintiffs' solicitors will do all they can to speed the process up.

<a name="80514w10.html_wqn8"><B> Ann Clwyd: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade, pursuant to her answer to the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) of 27 November 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>645</i>, if she will list the assessments made by <i>(a)</i> ECGD and <i>(b)</i> other relevant agencies on the risks of extending the export credits against which claims have been made by manufacturers and not recovered from the Governments of (i) Venezuela, (ii) Jordan, (iii) Kenya, (iv) Egypt and (v) Algeria.  [39267]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> All ECGD's risk assessments are based on analysis of the economic and political factors which influence an individual country's ability and willingness to meet its external debt commitments. Any 



<P>
<P><I>14 May 1998 : Column: 188</I><P>
vulnerability to political risks, such as civil wars, coups, etc., is also taken into account. In the cases of Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Kenya, and Venezuela the risk assessments made prior to the issue of the guarantees led us to take the view that these countries had the capacity and willingness to pay, and the decision was taken to issue the guarantees. However, despite best endeavours at judging the long-term risk some countries can still default on their commitments for reasons which are outside ECGD's control (for example unforeseen economic shocks such as oil price falls).
<P>

<a name="80514w10.html_para2"><i>(b)</i> ECGD considers a wide variety of country information and risk assessments from other relevant agencies such as the International Monetary Fund, The World Bank, and Export Credit Agencies. Information from these agencies helps to inform ECGD's own assessment of the economic and political risks.

 The Government believe that outward investment can make a significant contribution to sustainable development.

The Department also continues to run the Technology Partnership Initiative, which seeks to promote technology co-operation with developing countries, and which can facilitate the transfer of the environmental technologies, which are crucial to the achievement of sustainable development.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what support the Government are giving to small businesses to deal with the threat of Year 2000 computer bugs.  [39795]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 May 1998]:</i> This Government's support to small businesses to help them deal with the Millennium Bug falls under two headings: informed advice, guidance and signposting to sources of help through DTI's new initiative--Action 2000--and a Department for Education and Employment scheme to subsidise training in IT skills for staff of small businesses.
<P>

<a name="80514w11.html_para0">Government support for Action 2000 now amounts to &#163;17m. The main focus of the Millennium Bug campaign is on ensuring that small businesses take action now to address the problem by signposting practical help and guidance and available information on tools and services. DTI's network of Business Links and similar organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, working with Action 2000, are training staff to provide advice to businesses, including advice on the best programmes and consultants to use.
<P>

<a name="80514w11.html_para1">In March, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced that &#163;26m was being made available for DfEE to help employers in small businesses train up to 20,000 people to tackle the Millennium Bug.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade (1) what powers she has to prevent the misuse of fax machines for transmitting unsolicited material;  [41499]
<P>
<UL>(2) if she will legislate to prevent the sending of unsolicited faxes.  [41501]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Measures are already in place to deal with the problem of unsolicited faxes. The telecommunications and telephone selling industries have established a Fax Preference Service to help residential customers reduce the number of faxes they receive. Customers who have a fax machine in their residential premises may register for inclusion in a database against which companies selling via fax 'clean' their mailing lists. Moreover, under the Telecommunications Act 1984, UK companies using fax marketing are subject to a class licence which contains measures aimed at limiting the nuisance which can be caused by unsolicited faxes. Anyone sending unsolicited faxes must cease doing so to any particular person on receipt of a written request from them, or face possible enforcement action, including the removal of their right to operate a telecoms system, by Oftel.
<P>

<a name="80514w11.html_para2">The Government are addressing the question of additional measures to protect businesses and residential consumers from unwelcome faxes in the forthcoming consultation paper on the European Union Telecoms Data Protection Directive, which the Government will implement later this year.

<a name="80514w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The main problem affecting legitimate retailers of petrol and diesel in Northern Ireland is smuggling of duty paid fuel across the border for onward sale. The Government, Customs and Excise and the other authorities in Northern Ireland are fully aware of the problem.
<P>

<a name="80514w11.html_para3">Customs are deploying resources and actively mounting investigations against those involved to counter the threat posed to revenue and to the Northern Ireland business community. Customs are taking the lead on this issue but are acting in conjunction with other authorities, including the Royal Ulster Constabulary, to make seizures of oil tankers and vehicles carrying oil tanks filled with illegally imported fuel for resale. Wherever possible, cases are progressed with a view to criminal prosecution of the individuals concerned.

<a name="80514w11.html_para8">North West London TEC has been instrumental in developing and enhancing a successful local Business Link partnership in its area. The TEC is committed to playing its part in the development of quality business and enterprise support services in line with my vision statement announced in October last year, and to enhancing its strategic role in this respect. I understand that the TEC has not reached any conclusions about its contribution to the Business Link for 1998-99. If the TEC were to withdraw its partnership contribution, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry would have the right, at her discretion, to withhold pump-priming funding and to recover the pump-priming funding already paid. In addition, concerns about operational and financial viability that may result as a consequence of any of the partners' proposals to withdraw contributions would be subject to a thorough review by the Government Office for London. This is done in the normal course of business so as to ensure that the TEC has an operational Business Link in the area.

[41614]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The nature of the functions of the Patent Office is defined by Statutes which in practice preclude it from expanding its work into areas of activity undertaken by patent and trade mark agents. In the context of a prior options review in 1994, the previous Government considered in general terms whether legislation should be introduced to alter this arrangement. In the event, they decided not to proceed with legislation.

 European Monetary Union will affect the business environment for firms in all sectors. The setting of inflation targets and interest rates by the European Central Bank will affect the macroeconomic situation, and barriers to trade between member states will be removed by the elimination of exchange rate barriers and currency transaction costs. EMU should also increase the transparency of prices across the euro zone, a point of particular interest to the vehicle sector. Businesses in all sectors should be considering their marketing and pricing strategies in the light of this new environment, as well as the practical implications of the change for the way in which they do business.

<P>
<a name="80514w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We have plans to amend the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 and the Plant Protection Products (Basic Conditions) Regulations 1997 by means of new regulations. If the Pesticides Bill passes into law, as the Government hope, the existing Regulations will be amended to improve the arrangements for public access to information and also to extend to local authorities certain powers to seize and dispose of pesticides. In addition, the Government intend to remove the age exemption from the requirement for users of agricultural pesticides to hold a certificate of competence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Government's policy is to make as much information about pesticides available to the public as possible. Constraints are therefore kept to the minimum necessary to protect personal information, commercial secrets and intellectual property rights.
<P>

<a name="80514w13.html_para1">Documents detailing the evaluation of pesticide compounds carried out by the Advisory Committee on Pesticides are available for inspection or purchase by the public.

 Plant Varieties are tested for Distinctness, Uniformity and Stability (DUS) for the purposes of National Listing and plant breeders' rights. The main agricultural species are also trialled, for National List purposes only, to establish whether they have Value for Cultivation and Use (VCU). These requirements apply to all varieties, regardless of whether they are genetically modified or not, although genetically modified varieties cannot be entered in tests and/or trials unless a consent to release has been granted by the Secretary of State in accordance with the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 1992, as amended. The tests and trials must also comply with any conditions imposed in release consents.

Tests for Distinctness, Uniformity and Stability (DUS) are undertaken in respect of applications for plant breeders' rights under the Plant Varieties Act 1997 (the Plant Varieties and Seeds Act 1964, which preceded the 1997 Act, also required DUS tests). Tests for DUS and trials to establish Value for Cultivation and Use (VCU) are undertaken in respect of applications for National Listing. The Department is currently considering 13 applications for plant breeders' rights, 11 applications for addition to the National List and 9 combined plant breeders' rights/National List applications in respect of plant varieties which are genetically modified organisms.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Varieties entered for plant breeders' rights under the Plant Varieties Act 1997 (and the legislation which preceded it) are tested for Distinctness, Uniformity and Stability (DUS). Varieties entered for National Listing are also tested for DUS. A DUS test undertaken for plant breeders' rights purposes is acceptable for National List purposes. In most circumstances, a DUS test initially undertaken for National List purposes is also acceptable for plant breeders' rights. There may, however, be isolated instances when a DUS test undertaken initially for National List purposes is not entirely acceptable for assessing an application for plant breeders' rights. This is because Distinctness must be established in an international context for plant breeders' rights, whereas for National List purposes, it needs to be established only in comparison with varieties on a National List of another Member State or on the Common Catalogue.

 I refer to the answer my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary gave my hon. Friend the Member for East Ham (Mr. Timms) on 28 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>26-29</i>, announcing the criteria to be used when considering licence applications for the export of conventional arms. These criteria specify that an export licence should be refused if approval would be inconsistent with the UK's international obligations and commitments to enforce UN arms embargoes.
<P>

<a name="80514w15.html_para0">The UK takes seriously its obligations to implement UN Arms Embargoes and expects other countries to do the same. Within the EU, we are working towards an EU Code of Conduct that will set high common standards for arms exports from all EU Member States. The latest draft of the Code contains similar wording on Member States' international obligations and the commitments to enforce UN arms embargoes.

<P>
<a name="80514w15.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The information is not available in the format requested. The General Household Survey (GHS) conducted by the Office for National Statistics estimated that in 1993 and 1995, 25 per cent. of women aged 16 to 49 in Great Britain used the contraceptive pill. Information is not available for the other years requested because the GHS only asked the specific question on contraception in 1993 and 1995.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action he has taken to implement the recommendations of the Calman report on the provision 



<P>
<P><I>14 May 1998 : Column: 207</I><P>
of cancer services in the NHS <i>(a)</i> nationally and <i>(b)</i> in the North Thames region; and if he will make a statement.  [38377]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 We remain committed to improving cancer care, and achievement of the cancer targets within <i>The New NHS</i> and <i>Our Healthier Nation</i> will be set firmly within the ongoing implementation of the Calman/Hine recommendations. Nationally, a great deal of work has already been undertaken to agree the provision and standard of cancer services at each individual potential cancer centre or cancer unit. To support the implementation, commissioning guidance is being produced on the commoner cancers to help health authorities, hospitals, primary care and community services focus on areas most likely to make a difference to the outcomes of treatment. The first guidance document "Improving Outcomes in Breast Cancer" was published in July 1996. The second "Improving Outcomes in Colorectal Cancer" was published on 24 November 1997. Guidance on lung cancer and the gynaecological cancers is planned for 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="80514w15.html_para4">In the North Thames region, the majority of health authorities have focused initially on breast cancer services and have agreed standards of care for their cancer units based on the best guidance. Progress has also been made on the designation of those units that will provide services for colorectal, lung and gynaecological cancers.
<P>

<a name="80514w15.html_para5">Designation status for cancer centres was agreed after a process of review jointly by clusters of relevant health authorities using standards drawn from the Calman/Hine report and agreed by all the health authorities. This process resulted in five centres being designated by November 1997. The centres are located at the following trusts: the Hammersmith Hospitals, Mount Vernon and Watford, the Royal London Hospitals/Havering Hospitals (joint centre), Southend Health Care, and the University College London Hospitals/Royal Free Hampstead (joint centre). A further two aspiring centres are exploring how they could collaborate with other trusts to strengthen their position in the cancer network. All the designated centres were required to produce action plans to set out how they would address issues and service gaps identified during the designation process and these are being closely monitored by the health authorities.
<P>

<a name="80514w15.html_para6">The designated centres are starting work on protocols of care for each cancer. Health authorities and trusts across the Region have also developed a pan-regional audit process for breast cancer so that feedback can be given to providers on their comparative performance against key standards. A similar audit is being developed for colorectal cancer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if the new primary care commissioning groups will be able to use their budgets to purchase specialist services from independent providers.  [41542]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Existing guidance to the National Health Service, issued for the 1998-99 commissioning round, is that health authorities and NHS trusts should explore the scope to make maximum cost-effective use of local NHS capacity before contemplating recourse to private sector hospital provision. Where care is nonetheless commissioned from private hospitals, the reasons must be reported to the Regional Office of the NHS Executive.
<P>

<a name="80514w16.html_para0">In the White Paper <i>The New NHS</i> we promised to introduce new arrangements for commissioning specialised services for 1 April 1999. We have issued a draft guidance document for wide consultation, with responses due by 1 June 1998. Further guidance on Primary Care Groups will be issued in due course.

<P>

<a name="80514w16.html_para4">In an open debate on the future framework for action in the field of public health, the Council explored three strands for future action: improving information for the development of public health; reacting rapidly to threats to health; and tackling the determinants of health through health promotion and disease prevention. The Council also discussed the limitations of the present disparate funding programmes, and the importance of improved efforts to ensure that health protection requirements form a constituent part of other Community policies. The Council agreed common positions on the proposed programmes of Community action on rare diseases and on pollution-related diseases. Agreement was also reached on a Council Recommendation on the suitability of blood and plasma donors and the screening of donated blood. The Council agreed conclusions on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies, and on the integration of health protection requirements in Community policies. Progress was noted on the Community's role in combating tobacco consumption, on the Commission

 The British Crime Survey gives estimates of drug use among people aged 16 to 24 living in private households in England and Wales. The most recent estimates are from the 1996 survey, when 39 per cent. of people in this age group said they had used cannabis at some time. 11 per cent. had used ecstasy; 1 per cent. had used heroin; and 4 per cent. had used cocaine.
<P>

<a name="80514w17.html_para0">The estimates of heroin, cocaine and ecstasy use should be treated with great caution, partly because they are subject to very large sampling error, and partly because a household survey such as the BCS is likely to under-represent current users.
<P>

<a name="80514w17.html_para1">The table gives the range, together with the mid-point estimate. The estimates for cannabis use are fairly precise, while those for the other drugs are not.

<P>
<a name="80514w17.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The question of whether service in the Gulf has affected the fertility of male Gulf veterans is being addressed as part of a MOD-funded epidemiological study currently being conducted by a team led by Dr. Patricia Doyle of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. This study is examining the reproductive health of Gulf veterans, both male and female, and the health of their children. Dr. Doyle's team will shortly begin sending out questionnaires for the main phase of this study to all Gulf veterans and to a control group of Service personnel who did not deploy to the Gulf. We expect that results will begin to emerge from this study by mid-2000.

 I and other Ministers regularly receive representations relating to European security issues from individuals and groups in all walks of life, expressing a variety of views. I am confident that the accession to NATO of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland is in the best interests of the Alliance and of European security as a whole.

<a name="80514w17.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 In the case of returned sites, under the terms of the confidential UK/US bilateral cost sharing arrangement, responsibility lies with the Ministry of Defence for rectifying any contamination caused by defence activities which may subsequently be discovered. United States Visiting Forces are expected to observe and abide by environmental protection standards at least equal to UK legislative requirements. If environmental pollution were discovered at a base made available to the United States Visiting Forces, they would normally be responsible for ensuring that the appropriate remedial action was carried out. The timescales for the removal of polluted matter would have to be set on a case by case basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what was the total cost of employing Ministry of Defence Police at RAF Menwith Hill in the most recent year for which figures are available; and what proportion of the cost was met by <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> the US Government.  [41776]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80514w17.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence Police is a civilian police force constituted under statute by the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987. The Chief Constable of the Ministry of Defence Police is independent of Ministerial, Departmental and political influence in the exercise of his constabulary powers. The total cost of policing RAF Menwith Hill for financial year 1997-98 was &#163;1,915,122 of which &#163;1,762,263 was recovered from the US Government. The US Government refund my Department all Ministry of Defence Police costs, other than overtime occasioned by the activities of protesters, in respect of RAF Menwith Hill.

 A number of inquiries have been received by my Department concerning the possible impact of the Strategic Defence Review on the Cadet Forces. No decisions have yet been taken on the Strategic Defence Review but the Government fully recognise the contribution made by the Cadet Forces to national life, and Defence Ministers have made their support for the cadets clear on several occasions.
