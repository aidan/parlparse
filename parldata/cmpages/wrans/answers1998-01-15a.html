To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what checks were made to ensure that all counting areas involved in the Welsh referendum were following the same procedure in relation to new guidance provided following representations from Denbighshire on the night of 18 September; and if he will make a statement. [23133]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80115w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 Decisions as to what regard should be had to the advice given by the Chief Counting Officer on the night of 18 September were for individual Counting Officers to take at their discretion; it would not have been appropriate for my officials to make inquiries on that matter during the course of the various counts.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80115w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Ancram: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what advice he sought, and from whom, following representations received relating to the conduct of the count of the Welsh referendum. [23157]

<P>
<P>
<a name="80115w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 I became aware of concerns in my constituency capacity in respect of the count in Caerphilly County Borough. I asked the Counting Officer to consider these and advise me of the outcome. He replied on 29 September. A copy of his letter has been placed in the Library of the House. I have received no other representations on this matter.

<P>
<a name="80115w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 The Chief Counting Officer decided to issue supplementary advice in response to the representations received from Denbighshire Counting Officer; this decision was made at approximately 11 pm on the night of 18 September. The advice was telephoned to Counting Officers. It was for them to decide what regard should be had to it, and it would not have been appropriate for officials to make further inquiries during the course of the counts as to how Counting Officers were exercising their discretion.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80115w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 Our White Paper on the future of the NHS in Wales, "Putting Patients First", is published today. The White Paper has been laid before Parliament and copies are also available in the Library of the House and in the Vote Office.
<P>

<a name="80115w02.html_para0">"Putting Patients First" fulfils the undertakings we made before coming into office. It abolishes the divisive internal market in the NHS and charts a course for NHS Wales which will restore it as a truly national service of quality, responsive to the needs of its patients.
<P>

<a name="80115w02.html_para1">Our objectives are clear. An NHS which is people centred; an NHS which is delivering quality services in a seamless and collaborative way; an NHS which makes full use of new technologies and makes best practice common practice. "Putting Patients First" provides the framework within which these objectives will be pursued. Fragmentation, inequality and bureaucracy will be replaced by integrated services, collaboration and improved efficiency, saving &#163;50 million over the lifetime of this Parliament for reinvesting in patient care.
<P>

<a name="80115w02.html_para2">Health Authorities and NHS trusts will be retained with new duties and responsibilities for improving health and for working co-operatively with others. We will honour our commitment to reinforce the place of primary care through the creation of Local Health Groups. These will allow professionals to take the lead, in co-operation with others, in planning and providing services locally for the benefit of their patients. They will have budgets and new freedoms to use the available resources in the best interests of their patients. Through these Groups, all primary care professionals, social services departments and others will be able to address the needs of their patients, without the divisions and inequalities of the GP fundholding scheme.
<P>

<a name="80115w02.html_para3">"Putting Patients First" sets out our vision for the NHS in Wales with measures suited to Welsh needs. It lays the foundations for the work of the National Assembly and gives NHS Wales a clear framework within which to address the health of our people and improve the health services they are due.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80115w04.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what his plans are for the future management of the historic royal palaces; and if he will make a statement. [23684]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80115w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The historic royal palaces are currently managed by an Executive Agency of my Department, which has progressively reduced its call on Exchequer support since its establishment in 1989. I have given careful consideration to ways of building on that performance and bringing an end to Exchequer support, while safeguarding the fabric of the Palaces and maintaining the quality of visitors' experience. I have concluded that these benefits will best be realised through establishing the historic royal Palaces as a Non- Departmental Public Body.
<P>

<a name="80115w04.html_para15">I therefore propose to apply for the grant by Her Majesty the Queen of a Charter establishing the new body and to seek Parliamentary approval of an Order under the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 to enter into a contract for it to carry out my day to day responsibilities for the management of the historic royal palaces. An application for charitable status will be made to the Charity Commission.
<P>

<a name="80115w04.html_para16">The new body would be established under a Board of Trustees to bring a wider range of expertise to the running of the historic royal palaces. I propose that the Board comprise three members appointed by Her Majesty the Queen and five appointed by me. The Chairman would be appointed by The Queen on my advice.
<P>

<a name="80115w04.html_para17">I can reassure the current staff of the Agency, who have done so much to secure its success, that their terms and conditions of service will be protected on their transfer to the new body. New pension arrangements, broadly comparable to those under the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme, will be put in place. The Chief Executive of the Agency will now take forward discussions with staff representatives on the detailed implications of the proposed arrangements.
<P>

<a name="80115w04.html_para18">Exchequer funding is set to reduce to some &#163;4 million in 1998-99, but I expect the new body to continue the Agency's success in increasing income and that its new status will give greater financial flexibility and open up fresh sources of income, so that the need for Exchequer funds can be brought rapidly to an end.




<P>
<P><I>15 Jan 1998 : Column: 264</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80115w04.html_para19">I should emphasise that the new arrangements would apply only to the historic royal palaces, which are currently managed by the Agency, and do not affect the palaces which remain in use and are managed on my behalf by the Royal Household. The changes would not alter the ownership of the historic royal palaces or my responsibility for their management. I shall remain answerable to Parliament for their care and presentation.
<P>

<a name="80115w04.html_para20">The new body would operate on the basis of an annual plan and agreed performance targets. The National Audit Office would continue to have full rights of access, both to carry out the annual audit of the accounts and to undertake value for money studies. Annual Reports and Accounts will be presented to Parliament and the Chief Executive will be liable to be summoned to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and other Select Committees of this House.
<P>

<a name="80115w04.html_para21">Subject to the approvals to which I have referred, the new body would be established to take over the management of the historic royal palaces from 1 April this year.
<P>

<a name="80115w04.html_para22">The Historic Royal Palaces agency has been a highly successful Executive Agency. It has achieved major improvements in the conservation and presentation of the palaces, while reducing the call on taxpayers' support. I want to build on that success, bringing in new skills and resources to enhance the palaces and their attractions still further for millions of future visitors.

 On the 12 November 1997, the Government announced a long term investment of up to &#163;200 million in Rolls-Royce plc's large engine programme. The investment is expected to secure 16,000 jobs in the Company and its UK suppliers.

<P>
<a name="80115w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 My hon. Friend the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs announced on 31 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column 641 that the Government had commissioned a research project, to examine papers relevant to the Trading with the Enemy legislation under which the property of residents of enemy countries was confiscated during the Second World War. The project which has been co-ordinated by the FCO in close partnership with the DTI is nearing completion. The Government are considering the project's findings and will publish their response together with the report soon.
<P>

<a name="80115w05.html_para1">The Government, however, recognise that some of the information currently held at the Public Record Office will be of particular interest to Holocaust survivors or their families who may wish to check their family history. The Government therefore intend to publish a list of the names and other details of those who had their property seized under the Trading with the Enemy legislation. This cannot be a complete list as many individual case records have not been retained. However officials are examining the remaining records to see what information can be provided and it is estimated that the list will cover some 25,000 names. It is intended to publish the list on the Internet as soon as possible but the size and complexity of the task makes it difficult to be specific on the timing at this stage. The Government are committed to openness on this issue and believe that the publication of the report and of the list of names should make a large contribution to the public's understanding of this complex subject and help the relatives of holocaust victims to research their family history.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade, pursuant to her answer to the hon.

 The purpose of the discussion meeting I shall be hosting next month is to determine how best to develop a public consultation activity with a view to develop a consensus. The focus will therefore be on the process associated with this type of activity, rather than a discussion of the issues raised by biotechnology as this would pre-judge the public attitudes, which we are seeking to understand.

<a name="80115w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) carry out an on-going programme of research into nuclear fusion. This is supported by my Department, and it forms part of the European Union's fusion programme. Later this year, the UKAEA will complete and commission an important new experimental device--the mega-amp spherical tokamak (MAST).
<P>

<a name="80115w05.html_para4">Both the European and UK programmes have made progress in the last year. The Joint European Torus achieved world-record values for fusion power and fusion energy. On a smaller scale, the UKAEA's small tight aspect ratio tokamak (START) achieved world record values for the efficiency of plasma confinement. Although the research is meeting and exceeding its targets, it is still thought to be at least 50 years before we could build commercial fusion power stations.

 Under the Immigration Rules, holders of travel documents which are not issued by a recognised national authority are required to obtain a visa if they wish to come to the United Kingdom. Despite this, while not recognising the authorities of the so-called "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" (TRNC) we have in the past accepted TRNC travel documents as proof of identity. This has meant that holders of TRNC documents were up till now not required to obtain a visa if visiting the United Kingdom for a short period. This operated under a concession.
<P>

<a name="80115w08.html_para3">We are today bringing the arrangements concerning holders of these documents into line with our standard practice by withdrawing this concession. There have been significant numbers of asylum claims by passengers travelling with this document which, when determined, have all been unfounded. With effect from midnight tonight, holders of documents issued by the authorities of the so-called "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" will be required to obtain visas to the United Kingdom, regardless of the purpose of their journey.
<P>

 This information is not held centrally. During police trials of CS spray, between 1 March and 31 August 1996, it was found that 78 per cent. (588) of officers who sprayed CS suffered some cross- contamination effects, such as a burning sensation to the skin or pain to the eyes. The report of the evaluation of the trials, which was published by the Home Office Police Research Group in December 1996, noted that, in some cases, officers appeared to have reported their experience of CS cross-contamination as minor injury. The officers who took part in the trials generally felt that the disadvantages of cross-contamination were outweighed by the advantages of CS spray as an item of defensive equipment.

 The United Kingdom Presidency will continue to give priority to action against drug trafficking and drugs misuse, in particular by building on the wide range of work already under-way across the three Pillars of the European Union. Our main objectives are to progress further implementation of the European Union strategy against drugs, with a focus on practical action; to begin consideration of a post-1999 European Union drugs strategy; to ensure effective European Union co-ordination for the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Drugs, being held in New York in June; and to promote effective implementation of the European Union/Caribbean and European Union/Central Asia drugs initiatives. This will include taking forward implementation of the Joint Action on the approximation of drugs laws and practices and continuing work on practical measures to tackle drug trafficking from Latin America and heroin trafficking along the Balkan route.

<a name="80115w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Brains from culled hounds in packs throughout Great Britain, which are traditionally fed fallen livestock and so may be considered a high risk population exposed to tissues potentially infected with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies before controls were introduced in September 1990, have been examined and the results considered by SEAC in August 1994. The results were re-evaluated in June 1995. SEAC concluded that the results were inconclusive because there were certain limitations in the protocol of the study. However, it was recognised that the study established that in the dogs studied there was no evidence of a pathologically overt spongiform encephalopathy. It has to be stressed that the hounds were being culled for a variety of reasons and the vast majority were showing no evidence of suffering from neurological disease.
<P>

<a name="80115w12.html_para0">The brains of dogs which die in quarantine are routinely examined for the presence of rabies. Depending on the clinical signs presented before death, some may also be examined for evidence of spongiform encephalopathy if the rabies diagnosis is negative. No TSE has been identified by these examinations.

 The Intervention Board Executive Agency (IBEA) has responsibility for the day to day running of the over-thirty-months scheme. After careful consideration, it has concluded that none of the bids received for incineration under its 1997 tender exercise are capable of meeting its requirements of energy recovery, proven technology, early deliverability, high volumes and reasonable costs. IBEA has therefore terminated the restricted stage of the tender so far as the incineration only element is concerned and is actively investigating other options which may be able to meet its requirements.

 In June 1997, the Environment Agency published a number of studies on the risks from BSE to human health via different environmental pathways. In relation to incineration of BSE suspects, the risk calculation showed that the likelihood of the most exposed individual ingesting in one year sufficient material to cause infection to be less than one in 1,000 million. The Agency pointed out that, in reality, the real risk to the general public is way below that of the most exposed individual. The risks of incinerating over-thirty-months Scheme cattle carcases will be lower still. Incinerators burning carcases and meat and bone meal (MBM) will require consents under the Environment Protection Act 1990.
<P>

<a name="80115w12.html_para4">The risk assessments gave similar results for burning meat and bone meal derived from OTMS carcases in coal fired power stations. All of the risk assessments carried out showed the risks to be very low and negligible compared to other risks in daily life.

 Studies to assess the effectiveness of the rendering processes to inactivate BSE and scrapie infectivity (Taylor et al 1995, Taylor et al 1997) failed to detect any infectivity in tallow. The majority of tallow produced under the Over Thirty Months Scheme is being safely and securely stored pending a final decision being taken on the disposal options. Small amounts of tallow are being burned in some rendering plants to power the rendering process subject to the consent of the local authority.

<a name="80115w16.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 January 1998]:</i> Goods imported into the UK normally bear VAT at the Standard rate (17.5 per cent.). Under the terms of EC law introduced in 1995 certain works of art, antiques and collectors' pieces imported into the UK are eligible until 30 June 1999 for an effective rate of VAT at importation of 2.5 per cent.
<P>

<a name="80115w16.html_para0">The fine art trade's published overseas trade statistics indicate that, since 1995, there has been a reduction in the annual values of UK imports of works of art, antiques and collectors' pieces from non-EC countries. It is readily acknowledged by representatives of the fine art trade that, in such a highly competitive global market, a variety of factors may have contributed to the apparent decline in imports.
<P>

<a name="80115w16.html_para1">During 1998, the EC Commission is expected to review the effects of the relevant EC legislation on the competitiveness of the Community art markets compared to third countries' art markets. The relevant Government departments are working closely with art trade bodies to evaluate those effects, and to try to ensure that the position of the UK's fine art market will be properly represented in that review.

<P>
<a name="80115w16.html_spnew8"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The abolition of paid tax credits applies to all non-taxpayers and is part of a wider reform. We did, however, consider the position of charities carefully and so included a special seven year transitional provision for them which has been generally welcomed.

<P>
<a name="80115w16.html_spnew9"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 No. These arrangements have been the subject of discussion with the oil industry for some time but the cost to the Exchequer of returning to rebonding is too expensive. It also has resource costs for Customs. The industry was compensated for debonding by the current duty deferment system, which allows monthly, rather than daily, payment of duty.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment she has made of the impact of Welfare to Work proposals on the number of people claiming invalid care allowance. [20674]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80115w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government have recently launched the New Deal for people with a disability or long-term illness. Under the New Deal up to &#163;195 million, set aside from the Windfall Tax, will be used to finance a range of options aimed at helping participants, in the most effective way possible, to move into or stay in work, Whilst the programme is primarily aimed at helping people with a disability or long-term illness who want to work, it also aims to help carers to balance their responsibilities with work, or to take up work when their caring responsibilities come to and end.
<P>

<a name="80115w17.html_para0">One key element of the New Deal will involve funding a number of innovative schemes to test ways of helping people who want to work, and the bidding process for this part of the programme was launched on 9 December. Up to 20 schemes will be selected, and we anticipate that some of the bids will focus on the needs of carers. In addition we also plan to introduce personal advisers, initially on a modest basis, to help people with a disability on long-term illness to overcome barriers to work. Carers receiving invalid care allowance will also be eligible for help from these personal advisers.
<P>

<a name="80115w17.html_para1">No estimate has been made of the impact of the New Deal on the number of people claiming Invalid Care Allowance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will list the criteria for eligibility for claims under the family credit childcare disregard; and for each of the last three years <i>(a)</i> how many families made claims against the disregard, <i>(b)</i> what was the total expenditure, <i>(c)</i> what were the average and the median claims, <i>(d)</i> how many claims were made for care of children aged (i) under one year, (ii) between one and four years and (iii) of school age, <i>(e)</i> how many families claimed for help with child care costs for more than one child and <i>(f)</i> what was the average proportion of total family expenditure on childcare which was offset by family credit childcare disregard.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80115w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The eligibility criteria for the Family Credit childcare disregard are set out in Regulation 13A of the Family Credit (General) Regulations 1987.
<P>

<a name="80115w17.html_para2">The disregard provides help with certain childcare charges for lone parents working 16 hours or more, couples where both are working 16 hours or more and couples where one partner is working (16 hours or more) and the other is incapacitated. It applies in respect of 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jan 1998 : Column: 309</I><P>
childcare charges of up to &#163;60 per week for children until the September after the child's 11th birthday. The child must be cared for by a registered childminder, nursery/playscheme, out-of-school club, a childcare scheme operating on Crown Property and schools or establishments exempt from registration under section 71 of the Children Act 1989.
<P>

<a name="80115w17.html_para3">From June 1998 the disregard will be enhanced by increasing the maximum childcare costs allowed to &#163;100 for families who incur childcare costs for two or more children of qualifying age and extending the age limit by one year to the September following the child's 12th birthday.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what is the most recent completed research evaluated by her Department in respect of the take up of income support by pensioners. [23118]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80115w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 As part of our commitment to find the best ways of encouraging take-up of Income Support amongst pensioners, we are currently reviewing relevant research and initiatives completed up to this year, or in progress.
<P>

<a name="80115w18.html_para0">The Department is now commissioning research to identify the most important barriers to pensioners not claiming the Income Support to which they are entitled.
<P>

<a name="80115w18.html_para1">An estimated one million pensioners are not taking up their entitlement to Income Support, and we will be running a number of pilot schemes from April this year to find the best way to help them to claim their entitlement.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80115w18.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to her Department's letter of 16 December in respect of her Department's research into the take up of income support by pensioners, who is carrying out the research, which organisations were invited to tender for it and what are her Department's <i>(a)</i> terms of reference and <i>(b)</i> budget for such research. [23116]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80115w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Research has been commissioned comprising in-depth interviews with pensioners currently claiming and not claiming, but potentially eligible for, Income Support. It will also include focus groups with pensioners and advice agencies. The terms of reference are to explore the reasons for not claiming Income Support and identify possible means of increasing take-up. Exploring the views of those who are already claiming (as well as those who are not) will give an insight into what encourages, as well as discourages, claims for Income Support.

<a name="80115w18.html_para2">Research commissioned by the Department is usually competitively tendered. In this case, the sample was drawn from existing data, so only the organisations involved in the original survey--the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Social and Community Planning Research (SCPR)--were invited to tender. A contract worth &#163;66,000 was awarded to Social and Community Planning Research.
<P>

<a name="80115w18.html_para3">A quantitative survey of pensioners potentially eligible for, but not claiming, Income Support is currently being negotiated; details are not yet finalised.

 Although benefits for sickness and disability are included in my Department's Comprehensive Spending Review, no proposals have yet been brought forward. Since the beginning of July 1997, the Secretary of State and Ministers in the Department have had 14 seminars and meetings with organisations representing disabled people. A range of issues were discussed in these meetings.

<P>
<a name="80115w18.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gale: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when she expects to table regulations implementing the introduction of cold weather payments; what provisions she intends to make to enable those elderly people using key meters to pay their heating bill; and if she will make a statement. [23210]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80115w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Social Fund Winter Fuel Payments Regulations were laid before the House on 8 January and will come into force on 16 January.
<P>

<a name="80115w18.html_para5">Publication of the Regulations followed an announcement on 5 January, which outlined the detail of the scheme. A publicity campaign has now been launched involving media advertising, posters and leaflets in conjunction with Help The Aged, Age Concern and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. It is designed to ensure that pensioners are aware of what payments they will receiving, how and when. This information will enable pensioners to heat their homes confident in the knowledge that they will get extra help with their heaviest fuel bill.
<P>

<a name="80115w18.html_para6">People receiving Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, and where their benefit includes one of the pensioner premiums, will receive a payment of &#163;50. Around 1.5 million payments should be made by the end of January.
<P>

<a name="80115w18.html_para7">Other eligible pensioners will receive a payment of &#163;20 or &#163;10. Where there is only one eligible person in a household, or the eligible person is of no fixed abode, they will receive &#163;20; otherwise, each person will receive &#163;10. It is estimated that nearly three and a half million payments will be issued for &#163;20 and almost five million for &#163;10.
<P>

<a name="80115w18.html_para8">Overall, almost ten million payments will be made to over seven million pensioner households this winter, at a cost of around &#163;200 million. The great majority of payments will be made by the end of March.
<P>

<a name="80115w18.html_para9">Information is not held on the method of payment used for heating costs by eligible pensioners, but the announcement that a payment will be made provides certainty that money is coming. Many of the poorest pensioners receive Income Support, or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, and could receive a Cold Weather Payment should there be a spell of very cold weather in their locality.

 We have sought responses from relevant organisations on the best means to translate our objectives for the long-term funding of supported accommodation into a modern, practical and sustainable funding system. Two hundred and six responses were received including 89 from organisations resenting themselves as housing associations or related bodies. The respondents made a number of different observations, which we are considering.
