 The International Monetary Fund (Increase in Subscription) Order 2011 authorises the increase in the UK’s quota contribution limit. This will become effective once two conditions are met.

Secondly, the proposed amendment of the IMF Articles of Agreement on the reform of the Executive Board must have entered into force.

               <i>[holding answer 14 July 2011]:</i> An academy's main source of funding is the General Annual Grant (GAG). The Academy Funding Agreement regulates the way in which the academy may use this funding and specifies that it may only be spent by an academy towards the normal running cost of that academy. An academy is also free to further its educational objects through funding obtained outside state sources such as through charitable donations.</p>

               <a name="stpa_266">

               <a name="11071831000041"> It is right that the funding provided by the state should be used fairly to raise educational standards which will benefit all the pupils in an academy. All academies can of course collaborate with, and learn from, the strong education that the independent sector provides. The Government do not however believe that state funding should be used to advance the education of individual pupils at private schools, but should instead be used to further the academy, and its pupils, as a whole.</p>

                     <sup>(1 )</sup>Teachers are counted once against each subject that they are teaching. Head counts are used, so a teacher teaching French and German would be counted once in each. In the science subjects, the teacher will be counted under the subject as marked on their timetable—if a teacher is marked as teaching physics then they will only be counted under physics, whereas if they are marked as teaching physics and combined/general science they will be counted once against each subject. The 33,300 combined/general science teachers are teachers with combined/general science on their timetables; the figure does not include physics, biology and chemistry teachers unless they are teaching it as an additional subject and is marked as such on their timetables.

<sup>(5 )</sup>Classics includes classics, classical Greek, classical Hebrew and Latin.

 In order to improve fairness and transparency in the way free early education funding is distributed all local authorities have been required to implement an early years single funding formula from April 2011. Local authorities, in consultation with their Schools Forums, decide how best to distribute 3-16 funding across their locality. This includes setting funding rates for maintained, private, voluntary and independent providers of free early education. Local authorities are required to report on financial expenditure through section 251 returns. Data on individual local authority spend for 2011-12 are not yet available, but will be published later in the year. The Department has undertaken analysis of the rates paid by the 71 pathfinder local authorities that implemented their early years single funding formula from 2010. This analysis includes a breakdown of medium rates per hour by types of provider.</p>

 Figures for the years 2005/06 to 2009/10 are given as follows. Figures for the years 2001/02 to 2004/05 can be provided only at a disproportionate cost. Figures for the years prior to 2001/02 are not available because pupil-level data have only been collected in the School Census since the 2001/02 academic year.</p>

Ahmed Wali Karzai was not directly involved in this work and we expect these institutions to continue their activity.

 Given current circumstances, our consular contingency plans for Syria and Yemen are regularly reviewed and updated in accordance with the latest situation on the ground. For Yemen, our travel advice is quite clear, if people do not leave the country now, while commercial carriers are still flying, it is extremely unlikely that the British Government will be able to evacuate them or provide consular assistance. And for Syria, we have advised that those who choose to remain in Syria, or to visit against our advice should be aware that it is highly unlikely that our embassy would be able to provide a normal consular service in the event of a further breakdown in law and order and increased violent civil disorder. Evacuation options would be limited because of likely communication and travel restrictions. This advice was only given after careful consideration of the threats and difficulties that would face an official Government-led evacuation.</p>

 MONUSCO has recently assisted with the transfer of soldiers accused and convicted of rape. UN Security Council resolution 1991, which the British Government had a significant part in shaping, instructs the UN Peacekeeping Mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (MONUSCO) to act under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, the most robust possible mandate. UNSCR 1991 prioritises the protection of civilians. UNSCR 1991 also emphasises the need to act against sexual and gender based violence, and to help end impunity. We regularly encourage MONUSCO to work closely with the DRC security forces to prevent human rights violations by their members, and ensure the detention and prosecution of those responsible.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 14 July 2011]:</i> I can confirm 12 British nationals were detained on 8 July at Ben Gurion airport. By 13 July, all but one had returned to the UK, with one being allowed to enter Israel. None of them were charged. The legal basis for their detention is a matter for the Israeli authorities, and for the detainees to follow up through their own lawyer should they wish to. However, our travel advice clearly states that travellers to the Occupied Territories may face difficulties on arrival. They were visited four times by consular staff, including a visit by our ambassador to Israel.</p>

 The UK has a strategic relationship with Pakistan, formalised in the Enhanced Strategic Dialogue. This includes a strand under the National Security Dialogue, which focuses on counter-terrorism and other security issues. Our intensive diplomatic efforts, bilaterally, multilaterally, and in concert with key partners such as the US, are complemented by a programme of counter-terrorism assistance to Pakistan. This includes supporting the development of strong institutions and machinery of Government. As part of this co-operation, we have assisted Pakistan's law enforcement and security forces, for example in improving their ability to counter improvised explosive devices (IEDs). However, due to the sensitive nature of counter terrorism projects, we are unable to provide detailed spend figures for our assistance programme.</p>

The second was for the extension of the Digimap system that has been successfully used in Operation Herrick at a cost of £200,000 provided through the reserve.</p>

Self-employed earnings are usually taken from the self-assessment return that is submitted to HM Revenue and Customs, or from a tax calculation notice.

It was anticipated that increased workloads would be temporary and it was always planned to reduce numbers as the growth in unemployment slowed. Jobcentre Plus continues to keep its workloads and staffing levels under close scrutiny. That includes the need to extend Fixed Term Appointments (FTAs). At this point, Jobcentre Plus does not plan to recruit further FTAs and expects to release the majority of existing FTAs during 2011/12 as they reach the end of their fixed term contracts. This will be kept under review.</p>

To ensure an equitable distribution of the benefits, the scheme requires a proportion of the carbon savings be achieved in the homes of 'priority' lower income households (aged 70 and over or on certain means tested benefits). In the first two years of the scheme, between April 2008 and March 2010, 3,861 priority group households in York benefited from subsidised loft and/or cavity wall insulation under the scheme.

 From 1 August a recipient of jobseeker’s allowance or employment and support allowance (work-related activity group) in England may be required by a Jobcentre Plus adviser, or by a provider working on behalf of Jobcentre Plus, to attend work-related education training programmes or careers advice.

The change is intended to improve take-up and completion of work-related training so that lack of basic work skills do not hinder the claimant’s opportunities in the labour market, thus enabling the claimant to find a job and keep it as soon as possible.</p>

For example, even though there were 144,000 redundancies, overall employment during the period March to May 2011 rose—by 50,000—because the numbers moving into jobs exceeded the numbers that left—including those made redundant.</p>

The redundancy payments made by the service to ex employees of insolvent employers during the period Apr 2009 to March 2010 amounted to £270,012,000.</p>

 The estimate of numbers lifted out of poverty are based on an assessment of the impact of universal credit using DWP’s Policy Simulation Model. This model uses data from the 2008-09 Family Resources Survey (FRS) and uprates incomes and demographics to the relevant year using projections from the Office for Budget Responsibility. The model is able to assess entitlement to universal credit, because of the wide range of personal characteristics reported to the FRS by respondents.</p>

 It is still too early to say how many staff, and what skills and experience will be required for universal credit. Decisions about TUPE and redundancy cannot be made until there is much more definition around the specific roles required to deliver the new universal credit. Although it is anticipated that fewer staff will be required compared to the legacy benefits, it is too early to say which staff and organisations will be affected. The impact on local authority staff will be affected by the design of the council tax benefit replacement, and decisions about the delivery model for universal credit.</p>

 DEFRA's policy on appraisal requires flood management authorities in all areas to value agricultural land and the damages that could occur to food production as a result of flooding and coastal erosion in line with HM Treasury guidance. Specific guidance was provided by DEFRA in 2008, based on HM Treasury Green Book appraisal principles. This is in line with the approach taken to the valuation of other assets. The guidance allows authorities to recognise the different kinds of agricultural output in flood and erosion risk areas and their different values. For example, it highlights the value of specialist salad crops in the Fens and the fact these are less viable to grow elsewhere.</p>

 The Government's policy is that the best available evidence should be used to identify sites and conservation objectives. This policy is set out in the Government's Guidance Note 1 on the Selection and Designation of Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs), to which the Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies (SNCBs) and Marine Conservation Zones Regional Projects are working. The evidence used in the regional project process includes data supplied by national contracts, with regionally and locally sourced data, and expert knowledge. Ministers want to make sound decisions on sites to take forward for designation, so we have, and will continue, to ensure quality assurance processes are put in place.</p>

 The Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies' Ecological Network Guidance to the Regional Projects describes the requirements for an ecologically coherent network, including those habitats and species of conservation importance considered to be most appropriately protected using Marine Conservation Zones.

We will continue to develop bespoke management measures for vulnerable mobile species, such as acoustic deterrents to reduce dolphin by-catch and fisheries protection for endangered sharks. All naturally occurring wild birds, including seabirds, are protected by the provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 and the Offshore Marine Conservation (Natural Habitats, etc.) Regulations 2007. This legislation transposes the EC wild birds directive and, in particular, prohibits the deliberate killing or taking of wild birds and provides for the classification of special protection areas for birds in both English and UK waters.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 18 July 2011]:</i> The Environment Agency’s policy and operational rules for Denver Sluice are to maximise the available flow so that it can discharge through the sluices at all times. These flows help to reduce the siltation of the Tidal River downstream of the Denver Sluice. This is line with the Great Ouse Tidal River Strategy recommendations and has been found to be the most efficient, sustainable and cost-effective way of managing the build-up of silt in the Tidal River.</p>

                     <i>Notes:</i>
1. Alcohol-related admissions.
The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO), which uses 48 indicators for alcohol-related illnesses, determining the proportion of a wide range of diseases and injuries that can be partly attributed to alcohol as well as those that are, by definition, wholly attributable to alcohol. Further information on these proportions can be found at:
www.nwph.net/nwpho/publications/AlcoholAttributableFractions.pdf
The application of the NWPHO methodology has recently been updated and is now available directly from HES. As such, information about episodes estimated to be alcohol related may be slightly different from previously published data.
2.PCT/SHA data quality.
In July 2006, the NHS reorganised strategic health authorities (SHAs) and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England from 28 SHAs into 10, and from 303 PCTs into 152. As a result data from 2006-07 onwards is not directly comparable with previous years. Data has been presented for those SHA/PCTs which have valid data for the breakdown presented here. As a result some SHA/PCTs may be missing from the list provided. See the following table.
It should be noted that in 2005-06; Craven, Harrogate and Rural District PCT, Hambleton and Richmondshire PCT, Scarborough, Whitby and Ryedale PCT and Selby and York PCT merged to form North Yorkshire and York PCT of residence.
3. SHA/PCT/LA of residence.
The SHA, PCT or LA containing the patient's normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another area for treatment.
4. Assessing growth through time.
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.
5. Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis.
These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a HES record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.
6. Data quality.
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.

 Strict quality assurance operates across the NHS breast screening programme at a cost of £5 million per year. The aim of quality assurance in the programme is to maintain standards and continued improvement in the performance of all aspects of breast screening in order to ensure that women have access to a high quality service wherever they live. In line with the update on ‘Healthy Lives, Healthy People’, breast screening quality assurance will become the responsibility of Public Health England from 1 April 2013.</p>

To support the national health service to develop the CNS work force, ‘Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer’ sets out our intention to build the evidence base for the benefits and costs savings that CNSs can offer. This follows an independent report we published in December 2010 that showed that, in many scenarios, the costs of additional support roles are likely to be outweighed by the savings that can be achieved. The 2010 Census of Cancer Specialist Nurses in England reported that there were 2,164.2 whole-time equivalents CNSs in the 28 English cancer networks, of which 400.37 worked in breast cancer.

Umbilical cord blood collected for the NHS Cord Blood Bank is part of a strategically agreed programme to increase the number of stem cell units available to transplant centres. It complements the work on adult donation carried out through the United Kingdom bone marrow registries. An important aim of the NHS Cord Blood Bank is to help redress the current inequality experienced by sections of the population, mainly from black or mixed parentage backgrounds, when looking for a suitable adult donor on bone marrow registries. For this reason, collection sites are located in areas with high ethnic diversity and high delivery rates. As a consequence, approximately 40% of donations in the NHS Cord Blood Bank derive from ethnic minority mothers. All the cord blood units stored in the NHS Cord Blood Bank are available to national health service patients across the country.</p>

               <a name="1107193000428"> The MRC does not routinely record expenditure on research relating to umbilical cord blood research as a separate category. Projects involving research on umbilical cord blood cells are primarily categorised as adult stem cell research. The MRC's expenditure in all areas of stem cell research is detailed in the following table, and umbilical cord research will be a subset of the adult stem cell expenditure. In its records, the MRC classifies stem cell research as either adult or embryonic. This is because stem cells derived from an embryo are truly pluripotent, which means that each cell has the potential to become any type of cell that makes up the whole organism. Stem cells from other sources, including the umbilical cord, are multipotent so they have the potential to become a range of other cell types but not necessarily all cell types found in the adult.</p>

                     <i>Notes</i>:
1. The new headcount methodology for 2010 data is not fully comparable with previous years data due to improvements that make it a more stringent count of absolute staff numbers, Further information on the headcount methodology is available in the Census publication. Headcount totals are unlikely to equal the sum of components.
2. Data quality. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality. Where changes impact on figures already published, this is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses.

 The development of this guidance was suspended because of the overlap with National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on Pregnancy and Complex Social Factors (CG110) issued in September 2010. This guidance addressed the additional antenatal needs of women in vulnerable groups, including young women under 20, with a view to improving outcomes and reducing mortality. This group of young women under 20 was the proposed focus of the suspended guidance. We will review the need for additional NICE guidance in the context of “Healthy Lives, Healthy People” (Cm 7985) and further policy development around infant, maternal and child health.</p>

 Aside from the inclusion alongside general practitioners of at least one registered nurse and a doctor who is a secondary care specialist, we do not intend to prescribe in detail the wider clinical professional membership of commissioning groups' governing bodies. We agree with the NHS Future Forum's report that it would be unhelpful for clinical commissioning groups' governing bodies to be representative of every professional clinical group. The prime purpose of a governing body should be to take key decisions and make sure that clinical commissioning groups have the right systems in place to do their job well. These systems will ensure they involve the full range of health and care professionals in commissioning.</p>

For example, we will strengthen existing duties on clinical commissioning groups to secure professional advice and ensure this advice is from a full range of health professionals where relevant. Clinical commissioning groups will also receive expert support and advice from clinical networks and senates on the design and delivery of services.</p>

 The measure of patrol refers only to time when an officer is patrolling but engaged in no other duty. Activity (such as advice to a member of the public) carried out while on patrol is recorded separately. The percentage of time spent on patrol therefore appears low and it is misleading to look at this element in isolation from other activities. Under this measure, officers spent 13.8% of their time on patrol in 2007-08 (the last year for which data is available) compared with between 13.6% and 15.3% in the four preceding years.</p>

It is equally important to work with developing countries to build government capacity to manage data, share data and apply analysis to planning decisions. Loss of forests often comes about as a result of poor governance, which results in illegal land clearance and illegal logging. To this end the UK Government are also working with a number of key forest nations to bring about improvements to forest governance.</p>

 DFID sees building long-term resilience into national agricultural systems as key in reducing the effects of potential food crisis in the horn and across the whole of Africa. It is for this reason the UK Government provided a £10 million grant to the African Union’s Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) to boost agricultural productivity and improve resilience to food insecurity in Africa. CAADP is working with the national agricultural systems in Ethiopia and Kenya, among other African countries, to define strategies for halving hunger and achieving increases of 6% in agricultural growth each year through policy reform and better investment. For example, latest figures we have from 2009 show that annual agricultural growth rates were 6% in Ethiopia and 3% in Kenya.</p>

 The electricity market reforms are focused on achieving the investment we need to deliver the secure, affordable and low-carbon electricity we need. EMR does not specifically focus on the uptake of electric vehicles, however, the reforms set out in the White Paper will ensure that the electricity generation is in place to support their use. It is anticipated that electrification of the heat, transport and other carbon intensive sectors may lead to a doubling of overall electricity demand by 2050.</p>

 The reforms put forward in the Electricity Market Reform White Paper will facilitate a green economy, with long-term economic and sustainable growth, and are complementary to policies such as Green Deal. The EMR White Paper and impact assessment provide more details to demonstrate how that the proposed policies will lead to more investment in the electricity generation sector, enabling investment in electricity generation and transmission of around £110 billion by 2020. EMR will lead to higher revenue certainty for low-carbon generators, hence enabling not only new sources of finance but also lower costs of financing.</p>

 The Electricity Transmission System Operator Incentive Scheme is a matter for the independent energy regulator, Ofgem, in their role of regulating the monopoly companies which run the gas and electricity networks. The consultation on proposed changes to the incentive scheme closed on 8 July. Ofgem is currently in the process of finalising its position, which it will publish soon. While this is an important issue, it is one suited to the regulator to deal with due to its technical nature, concerning the detail of economic regulation. Therefore, while the Department is tracking developments, it is not actively involved in the details of the process.</p>

 This is not the case. We have commissioned the British Standards Institute (BSI) to develop a Green Deal Installer Standard with industry by the end of this year. This will bring together the existing standards and develop new ones where necessary. We will then use the UK Accreditation Service (UKAS) to provide independent accreditation of the existing certification bodies to ensure they are meeting this standard. Once a certification body has been accredited, those installers certified by that body will automatically be deemed as meeting the new BSI standard and will be able to use the Green Deal quality mark and supply into the market.</p>

 As a party to the United Nations convention on the law of the sea, the United Kingdom has an obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment. The national contingency plan for marine pollution from shipping and offshore installations (NCP) is one of the measures the UK has taken to meet this obligation and the Department for Transport’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is the custodian of this plan. The NCP’s purpose is to ensure there is a timely and measured response to an oil pollution incident.</p>

Therefore, the MCA may need to use national assets in the response to a marine pollution incident. The NCP sets out the circumstances in which MCA deploys the UK’s national assets to respond to a marine pollution incident to protect the overriding public interest. It also describes how MCA manages these resources.</p>

 There are no immediate plans to introduce mutual recognition of concessionary bus passes across the UK. Concessionary travel is a devolved policy area so the arrangements differ between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Concessionary Bus Travel Act 2007 contains a power to allow, through future regulations, for mutual recognition of bus passes across the UK. Regular discussions have taken place at official level with the devolved Administrations. However, various technical and resource issues would need to be resolved before mutual recognition could be pursued. Individual local authorities on the England-Wales border are free to introduce arrangements between them to enable concessionary travel across the border, and some indeed have.</p>

 The Department did not use any consultants in the development of the new Strategic Framework for Road Safety. The Transport Research Laboratory provided updated forecasts and analysis at a cost of £14,091.52. There was a consultation exercise with stakeholders in the form of a series of workshops that were hosted and run, on behalf of the Department, by the Parliamentary Advisory Council on Transport Safety. The total cost of these was £6,360.32, which included the production of several think pieces and summaries following the events. 100 hard copies of the document were printed in-house. Due to the nature of the contract it is not possible to quantify the cost of an individual print job, but this was the least cost approach. The rest of the development work was undertaken by permanent members of staff as a part of their general road safety work. It is not possible to quantify this cost but as an illustration there was approximately one full time member of staff developing the document for nine months, with input from many others throughout the process.</p>

 12 statutory instruments that impose costs on businesses, charities or the voluntary or public sector were made by the Department for Transport in the six months prior to 1 September 2010. Eleven were made by the Department under the last administration. Of the 12, six imposed an overall net cost.

 The term ‘road rage’ is used to cover a wide range of aggressive behaviour when one road user assaults another or threatens another due to their behaviour on the road. Unless a serious incident takes place the police do not become involved, and therefore no record of the number of incidents exists.</p>

               <a name="11071951000530"> Contributions towards ‘road rage’ incidents include motoring offences for which the road user may be prosecuted under road traffic offences. The Government’s Strategic Framework for Road Safety includes a proposal to introduce a fixed penalty notice for careless driving, expected to start in 2012. This would allow more people to be offered rehabilitative education to combat behaviour such as ‘tail-gating’, which itself is at times unofficially described as ‘road rage’.</p>

 HS2 Ltd estimate that around 9,000 jobs would be created to construct the new London-West Midlands route, with a further 1,500 permanent jobs created in operations and maintenance. These figures would significantly rise under the Government's proposed ‘Y’ shaped high speed rail network which includes links to the north-east and north-west, and has the potential to generate benefits worth £44 billion over the appraisal period.</p>

The structure of regulation in the rail industry, the structure of franchises and the impact of competition from other rail operators (and indeed from air operators) could all affect the fares structures that might eventually be put in place on high speed trains. For the purposes of the economic case we have assumed that the level of fares on HS2 would be broadly similar to that currently in place on the West Coast Main Line.</p>

 The role of the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) is to conduct investigations into the types of accident or incident that the industry is obliged to notify us about, which are defined in the Schedules to the Railways (Accident Investigation and Reporting) Regulations 2005.</p>

               <a name="11071951000768"> The event on 4 June 2011 at Burnham occurred after the signaller at Slough had authorised a train to pass signal DM20 at danger. During the previous day, there had been signal failures caused by vandalism between Taplow and Burnham and work continued during the morning of the 4th to repair the problems which had led to some signals in the area being held at red.</p>

However, the driver correctly applied the Rule Book procedure and ensured that the train proceeded slowly and was able to stop well short of the train ahead, without the use of emergency braking. Consequently, while the trains where physically in relatively close proximity (circa 100 yards), they were not at risk of collision. Under these circumstances, the event was not notifiable to the RAIB according to the legislation.</p>

 Prevention of rail crimes is a matter for the British Transport police (BTP). Cable theft is a crime which hits the railway particularly hard and causes levels of disruption out of all proportion to the value of the material stolen. That is why the BTP is in the forefront of efforts to tackle the problem, working with, Network Rail, the train operators, other police forces, the scrap metal industry and others with an interest. In addition, I recently met with interested parties in the rail industry to discuss this problem.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> Number of incidents which caused delay to the operational network. It does not include thefts from depots, engineering sites or redundant cable.
<sup>(2)</sup> Delay minutes show the inconvenience experienced by the passenger and vary with each incident. If the theft is on a busy mainline then they rack up much quicker than on quieter suburban lines. Delay per incident is decreasing as Network Rail teams become more efficient at locating and fixing the problem.
<sup>(3)</sup> Compensation costs (known as schedule 8 costs) are paid to train and freight operators for the disruption caused by the delay. This is a substantial part of the cost to the industry of cable theft but does not include the cost of staff time to repair and replace the cable, replacement cable itself and the cost of mitigation measures such as security patrols and investment in new technology. The amount of compensation paid depends on the type of services delayed.
<sup>(4)</sup> Total cost comprises schedule 8 (compensation to train operators), as well as the average cost of replacement cable; average maintenance cost of attending to the fault and average opportunity cost of diverting this labour from elsewhere. This figure is only available as a national figure as it is an estimation based on averages.

               <i>[holding answer 5 July 2011]:</i> The requirements of EU law mean that Ministers are not permitted to discuss the details of individual bids for contracts before they are awarded. The Invitation to Tender produced in 2008 specified the evaluation criteria by which bids for the Thameslink contract would be judged. The Secretary of State for Transport, my right hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr Hammond) and the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, the right hon. Member for Twickenham (Vince Cable), have subsequently discussed the award of the Thameslink contract and its implications and have jointly written to the Prime Minister outlining their proposals for the Growth Review to include consideration of the way EU procurement rules are applied in the UK, a proposal the Prime Minister has agreed to.</p>

 Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service does not routinely keep a record of the sitting time for individual cases. To obtain the information where sitting times have been recorded would be at disproportionate cost because each case file would need to be checked manually to establish whether a sitting time had been recorded.

               <b>Mr Djanogly:</b>
 The Legal Services Commission (LSC) has been working closely with Immigration Advisory Service (IAS) for some time now following an audit which raised concerns around the company’s financial management and claims irregularities and as such, the Trustees of the IAS decided that the organisation had to enter into administration on 8 July 2011.</p>

               <a name="11071951001453"> The primary concern for the Government and the LSC now is to ensure clients of IAS continue to get the help they need. The LSC expects that the administration of IAS will allow a managed close down process of IAS's activities and an orderly transfer of clients to new providers. Provisional arrangements have been made to ensure that any emergency cases are dealt with speedily.</p>

               <a name="11071951001454"> Meanwhile the LSC is identifying alternative advice provision in the areas affected and arrangements for case transfer will follow as soon as possible. Three IAS hub centres will be kept open for the moment: in Manchester, Birmingham and Bradford which will help facilitate the transfer of these cases.</p>

These claims will be set off against any sum that is confirmed as being owed to the LSC as a result of the Contract Compliance Audit, which has not yet concluded.</p>

 The starting point for our consideration has been to examine, from first principles, which issues should attract public funding in the light of the financial constraints. In reaching our proposals, we have taken into account our domestic, European and international legal obligations, including the European Convention on Human Rights, and have also taken into account the importance of the issue at stake in the case, the litigant's ability to present their own case, the availability of alternative sources of funding and the availability of other routes of resolution. Our impact assessment shows that based on cases funded in 2009-10 we intend to retain approximately 390,000 acts of assistance within scope of the civil legal aid scheme.</p>

 For cases retained within the scope of the civil legal aid scheme, children and adults will have access to legal aid, subject to the usual tests of financial means and the merits of the case. We have announced our intention to retain legal aid for children for family proceedings. This will primarily be where the judge decides that it is in the best interests of the child for them to be separately represented from the other parties in the case (usually their parents).</p>

This will allow funding to be granted in individual excluded cases where failure to provide funding would amount to a breach of the individual's rights to legal aid under the Human Rights Act 1988 or EU law. In considering whether exceptional funding should be granted we will take into account the ability of the client to present their own case, the complexity of the issues, the importance of the issues at stake and all other relevant circumstances. In the vast majority of civil cases, parents will be bringing proceedings on behalf of their children as their litigation friend. Where children are acting without a litigation friend, this would be taken into consideration in deciding whether they had the ability to present their own case.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> Before October 2007 it was possible to report only one matter in family legal help e.g. children or domestic violence. The new way of recording allows the Legal Services Commission (LSC) to record multiple matters. So advice involving both children and domestic violence can now be recorded as such. Whereas it would have been domestic violence or children before.

 The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) does not hold that information. When people apply for criminal injuries compensation they are asking CICA to assess what happened to them, decide whether they are eligible for compensation and, if so, how much. Injury descriptions, from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme's ‘tariff of injuries’, are used as the primary basis for paying compensation so they are only reliably recorded once CICA have assessed someone as eligible to receive the compensation payable for that injury. Similarly, since payments are based on injuries and not crimes, CICA does not hold figures for how many people apply following a specific crime or type of crime.</p>

The agreements contain institutions plans for investment in activities to widen access through programmes such as summer schools, scholarships and fee waivers, estimated to reach more than £600 million annually by 2015.</p>

               <b>Mr Willetts:</b>
 Universities and schools have learned a lot from the Aimhigher programme about “what works” in raising the aspirations of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Much of this knowledge is now embedded in the sector. However, while there has been some progress in improving access to higher education, overall this has masked a position where institutions and courses that offer the greatest lifetime benefits to their graduates have failed to reflect the wider social mix of our country.</p>

<i>Notes:</i>
1. The start date and planned end date entered on to the ILR reflect the length of the apprenticeship programme applicable to an individual learner and is based on a number of factors including the needs of the employer, which is agreed at the outset with them, the individual apprentice and the training provider.
In issuing apprenticeship frameworks, each issuing authority (typically sector skills councils) will determine the ‘normal’ length of stay. For many intermediate apprenticeships this is 12 months or 52 weeks, and for advanced programmes it is generally in excess of 12 months.
2. All figures are rounded to the nearest 10 except for total figures which are rounded to the nearest 100.
3. Figures for 2010/11 cover August 2010 and April 2011 and are provisional. It is not possible to directly compare provisional 2010/11 estimates against final full year 2009/10 figures.

 In accordance with the commitment set out in the Department's “Structural Reform Plan<sup>(1)</sup>”, the Department is in the process of finalising draft English apprenticeship alternative completion conditions regulations intended to provide flexibility for the delivery of apprenticeships in specific occupations not only in the digital and creative Industries but also in set crafts, maritime occupations and photo imaging, where self-employment and unpaid work are the predominant and accepted mode of employment. These are on track to be completed by the end of July 2011 .and we hope to be in a position to lay the draft regulations before Parliament in September.</p>

This is the same population used for the 65,000 estimate of the AAB population in 2012/13 quoted in the Higher Education White Paper.</p>

 The Higher Education Funding Council for England's consultation document states that creating a margin of 20,000 students would amount to an average reduction of approximately 8% to the student number control of all institutions with an Access Agreement with the Office for Fair Access. Reductions of 40,000 and 60,000 would therefore be approximately 16% and 24% respectively.</p>

 The matched funding was intended as a time limited scheme to incentivise universities to improve their fund raising efforts. We are fully funding the £115 million required for the third and final year and expect the total Government contribution of £200 million to have leveraged an additional £400 million in donations to higher education institutions. The 2011 Budget also announced a number of measures that will encourage private giving in the higher education sector, including, a 10% cut in inheritance tax for estates leaving at least 10% to charities. This has been warmly welcomed by the sector.</p>

 This information is not held in the form requested. However, it is possible to provide notional figures for the amount of grant distributed by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) for teaching and research apportioned by the number of learners (full-time equivalent) in each year. It should be noted that there have been some significant changes in HEFCE's funding methodology over this period which means that the following table should not be read as a time series. HEFCE funding is one source of income only and the figures provided do not include income from fees. In addition the data do not take account of other sources of public funding, for example from the NHS or the research councils. Crucially it should be borne in mind that institutions have a significant degree of freedom in terms of how its grant is distributed internally. It is for that reason that the figures given are notional and should not be read as the actual level of resource attached to any particular learner.</p>

<i>Notes</i>:
UG/PGT
'Funds' for UG and PGT are standard resource minus assumed fees, plus widening access and improving retention funding.
'FTEs' are Home and EU HEFCE-funded, excluding non-completions.
Funding for non-mainstream FTEs has been excluded.
PGR
Figures include proportionately small amounts of transitional funding for PGR students.
For the years in which the mainstream QR quality threshold differed from the PGR supervision fund threshold, the student numbers in this analysis include the larger of the eligible student totals.
In the early years some notional teaching grant is included in the funding amounts.

 The Inter-Departmental Ministerial Group (IDMG) on Human Trafficking—which this Department is not represented on—co-ordinates work on trafficking across Government. The group brings together Ministers from key Departments to provide oversight and to strengthen our efforts to tackle human trafficking by ensuring that input and expertise from all Departments is shared.</p>

                     <i>Notes on MRC data:</i>
1. The data presented for (b) other Masters excludes any studentships where a Masters has been funded as part of doctoral study.
2. The data presented under (c) other doctoral training were clinically trained students funded as Clinical Research Training Fellows.
3. All of the data presented above excludes studentships at MRC funded Centres. In 2008/09 there were a total of 226 students undergoing doctoral training in MRC funded Centres. This figure includes existing and new students. The MRC does not have data available for any other years.
4. Data for 2010/11 is not yet available.
5. The number of studentship places funded by the MRC is subject to annual review, hence there are no figures given in the second table. At present MRC have no plans to significantly increase or decrease funding for PhD or Research Masters Studentships.
<i>Note on BBSRC data:</i>
All Masters students are included in “Other Masters”. Separate figures are not available for Taught and Research Masters. PhD studentship numbers for the last three years are estimates from data based on returns provided by awarded institutions.
<i>Note on EPSRC data:</i>
EPSRC only supports Masters level training when it aligns with their broader strategy. For this reason, in 2009 they decided to focus most of their support in this area on activities which employ Masters—level training as a means of developing highly skilled doctoral—level researchers, rather than those which view the provision of Masters graduates as an end in itself. As a result, their current support for Masters level training is delivered via the Centres for Doctoral Training, Doctoral Training Accounts and some courses in Mathematical Sciences (e.g. Statistics). Not all of these routes provide students with a formal Masters qualification so it would be difficult to be definitive about numbers over a specific period.
<i>Note on ESRC data:</i>
ESRC funds a mix of 3 year PhD and 1 year + 3 years Masters + PhD awards. The total amount of these awards is included under section (c) PhD for the previous and next three years. ESRC are unable to disaggregate these figures further in the time available without use of disproportionate resources, however they estimate that 60% of the awards are of the 1+3 type. Under section (b) Other Masters, they have included a strategic initiative where we fund standalone Masters to build research capacity in Demography.
<i>Note on NERC data:</i>
NERC does not differentiate between MSc and MRes, so all places listed as other masters.
<i>Notes:</i>
1. The year presented relates to an academic year i.e. 2008/09 relates to students starting in October 2008.
2. The data does not take in to account any funds leveraged by HEIs to increase the total number of studentship places available.
3. Figures for the next three years are estimates and hence the actual numbers may vary from those given above. If universities choose to support part—time students and fees—only students, and/or match research council funding with that from other sources, then more students will be able to be supported; PhD students may also be supported by larger Research Grants from some councils.
