<a name="91221w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government are committed to the rapid development of e-commerce in the UK. Our policy is to make the UK the best place in the world for e-commerce by 2002. To help us achieve this, the Prime Minister commissioned the Cabinet Office Performance and Innovation Unit, in January this year, to undertake a project that would recommend how this can be achieved. Their report--"e-commerce@its.best.uk"--was launched by the Prime Minister on 13 September. All 60 recommendations have been accepted by the Government.
<P>

<a name="91221w01.html_para0">In November 1998 the Chancellor of the Exchequer set up an independent review of the UK retail banking market, chaired by Don Cruickshank. In line with the recommendations in "e-commerce@its.best.uk", the issues under consideration by Don Cruickshank include the involvement of banks in payments made over the Internet. They expect to publish the results of their work in February 2000.

 The recent Audit Commission report: "Measure for Measure: the Best Value Agenda for Trading Standards Services" confirmed the Government's analysis, as set out in the White Paper: "Modern Markets: Confident Consumers" (Cmnd 4410), that the quality and availability of consumer advice varies across the country. The White Paper outlined our proposals to ensure that people have easier access to high quality advice. The Government will promote the development of a joined-up approach to the provision of advice through CABx, local authorities and independent advice agencies, linking with the Community Legal Service.

<P>
<a name="91221w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 There are no direct operating EU-funded subsidies available to Worcestershire businesses. However, a number of grant schemes, each with specific purposes, operate with EC approval and some are supported in part by EU funds. The most significant to firms in Worcestershire are: Regional Selective Assistance, which is available in the Redditch and Bromsgrove areas; local schemes delivered as part of the Marches Objective 5b programme, which covers some western parts of the county; and SMART, which operates throughout the county.
<P>

<a name="91221w02.html_para4">Three offers of Regional Selective Assistance were made to firms in Worcestershire during the 1998 calendar year and the 1998-99 financial year. The total amount of grant aid offered in these cases was &#163;137,000.
<P>

<a name="91221w02.html_para5">It is estimated that Worcestershire companies benefited from ERDF funding of approximately &#163;250,000 and ESF funding of approximately &#163;75,000 through the Marches Objective 5b programme in 1998. These sums represent grants to individual companies through delegated grant schemes delivered through Business Links and co-financing measures. The ERDF and ESF totals for the financial year 1998-99 were of similar magnitude.
<P>

<a name="91221w02.html_para6">SMART offers totalling &#163;534,384 were made to Worcestershire firms in calendar year 1998 and &#163;428,880 in financial year 1998-99.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on his policy on the export of diphtheria, tetanus and yellow fever vaccines for Iraqi children.  [103212]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91221w02.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 December 1999]:</i> While the export from the United Kingdom of diphtheria, tetanus and yellow fever vaccines is not normally subject to control, the export from the UK to Iraq of any goods, unless under authority of an export licence, is prohibited by the Export of Goods (Control) (Iraq and Kuwait Sanctions) Order 1990 [SI 1990/1640], which came into force on 9 August 1990. All applications for a licence to export goods to Iraq are considered very carefully.
<P>

<a name="91221w02.html_para8">Vaccines for yellow fever and diphtheria vaccines are also covered by the Import and Export (ImpEx) mechanism established under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1051. This mechanism requires certain goods, as specified in a UN agreed list, to be subject to special controls, including the monitoring of their end use in Iraq by UNSCOM because they are capable of being used in weapons of mass destruction programmes; tetanus vaccines are not covered by the ImpEx mechanism.
<P>

<a name="91221w02.html_para9">Since UNSCOM officials left Iraq in December 1998, they have been unable to monitor the importation and end use of goods covered by the ImpEx mechanism. Applications for licences to export such goods to Iraq are therefore processed on a case-by-case basis and will be granted only if the Government is satisfied that the particular export would be subject to appropriate controls and monitoring in Iraq.

 Employees or employee representatives who consider that their rights under these Regulations have been infringed may seek legal redress. In 1998-99, the most recent year for which statistics are available, 505 complaints were made to the Employment Tribunals alleging unfair dismissal by reason of a transfer of an undertaking, and 886 alleging breach of the requirements relating to information and consultation of employee representatives about a transfer of an

undertaking. Statistics are not available to show what proportion of these complaints were upheld; some of the cases are still ongoing. Redress for unlawful changes to terms and conditions by reason of a transfer of an undertaking may be sought either from the civil courts or, in certain circumstances, the Employment Tribunals. These are not identified separately from other breach of contract complaints in the available statistics.

<P>
<P>

 The TUPE Regulations, like other aspects of the employment rights legislation, provide for those who consider that their rights have been infringed to seek redress through the Employment Tribunals or, in appropriate cases, the civil courts. The number of cases brought gives an indication of the extent to which private sector employers are observing the Regulations.

 My Department intends to publish shortly a public consultation document setting out detailed proposals for the amendment of these Regulations. The Government's aim in putting forward the proposals will be to improve the Regulations operation and to implement requirements of a revised EC Acquired Rights Directive successfully negotiated last year as a social affairs priority under the UK Presidency. This will be to the benefit of employers, employees and the economy as a whole.

 <i>[holding answer 20 December 1999]:</i> There is no formal timetable. The first step is for consultations between WTO member governments on the way forward. We would hope that the Round could be launched next year or in 2001. In the meantime, we need, as I have said, to press on urgently with reform of WTO processes so that WTO members are able to work more effectively in the preparation, launch and conduct of trade negotiations.

 As I stated in my answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd) on 29 October 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1015W, all individual licences covering the export or transhipment to Indonesia of military goods or technology have been suspended in accordance with the Common Position, adopted on 16 September, by which EU member states decided to impose an arms embargo on Indonesia for four months. In that answer I also stated that, because the embargo is time restricted, the period of validity of the licences concerned has been extended by four months. Accordingly, the licence granted under the previous administration on 22 November 1996 for the export of sixteen 200 series Hawks has been suspended, and its period of validity extended by four months; it will now expire on 24 March 2001.

<a name="91221w03.html_para4">The actual impact on UK companies in the targeted sectors will depend on a number of factors, including the length of time that the retaliatory measures remain in place and the ability of affected companies to find alternative customers for their goods. However, I have received many representations from UK companies affected by the US retaliation, and based upon these representations my assessment is that there is a real risk of damage to British companies in terms of lost trade and jobs.

 On support for environmentally responsible business, my Department is continuing to help business reduce waste in the most cost-effective way, with a five-year and &#163;30 million extension to the joint DTI/DETR Environmental Technologies Best Practice Programme. We are helping to overcome market and technical barriers to increased use of recycled materials with an initial &#163;1.4 million programme as the first stage of a planned bigger joint DTI/DETR initiative. We are also helping business develop the "know-how" to incorporate sustainability in products and processes from design stage through the Sustainable Technologies Initiative, worth &#163;7.8 million over three years.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry raised the quality of information which consumers receive about mortgage products at the summit held with major lenders, consumer groups and regulators on 29 October. Officials will convene a working group next month to look at how mortgage information can be improved. We also published ten key questions consumers should ask to help them choose the best mortgage deal.

 The broad aim of the working group led by Dr. Robert Hawley, Chairman of the Engineering Council, the "Hawley Group", is to review the contribution the Engineering Council should make to add value to the engineering community by improving the effectiveness of existing activities in such areas as the promotion and standards of engineering, building on existing synergies with other organisations.

It is hoped that the Hawley Group can complete this by the end of January 2000. The second stage will be the development of a strategy for achieving these objectives. The intention is to complete this second stage by the end of July 2000.

<P>
<a name="91221w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 My Department continues to provide financial support for project work arising from the Action for Engineering initiative, which promoted co-ordinated action to increase substantially the influence, involvement and achievement of professional engineers for the benefit of British industry. The most notable of these is SETNET (Science Engineering Technology Mathematics Network) which aims to bring coherence to the delivery of the somewhat fragmented range of activities aimed at promoting science, engineering, technology and mathematics to school teachers and pupils. It offers a one-stop shop for independent advice to teachers and industry on a range of issues through its regional network of 28 SETPOINTs. DTI and DfEE have provided SETNET with funding of over half a million pounds over the last three years.

 I am pleased to announce that, following successful negotiations between the Ministry of Defence and BAe Systems, the Ministry of Defence intends to enter into a ten year partnering arrangement with Royal Ordnance for the supply of a wide range of ammunition products produced by Royal Ordnance Weapons and Munitions Ltd. and Royal Ordnance Radway Green. The partnering arrangement will provide Royal Ordnance with a stable work load worth some &#163;100 million per year, and will involve the Ministry of Defence and Royal Ordnance in sharing the costs, risks and benefits over the period of the arrangement.
<P>

<a name="91221w06.html_para3">The agreement is the culmination of hard discussions over the last year. It represents value for money to the taxpayer, while preserving an indigenous ammunition manufacturing capability in the United Kingdom, which will enhance the future security of supply of ammunition for our armed forces. These advantages, which will be

 We have been reviewing the BOWMAN Tactical Communications System project. In accordance with Smart Procurement principles, it is now planned to deliver the system incrementally. As a consequence, initial deliveries of the stand-alone, Personal Role Radio element of BOWMAN should now be possible earlier than previously planned.
<P>

<a name="91221w06.html_para4">The MOD's preferred supplier for BOWMAN is Archer Communications Systems Ltd. (ACSL). Management of ACSL is now vested in BAe Systems who have committed to a radical reinvigoration of the company. ACSL is working under a risk of reduction contract to deliver a viable solution to the BOWMAN requirement. The company's original proposal was too expensive and carried too much risk. Since June, we have, therefore, been working with ACSL to produce an acceptable solution. This will depend in part on efficiencies being achieved by the company.
<P>

<a name="91221w06.html_para5">We now hope to place an implementation contract in late 2000. We cannot yet set a revised in service date, but would expect it to be in late 2003/early 2004.

<a name="91221w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 In his answer of 26 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 434W, my predecessor stated that the strength of the Defence Vetting Agency would be 310 when the Agency collocates at York. The revised position is that the Agency strength immediately following collocation (in early 2001) will be 311.
<P>

<a name="91221w06.html_para6">Of those 311, a total of 130 will be Investigating Officers who currently work from their homes, and will continue to do so. Thus, the number of Defence Vetting Agency staff who will actually be working in Imphal Barracks immediately after collocation is 181.
<P>

<a name="91221w06.html_para7">The total number of civilian staff (including those of the DVA) who will be working at Imphal Barracks in early 2001 will be 430. The balance of 249 are Imphal Barracks staff, employed in various (mainly Army) units.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="91221w07.html_para0">The United Kingdom abandoned its offensive chemical weapons capability in the mid-1950s. In accordance with our obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) the UK has declared to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) eight former chemical weapons production facilities. Of these facilities, four have been destroyed, one is due to be destroyed, one has been approved by the OPCW to be used for purposes not prohibited by the CWC and the remaining two are awaiting similar approval from the OPCW.
<P>

<a name="91221w07.html_para1">In its 1998 Annual Report, the OPCW reported that fifty-nine chemical weapons production facilities had been declared by States Parties as of 31 December 1998. All of these will have to be destroyed unless the States Parties concerned decide to seek approval to use any of the facilities for peaceful purposes under the provisions of the CWC.

 <i>[pursuant to his reply, 9 December 1999, c. 591W]:</i> The agreement on the Ministry of Defence's bilateral concordat with the Welsh Assembly was not reached on 9 December as I stated. However, we have subsequently agreed the Ministry of Defence's concordat with the Cabinet of the Welsh Assembly for Wales. The Concordat sets out the principles governing the bilateral relationship between the Ministry of Defence and the Welsh Assembly. A copy of the Concordat has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

 The percentage of permanent staff in the Home Office, including the Prison Service, recorded as having a disability on 1 April 1999 was 0.6 per cent. More detailed figures are given in the table. Staff with disabilities in the main Home Office are no longer recorded as being "registered" or "unregistered". Information on staff with disabilities is gathered on a

<P>

<a name="91221w08.html_para0">As part of our commitment to the employment of people with disabilities, we use the Employment Service's "Two Ticks" Disability Symbol for external recruitment and for internal selection and promotion boards. We operate a Guaranteed Interview Scheme which guarantees an interview to anyone with a disability as long as they meet the minimum criteria for the post. The recruitment brochure for the Home Office includes details of the scheme. An audio version of this brochure is in preparation for applicants with sight difficulties.
<P>

<a name="91221w08.html_para1">The Home Office is signed up to New Deal. The Government aim to ensure that the particular needs of young people with disabilities who are claiming Job Seekers Allowance are met within the New Deal so that they are able to benefit fully from the opportunities it offers. We have been able on some occasions to offer placements to graduates with disabilities under the 'Workable' scheme. We also provide a disability assessment service for staff to establish what reasonable adjustments can be made by, for example special aids or facilities, to help them participate fully in the work of the Department.
<P>

<a name="91221w08.html_para2">We also take part in the Cabinet Office bursary scheme for staff with disabilities. Under this scheme, we award departmental bursaries, supported by mentoring, to those who are judged to have the potential to reach the feeder grade to the Senior Civil Service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91221w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 There are no plans to introduce a new hardback United Kingdom passport. The burgundy style soft covered passport, introduced in 1988, is machine- readable and in a common format agreed in 1981 with other European Union countries. It also complies with international practice, in particular the International Standards and Recommended Practices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation Convention on International Civil Aviation. Most countries of the world produce passports with a flexible soft cover. The standard format for passports facilitates the passage of many millions of travellers worldwide, enabling speedier progress through passport controls.
<P>

<a name="91221w08.html_para3">Moreover, it would not now be practical to produce a hardback version of the United Kingdom passport. In 1997 the United Kingdom Passport Agency let a 10-year contract for the Security Printing and Systems Ltd. for a more secure version of the soft covered machine readable passport. It would require substantial and expensive re-engineering of the passport manufacturing process to switch to a hardback cover.

 The interim report on the study on the attrition in rape cases was followed by the final report of the study "A Question of Evidence? Investigating and prosecuting rape in the 1990s", which was published on 1 July 1999. The recommendations of the report have contributed to the work of the sex offences review which is looking at the definition of rape and consent, and the "Speaking Up For Justice" programme to improve the treatment of vulnerable or intimidated witnesses.

 The deployment and training of police officers is an operational matter for the chief officer of each force. But it is recognised that victims of sexual abuse and rape need to be treated with special care, and officers chosen to support them have appropriate training and experience.
<P>

<a name="91221w08.html_para6">Experienced Victim Support volunteers receive additional training to enable them to provide the kind of specialised help required by victims of sexual abuse and rape, both at the time the offence is reported and subsequently.

the victim and assailant. Improvements to these systems are in hand. This will, in due course, allow better estimates of domestic assault and may allow different components of a main offence to be classified.
<P>

<a name="91221w09.html_para0">The 1996 British Crime Survey collected information on the prevalence of domestic violence via a computerised self-completion questionnaire. Sexual assault was one component.
<P>

<a name="91221w09.html_para1">Twenty-three per cent. of women aged 16 to 59 reported that they had experienced domestic assault at some time in their lives. Among the women who had been assaulted the percentage who had been forced to have sex at the last assault was eight per cent.

<P>
<a name="91221w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The police service in England and Wales has estimated that the costs of policing the millennium celebrations could be &#163;33 million out of total annual expenditure of over &#163;7 billion. Police authorities are expected to meet this one-off additional expenditure item from within existing budgets and contingency reserves. Police budgets will increase on average by 3.1 per cent. this year. Police authorities will be able to increase their spending power by achieving the 2 per cent. efficiency target that has been set. In cash terms, this represents efficiency gains of around &#163;140 million.

<P>
<a name="91221w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B>

 Prison Service establishments which are overcrowded and the level of overcrowding are listed in the table, based on the definition of overcrowding as being the number of prisoners above the in-use certified normal accommodation (CNA) of the establishment. In-use CNA is the baseline CNA minus places temporarily unavailable, such as damaged cells or those being refurbished. The data are for the month of November and are provisional.

 New short-term prison population projections as at October 1999, and revised long-term projections have been prepared by the Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate.

<P>

<a name="91221w09.html_para5">We are considering the implications for the longer term or if the higher variant projection occurs. It is too soon to say what the consequences for funding might be but the Prison Service budget for 2002-03 and 2003-04 will be determined in the next spending review.

<P>

<a name="91221w10.html_para1">I am pleased to say that the Service has accepted the majority of the recommendations in full. This will mean new procedures governing admission to the units and published standards for their management.

<a name="91221w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 There are now over 10,000 sex offenders registered in England and Wales. This represents a compliance rate of 97 per cent. This compliance rate refers to the number of offenders who have registered their names and addresses with the police. There has been a steady improvement in compliance rates for registration from around 70 per cent. when the Act first came into force in September 1997. This is due to a large extent to the active approach adopted by the police in enforcing the registration system and following up those who have failed to register. The police are working with the Home Office to look at how compliance rates can be improved further.

 Family Court Welfare officers are expected to comply with the National Standards for Probation Service Family Court Welfare work, published in 1994. The Standards, which set out basic standards of good practice, are issued in consultation with the Lord Chancellor's Department, the Department of Health and the Wales Office. Probation Services should ensure that local procedures are instituted to monitor whether the standards are being achieved. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation inspect service performance against the standards.

 We have introduced a Bill to extend further the Race Relations Act 1976 in relation to public authorities and to make chief officers of police vicariously liable for acts of racial discrimination by their police officers; we have responded positively to proposals made by the Commission for Racial Equality and the Better Regulation Task Force to amend the Race Relations Act 1976 and other anti-discrimination legislation; we are implementing an Action Plan published in response to the 70 recommendations made in the report on the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry; targets have been set for the recruitment, retention and career progression of ethnic minority staff in the Home Office and the fire, prison, police, probation and immigration services; and we are currently developing a basket of performance indicators which will be designed to measure improvements in race equality across a range of key public services.

 The Lord Chancellor's Department (LCD), which has responsibility for the courts, is currently reviewing the position of group and representative actions to the courts in England and Wales. The Commission for Racial Equality proposed, in its Third Review of the Race Relations Act 1976, published in April 1998, that the Act be amended to enable a court (or tribunal) to consider a complaint where racial discrimination affects a number of people who wish to bring a group complaint, without the need for each person separately to bring proceedings. The Commission's recommendation is being taken into account as part of the LCD's review. The LCD will be undertaking a public consultation on the Government's proposals early in 2000.

 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is responsible for co-ordinating the international humanitarian effort to support the people of Kosovo through the winter. Their view is that the effort to provide winter accommodation for those who need it is well on target. About 90 per cent. of the planned distribution of emergency repair kits has been completed by United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) and the Office for Disaster Assistance/USAID. The agencies are also distributing firewood, stoves and additional roofing repair and insulating material. UNHCR have identified 19,800 places in community shelter to supplement the accommodation available with 40,000 host families. These measures, together with the provision of winterised tents and prefabricated shelters in some areas, should cover needs.

The Thai authorities administer the camps in close co-operation with UNHCR and NGOs. The refugees themselves are actively involved in implementing the programmes of assistance provided by NGOs. The UK is an important contributor to the Burma Border Consortium, one of the leading NGOs providing food and shelter to refugees. We will continue to pay close attention to the plight of Burmese refugees in Thailand.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91221w15.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 One of our first actions in Government was to commission Sir Donald Acheson to undertake an "Independent Inquiry into Inequalities in Health". Sir Donald's report was published in November 1998. The report clearly identifies the significance of income as one of the wider determinants of health and recommends action to tackle this.
<P>

<a name="91221w15.html_para0">The Government are taking measures to tackle low income. These include the Minimum Income Guarantee, Winter Fuel Payments for Pensioners, Working Families Tax Credit, National Minimum Wage, Sure Start and an increase in Child Benefit. A first annual report, "Opportunity for all--Tackling Poverty and Social Exclusion", was published in September.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91221w15.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 In October 1999, NHS Direct handled 109,000 calls. I expect that by the end of this year, NHS Direct will have helped around 1 million callers since the service began. From December this year, NHS Direct has been extended to cover over 65 per cent. of the population of England. The scope of the service has also been extended by the publication in December of the NHS Direct Healthcare Guide and the launch of NHS Direct on-line. This means that a greater proportion of the population will have access to high quality health care information and advice.

<a name="91221w18.html_para6">The Government's policy is to encourage mast and site sharing, where that is appropriate. Circular 4/99 makes clear our expectation that developers should provide evidence to local planning authorities that they have carefully considered the use of existing masts, buildings and other structures before seeking to erect any new mast, regardless of size. The authority may be justified in refusing prior approval or planning permission if it considers the evidence regarding the consideration of such alternative sites is not satisfactory.

 Sir John Harman will succeed Lord De Ramsey as Chairman on 1 January 2000. Sir John is currently Deputy Chairman of the Agency. The appointment will be for four years.
<P>

<a name="91221w18.html_para9">I am delighted that he has accepted our offer. The Agency plays a central role in protecting and enhancing the environment in England and Wales, and the Chairman must lead in determining the strategic direction, inspire the staff and ensure that it discharges its statutory duties fully.
<P>

<a name="91221w18.html_para10">I believe that in Sir John we have found someone who has the ability and vision which are needed to lead such a major public sector organisation, and to develop a successful relationship with the wide range of bodies that have dealings with the Agency.
<P>

<a name="91221w18.html_para11">I would also like to thank Lord De Ramsey for his contribution in bringing the Agency into being, and for steering it through the early days when it has sought to develop a single corporate approach from the multiplicity of organisations from which it was constructed. The Agency has come a long way since it began work in 1996, and the next few years will set the course for its continuing development.

 <i>[holding answer 20 December 1999]:</i> The saving that PricewaterhouseCoopers identified in their briefing note--&#163;4.5 billion in total over the first 15 years of the PPP, once financing costs are taken into account--assumes that the private sector PPP infrastructure companies will bring an efficiency improvement of 20 per cent.

<P>
<a name="91221w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 I am confident that the public-private partnership--publicly owned, publicly run, and properly financed--is the best way to deliver the improved underground system London needs.
<P>

<a name="91221w19.html_para7">London Transport is today launching a public-private partnership for the sub-surface lines (Circle, District, Hammersmith and City, Metropolitan, East London lines). A notice inviting expressions of interest from prospective bidders will appear shortly in the "Official Journal of the European Communities".
<P>

<a name="91221w19.html_para8">London Transport is also today inviting expressions of interest in a new public-private partnership for the future management of London Underground's non-operational property estate and for property which is surplus to the requirements of the operational railway.
<P>

<a name="91221w19.html_para9">This public-private partnership comprises the disposal of some surplus, non-operational properties, allied to long- term contracts for the provision of property management services and for the future development of non-operational property. Non-operational property includes commercially let property outside the boundaries of the operational railway, car parks, railway arches, office buildings, development sites and areas made available for the generation of non-fare income (e.g. shops, commercial advertising, vending and cash machines) within the operational boundary.
<P>

<a name="91221w19.html_para10">This partnership would enable London Underground to arrange for its non-operational property portfolio more efficiently and to concentrate on its core task of providing transport services throughout the capital. Together with the public private partnerships for the sub-surface and deep tube lines, it will deliver better station facilities and real improvements for passengers.
<P>

<a name="91221w19.html_para11">It is envisaged that negotiations for the partnership will be concluded in line with the sub-surface and deep tube line public- private partnerships.

The Underground PPP proposals are expected to generate &#163;8 billion new investment in the Underground over the next 15 years.

<a name="91221w19.html_para13">We will publish the methodology underlying the Public Sector Comparator before contracts for the London Underground public-private partnership are signed. The comparative cash values of the Comparator will then be released after negotiations have been completed. To publish these results any earlier would expose the taxpayer's negotiating position and jeopardise our chances of getting best value.

[103009]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91221w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The privatisation reference was to make explicit the implicit point that a long process which started under British Rail ownership continued under other ownership. On the second point, there have been no references to Ministers. Ministers have no involvement in the statutory approval process for track layout or safety rules. They are the responsibility of the independent Health and Safety Commission and Executive and Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate.

 I represented the UK at the Environment Council in Brussels on 13 December 1999, accompanied by Sarah Boyack, Scottish Executive Minister for the Environment and Transport. Three common positions were agreed, along with one set of Council Conclusions.
<P>

<a name="91221w20.html_para2">Agreement was achieved on a Recommendation on minimum standards for environmental inspections in member states, and will apply to environmental inspections of installations regulated under Community law. This will help improve standards of environmental protection and contribute to the effective implementation and enforcement of Community law. A common position was also reached on the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive, which requires an assessment of the environmental effects of certain plans and programmes prepared and/or adopted by public authorities.
<P>

<a name="91221w20.html_para3">Ministers discussed several air quality measures and reached agreement on one, establishing limit values for carbon monoxide and benzene in ambient air, to be achieved by 2005 and 2010 respectively. These will provide a high level of protection for public health and the environment and are in line with those adopted by the World Health Organisation in 1996. Agreement on an amendment of the 1998 Large Combustion Plant Directive was not reached. The Commission proposal sets limit values for emissions from new plant. Council could broadly agree to that proposal, but was divided over the suggestion from some member states of extending the directive's requirements to pre-1987 plants. Further negotiations on this, in parallel with those on the National Emission Ceilings Directive, are likely to be continued by the forthcoming Portuguese Presidency. The Presidency also reported on progress on the proposed National Emission Ceilings Directive and a related air quality directive setting target values for ozone in ambient air.

 The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES) provides grants for energy efficiency improvements in the homes of people on benefits, the disabled and the over-60s. On 29 September 1999 the Deputy Prime Minister announced that the scheme is being radically improved. The New Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (New HEES) will provide complete packages of insulation and heating improvements up to a maximum grant of &#163;2,000, compared to the current maximum of &#163;315. Installations will start in June 2000. In the first two years New HEES is expected to help 460,000 households at a cost of &#163;260 million. These households should be substantially moved away from fuel poverty.
<P>

<a name="91221w20.html_para6">We have also released substantial additional funds to help improve our housing stock; in total some &#163;5 billion is being made available over the lifetime of this Parliament for investment in housing. We estimate that around one third of the money is likely to lead directly or indirectly to improvements in energy efficiency.
<P>

<a name="91221w20.html_para7">The Government have introduced a wide range of programmes to tackle low income and poor energy efficiency, which are the main causes of fuel poverty, as well as the liberalisation of the energy markets which has lead to significant falls in the cost of keeping warm. An inter-ministerial group, chaired jointly by the Minister for Energy and my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, has been set up to consider the impact of all these initiatives on fuel poverty. The group will seek to develop a more accurate picture of the extent of the problem, how quickly it can be addressed, and at what cost, so that a target date can be set for the elimination of fuel poverty in England.
<P>

<a name="91221w20.html_para8">Some of the policy initiatives in this area, such as the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme, are devolved functions. Therefore a target date for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would be a matter for the respective bodies.

 The Committee has a programme of three meetings in 2000, but the first of these is not until 16 March. We do not therefore yet have agendas set for the meetings, although there are some issues, such as progress against our work programme, that I am sure we will want to discuss. The Committee takes one general cross-cutting theme at each of its meetings and has in the past considered issues such as biodiversity and green taxes. It is possible that the New Deal Environment Task Force might feature on a future agenda. The Government have taken steps to evaluate the impact of the Task Force, but the analysis is not yet available.

 A warning is issued to Authorised Examiners for shortcomings in the testing requirements, but the standard of testing remains acceptable within the scheme. It would be inappropriate, therefore, to release details of warnings issued. When an Authorised Examiner is withdrawn from the MOT testing scheme, they are required to remove all signs and documentation connected with the MOT scheme which gives a clear indication that the garage is not authorised to carry out MOT tests. Authorised Examiners cannot normally reapply for authorisation within a period of five years. To publish the identities of Authorised Examiners withdrawn from the scheme could be prejudicial to any of their other business interests unconnected with the MOT testing scheme and therefore a list of those withdrawn from the scheme is not published. There are about 18,500 private garages authorised as MOT testing stations. The number of Authorised Examiners withdrawn from the scheme in each of the past five years and the number of warnings issued in the same period are shown in the table.

 There are no central records of street works reinstatements or of inspections of works. So far as individual sites are concerned, it is for the undertaker concerned to put right any defects in reinstating the street that may have occurred. Such defects are likely to be discovered as the result of street works inspections by the local highway authority, who have powers under the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 to require remedial works to be carried out at the undertaker's expense.

 Long sea outfalls have generally been envisaged where sewage received no more than primary treatment before discharge to coastal waters. Some discharges to English coastal waters have been designed to incorporate long sea outfalls, but this is a matter for individual sewerage undertakers and there is no centrally held list. However, the Government's announcements on 23 September 1998 and 1 March 1999 on investment in the water industry introduced a requirement that all wastewater discharges from communities greater than 2,000 population would receive a minimum of secondary treatment. Within the context of this policy, wastewater long sea outfalls are less significant, since secondary treatment provides a high level of environmental protection, whatever the length of the outfall.

 Many of the proposed reforms which my hon.

The proposals to require landlords to consult leaseholders on proposed improvements, and to allow leaseholders to challenge the cost of these at leasehold valuation tribunals would be of particular benefit to public sector leaseholders.
<P>

<a name="91221w22.html_para1">We are also announcing this week two further measures to help public sector leaseholders with high service charges. We will extend the existing Directions requiring local authorities to reduce service charges to include works carried out under the Private Finance Initiative.

<P>
<a name="91221w22.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 A total of &#163;275 million will be provided through the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme for the provision of additional accommodation by registered social landlords (RSLs) in London in 2000-01; the announcement of allocations to local authority areas will be made in February. Increases in the supply of affordable housing will also be funded through local authorities housing capital programmes and can be achieved in a variety of different ways. The 2000-01 Housing Investment Programme (HIP) allocations to London Boroughs announced earlier this month included an earmarked &#163;20 million for an initiative mainly for purchase and repair of existing properties in and around London. The total HIP allocation for London for 2000-01 (&#163;613 million) is over 50 per cent. more than in 1999-2000.

<P>
<a name="91221w22.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Shortly after taking office, the Government made secondary legislation to strengthen the position of households accepted as statutorily homeless. This ensures that accommodation must be available for all homeless acceptances for at least two years and that they must be given reasonable preference in the allocation of long-term social housing.

<a name="91221w22.html_para9">The Government intend to meet their Manifesto commitment to impose a new duty on local authorities to protect those who are homeless through no fault of their own and are in priority need. My Department has set up an official-level sounding board with the local authority associations, Shelter, the Chartered Institute of Housing and other housing organisations, to discuss proposals for further changes to policy on homelessness and the allocation of permanent social housing. Our proposals are still at an early stage, but we shall consult on them widely, in due course.

 We intend to implement the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 as quickly as possible. We consulted earlier this year, jointly with the Public Carriage Office, on the licensing of private hire vehicle operators in London. Having carefully considered the responses, we intend to conduct a further consultation with draft regulations as early as possible next year. Further consultations, also jointly with the Public Carriage Office, will follow on proposals for regulating private hire drivers and vehicles.

 The national public transport information system--the Government's White Paper commitment to an integrated system giving journey planning and timetable information over the telephone--is being funded by transport operators and local authorities. Government have provided Supplementary Credit Approvals to local authorities of &#163;1 million in 1998-99 and &#163;3.3 million in 1999-2000 to assist with the capital requirements of the project.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91221w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 On 11 October we announced our intention to take forward a package of complementary measures aimed at speeding up and improving the home buying and selling process. The package is based on a detailed survey and consultation exercise and studies of experience in other countries. A key proposal is a requirement that before putting a home on the market, the seller or seller's agent should put together a pack of standard documents and information for prospective buyers. This should include copies of title documents, replies to standard buyers' preliminary inquiries, replies to local searches, copies of planning and other consents, copies of warranties and guarantees, a home condition report and a draft contract.
<P>

<a name="91221w23.html_para6">In addition, we want buyers to be better prepared and will be encouraging the wider use of "in principle" mortgage offers. We also want faster mortgage offers and local authority searches and will be asking the service providers to adopt service targets on these. Mortgage lenders are also being asked to provide title deeds within five working days of request and to examine the scope for "chain-breaking" loans. Finally, all the professions and other bodies involved in the home buying and selling process are being encouraged to make better use of advances in information technology to speed up the process.

 Other than in exceptional circumstances, the replacement of lighting columns should be treated as revenue expenditure.

<a name="91221w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Pensions Ombudsman provides an easily accessible service by which pension scheme members and those involved in the running of schemes can raise disputes of fact or law and make complaints of maladministration that have resulted in injustice. He can investigate complaints of injustice caused by maladministration and disputes of fact or law brought by members of pension schemes and their spouses and dependants against trustees managers or employers of those schemes. He can also investigate complaints made by employers against trustees or managers or vice versa, or made by the trustees or managers of one scheme against the trustees or managers of another. Further, he is able to investigate disputes of fact or law referred by employers and trustees or managers of the same scheme or disputes between the trustees or managers of different schemes.




<P>
<P><I>21 Dec 1999 : Column: 544W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91221w25.html_para0">The consultation paper "Strengthening the Pensions Framework" contained proposals to clarify and extend the Ombudsman's remit in respect of certain types of complaint or dispute. These proposals were generally welcomed by those who responded to the consultation. It is intended to bring forward provisions to introduce these changes as soon as is practicable.
<P>

<a name="91221w25.html_para1">A recent Court of Appeal ruling (Thomas Edge & Ors <i>v.</i> The Pensions Ombudsman & Anor) found the Pensions Ombudsman's power of investigation to be limited to those cases where the interests of others not party to the dispute are not affected.
<P>

<a name="91221w25.html_para2">Compliance with the court's determination has the effect of removing certain cases from the Ombudsman's remit. For instance, if a death benefit has been paid to one person (for example a current partner) by the trustees and not to another (for example the legal spouse) the Pensions Ombudsman could not accept a complaint from the legal spouse as it affects the interests of the recipient of the death benefit (who currently cannot be a party) even though the complaint is about the actions of the trustees.
<P>

<a name="91221w25.html_para3">It also means that if groups of members are affected, their cases cannot be considered. For instance, where a complaint relates to the treatment of surplus assets and concerns all the pensioners and all the active members it would be excluded.
<P>

<a name="91221w25.html_para4">The Pensions Ombudsman raised this issue in the light of the potential impact it could have on the types of cases he can investigate. In order to ensure that the Pensions Ombudsman can continue to deal with the range of cases he had dealt with before the 'Edge' decision, changes are required to the procedures under which he conducts his investigations.
<P>

<a name="91221w25.html_para5">These procedures are amended under provisions contained in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill. These provisions address the restriction on the Pensions Ombudsman's power to investigate and determine a complaint or dispute that affects the interests of those not party to the original complaint or dispute. These will ensure an individual can raise an issue with the Pensions Ombudsman if it affects the interests of a group of members in the same scheme. It will also require that those members have the opportunity to put their point of view. In the case of a group of members, this will be via an appointed representative. In effect, therefore, the procedural changes will establish a mechanism for consideration of group or 'class actions'.
<P>

<a name="91221w25.html_para6">Currently, complainants can have costs reimbursed only for attendance at an oral hearing. This process is adequate when an oral hearing is held to ascertain the facts in a case but might not be sufficient where a complaint or dispute raised intricate issues on which the complaining member might need specialist advice. Without the possibility of access to the resources of their scheme, members may be discouraged from taking valid complaints or disputes to the Pensions Ombudsman because of an inability to finance the required advice. There is, therefore, also provision in the Child Support, 



<P>
<P><I>21 Dec 1999 : Column: 545W</I><P>
Pensions and Social Security Bill to order that legal costs be met from the resources of the scheme. It is anticipated that such orders will be made only for complex cases that involve a number of parties.
<P>

<a name="91221w25.html_para7">The Pensions Ombudsman holds oral hearings where the facts of a case are in dispute or where there is an issue concerning the accuracy of evidence. To require mandatory oral hearings in all instances would lengthen the process, make it more costly and adversarial for those involved and, therefore, we do not propose to change the law in this way.
<P>

<a name="91221w25.html_para8">We also do not propose to confer on the Pensions Ombudsman powers concerning the admissibility of documents and evidence and standards of proof comparable to those employed in courts of law. This would run counter to the principle that the Pensions Ombudsman provides an informal process by which individuals can seek to have their grievances addressed.

 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1999]:</i> There is a comprehensive evaluation programme in place for the new deal for young unemployed which will be addressing issues such as this. The impact of the new deal on an individual's employability at each stage is one of the evaluation answers. However, I am advised that precise weighting of the respective benefit of each stage is likely to be difficult. Most evaluation is still in progress and is yet to report. Early evidence suggests a positive effect on outflows of young people from unemployment into jobs. Further quantitative evaluation on the impact of new deal for young unemployed will be published shortly and will be placed in the Library.

 <i>[holding answer 13 December 1999]:</i> The Government welcome all types of business organisation, including co-operatives, which can meet the needs of employers, individuals and customers. This reflects the Government's key objectives of achieving high and stable levels of overall growth and employment, and a flexible and adaptable labour market.
<P>

<a name="91221w26.html_para1">The UK's low inflation and stable macroeconomy, and its policies to promote competition, innovation and enterprise, aim to foster the conditions in which new jobs can be created, whether by co-operatives or by other types of organisation.

<a name="91221w26.html_para2">Through the new deal, we are also forging partnerships with a wide range of non-government organisations, including community based organisations and other intermediaries who can co-operate in the task of helping jobless people back to work. A &#163;5 million fund has also been established to support intermediary organisations in eleven cities, who can demonstrate they have effective links with employers and can help jobless people into work.

 Full information on the performance in 1999 of schools and FE sector colleges in England was published recently in this year's school and college performance tables. The results in the tables show a clear trend of continuing improvements in the GCSE and GNVQ results of pupils in secondary schools and in the achievements of students in schools and FE sector colleges in GCE A levels and other advanced qualifications. The tables also show substantial and very welcome increases in the proportion of pupils at the end of their primary schooling reaching the level expected of them in National Curriculum tests.
<P>

<a name="91221w26.html_para3">The performance tables show what can be achieved by committed teachers and pupils, supported by effective national strategies.

 <i>[holding answer 21 November 1999]:</i> Information on the number of children educated at home by their parents is not held centrally. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no current plans to introduce a national register of home-educated children. Home educated pupils can be removed from a school roll only where the school has received written notification from the parent that the pupil is receiving education otherwise than at school. The relevant local education authority is under a duty to monitor the education provided to home-educated children and to enforce school attendance where it is inadequate.

 <i>[holding answer 20 December 1999]:</i> Under the 1996 Education Act, parents can opt to educate their children otherwise than at school. In such circumstances, local education authorities have a duty to ensure that the education provided is suitable to age, aptitude and ability and any special educational needs the child may have. It is for education authorities to decide how to monitor these arrangements. In cases where the education being provided is deemed not suitable, LEAs can apply to the courts for an Education Supervision Order, which could allow home education to continue with supervision, or they can try to obtain a School Attendance Order.

 <i>[holding answer 20 December 1999]:</i> Six consultancy firms have been awarded framework contracts by the DfEE to undertake work in relation to LEA intervention. These are: PricewaterhouseCoopers; KPMG; The Office for Public Management; Lorien; Capita; and Arthur Andersen/ Birmingham LEA.
<P>

<a name="91221w27.html_para1">Under European Union procurement rules, we conducted a rigorous competition to establish framework contracts with consultancy firms. Framework arrangements allow the Department to appoint consultants quickly following an Ofsted report, without the need for a separate procurement exercise for each intervention case. 97 consultancy firms originally expressed an interest in the work and, following the competition, frameworks were established with six of them. In order to ensure maximum value for money, we have also held mini- competitions to let particular contracts.
<P>

<a name="91221w27.html_para2">The criteria for selecting the consultants included a proven track record in: understanding the nature of services provided by LEAs; working with service providers to improve service delivery standards; handling complex contract and project management arrangements; and preparing service related specifications.
<P>

<a name="91221w27.html_para3">The estimated overall cost of ongoing consultancy in Hackney, Liverpool, Islington, Leicester City and Haringey is &#163;2.7 million including VAT. The costs are generally split between DfEE and the LEA concerned.

<a name="91221w28.html_para0">We are encouraged by the success so far in the overall take-up of EMAs. We have worked alongside our external partners in the 15 pilot areas to ensure the smoothest possible introduction of the pilot scheme. LEAs are still dealing with EMA applications, including a number of cases where additional information is required to complete the assessment. We therefore expect the number of EMA recipients to rise further in the coming months.
<P>

<a name="91221w28.html_para1">An initial evaluation report is due in September 2000. However, early anecdotal evidence suggests that EMAs have helped young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to remain in education when they might otherwise would not have been able to afford to participate. In addition, a number of Institutions have reported improvements in attendance.

<P>
<a name="91221w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 Higher education institutions are responsible for making arrangements to collect tuition fees from all those students liable to pay them. We have asked institutions to be sensitive and flexible in their collection of the fee contribution and therefore in many cases students will be paying in instalments extending beyond the first term. Local authorities pay the fee contribution for students who fall under the previous arrangements; the Student Loans Company will pay the fee contribution due for students entitled to support from public funds under the current arrangements. In both cases, payment is due to an institution once the continued attendance of each student is confirmed three months after the beginning of the academic year. For the academic year beginning 1 September 1999, such payments from local authorities should in most cases be received by 9 February 2000.

 <i>[holding answer 23 November 1999]:</i> It is normal and established practice that sponsors of major events receive tickets to the sponsored event.

 So far over 560,000 children are booked to visit the Dome. The high level of enthusiasm among schoolchildren and teachers has, in part, been fired by the Learning Experience programme. This is a series of initiatives run by the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) to assist delivery of its "education" objective. Over the last 12 months in particular, NMEC has issued four Millennium Experience resource packs to all schools; finalised arrangements for the McDonald's Our Town Stage event which enables every education authority and library board to have a day in the Dome; worked with Tesco on the SchoolNet2000 initiative through which children are compiling an electronic Domesday Book which will be completed this month; and worked with Marks and Spencer on Voices of Promise, which has encouraged and enabled children to compose songs for the millennium.

<a name="91221w28.html_para5">The first of the ballots to allocate the one million free school tickets to the Dome was drawn on 15 November and covered the period February through to April 2000 inclusive. These free tickets are outside NMEC's 12 million visitor target and were not included in the recent announcement by the Shareholder, Lord Falconer, that over a million tickets had already been sold. A total of 226,408 free tickets have been allocated in this first ballot to over 2,600 schools. All schools who applied by the closing date received an allocation.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has the power to list buildings in England; the responsibility for listing buildings in Wales rests with the Welsh National Assembly. Local planning authorities can serve Building Preservation Notices (BPNs) in respect of buildings which are not listed, but which they consider are of special architectural or historic interest and are under threat. BPNs remain in force for six months during which the Secretary of State must decide whether to list the building concerned. There are no such cases currently before him.
<P>

<a name="91221w29.html_para0">There are 123 listed cinema buildings in England; English Heritage recently launched a public consultation in respect of a further 30 cinema buildings which it has identified as having the potential for listing. The consultation period lasts until 1 March next year, after which English Heritage will submit its recommendations to the Secretary of State for decision.

<a name="91221w29.html_para3">NMEC is keen to encourage visitors, from all parts of the UK, to the Dome in 2000. Ticket sales and reservations are running ahead of NMEC's expectations and, at over 1 million, are outstripping advance sales for other worldwide visitor attractions. The company is concerned not to affect the on-going success of ticket sales through publication of selected and piecemeal statistics at this stage. It is competing in the crowded and highly commercial marketplace of visitor attractions and its competitors do not publish detailed statistics of forward sales in the formats that have been requested. However, NMEC has informed the Select Committee for Culture, Media and Sport, on a commercially confidential basis, of progress on ticket sales and will provide, periodically, further progress reports as requested by the Committee. The company will release details in February 2000 of attendance at the Dome during January 2000, and on a monthly basis thereafter.

 The wreck site of the Amsterdam was one of the first sites to be afforded legal protection under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973. Designation of a wreck site under the provisions of this Act makes it an offence for anyone to tamper with, damage or remove any part of a vessel without the authority of a licence granted by the Secretary of State. Recently concerns have been voiced over the state of steel girders left over the site following licensed archaeological excavations in the 1980s. I am pleased to be able to report that these girders were removed in October this year.

The panel have been provided with a wide range of professional and technical advice and the Highways Agency, English Nature, Salisbury District Council and Wiltshire County Council have all been consulted. The Ministry of Defence is not involved in the selection of the operator for the new visitor centre. The panel met with representatives of the short listed bidders on 16 December and hopes to make an announcement of the preferred bidder early in 2000. Salisbury District Council will, in due course, consider a planning application submitted by the preferred bidder. It is not possible at this stage to give an accurate estimate of the timescale for the consultations that will follow the selection of the bidder.

Monthly figures for Nottinghamshire over this period are not available. Figures for January to June 1998 covering Nottinghamshire alone are not available: the previous figures cover 1998 as a whole, and the average for Nottinghamshire was 148 days.

 The details as to which antibiotic growth promoters are used in Thailand and Brazil in the farming of food animals that are likely to be imported into the UK are not currently available. However, it is possible that some antibiotic growth promoters are used in the rearing of food-producing animals that are not permitted for such use in the EU. In adopting a temporary ban on four antibiotic growth promoters in December 1998, the Council of Agriculture Ministers asked the Commission to produce a report on the external dimension of the measure. In particular, the Council asked the Commission to consider how the EU's trading partners might be encouraged to adopt equivalent measures. This report is expected by the end of this year.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will list the occasions since 1 May 1997 when <i>(a)</i> poultry farms and <i>(b)</i> poultry processing plants in Thailand have been inspected by (i) MAFF officials alone, (ii) MAFF officials within an EU inspection team and (iii) an EU inspection team not including MAFF officials; and if he will place in the Library copies of the reports of those visits.

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 1999]:</i> Veterinary staff from the MAFF/Department of Health Joint Food Safety and Standards Group and the MAFF Veterinary International Trade team visited Thailand from 31 January to 12 February this year. They visited five poultry meat establishments, four of which were combined slaughterhouses, cutting plants, meat preparations and meat products premises. The fifth establishment was a stand-alone meat products premises. The central laboratory of the Department of Livestock Development, a hatchery and a broiler farm were visited. The report of the mission was sent to the Commission and placed in the Library on 24 June 1999. It can also be found on the Ministry's internet site, the address of which is http://maffweb/animalh/int-trde. A European Commission-led inspection of poultry or poultry meat premises in Thailand is currently under way, and I will ensure that the report is placed in the Libraries of the House as soon as it is available.

<a name="91221w31.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1999]:</i> Unilateral action of the kind suggested would be contrary to European law. However, MAFF is raising such labelling issues in EU and international discussions. We are also consulting all interested parties on guidance aimed at ensuring that country of origin markings on food labels provide accurate information about the true origin of ingredients used. In the meantime, we will continue to encourage retailers, caterers and public procurement authorities to source their supplies of pork and pork products to British standards.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for what reasons the Government <i>(a)</i> decided to require that no beef with the bone in from cattle over six months old should be sold to consumers and <i>(b)</i> not to make public the research findings on the subject, together with SEAC's assessment of the risk.

<a name="91221w31.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nick Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1999]:</i> The ban on sales of bone-in beef from cattle over six months of age was introduced after the Government was advised by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) that BSE infectivity had been discovered in the dorsal root ganglia, and possibly bone marrow, of cattle infected experimentally with BSE. The Government's decision to introduce the controls was taken after consideration of SEAC's advice and in the

<P>

<a name="91221w31.html_para0">SEAC's advice to Ministers, including its assessment of the risk, was published on 3 December 1997 by means of a Ministry of Agriculture News Release.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91221w31.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The stall and tether ban was introduced in 1991, with an eight-year phase-out period for existing stall and tether systems. No recent assessments have therefore been made of the costs to pig farmers in either the UK in general or Cumbria in particular.

 <i>[holding answer 13 December 1999]:</i> Hunts and hunt kennels are consulted on proposals to amend the statutory controls on specified risk material (SRM) through the Master of Foxhounds Association and the Master of Deerhounds Association. The operators of hunt kennels are advised as necessary on the SRM controls by Ministry veterinary officers during their monthly audit visits to these premises. Such advice will normally be confirmed in writing, particularly in respect of any deficiencies in the handling or control of SRM found. Advice is also given in response to specific requests by letter or telephone from individual hunts or hunt kennels.

The Commission will certainly not sanction any scheme which fails to meet the rules; and we could not contemplate paying an illegal aid.

 <i>[holding answer 20 December 1999]:</i> The Government recognise that the television licence fee can be a source of concern for many elderly people. Older pensioner households are more likely to be on low incomes, which is why additional resources will be directed at the 75-plus group. Free television licences to people aged 75 years and over, nearly 50 per cent. of whom are in the lowest three income deciles, is a significant measure for poorer pensioners and will benefit over three million pensioner households.

<a name="91221w33.html_para12">This measure builds on a number of significant improvements we have made in respect of provision for pensioners. Pensioners aged 75 and over now have a Minimum Income Guarantee of at least &#163;77.30 plus housing costs for single pensioners and &#163;119.85 plus housing costs for couples. The Government have committed to uprate the Minimum Income Guarantee by earnings growth during this Parliament. Pensioners also

Table B shows a forecast of the estimated payments for services flowing from new private investment over the next twenty five years. Actual expenditure will depend on the details of the payment mechanism for each contract. Payments may be lower than estimated due to deductions from the service payments caused by either the supplier's failure to make the service available or a failure to meet the required performance standards. In addition variances may occur due to changes in the service requirements agreed during the course of the contracts. Payments may also vary as a result of the early termination of a contract triggering contractual arrangements for compensation on termination. <P>

 The French reduced rate is for the renovation and repair of private dwellings and has been introduced under the new Annex K of the Sixth VAT Directive.

 It is widely recognised in the United Kingdom and other leading industrialised countries that double taxation agreements encourage international trade and investment by relieving double taxation and providing certainty of tax treatment. Investment and income flows are taken into account in negotiating double taxation agreements. The business community is invited regularly to give its views on the priorities for negotiating new agreements and renegotiating existing agreements. The many representations made by business during our annual review of our network of agreements show the considerable value of these agreements to the United Kingdom, and in particular to UK business.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91221w35.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The next spending review, in 2000, will be conducted on a resource basis. This will fulfil the Government's commitment in the Code for Fiscal Stability to adopt, as soon as reasonably practicable, a resource accounting and budgeting approach for planning and accounting for the costs of resources consumed by government.
<P>

<a name="91221w35.html_para6">The decision to proceed with resource budgeting follows a successful "dry run" of the new procedures carried out by all Departments during the course of 1999. This confirmed that the procedures were workable. However, it also highlighted a transitional issue in relation to Departments' ability to forecast the large new non-cash elements of resource budgets (depreciation, capital charges and provisions) for three years ahead.
<P>

<a name="91221w35.html_para7">To allow time for a track record in forecasting, monitoring and controlling these items to be established, resource budgeting will therefore be introduced in two stages. In the first stage, in the plans drawn up in the 2000 spending review, the big non-cash elements of resource budgets will be part of Annually Managed Expenditure rather than Departmental Expenditure Limits. The intention is that, in the light of experience, these items will be moved into Departmental Expenditure Limits following the 2002 spending review.
<P>

<a name="91221w35.html_para8">Details of the new arrangements are being placed in the Libraries of the House.
