many whole time equivalent staff there were in each (a) (i) customer
facing and (ii) benefit processing district and (b) call centre (A)
before Customer Management Service (CMS) and (B) after full or partial

Plus.</p></ul><a name="060518145000745"><ul><p class="tabletext">Our
staffing information is not held in a format that allows any specific
distinction between customer facing and benefit processing functions,

attach a table which provides a breakdown of the number of Full Time
Equivalent staff for the period ending 30 September 2003, immediately
prior to the commencement of implementation of CMS in October 2003, and
in March 2006. It differentiates between Jobcentres (including
Jobcentre Plus offices), Social Security Offices and Contact Centres.
The data includes some Districts for which Jobcentre Plus
implementation is not yet
complete.</p></ul><a name="060518145000747"><ul><p class="tabletext">A number of
factors have contributed to the changes in staffing volumes over the
period, including progress towards the Government&#146;s efficiency
challenge. The implementation of Jobcentre Plus introduces significant
process changes, such as the introduction of work-focussed
interventions for all new claims, which attracts additional resource in
Jobcentres, but also some transfer of new claims work to Contact
Centres. Comparisons of staffing numbers pre and post CMS
implementation cannot therefore be directly attributable only to the
introduction of the new information
technology.</p></ul><a name="060518145000748"><ul><p class="tabletext">I hope

health is outlined in our 2004 strategy document &#147;Reducing
maternal deaths: evidence and action: First Progress Report&#148;.
This sets out four priority areas for supporting better maternal
health; specifically advocacy, scaling-up and improving services,
helping remove barriers to access, and research to develop better
technologies and
policies.</p><p><a name="06051912000133">We have
recently reviewed our performance; copies of our Progress Report have
been deposited in the Libraries of the House. The report notes that
DFID spending on reducing maternal mortality (together with
reproductive health services) has increased by 41.3 per cent. over the
past three years, and we are committed to continuing to increase our
support to maternal
health.</p><p><a name="06051912000134">But we still
need to see more governments give greater priority to this issue. Some
progress has been made in Asia, for example in Nepal, China, Vietnam
and Indonesia. In many parts of Africa, however, weak health services,
conflict and HIV have combined to constrain overall progress. Improving
this situation will require long term and sustained
help.</p><p><a name="06051912000135">The
Progress Report makes several recommendations, one of which is to use
maternal mortality as an indicator through which to track progress in
health systems strengthening. Functioning health systems are essential
in seeing improvements in maternal health, and we will indeed wish to
monitor maternal health outcomes as we scale-up our support to basis
health
services.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06051912000012">Palestinian

Garnier:</b> To ask the Secretary of State for
the Home Department what his policy is on the preparation of <i>(a)</i>
adult prisoners and <i>(b)</i> young offenders for release from custody
and rejoining their families; and if he will make a statement.
[55074]</p><p><a name="06051912001237"><b><a name="06051912002791">Mr.
Sutcliffe:</b> The Government are committed to reducing
re-offending by both adults and younger offenders. We recognise that,
in the case of those released from custodial sentences, this can be
achieved only through successful reintegration into the community.
This, in turn, requires action from the earliest stages to address
offenders' needs; examples of activity taking place in prisons include
basic skills training and work to increase offenders&#146;
employability.</p><p><a name="06051912001238">In
recent months we have launched a series of complementary initiatives,
to reduce re-offending. Last November we published the National
Reducing Re-offending Delivery Plan, setting out our plans over the
next 18 months for tackling re-offending, working in partnership at
national, regional and local
levels.</p><p><a name="06051912001239">At the same
time we launched three important new alliances, which will develop
existing links with the corporate sector and with the faith and
voluntary and community sector; we will also build on links with local
authorities and other non-CJS partners, through the Civic Society
Alliance. The alliances reflect the reality of our intention to develop
partnerships at all levels to reduce
re-offending.</p><p><a name="06051912001240">Last
month, we published &#147;A Five Year Strategy for Protecting the
Public and Reducing Re-offending&#148;. This sets out our wider
vision of how the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) will work
with its partners in the coming years, to reduce re-offending, to cut
crime and to help create a safer, more secure
society.</p><p><a name="06051912001241">Also last
month, the Youth Justice Board published its Youth Resettlement
Framework Action Plan community prisons. The framework focuses on seven
resettlement pathways: Case Management and Transitions; Accommodation;
Education, Training and Employment; Health; Substance Misuse; Families;
and Finance, Benefit and Debt. It highlights the main actions required
at local, regional and national level, emphasising the need to take
account of the reducing re-offending
alliances.</p><p><a name="06051912001242">The
framework will be continually influenced by developing practice and
monitored by a strategic steering group of key partners at national
level. This group will provide an overview for the NOMS Programme Board
and the Youth Justice Board, promoting and disseminating practice as it
develops. The framework will be revisited in 12 months time when a
formal review of its impact will be conducted by the Youth Justice
Board. The regional reducing re-offending partnership boards will be
instrumental in implementing effective resettlement for young people
and links have already been
established.</p><p><a name="06051912001243">One of
the pathways in the Reducing Re-offending Delivery Plan focuses on
offenders&#146; children and families. It will help offenders
maintain family relationships and provide support while they are
serving sentence and in sustaining changes in behaviour thereafter. The
pathway is in the early stages of development and we are working to
establish 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2006 : Column 1225W</b><br>governance arrangements, including establishing a cross-Government
sub-board. The sub-board will enable us to ensure our policies across
government are aligned and mutually supportive, highlighting good
practice while preventing duplication of effort and resources. As an
important element of the work, a three year project to establish a
regional pathfinder is now getting under way under the management of
the regional offender manager for the West Midlands. Its objectives are
to strengthen family ties, to support children and families and reduce
re-offending through a collaborative
approach.</p><p><a name="06051912001244"><b><a name="06051912002792">Mr.

total number of buildings currently in the public prison estate (dating
from the 19th century to 2003) with leaks is 1,357 and that it would
cost an estimated &#163;23 million for them to be repaired. The style

temporary licence (ROTL) is used by prison governors to improve
resettlement opportunities for prisoners and to maintain family ties.
In conjunction with a stringent risk assessment process, ROTL plays a
key role in the management of prisoners in the resettlement estate.
This comprises 30 establishments, mainly open prisons, which provide
specific regimes for longer term prisoners, including life sentence
prisoners, during the final two years of their sentence. The
resettlement estate provides opportunities for prisoners to address
offending behaviour, educational and training needs, and to undertake
unpaid community work and, finally, paid
employment.</p><p><a name="06051912001257">The number

frequently have a complex range of needs which can include drug
treatment and other health needs, and housing. A key objective of the
strategy is to ensure that these needs are recognised and that services
are accessible to this group. The most urgent need for many is for drug
treatment. In addition to NHS funding through primary care trusts and
social services funding streams, central Government provides funding
for drug treatment through the pooled treatment budget, which increased
by 18 per cent. from &#163;253 million in 2004-05 to &#163;299
million in 2005-06. The other urgent need is for appropriate and stable
housing. The strategy encourages local authorities to ensure that
relevant services, such as those provided via the Supporting People
programme, are made accessible to women exiting prostitution.</p><p><a name="06051912001272">Other sources of Government
funding are available to support this aspect of the strategy. For

this.</p><p><a name="06051912001282">The SIA
discussed the assumptions with specialist sector bodies. It based its
current assumption on the experience in the pilot region where the
numbers applying for licences were significantly lower than
expectations. Once the offence date had passed the SIA obtained
information through its compliance team and enforcement partners on the
numbers of licensed and unlicensed individuals they were finding during
visits to premises and their joint compliance operations. At the time

Coaker:</b> From 20 March 2006, it became a criminal offence
for manned guards to carry out security activities without a licence
under the terms of the Private Security Industry Act 2001 (PSIA).
Enforcement is the responsibility of the Security Industry Authority
and the police. The SIA published an enforcement policy on 7 March
which stated that, while they want the private security industry to be
compliant with the law as quickly as possible, they will take into
account a number of factors when deciding what enforcement action to
take. These factors include the progress an individual has made towards
getting or renewing a licence, the current licensing processing time,
the time elapsed since the activity became licensable and any previous
encounters with or warnings given by the SIA or other
agency.</p><p><a name="06051912001286">Any individual
carrying out licensable activities without a licence will be committing
a criminal offence, unless they have received a license dispensation
notice from the SIA under the Approved Contractor Scheme (ACS). This
allows accredited firms to legally deploy a proportion of their staff
who have completed their training but whose applications are still
being processed. As at 11 May, it is estimated that around 30,000
individuals are being deployed lawfully under the ACS
Scheme.</p>

award parole focus primarily on the risk to the public of an offence
being committed at a time when the offender would otherwise be in
prison. In assessing whether the safety of the public will be placed
unacceptably at risk, the board is directed to take into account that
the risk of violent or sexual offending is more serious than a risk of
other types of offending. This must be balanced against the benefit,
both to the public and the offender, of early release back into the
community under a degree of supervision which might help rehabilitation
and so lessen the risk of re-offending in the
future.</p><p><a name="06051912001289">The Parole
Board considers many factors including the nature and circumstances of
the offence of which the offender was convicted, any previous
convictions, the offender&#146;s attitude and response in prison,
what, if any, offence-related work has been completed, reports from the
Prison and Probation Service and any representations from the offender
himself. On the strength of the available information it makes a
judgment on the likely benefit both to the offender and society in
allowing the offender to serve part of the sentence in the
community.</p><p><a name="06051912001290">There is no
requirement for an offender to admit guilt prior to making an

1. These statistics are based on information recorded on the central
Prison Service IT system at 21 April 2006. Further updates and
amendments may be made to records on this system in future resulting in
revised figures.  2. Investigations suggest that, for HDC
releases covering all offence groups, around 5 per cent. of offence
types recorded on this system do not relate to the offence for which
they were released on HDC but relate to offences committed after
release from prison and before their licence expiry date for their
sentence.  3. Of the 82 discharges recorded as relating to
those serving sexual offences shown in the table, 64 were actually
serving a sentence for a sexual offence at the time of their release.
The last offender to be released on HDC while serving a sentence for a
sexual offence was released in January 2004.  4. The
statistics presented in the table will also include those sentenced to
abduction which was not of a sexual
