 To ask the Solicitor General what the cost was of UK participation in the Commission case against the Hellenic Republic in Court of Justice Cases C-475/01 as detailed in OJ C300 volume 47 of 4 December; and what form such participation took.  [207258]</p>




<p><a name="50117w01.html_spmin1"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The UK&#039;s participation in Case C-475/01 was limited to applying to the European Court of Justice for leave to intervene, which was granted. After reviewing the pleadings, the UK decided not to pursue the intervention because it had nothing to add to the Commission&#039;s case. The UK did not therefore submit a statement of intervention or attend the hearing.

In accordance with the Court&#039;s Rules of Procedure (Article 69(4)), an intervening member state bears its own costs of intervention. Aside from the time spent by departmental officials in considering the pleadings and applying for leave to intervene, the only costs incurred were the costs of translating the pleadings from Greek to English, which were approximately &#163;2,150.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 Jan 2005 : Column 665W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="50117w01.html_spmin4"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 All cases received by the Crown Prosecution Service are individually reviewed against the tests set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The Code is a publicly available document issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions to give guidance on general principles to be applied in determining whether cases should be prosecuted and the choice of charge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w01.html_para3">
A prosecutor must first decide whether there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against each defendant on each charge. If there is sufficient evidence the prosecutor will consider whether the public interest requires the case to be prosecuted. A prosecution will usually take place unless there are public interest factors tending against a prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending in favour, or it appears more appropriate in all the circumstances of the case to divert the person from prosecution.
</p>

 To ask the Solicitor General what documents the Crown Prosecution Service requires to receive before making a decision to prosecute.  [206933]</p>




<p><a name="50117w01.html_spmin5"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 Under the new early advice and charging arrangements, the police may seek the opinion of a Crown Prosecution Service duty prosecutor at any stage in the proceedings. No formal documentation is required for the early stages of an investigation, though the police are encouraged to provide copies of any documentation they have. For the formal decision to commence proceedings, usually by the preferment of a charge, the police are required to provide jointly agreed documentation set out in a Manual of Guidance and in Guidance issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions for prosecutors making charging decisions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w01.html_para4">
The documents which accompany a police officer&#039;s report will include key witness statements and other relevant material such as video recordings, an account of the defendant&#039;s interview, a record of the defendant&#039;s previous convictions, if any, and any material that would undermine the prosecution&#039;s case or assist the defence.

<p><a name="50117w01.html_spmin6"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The joint Crown Prosecution Service/police criminal justice unit was opened in Southend Police Station in November 2000.

 In all cases it prosecutes, the Crown Prosecution Service applies the evidential test set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and only those cases that pass this test and where it is in the public interest to prosecute, are put before the court. A new edition of the Code was issued in November 2004, and is publicly available.

<p><a name="50117w02.html_spmin1"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 Neither the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), nor the Serious Fraud Office have spent any money on taskforces or similar bodies since 1997. In 1999 the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers spent a total of &#163;210,000 on a review which led to the establishment of a separate and independent Inspectorate for the CPS.

<p><a name="50117w02.html_spmin2"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The working time regulations provide workers with the protection of a limit of an average of 48 hours a week working time. This is not an absolute cap of 48 hours in any one week. This average is normally calculated over a 17-week reference period, although this can be longer in certain situations (26 weeks) and can be extended by agreement (up to 52 weeks). Workers may choose to work more than 48 h ours per week over this reference period by signing an opt-out agreement, but employers cannot force a worker to sign an opt-out, and workers cannot be subjected to detriment for refusing to sign an opt-out. In 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 Jan 2005 : Column 667W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the last 12 months four officials working in the combined Private Office for the Law Officers have worked more than a 48 hour week on occasions. This represents 100 per cent. of the total number of permanent staff in the office.

 The Iraqi Ministry of Health (MoH) is responsible for providing adequate medical facilities and healthcare for all of the population of Iraq. The MoH made provisions to treat injured civilians during military operations in Fallujah at hospitals and clinics near to the city. Multi-National Force-Iraq also had medical facilities at a base near Fallujah which were available to treat injured civilians in emergencies. The main hospital in Fallujah is now operational and the Iraqi Ministry of Health has delivered adequate basic medical supplies to the hospital and to clinics in the city. Most of Fallujah&#039;s civilian population left the city before military operations began and have been provided with essential food, water, shelter and medical supplies in the surrounding area.

 Most areas of Fallujah are now open to the returning population. The number of people returning to the city is increasing steadily. By 14 January, over 100,000 people had crossed the checkpoints into the city since returns began on 23 December although far fewer are staying overnight.

After 2002 only core newspapers and periodicals were centrally funded and access transferred from print to electronic editions (for heavily used and requested periodicals). Due to the disproportionate cost of listing every newspaper and periodical taken since 1997 only the current core centrally funded newspapers and periodicals are listed.

 At the onset of the disaster, a Tsunami Assistance Co-ordination Group, composed of international NGOs, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and UN agencies and chaired by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) was established in Burma. Over the next 10 days, Co-ordination Group members undertook a series of assessment and verification missions&#151;to the Rakhine Coast, the Irrawady Delta and the southern coast including the most populated islands of the Myeik archipelago and the islands off Kawthaung around Lampi Island. On 6 January 2005, the group met to consolidate the findings of the different assessment and verification missions. It concluded that Burma had been largely spared from the destructive forces of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami, and that initial emergency needs had been met. The group&#039;s assessment was a death toll of 60 to 80, and an estimated longer-term affected population of 10,000 to 15,000 (of whom 5,000 to 7,000 were directly affected). Assessment of longer-term reconstruction and rehabilitation needs is currently ongoing.

 The lead responsibility for co-ordinating the response to the disaster rests with the United Nations.

Immediately following news of the disaster, we provided two experts to the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Co-ordination mechanism for deployment to affected countries. DFID has since been providing a range of practical assistance to help the United Nations be sufficiently equipped and resourced to meet its co-ordination and response role.

International co-ordination is also being progressed through a series of international meetings. On 6 January, the Foreign Secretary attended the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit, in Jakarta, my Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State attended the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) of the European Union, in Brussels on 7 January, and on 11 January, I attended a donor conference arranged by the United Nations, in Geneva, following the launch of their Regional Appeal.

However, Article 6 makes clear that the nature and extent of consultation on the principle of subsidiarity is for national Parliaments to decide.

Responsibility for what is broadcast on television and radio rests with the broadcasters and the organisations which regulate broadcasting&#151;the Office of Communications (OFCOM), the Governors of the BBC and the Welsh Fourth Channel Authority (S4C). They are independent of the Government and responsible for safeguarding the public interest in broadcasting in accordance with the duties laid upon them. They set the detailed rules and guidance with which broadcasters must comply. It is a long-standing principle that the Government does not interfere in editorial matters, either in relation to scheduling or content.

 We have had no consultation with church authorities about the National Lottery Bill, but have received written representations from a number of Diocesan Advisory Committees, and others, concerning how clauses 7 and 8 of the Bill may affect Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) grants to church buildings. We have been in close contact with HLF to address their concerns and have made assurances both to them and

We have also made clear that, if Parliament approves these powers, we would ensure that any money reallocated would still go to heritage projects but would be allocated to a different distributor. We will set out the Government&#039;s position more fully when the Bill is considered by the House.

The vast majority of households in England can, with the appropriate equipment, receive the BBC digital services via either digital satellite, digital terrestrial or cable.

<p><a name="50117w16.html_spnew5"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 The Government aim, through the UK Film Council (UKFC), to promote the availability of the widest possible variety of films to the widest possible audience. The UKFC&#039;s initiatives in this area do not directly address the issue of competition in the market place, but do account for it within the broader objective of improving variety and accessibility. The &#163;2 million available annually through the Prints and Advertising Fund is designed, for example, to encourage film distributors to acquire more specialised films and to release them more widely. The UK Film Council is separately in constant dialogue with both individual distributors and relevant trade organisations to ensure that any structural or competition issues are dealt with appropriately.

 The Government is committed to creating a sustainable, stable and successful film industry.

<p><a name="50117w16.html_spnew10"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Government played a leading role in securing major reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy in 2003 and 2004. They break the link between the bulk of farm subsidy and levels of production, make subsidy dependent on meeting environmental and animal welfare standards, and redirect a greater proportion of EU subsidy to environmental and rural development schemes. As a result, the CAP will now be less environmentally damaging and trade distorting and enable farmers to become more market focused.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the outcome was of the Environment Council on 20 December; what the Government&#039;s stance was on the issues discussed, including its voting record; and if she will make a statement.  [207059]</p>




<p><a name="50117w18.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I attended the Environment Council on 20 December 2004, together with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w18.html_para0">
Council reached political agreement on two measures concerning the Aarhus Convention, both with the support of the UK. We agreed a draft Regulation on the application of provisions on access to information, public participation and access to justice in environmental matters to the Community institutions and bodies, with Belgium voting against. I intervened in the discussion to oppose a Commission suggestion that would have set a requirement that NGOs should be active at EU level to be entitled to use the access to justice provisions. Others took the same view and this proposal was not adopted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w18.html_para1">
There was unanimous agreement on a draft Decision to the effect that the European Community should ratify the Aarhus Convention. It is hoped that this will enable ratification by the EC to be concluded before the next meeting of the parties in May 2005. The Commission said it would enter a minutes statement concerning a declaration on external competence annexed to the decision.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w18.html_para2">
We also reached political agreement on the proposed Directive on Batteries and Accumulators, following lengthy discussion of the main outstanding issues which were the extent of the partial ban on nickel cadmium batteries, and, particularly, the level and timing of collection targets. There was a wide range of views in Council, with strong pressure from a number of member states for tougher provisions on nickel cadmium and more ambitious collection targets. I argued for an evidence-based approach on nickel cadmium, and for achievable and proportionate collection targets, noting that the legal base used for this measure would not prevent member states that wished to go further from doing so. A compromise was reached after a difficult negotiation, involving targets of 25 per cent. after four years and 45 per cent. after eight years from the Directive coming into force. The exemption of cordless power tools from the nickel cadmium ban was maintained, with a Commission review after four years. Belgium abstained because the targets were too unambitious, Greece because they were too high, and Ireland because of the terms of the review of cordless power tools. Italy was also unable to support the political agreement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w18.html_para3">
We debated elements of the Regulation on the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH). The Secretary of State welcomed a recent workshop held by the Netherlands Presidency on the wide range of impact assessment work being done on this dossier, and pointed out that the UK proposal for &#039;one substance one registration&#039; would help reduce duplication of information and therefore costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w18.html_para4">
There was general support for prioritising registration of substances of greatest concern, particularly those that may be persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. Some member states would like to go further and there was limited interest in developing a risk-based approach at the registration stage. Mrs. Beckett expressed UK concerns about the practicality of such an approach in the absence of the data that would only become available during the registration process itself. The Commission took a similar line.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w18.html_para5">
There was broad agreement in Council that the treatment of substances in finished products (articles) was important to safeguard human health and the environment but could raise issues of workability. In addition we should avoid any danger of creating a competitive advantage for goods imported from outside the EU. Mrs. Beckett strongly supported the principle of regulating substances in articles under REACH, but put forward concerns over the workability of the current Commission proposal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w18.html_para6">
There was no qualified majority for or against the Commission proposal for a Decision authorising placing an oilseed rape product (Brassica napus L,GT73 line), genetically modified for tolerance to the herbicide glyphosate, on the market. The UK abstained in this vote.
</p>


<p>

Council agreed a wide-ranging set of Conclusions on Climate Change: Medium and Long-term Strategies and Targets, following the 10th Conference of the Parties to the UN Climate Change Convention in Buenos Aires, and as a contribution to the planned discussion at the Spring European Council. I spoke supporting the need

</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w18.html_para8">
Council also adopted Conclusions on the review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy, but was unable to do so on the Kok Report on the Lisbon Strategy. Some wished to widen the scope of the conclusions. For the UK, Mrs. Beckett strongly supported the succinct draft conclusions put forward by the Presidency. The Presidency concluded that Council should return to the discussion under the Luxembourg Presidency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w18.html_para9">
Council held a lengthy preliminary exchange of views on the proposed Regulation on the Financial instrument for the environment (LIFE+). Discussion focused on the need to ensure compatibility with the EU&#039;s overall budget. Views were expressed for and against the Commission&#039;s intention to focus funding from the new Regulation on policy support rather than implementation, which would be funded from other EU funding streams or by member states. A number of member states were concerned about possible gaps arising from this approach.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w18.html_para10">
Council also exchanged views on the preparation for the 23rd Session of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Governing Council, to be held in February 2005, and heard from UNEP&#039;s Executive Director, Klaus Topfer. For the UK, the Secretary of State provided an opening intervention in response to a question on achieving complementarity between the Johannesburg outcomes and the Millennium Development Goals, and the role of UNEP in enhancing these synergies. This and subsequent interventions emphasised the need to recognise the links between the Millennium Development Goals and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the effective use of resources, underlining the necessity for all parties to make appropriate financial contributions to UNEP. The need for the Millennium Review summit to address environmental sustainability and climate change, and the importance of the Bali strategic plan for technology support and capacity building as a mechanism for implementation were also stressed.

Council adopted Conclusions on the Protection and Conservation of the Marine Environment without further discussion, in which we looked forward to the publication by the Commission of the thematic strategy on the marine environment, due in 2005 under the 6th Environmental Action Programme.

Under Other Business, the Secretary of State raised the urgent need for concrete measures to address increasing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, and our preference for action through the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

<p><a name="50117w18.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 In 2003 the UK produced 7,500 tonnes of honey worth &#163;35 million, a significant increase over previous years. Part of this increase is attributable to the EU ban on imports of honey from China between 2002&#150;04. British honey is produced by about 200 commercial bee farmers and some 43,000 private beekeepers. Their contribution to the agricultural economy is difficult to measure but the value of pollination as a service to agriculture has been estimated as at least &#163;120 million a year.

<p>
<a name="50117w18.html_para15">
In the light of the National Bee Unit&#039;s assessment of the disease threats faced by bee colonies, the Department has concluded that statutory enforcement provisions for the control of varroa are now of low priority since this pest has become endemic.

 It is vital that we ensure that the Army of the future is properly configured to meet the priorities and challenges of the future, rather than the past. The Army has always evolved to meet current and future challenges and it is a fact that very few of our regiments and corps exist today in the same form as they did in the past.

Although statistics are not collated centrally in respect of the numbers of forged documents found in possession of those illegally in the UK, during the period 1 January 2004 to 30 November 2004, enforcement staff brought 108 forged Portuguese identity cards (out of a total of 141 forged identity cards from all EU nationalities) to the attention of NDFU.

 Each unit of property was given a rateable value using a valuation, which for domestic property was usually based on rental evidence just prior to 1973 when the last revaluation on this basis was undertaken.

The rate was expressed in pence per pound sterling. The rates payable were calculated by multiplying this poundage by the rateable value. Rates on domestic property were reduced by a domestic rate relief scheme and could be further reduced by national or local rate rebate schemes.

1. Figures for the number of people receiving state pension, in hospital over 52 weeks are from a 5 per cent. sample from the pensions strategy computer system at 30 September 2003 and 31 March 2004. pension credit figures are based on the proportion of the pensioner population who receive pension credit, as no data are currently available for those in hospital longer than one year.<br>

2. Disability living allowance and attendance allowance are not paid if the benefit recipient is in hospital over four weeks, so have not been included. The unemployment supplement in industrial injuries disablement benefit is downrated but there are few cases where this applies and no cases where hospital downrating has been recorded.<br>

3. The incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance admin data are from the Incapacity Benefit/Severe Disablement Allowance Quarterly Summary Statistics (four quarterly averages have been used) and the income support data are from the Income Support Quarterly Statistical Enquiry. <br>

<a name="50117w32.html_para0">
Before considering civil proceedings, the disabled person may raise a complaint directly with the service provider, or the person responsible for the disposal of premises, to see whether the issue can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. The disabled person may also wish to seek advice from the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) which has established an independent conciliation service for disputes arising under part 3 of the DDA, with a view to promoting the settlement of disputes without recourse to civil proceedings. The DRC also has statutory duties to monitor and keep under review the implementation and enforcement of the DDA, and to advise the Government on the operation of the Act.

<a name="50117w32.html_para1">
No assessment has yet been made since 1 October 2004 of the impact of the new duties requiring service providers to tackle physical barriers that prevent disabled people accessing their goods, services and facilities. However, the Government have a programme of research to monitor how those with responsibilities under the DDA are responding to those duties. Research conducted in 2003 and published in 2004 (DWP Research Report 202, Disability in the Workplace: Employers&#039; and Service Providers&#039; Responses to the Disability Discrimination Act in 2003 and Preparation for 2004 Changes) showed that 56 per cent. of the service providers surveyed had changes to physical access in place or planned.

Contribution based benefits are intended to help those who experience periods of unemployment or sickness between jobs.

<ul>Directives has been significantly lower in Northern Ireland particularly on wastewater treatment. It is estimated that substantial capital investment, projected at &#163;2.9 billion over the next 20 years, needs to be invested to modernise the existing infrastructure. Over one-quarter of this total is directly attributable to meeting the quality standards required by EC Directives. The remaining investment is required to cater for growth in the demand for water and sewerage services, to improve levels of customer service and to renew the existing watermains, sewers and other parts of the infrastructure. All of this investment must of course comply with the relevant standards including quality.</p>

<p class="tabletext">Priority is at present being given to upgrading water and wastewater treatment works. This accounts for some &#163;1 billion of the total investment required and of this approximately one-third is for water treatment while two-thirds is for wastewater treatment. Refurbishment of watermains and sewer networks accounts for the remaining &#163;1.9 billion and will take longer to complete. It is planned to accelerate spending on network refurbishment to around &#163;100 million per year within the next few years, as the treatment works upgrading programme nears completion.</p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Water Service aims to provide continuous supplies of safe drinking water to all customers connected to the water distribution system and to ensure that interruptions to supply, whether due to an emergency or planned maintenance work, are dealt with efficiently and without unnecessary delay. Water Service&#039;s Customer Charter sets out the standards it aims to achieve in the delivery of these services. These standards include:</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">having inspection staff on site within four hours (six hours outside normal working hours) when an unexpected problem disrupts the water supply;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">restoring water supplies cut off in an emergency within 12 hours;</p>

<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">restoring water supplies cut off for planned work by the time stated in the notice, which will normally be within 12 hours;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">making alternative water supplies available if any interruption is expected to last more than 24 hours.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Water Service also has a well developed Major Incident Plan to manage major incidents and to mitigate the effect on customer supplies.</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 Jan 2005 : Column 793W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Customers can report interruptions in supply or leaks in the distribution system to the Water Service Customer Service Unit by telephoning the Waterline (08457 440088) or the Leakline (08000 282011) during normal working hours. An out-of-hours emergency service is also available by contacting the Waterline. In addition, Water Service has Telemetry Units, which are staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to monitor the working of the water and sewerage systems. Operational repair teams, consisting of around 300 staff from both Water Service and contractors, can be deployed to respond to operational incidents throughout the day and night. During 2004, Water Service repaired over 6,000 bursts and leaks on the water distribution system and it is anticipated that a similar number will be repaired in 2005.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Effective leakage management is a key component in the delivery of Water Service&#039;s second Water Efficiency Plan, which was published last year. Water Service is currently implementing a comprehensive leakage reduction programme, costing over &#163;20 million in the three-year period, to reduce leakage to the economic level of 172 million litres per day by 2007.</p>

<i>Letter from Mrs. Katharine Bryan to Mr. Eddie McGrady, dated 14 January 2004:</i>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question (No. 208375) about the management of water pressure to reduce the amount of water wasted through bursts in water mains. I have been asked to reply as this issue falls to my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Water Service&#039;s second Water Efficiency Plan, which was published on 12 January 2004, set out a wide range of measures aimed at reducing demand for water, including effective leakage management and the raising of awareness of water efficiency measures. A significant programme of leakage reduction is a major component of the Plan and Water Service is currently implementing a comprehensive Leakage Reduction Action Plan aimed at reducing leakage to the economic level by 2007. It is widely recognised throughout the water industry that excessive water pressure within the distribution system contributes to leaks, and the design and implementation of an effective pressure management scheme is, therefore, one of the main elements of the Action Plan.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Water Service is committed to extending pressure management to 30 new areas each year. In the current year this total has already been bettered and pressure management has been extended to over 50 new areas. Pressure management schemes have targeted areas where pressure, particularly at night, is excessive. The schemes are carefully designed to ensure that an adequate level of pressure is maintained to customers at all times.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The implementation of the Leakage Reduction Action Plan has enabled Water Service to reduce leakage from 291 million litres to 231 million litres in the period from April 2002 to March 2004. Water Service is on target to reduce leakage to 205 million litres per day by March 2005 and to achieve the economic level of leakage of 172 million litres per day by 2007.</p>

2. Hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Department liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes.<br>

3. Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates.

 In general, Academy sponsors are required to provide 10 per cent. of the capital costs of establishing an Academy, up to a cap of &#163;2 million. The balance is paid by the Department.

The Trusts which run Academies may borrow from the financial sector. However, like maintained schools, they would require the Secretary of State&#039;s consent to do so.

<p><a name="50117w39.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 The main differences between Academies and City Technology Colleges (CTCs) are around admissions and funding. A CTC is able to select those applicants who are most likely to benefit from the college&#039;s emphasis on science and technology, have the strongest motivation to succeed and intend to continue in full time education or training up to the age of 18. Unlike CTCs, Academies are required to comply with the codes of practice on admissions and admissions appeals, and to the admissions law as it applies to maintained schools. They are required to take part in local co-ordinated admissions arrangements. Academies must have regard to the code of practice on SEN and to the statutory guidance on inclusion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w39.html_para6">
Both CTCs and Academies receive 100 per cent. of their recurrent funding from the Department. CTCs and Academies are treated on the same basis for ongoing capital funding once open, in that the Department would generally fund 80 per cent. of such costs with the trust finding the remaining 20 per cent., though where work arises through statutory requirements the Department would meet all the costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w39.html_para7">
The Department funds CTCs through a funding agreement with the Secretary of State. One fifth of the initial capital cost was paid by private sector sponsors who continue to contribute 20 per cent. towards all capital projects. The Department funds CTCs&#039; running costs on the basis of a direct comparison with budgeted spending for secondary schools in the LEAs from which the CTCs collectively take their pupils. An overall average cost per pupil is derived from this comparison and applied to all the CTCs.

 The Government is committed to funding Academies on a comparable basis to other schools in their areas with similar characteristics.

 Government recognises the importance of early intervention for children with autistic spectrum disorders and relevant initiatives aim to ease access to informed intervention for pre-school children below the age of five. All three and four year olds are now entitled to a free part-time early education place, for at least 12 and a half hours a week, if their parents want one. The Government&#039;s special educational needs (SEN) strategy Removing Barriers to Achievement (February 2004) set out a programme for improving advice and support to, and the skills of, early years settings in meeting the needs of children with SEN. Local education authorities, where necessary, have duties and powers to assess pre-school children&#039;s SEN, including children with autistic spectrum disorders, and to draw up statements of SEN setting out the provision necessary to meet the child&#039;s needs. The provision, including the number of hours of any specialist intervention, will depend on the nature and intensity of the individual child&#039;s needs.

 The provisional local government funding settlement for 2005&#150;06 was announced on 2 December 2004 and provided a good settlement for schools. All schools will receive at least the guaranteed per-pupil increases that we announced in July. The guarantee for secondary and special schools remains at 4 per cent. per pupil, but the guarantee for primary and nursery schools is higher at 5 per cent. per pupil. This is in recognition that these schools need extra support to implement the final phase of workforce reform from 1 September 2005, including guaranteed time for all teachers for planning, preparation and assessment

</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w42.html_para2">
To ensure that there is headroom above the guarantee all authorities will receive an increase in their School Formula Spending Share of at least 5.5 per cent. Devon&#039;s settlement for 2005&#150;06 is significantly higher at 7 per cent. and Torbay will also receive a higher settlement of 6.5 per cent., giving both authorities greater flexibility to target resources at schools with particular pressures. Local education authorities have a great deal of freedom to decide how to allocate the available resources through their local funding formula. Therefore I think Devon teachers should press their case locally.

Notes:<br>

1. The Information is taken from Bedfordshire LEA&#039;s section 52 budget statement.<br>

2. These figures are the Individual Schools Budget (ISB) allocated to schools. In 2004&#150;05 there was a further &#163;747,818 unallocated Schools Budget (no unallocated ISB was reported in 2000&#150;01).<br>

3. In 2004&#150;05 an additional &#163;19.4 million was funded through the school standards grant and the devolved standard fund (of which &#163;7.2 million was for primary schools, &#163;3.3 million for middle deemed schools, &#163;5.6 million for secondary schools and &#163;3.3 million was unallocated) while in 2000&#150;01 an additional &#163;12.9 million was funded through the devolved standard fund (of which &#163;1.9 million was for primary schools, &#163;1 million for middle deemed schools, &#163;1.3 million for secondary schools and &#163;8.8 million was unallocated).<br>

4. Prior to 1999&#150;2000 budget data was not collected at school level. In 1999&#150;2000 school level data were collected but amendments were not checked back with LEAs. If the data were to be made available externally, the cleansed data would need to be agreed by the LEAs which would require a significant amount of time and effort.<br>

5. In 2000&#150;01 school standards grants was not recorded on Section 52 Budget Table 2.<br>

6. In 2004&#150;05 Bedfordshire LEA also reported an unallocated Excellence in Cities (EiC) Grant of &#163;229,000 (no EiC was reported as allocated). In 2000&#150;01 EiC was reported within the devolved standard fund and will therefore be included in the additional &#163;12.9million figure given above. This funding is not included in the above table.<br>

7. All figures are as reported by the LEA in real terms (2003&#150;04 prices) using the 23 December 2004 GDP deflators.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the level of funding for schools in Hendon for 2005&#150;06.  [207941]</p>




<p><a name="50117w43.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 The information requested is produced according to local education authority areas rather than districts within an area. Hendon is a district of the London Borough of Barnet. The provisional local government settlement for 2005&#150;06 was announced on 2 December 2004 and provided all authorities with an increase of at least 5.5 per cent. per pupil aged 3&#150;15. Barnet&#039;s settlement for 2005&#150;06 is significantly higher at 8 per cent. per pupil, giving the authority flexibility to target resources at schools with particular pressures.

<p><a name="50117w44.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 The Secretary of State has no role in the approval of proposals to close schools in England. For proposals published by the local education authority, where there are no objections, the LEA may decide to implement the proposals. In all other cases the proposals are passed to the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) for consideration. If the SOC cannot reach a unanimous decision, the proposals are passed to the Schools Adjudicator for the final decision.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50117w44.html_para1">
In making their decision the SOC and schools adjudicator must have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State. This sets out a range of factors that must be considered. These include the views of

Funding for education is distributed to local authorities based on their education formula funding share. Local authorities then decide how best to allocate and distribute funding to schools and services, including funding for pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Some funding for SEN is delegated to schools to enable them to make additional arrangements and some is managed by the local authority. Local authorities report planned expenditure in their section 52 statements. Total planned expenditure for SEN reported for 2004&#150;05 is &#163;3,774,756,700 as at 13 December 2004.
