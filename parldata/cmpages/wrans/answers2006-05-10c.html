 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent assessment she has made of the impact of the security situation in Afghanistan on the alternative livelihoods programme. [69481]</p>




<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60510w02.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The successful delivery of alternative livelihood programmes is highly dependent on the ability of organisations doing the delivery on the ground, being able to operate safely. Security in many parts of Afghanistan is improving, particularly in central, northern and western areas and further progress can be made by strengthening the effectiveness of the Afghan police and criminal justice system. However security remains a particular challenge in the south and east of the country, where the insurgency is most active.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60510w02.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_6">Continuing threats to the safety of Afghan and international staff have meant that some non-governmental organisations and international contractors are finding it increasingly difficult to operate in some parts of the country. The majority of DFID&#039;s livelihoods programme is channelled through the National Priority Programmes of the Afghan Government. This helps to reduce some of the security risks by using local contractors, but there have been a number of attacks on implementing partners of these national programmes. Although attacks have increased, so far they have not caused widespread suspension of alternative livelihoods programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60510w02.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_7">Helmand province will be a particularly challenging place in which to deliver programmes that will support the development of alternative livelihoods. DFID is currently designing a large multi-year programme to support rural development in Helmand through the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 May 2006 : Column 235W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
National Priority Programmes of the Afghan Government. This support will only be successful if implementing partners are willing to work in the province. The UK military deployment to Helmand should help to facilitate a greater Afghan Government presence in the province, and improve the capacity of the police and the Afghan National Army to provide the necessary security for development partners to operate effectively.

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="60510w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 Within DFID&#039;s programme in Burma, &#163;500,000 has provisionally been allocated in this financial year to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), of which approximately 80 per cent. is attributable to work with conflict-affected populations. In addition, several other projects funded by DFID which provide assistance through local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) (for example, to reduce the incidence of communicable diseases, or to enhance food security) include internally displaced people among their recipients.

 The key recommendations in the social exclusion unit&#039;s (SEU) report on &#039;Young Runaways&#039; were that young people at risk of running away should know who they could talk to about their problems, that local services needed to work closer together to make sure young people got help, and that a safety net of community-based emergency accommodation was needed for those who did run away.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60510w04.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_29">The findings of the SEU report, which was published in 2002, influenced the wider Government strategy on children&#039;s services, which was set out in the Green Paper &#039;Every Child Matters&#039; (2003). It is through the &#039;Every Child Matters: Change for Children&#039; programme currently being taken forward by local authorities, and including the reforms set out in the Green Paper &#039;Youth Matters&#039;, that the Government are promoting measures that respond to the SEU report.

<p>
<a name="60510w04.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_30">&#039;Change for Children&#039; aims to help local services respond to the full range of children&#039;s needs&#151;including their health, their safety and their economic well-being. It is particularly concerned with improving targeted support for those children most at risk of negative outcomes, such as those associated with running away or going missing from home. The programme, drawing on the Children Act 2004 reforms, is enabling local areas to improve integrated working arrangements by establishing multi-disciplinary teams, while adopting a lead professional model&#151;someone who is a single point of contact for a young person who can co-ordinate a package of support when multiple needs are present requiring help from various sources. Improved integrated working at a local level is being accompanied by enhanced information sharing between services, leading to earlier identification of children&#039;s needs. This in turn allows young people to be referred to the right source of support, at the right time. New Joint Inspection Arrangements will judge the effectiveness and co-ordination of such local provision.

 Royal Mail offer a range of products that provide bulk purchase and business mail discounts, but these apply only where there is a central point of posting and administration which enables Royal Mail to use their automation of bulk postings to reduce operational costs. As Parliament&#039;s pre-paid envelope service provides the ability to post in constituencies anywhere in the UK, often in small volumes, these services are not applicable.

Costs are presently lower than they were in 2002 and the contract is due to be re-let in competition in 2007. Members&#039; bespoke stationery is high quality comprising specially designed and milled environmentally friendly paper and envelopes. The stationery contract includes the provision of a next day delivery anywhere in the UK and a unique management system which allows two accounts to be held for each Member&#151;one for their own stationery and one for the bespoke stationery provided separately by the House.

This triple approach aims to reduce drug taking in the Army as far as is possible in order to maintain the integrity of the force.

The Army tests 85 per cent. of the force annually for all controlled drugs and those who are caught are almost always discharged. Additionally, education and information strategies for substance misuse, including drugs and alcohol, have been developed and are implemented at all stages in the careers of soldiers wherever they are based and on at least an annual basis.

a long stay is expected, patients can be transferred to a hospital local to their home for less acute treatment, enabling them to be nearer to their family. Indeed, a significant proportion of Service personnel requiring hospital treatment in the UK in general are treated, both as emergencies and electively, at other NHS hospitals. The decision to do this is based on relative waiting times and on convenience for the individual patient and the patient&#039;s family.

This includes &#163;5 million and &#163;2.3 million specifically earmarked for TA activities.

 In respect of voluntary returns through Erbil and Sulaymaniyah, returnees assisted by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) are met upon arrival by the IOM. Arrangements are in place at both airports which allow the IOM and their representatives unrestricted access, enabling staff to provide assistance to returnees from the moment they land. They are assisted through immigration, baggage retrieval and customs formalities.

<a name="stpa_28">The IOM arranges with local transportation companies in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah for returnees to be transported via bus or car to their final destination within the three Northern Governorates and their immediate vicinity, this means Kirkuk and Mosul. Arrival is confirmed by the transportation company. For returns through Baghdad, passengers are met at the airport by IOM staff. Only one company is able to provide transportation from Baghdad International airport. The IOM arranges for the returnees to be taken to Baghdad&#039;s main land transportation hubs where onward travel is organised either by taxi or bus. For enforced returns, there is clearly a difficult position in those parts of Iraq most affected by insurgent action, but it is not accepted that this applies to all areas.

<p><a name="st_60"><a name="60510w19.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 There have been some recent developments in respect of immigration detention in Northern Ireland. Until early 2006 it had been the case that where it was necessary to detain individuals in Northern Ireland men were accommodated in the Working Out Unit, Crumlin Road, Belfast and women were accommodated at HMYOC Hydebank Wood.

<p>
<a name="60510w19.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_32">It is now the case that individuals in Northern Ireland who are detained under Immigration Act powers are no longer held in Northern Ireland. Such individuals are transferred to a detention facility in Great Britain either on the day of detention or within 24 hours. In the majority of cases individuals will, initially, be detained at Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre. Individuals whose asylum applications are straightforward and capable of being decided quickly may be held at Oakington Reception Centre.

This would not have been desirable.

 The information sought by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham is not available. Criminal Records Bureau&#039;s standard and enhanced disclosures do not carry any specific period of validity. They are designed to be used by an employer or licensing authority at the point of recruitment for a specific position. With certain exceptions, CRB checks are not mandatory and the decision to undertake them for eligible positions rests with the employer or licensing authority, as does the decision to periodically renew checks on staff, bearing in mind any legal and contractual obligations.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to alter the Criminal Records Bureau registration system following the Bichard Inquiry recommendations.  [69443]</p>




<p><a name="st_68"><a name="60510w21.html_spnew1"><b> Joan Ryan: </b> 
 In 2004 the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) undertook an exercise to evaluate the compliance of Registered Bodies with the Bureau&#039;s Code of Practice. This identified risks to the Disclosure service posed by an increasing and remote Registered Body network. Although the CRB and the Bichard Inquiry recognise the vital role of Registered Bodies in the Disclosure service, both share concern over the high numbers and proficiency of the existing Registered Body network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60510w21.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_42">The CRB will consequently reduce the number of Registered Bodies to work with those that remain to make the network more professional and more experienced in the Disclosure process. This will allow the CRB to ensure that the network of users is fully proficient in the security and policies of the CRB. A minimum threshold of 100 applications per year, per Registered Body has been set. The CRB will provide advice, guidance and support to organisations that do not meet the volume criteria about how they can access the Disclosure service in the future before their registration is cancelled.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60510w21.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_43">The CRB has developed an alternative distribution network, through the Umbrella Body (UB) network to ensure cancelled organisations maintain full access to the Disclosure service. The CRB has been working closely with the existing UB network to ensure that they are able to provide an effective, robust and efficient service and have the capacity to absorb the increased volume of applications from new and cancelled organisations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60510w21.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_44">The CRB have developed a &#039;controlled roll out programme&#039; to ensure that UB&#039;s can manage any increased volume with ease. The CRB have also been encouraging those organisations that remain part of the Registered Body network to become UBs. The UBs are able to offer a great deal of experience in handling and processing CRB checks that can also pay dividends in ensuring that the check is completed as quickly as possible. In addition, improved UB web pages have 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 May 2006 : Column 300W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
been developed and implemented on the CRB website, which provides an enhanced search facility to enable eligible organisations to find a suitable Umbrella Body.

<p><a name="st_69"><a name="60510w21.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 3 May 2006]:</i> In England, resources previously held by the Home Office for the dental care of prisoners have been devolved to those primary care trusts (PCTs) that host a publicly managed prison. This forms part of their general allocation to commission appropriate healthcare services for prisoners. These resources are not ring fenced, and PCTs as part of their commissioning role are able to move resources from one healthcare service to another to meet their specific local needs. It is therefore not possible for us to identify centrally how much is spent on dentistry in prisons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60510w21.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_45">The dental services provided to prisoners are an integral part of primary dental services under the new contractual arrangements for national health service dentistry. PCTs are required to provide all dental services required to meet the reasonable needs of their resident population, including prisoners. In Wales, these resources have been devolved to local health boards. Arrangements in Scotland and Northern Ireland are a matter for the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland office respectively.

<p><a name="st_72"><a name="60510w21.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The importance of involving crime reduction partnership agencies in the resettlement of offenders is recognised in the NOMS regional strategies to reduce re-offending as well as nationally in the Government&#039;s Reducing Re-offending Delivery Plan. In November 2005 Baroness Scotland launched three alliances, including the Civic Alliance which set out how NOMS can work with local authorities and local communities to reduce re-offending.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60510w21.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_46">These are now being rolled out across the nine regions and Wales by Regional Offender Managers (ROMs). The ROM in the East Midlands, along with the Local Government Association and Society of Local Government Chief Executives, is leading a demonstration project on how NOMS will work with local Strategic Partnerships and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) through local area agreements to reduce re-offending in local communities. To date no evaluation of the effectiveness of CDRPs&#039; involvement specifically in the resettlement of ex-prisoners has been completed. However, work has recently begun in London to examine the operation of a scheme aimed at meeting the needs of prisoners resettling in eight London boroughs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60510w21.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_47">The scheme&#151;the London Resettlement Pilot&#151;forms part of the London Resettlement Strategy published in September 2005. The Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in the eight boroughs (Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Brent, Barnet, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Harrow and Ealing) are working with Wormwood Scrubs prison in west London. They have nominated local strategic leaders who are working to develop enhanced and co-ordinated responses to the needs of resettling prisoners. An action research project has been commissioned which will report in summer 2006 on the resettlement pilot and will include an assessment of progress being made through working with local partnerships in this way.

<a name="60510w21.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_48">An evaluation is also currently underway of the impact of Prolific and other Priority Offenders Programme (PPO), which is being implemented by CDRPs and local Strategic Partnerships. One strand of the programme is aimed at rehabilitating and resettling PPOs who are in custody or serving sentences in the community, through closer working between all relevant agencies and continued post-sentence support. A final report on this work is due in autumn 2006.

<a name="stpa_52">IPS introduced in March 2005 a new and comprehensive fraud casework and management information system. This is used for the progression of cases of suspected fraud and the collection, collation and analysis of information relating to passport fraud. Prior to the introduction of this system information relating to frauds detected was collated through manual processes and the analysis of breakdowns of types of fraudulent applications was not available. Figures relating to fraudulent applications involving identity theft and false declarations where the individual was otherwise entitled to a passport, for the period April 2005 to January 2006 are as follows:

 Highly skilled migrants will enter under tier 1 of the proposed points-based system and receive points for a number of attributes including their previous earnings. Under tier 1 of the proposed points-based system high-skilled migrants will receive points for a number of attributes they can demonstrate, including their previous earnings. As with the current High Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP), salaries earned overseas will be converted at an appropriate rate so that we can equate the earnings of equivalent workers between countries which have different income levels. The precise details of the points-based system, including salary conversion rates, are being developed and will be announced in advance of our implementation of the points-based system.

 The Home Secretary has regular meetings with the Secretary of State for Education and Skills.

The Department for Education and Skills, the National Offender Management Service and the national probation directorate (NPD) are working closely to ensure that all prisoners have education opportunities in prison and in the community after release. The throughput of prisoners in establishments (i.e. numbers of prisoners received and discharged on a daily basis, also known as churn&quot;) has increased significantly.

<p><a name="st_95"><a name="60510w23.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The Prison Service already has a scheme at HMP Coldingley that pays prisoners market rates for their work. However any expansion of such a pilot is limited by finding sufficient work that generates income to support such schemes. Under present legislation prisoners cannot be required to contribute directly to the cost of their stay in prison. Section 51 of the Prison Act 1952 requires that all expenses incurred for the maintenance of prisons and prisoners are met from public funds. However some schemes do exist that enable prisoners to make voluntary contributions to a variety of charitable causes, including those for victims. The Prisoners&#039; Earnings Act 1996, which would, if 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 May 2006 : Column 313W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

 An assessment has been made based on the number of in-country work related applications for settlement received each year.

 The Home Office has had significant and regular contact with employers and employers&#039; organisations to discuss the future changes to the immigration system since this increase in the minimum qualifying period for settlement was announced on seven February 2005. Between that date and the introduction of the change we received no views from employers on the substance of the policy, and the views that we have received since have been about the effect of the timing on individuals, not on sectors of business or employment. Most of the views we receive from employers in the normal course of events are that skilled workers do not stay with them for long enough, which, of course, is not affected by this change.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the likely effects on <i>(a)</i> the employability of those on work permits, <i>(b)</i> employers of migrant workers and <i>(c)</i> inward investment of the extension of the residency period required for settlement rights in the UK; and if he will make a statement.

<p><a name="st_103"><a name="60510w24.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The change does not affect anyone&#039;s right to remain and work in the UK; anyone with valid leave to remain and who is continuing in employment will qualify to remain as before and should have no difficulty in completing the fifth year. It will, therefore, have no affect on the employability of those on work permits since their employability is linked first and foremost to the skills that they possess, whether there is an employer who continues to require those skills, and whether the skills are still not available in the resident labour market. In some cases an employer may have to obtain renewal of a work permit and to pay a fee. We wish to maintain the attractiveness of the UK as a destination for investors. But our assessment is that the length of the qualifying period for settlement is of marginal importance in inward investment decisions compared with economic factors and the specific investment opportunities available. The discussions that we have had with representatives include those who 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 May 2006 : Column 316W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
represent individual overseas investors and these discussions have reassured us that the impact of this change on its own is likely to be neutral.

<p><a name="st_104"><a name="60510w24.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Government looked closely at the merits of introducing transitional arrangements for those affected by the increase in the minimum qualifying period for settlement. In deciding not to introduce transitional arrangements the Government was took account, amongst other things, the following: this change does not prevent anyone from doing anything that they are currently doing; it does not limit anyone&#039;s time with any employer or reduce their stay in the United Kingdom in any way; and that to introduce transitional arrangements for those who arrived when the qualifying period was four years would mean that a desirable policy would not take effect until 2011.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what factors affected the timing of the decision in February 2006 to include security personnel working in alarm control centres in the Security Industry Authority (SIA) licensing scheme; how many SIA licences have been issued to personnel working in alarm control centres; and how many SIA licence applications are yet to be processed.

 The Security Industry Authority (SIA) first provided guidance that individuals who use CCTV to &#039;solely identify intruders onto a site&#039; would need a Security Guard licence, as opposed to a CCTV licence, in the Licensing Security Get Licensed&quot; booklet, published in January 2005, not February 2006. The SIA has consistently made this position clear since then. Incorrect advice was given to one company by the SIA&#039;s call centre in October 2005, which was corrected in February 2006. It is not possible to identify how many licensed security guards undertake activities in alarm centres.

2. Caseloads are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

3. These figures are early estimates. Caseload figures are taken from the GMS scan at 17 February 2006. These are adjusted using the historical relationship between WPLS and GMS data to give an estimate of the final WPLS figure. Average amounts are displayed as at the scan reference data of 17 February 2006.<br>

4. Pension credit (PC) replaced minimum income guarantee (MIG) on 6 October 2003. Existing MIG recipients were automatically converted onto pension credit on that date (assuming they still met the eligibility criteria).<br>

5. Household recipients are those people who claim PC either on behalf of themselves only or on behalf of a household. This number is equal to the number of households in receipt of PC.<br>

6. Couples may include partners who are aged less than 60.<br>

7. Parliamentary constituencies are assigned by matching postcodes against the relevant postcode directory.<br>

However, through the EU, we have made representations to the Indonesian Government concerning the death penalty handed down to three Christians convicted of masterminding violence in central Sulawesi in 2000. On 14 November 2005, as EU Presidency, we expressed to the Government of Indonesia the EU&#039;s regret at the decision to carry out the executions, and urged the Indonesian Government not to do so and to consider the abolition of the death penalty altogether. The current EU Presidency, Austria, followed this up with the Government of Indonesia in January 2006 in separate meetings with the Minister of Law and Human Rights and the Attorney-General, and in a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The EU Presidency raised this again during the EU-Indonesia Ministerial Troika meeting in Vienna on 27 March 2006.

 On 23 March 2006 the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) published Getting earlier, better advice to vulnerable people&quot; (www.dca.gov.uk/laid/betteradvice.pdf). This report notes that different areas of Government must work together more effectively to commission advice that fits people&#039;s needs and recommends that the DCA and Legal Services Commission (LSC) work with other Government Departments to ensure that people can easily access appropriate advice across the full range of problems that they face. In particular, the report recommends improving co-ordination between the LSC&#039;s CLS Direct service and other Government funded helplines. The report also links to the LSC&#039;s Community Legal Service Strategy which sets out how the LSC will work in partnership with local authorities to deliver legal advice services.

 A list of all local authority housing stock transfers and arms length management organisations and the number of properties involved in each case has been place in the Libraries of the House.

The list shows the one off payment that was made to discharge the Office&#039;s continued liability, through the Housing Revenue Account (HRA), to pay subsidy on an authority&#039;s housing attributable debt that remains after transfer. This option of paying off debt, as opposed to continuing to pay subsidy, was introduced in 1999 following consultation and is not an extra cost, it is largely a question of when the liability to meet the cost of HRA debt is discharged. There is no debt repayment for ALMOs as the local authority continues to be support through the HRA subsidy system.

 The service development guide &#039;Everybody&#039;s Business&#039; was launched in November 2005 as the next step in the Department&#039;s strategy for improving mental health and care services for older people, including those with dementia. It builds on the existing service models outlined in the &#039;National Service Framework for Older People&#039; (2001) and the principles promoted in &#039;Securing Better Mental Health for Older Adults&#039; (July 2005). One of the main aims of the guide is that older adults with mental health problems and their carers have their needs met wherever they are in the system, including where possible being supported and enabled to live independently at home.

Notes:<br>

1. PDS schemes have varying registration periods. To ensure comparability with corresponding GDS data, PDS registrations for established PDS practices are estimated using proxy registrations, namely the number of patients seen by PDS practices in the past 15 months.<br>

 The Mental Health Act 1983 sets out the circumstances in which people with a mental disorder who are being treated compulsorily under that act may receive electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The act allows ECT to be given to patients who are under compulsory powers when a patient with capacity consents or if the patient&#039;s doctor prescribes it and a second opinion appointed doctor agrees to it. People can also receive ECT voluntarily. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued guidance on the use of ECT in 2003.
