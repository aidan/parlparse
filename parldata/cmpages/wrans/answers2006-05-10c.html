Indeed, a significant proportion of service personnel requiring hospital treatment in the UK in general are treated, both as emergencies and electively, at other NHS hospitals. The decision to do this is based on relative waiting times and on convenience for the individual patient and the patient's family. Additionally, patients requiring more complex rehabilitation for musculo-skeletal conditions can be referred, where appropriate, to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court.</p>

They are designed to be used by an employer or licensing authority at the point of recruitment for a specific position. With certain exceptions, CRB checks are not mandatory and the decision to undertake them for eligible positions rests with the employer or licensing authority, as does the decision to periodically renew checks on staff, bearing in mind any legal and contractual obligations.</p>

This identified risks to the Disclosure service posed by an increasing and remote Registered Body network. Although the CRB and the Bichard Inquiry recognise the vital role of Registered Bodies in the Disclosure service, both share concern over the high numbers and proficiency of the existing Registered Body network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_548"><a name="60510w0015.htm_para0"><a name="06051132000690">The CRB will consequently reduce the number of Registered Bodies to work with those that remain to make the network more professional and more experienced in the Disclosure process. This will allow the CRB to ensure that the network of users is fully proficient in the security and policies of the CRB. A minimum threshold of 100 applications per year, per Registered Body has been set. The CRB will provide advice, guidance and support to organisations that do not meet the volume criteria about how they can access the Disclosure service in the future before their registration is cancelled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_549"><a name="60510w0015.htm_para1"><a name="06051132000691">The CRB has developed an alternative distribution network, through the Umbrella Body (UB) network to ensure cancelled organisations maintain full access to the Disclosure service. The CRB has been working closely with the existing UB network to ensure that they are able to provide an effective, robust and efficient service and have the capacity to absorb the increased volume of applications from new and cancelled organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_550"><a name="60510w0015.htm_para2"><a name="06051132000692">The CRB have developed a &#145;controlled roll out programme' to ensure that UB's can manage any increased volume with ease. The CRB have also been encouraging those organisations that remain part of the Registered Body network to become UBs. The UBs are able to offer a great deal of experience in handling and processing CRB checks that can also pay dividends in ensuring that the check is completed as quickly as possible. In addition, improved UB web pages have been developed and implemented on the CRB website, which provides an enhanced search facility to enable eligible organisations to find a suitable Umbrella Body.</p>

This forms part of their general allocation to commission appropriate healthcare services for prisoners. These resources are not ring fenced, and PCTs as part of their commissioning role are able to move resources from one healthcare service to another to meet their specific local needs.

Government's Reducing Re-offending Delivery Plan. In November 2005 Baroness Scotland launched three alliances, including the Civic Alliance which set out how NOMS can work with local authorities and local communities to reduce re-offending.</p>

To date no evaluation of the effectiveness of CDRPs&#146; involvement specifically in the resettlement of ex-prisoners has been completed. However, work has recently begun in London to examine the operation of a scheme aimed at meeting the needs of prisoners resettling in eight London boroughs.</p>

They have nominated local strategic leaders who are working to develop enhanced and co-ordinated responses to the needs of resettling prisoners. An action research project has been commissioned which will report in summer 2006 on the resettlement pilot and will include an assessment of progress being made through working with local partnerships in this way.</p>

rates for their work. However any expansion of such a pilot is limited by finding sufficient work that generates income to support such schemes. Under present legislation prisoners cannot be required to contribute directly to the cost of their stay in prison. Section 51 of the Prison Act 1952 requires that all expenses incurred for the maintenance of prisons and prisoners are met from public funds. However some schemes do exist that enable prisoners to make voluntary contributions to a variety of charitable causes, including those for victims. The Prisoners' Earnings Act 1996, which would, if implemented, allow deductions to be made, is very complex and prescriptive and would cost substantially more to administer than it would raise in revenue.</p>

It will, therefore, have no affect on the employability of those on work permits since their employability is linked first and foremost to the skills that they possess, whether there is an employer who continues to require those skills, and whether the skills are still not available in the resident labour market. In some cases an employer may have to obtain renewal of a work permit and to pay a fee. We wish to maintain the attractiveness of the UK as a destination for investors. But our assessment is that the length of the qualifying period for settlement is of marginal importance in inward investment decisions compared with economic factors and the specific investment opportunities available. The discussions that we have had with representatives include those who represent individual overseas investors and these discussions have reassured us that the impact of this change on its own is likely to be neutral.</p>
