Department of Health, DEFRA, the Veterinary Laboratories Agency and the devolved Administrations, conducted a risk assessment for the zoonotic potential of this parasite in July 2005. They concluded that the possibility of pathogenicity to humans cannot be excluded but human exposure has not yet been identified. The fluke may only be transmitted to humans through the consumption of raw infected fish from rivers. However, the species which harbour this parasite in endemic countries are unlikely to be consumed by humans. There is no record of Pseudamphistomum truncatum in any fish species in the UK despite regular parasite examination of wild fish populations.</p>

Low numbers of human cases have been reported in Russia and these are associated with consumption of raw fish. Cases in cats and dogs have occurred in the aforementioned countries and in Italy. The pathogencity of the disease is not fully understood but the health of all species including humans only seems to be compromised following severe infections of a chronic nature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_433"><a name="61206w0005.htm_para9"><a name="06120663000330">A UK nuclear operator&#146;s liability for third party property damage and personal injury caused by a nuclear accident is generally limited to &#163;140 million. The limit is set in the Nuclear Installations Act 1965, as amended. The Act gives effect to the UK&#146;s international legal obligations under the Paris Convention on third party nuclear liability and the Brussels Supplementary Convention. The Paris Convention sets a minimum liability limit for nuclear operators. In the event of a nuclear accident for which a UK operator was liable the UK operator would be obliged, as the law stands, to pay compensation very greatly in excess of the Convention minimum and significantly in excess of the OECD recommended minimum. The operator is strictly liable, which means that it would not be necessary for a person seeking compensation for property damage or personal injury to prove negligence. Other requirements and conditions apply under the Act and the Conventions. For example, the operators of licensed nuclear sites in the UK are required to maintain insurance or other financial security covering their liability. The Paris and Brussels Conventions have recently been amended, but the amendments are not in force. Amongst other things, these amendments will, generally speaking, increase the amount of compensation an operator must provide to at least &#8364;700 million per incident. In that context, therefore, the liability limit of UK operators is under review. Work to implement these changes into UK law is being taken forward together with other contracting parties to the Conventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_442"><a name="61206w0005.htm_para18"><a name="06120663000403">In 2000, the UK was instrumental in establishing of the closure of the &#147;wee Bankie&#148; grounds&#151;off the coast of eastern Scotland and North East England&#151;to sandeel fishing to protect breeding seabird populations. We have continued to support the closure in the interim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_443"><a name="61206w0005.htm_para19"><a name="06120663000404">Outside EU waters, but still relevant to Community vessels fishing further afield, there are sea bird by-catch mitigation measures in place under Regional Fisheries Management Organisations. These include the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and the Commission for the Conservation of the Arctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) also has some measures in place. However, these could be more comprehensive. With this in mind, the Government are proposing a study which will assess the impact on sea birds of the Atlantic tuna fishery. The outcome of this research will inform further appropriate conservation management measures.</p>

At the last Maritime Environment Protection Committee meeting in October 2006, the UK made a significant contribution to difficult negotiations on the adoption of Interim Guidelines for Voluntary Ship CO2 Emission Indexing for Use in Trials (as well as Guidelines for On-board Exhaust Gas Sulphur Oxide Cleaning Systems). Ships under the United Kingdom flag are being encouraged to participate in these trials, which will help identify a ship&#146;s greenhouse gas index where the information obtained may be used in the context of reducing CO2 emissions.</p>

The evaluation found that across the Pathfinder areas, the programme has improved the planning and delivery of services to disabled children and their families, particularly through stronger joint working across those agencies involved in providing care and support for these children. It also highlighted the key challenges that many Pathfinder areas still face in successfully integrating services for disabled children around the needs of the child.

In line with Cabinet Office guidance bonuses are awarded to between 60 per cent. and 75 per cent. of SCS members.

Individual performance is relatively assessed at the end of the performance year. There are 4 performance levels.

Detailed criteria are determined by local managers. Awards may be cash or vouchers but the amounts that can be awarded are modest because the total expenditure over the year is limited to 0.25 per cent. of the manager&#146;s staffing budget.</p>

This is something, which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul><a name="61206w0024.htm_brev1"><a name="0612074000345"><ul><p class="tabletext">I enclose a list of the offices that were closed and have indicated in each case whether the office was open full-time or part-time prior to closure. I have placed a copy in the House of Commons Library.</p>
</ul><a name="61206w0024.htm_brev2"><a name="0612074000346"><ul><p class="tabletext">Firstly, as part of the rollout of the new Jobcentre Plus network we have rationalised our estate. We inherited around 1500 offices from the former Employment Service and Benefits Agency, several of which were unsuitable for the new processes, or were in the wrong place or in a poor state of repair. Often, the former agencies had offices situated at either end of the High Street and, in some instances, neither was suitable for conversion to Jobcentre Plus so we closed one or both of them. In each District we undertook detailed service delivery planning exercises in consultation with local stakeholders, identifying the sites which we would convert to the new standard and those, which needed to close. We also explained how, particularly in more rural locations, we would offer outreach services (&#147;flexible service delivery&#148;).</p>
</ul><a name="61206w0024.htm_brev3"><a name="0612074000347"><ul><p class="tabletext">Secondly, as a result of our programme to centralise benefit processing we have identified sites which will no longer be viable once processing work has been taken away from them.</p>
</ul><a name="61206w0024.htm_brev4"><a name="0612074000348"><ul><p class="tabletext">Thirdly, we have been looking very closely at the need for public-facing sites in a number of locations. The increased availability of new channels means that Jobcentre Plus customers can access services directly by telephone or Internet rather than needing to call into one of our offices. Reducing expenditure on our office network is part of our wider strategy for focusing resources more effectively on frontline advisory services to help our customers move into work.</p>
</ul><a name="61206w0024.htm_brev5"><a name="0612074000349"><ul><p class="tabletext">The list of closures should also be set against the 837 offices that we have rolled out to date under our restructuring programme, plus over 150 locations where we have installed flexible service delivery arrangements.</p>
</ul><a name="61206w0024.htm_brev6"><a name="0612074000350"><ul><p class="tabletext">I would emphasise that the closure of any of our offices involves consultation with local stakeholders, including MPs, and putting in place suitable alternative arrangements for delivering services to our customers.</p>

Approximately 19,000 reports of suspected ADRs are sent to the MHRA/CHM through this scheme each year. It is not possible to estimate from the Yellow Card scheme the number of people who suffer adverse drug reactions with a fatal outcome since the scheme is associated with an unknown level of under-reporting.</p>

Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease being treated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_689"><a name="61206w0031.htm_para4"><a name="0612079001348">A study funded by the MHRA and published in the British Medical Journal on 2 July 2004, was conducted in two large hospitals in Merseyside in order to ascertain the current burden of ADRs in the NHS. The study found that of 18,820 patients aged over 16 years admitted to hospital over a six month period, there were 1225 admissions judged to be related to an ADR, giving a prevalence of 6.5 per cent. Of these 1225, the ADR was judged to lead directly to the admission in 80 per cent, of cases. Adverse drug reactions were considered responsible for the death of 0.15 per cent, of all the patients admitted.</p>
