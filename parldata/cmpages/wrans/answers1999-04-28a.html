To ask the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on UK participation in the enforcement of the arms ban on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, set out in UN Security Council Resolution 1160.  [82294]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w01.htm_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The United Kingdom fully supports the UN arms embargo on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was imposed by UNSCR 1160. The embargo is implemented in the UK by means of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (United Nations Sanctions) Order 1998 and is rigorously enforced.
<P>

<a name="90428w01.htm_para0">In addition, the UK participates in international monitoring of the arms embargo through the European Community Monitoring Mission (ECMM).

To ask the Prime Minister what is his <i>(a)</i> policy towards and <i>(b)</i> definition of full accountability and absolute transparency in the European Commission, as set out as future Commission policy by President- nominate Prodi; and what representations he has made on the subject.  [82478]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w01.htm_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Government agree with Mr. Prodi that the European Commission should be made more accountable, more transparent and more efficient. Achieving this will require a fundamental overhaul of the commission's financial control systems, as well as reform of its personnel policies and its management structures.
<P>

<a name="90428w01.htm_para1">We have already shared specific reform ideas with partners. Heads of State and Government discussed plans for reform with Mr. Prodi on 14 April. They will continue their discussions on the basis of proposals put forward by Mr. Prodi at the Cologne European Council in June.

To ask the President of the Council if she will make a statement on her Department's policy when <i>(a)</i> conducting legal proceedings and <i>(b)</i> seeking legal advice as to the circumstances in which Queen's Counsel should be instructed; and for each of the last three years (i) on how many occasions his Department instructed Queen's Counsel and (ii) what was the total cost of instructing Queen's Counsel.  [81763]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 The Privy Council Office rarely, if ever, institutes legal proceedings, but is from time to time required to respond to proceedings initiated by third parties. In such cases the Department would be advised by the Treasury Solicitor's Department on the need to instruct counsel. However, there have been no recent instances (and none within the last three years) when it has been necessary to instruct counsel on behalf of my Department.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 I understand from the Independent Television Commission that over 53 per cent. of all homes in England now have cable available to them. This represents 57 per cent. of homes in urban England.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 We have no such plans. The BBC is required to comply with employment and equal opportunities law and to report annually, in its Annual Report and Accounts, on compliance with the legal requirements. The Annual Report also provides details of progress towards meeting the ethnic targets set by the BBC's Board of Governors and on the proportion of ethnic minorities in management.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 As Minister for Sport, I have attended a number of events where Chelsea officials were present, and I have met officials from the club on the following occasions.

<i>8 July 1997:</i>
<BR>
Meeting with David Blunkett to discuss a Study Centre linked to the Premier League (also in attendance was the President of Brazil and the then Brazilian Sports Minister, Pele). Representatives from many of the Premiership Clubs were in attendance, including Ken Bates, Chairman of Chelsea Football Club.
<BR>
<i>8 September 1997:</i>
<BR>
Meeting with Steve Keen, Lee Deegan, Leslie Smith and Colin Moore to discuss Chelsea Disabled Football Club.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90428w01.htm_para3">I have very good relations with Mr. Bates and frequent discussions with him. In his role as an FA representative, he was involved in the discussions this Department had about the development of Wembley Stadium.
<P>

<a name="90428w01.htm_para4">As part of the FA's Campaign to secure the 2006 World Cup, I have met with a number of FIFA Executive Committee members in this country and have accompanied some of them to Chelsea Football Club to tour the ground and view the impressive facilities there and at Chelsea Village.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w01.htm_wqn12"><B> Mr. Spring: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what discussions he has had with FIFA about the suitability of English stadiums for the World Cup 2006 bid.  [81804]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 None. FIFA has well-established criteria for World Cup host venues.
<P>

<a name="90428w01.htm_para5">As the hon. Member may be aware, the Football Association is required to nominate between eight and 12 stadiums as host venues in the bid document, which it will be submitting to FIFA in July. These stadiums will be subject to inspection by a FIFA Inspection Committee at the end of this year.
<P>

<a name="90428w01.htm_para6">I understand that, following a detailed survey of potential venues, the Football Association has identified 15 stadiums which fulfil the FIFA criteria for World Cup venues and a further five that have the potential to be redeveloped in the run-up to the staging of the 2006 World Cup to meet the criteria.
<P>

<a name="90428w01.htm_para7">The FA are, therefore, well placed to meet FIFA's stadium requirements. This bears testimony to the &#163;565 million which football clubs in this country have spent on the redevelopment of their grounds over the past ten years, helped by &#163;160 million from the Football Trust as a result of the reduction in Pool Betting Duty concession.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the effects of the introduction of herbicide-resistant crops on vulnerable species of birds.  [80792]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I am aware that many species of farmland bird are in decline in Britain and so I take very seriously the potential effect that the introduction of herbicide-resistant crops might have on these vulnerable species.




<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 1999 : Column: 141</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90428w02.htm_para0">The Government have undertaken to fund a four year research programme into the effect of the management of genetically modified herbicide-resistant crops on farmland wildlife as announced in my answer on 15 April 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>301-02</i>. These farm-scale evaluations will begin in spring 1999 and will consider spring and winter-sown oil seed rape and maize. The research programme will concentrate on monitoring the diversity and abundance of plants and invertebrates in GM herbicide-resistant crops compared with conventionally managed non-GM equivalents. It is not planned that birds will be included in the monitoring programme. However, existing research has been able to demonstrate connections between some bird populations and, for example, weed and insect abundance in crops. In this way, the results of the plant and invertebrate monitoring will be used to predict whether an adverse affect on bird populations is likely to occur.

[81770]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions predominately uses junior counsel when it is necessary to instruct counsel to provide legal advice, as does the Treasury Solicitor when instructing counsel in court proceedings involving the Department.
<P>

<a name="90428w02.htm_para1">The two First Treasury Counsel are both junior counsel and they will advise and represent the government without a Queen's Counsel in many of its important civil cases. In addition, the Attorney-General maintains four panels of junior Counsel whom departments are expected to use for the majority of the government's civil litigation. The approval of the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General is required before a Queen's Counsel can be instructed to appear for any government department in civil litigation.
<P>

<a name="90428w02.htm_para2">In determining the level of counsel to use (whether in connection with civil or criminal proceedings, or the provision of legal advice), the department will consider the individual circumstances of each case. It will take into account, amongst other things, the importance and sensitivity of the case, the complexity of the law, the 



<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 1999 : Column: 142</I><P>
weight and complexity of the evidence, and the degree of experience and expertise required before deciding whether to instruct Queen's Counsel or junior counsel.

 The repairs carried out in 1998 to the A38 bridge over the M4 at Almondsbury included road resurfacing and strengthening works necessary to ensure that the structure remained safe for future use.
<P>

<a name="90428w02.htm_para4">The Highways Agency was not satisfied with the surfacing laid by the contractor and negotiations have led to that surface being replaced at no expense to the taxpayer.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what monitoring of air quality has been conducted, and what were the results thereof, in relation to the A13 and abutting residential areas, from the vicinity of Dagenham Dock to Central London; and if he will make a statement.  [82034]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 1999]:</i> Local air quality studies of the existing levels of pollutants were undertaken by the Highways Agency in 1992 and in 



<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 1999 : Column: 143</I><P>
1998 in order to assess the potential effect of the proposed junction improvement schemes for this section of the A13. The most recent monitoring data were gathered in the vicinity of the A13/A112 Prince Regent Lane junction for the period January to May 1998. The pollutants monitored were Carbon Monoxide, PM10, Nitrogen Dioxide, Benzene and 1-3 Butadiene.
<P>

<a name="90428w02.htm_para6">When compared with National Air Quality Strategy (NAQS) objectives, to be achieved in 2005, the monitoring data indicate that the objective for PM10 (50 microgrammes per cubic metre as a running 24 hour mean) is currently exceeded. However, as a non-standard measuring method was used, the scale of this likely exceedence cannot be certain. The 99 percentile of a running 24 hour mean over the monitoring period was 113 microgrammes per cubic metre at the roadside. Mean Nitrogen Dioxide measurements exceeded the value of the NAQS annual mean objective (21 ppb) and were made using the standard method. The mean roadside concentration was 38 ppb. It is therefore possible that the 2005 objective is currently exceeded but a longer period of monitoring would be needed to confirm this. Monitoring of the other pollutants indicated current levels below the 2005 objectives.
<P>

<a name="90428w02.htm_para7">Local authorities are currently monitoring air quality more generally in their areas as part of the local air quality management process, with the aim of achieving the objectives of the NAQS by the year 2005. Where a local authority's review and assessment of local air quality indicates that air quality objectives are not likely to be met, then local authorities must declare Air Quality Management Areas. For each Air Quality Management Area, the local authority must draw up an action plan, setting out measures through which the objectives may be achieved.

<P>
<UL>(2) if he will convene a meeting of representatives of the Highways Agency, the London boroughs and the Traffic Section of the Metropolitan Police to examine what interim measures could be introduced to minimise traffic congestion and to maximise mobility in the westbound section of the A13 from the vicinity of Dagenham Dock to Central London; and if he will make a statement;  [82031]

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Thank you for the Parliamentary Questions that you have tabled on the subjects of congestion, traffic speeds, and mobility on the A13 from Dagenham Dock to Central London. As these are operational matters they have been passed to the Highways Agency for me to reply.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Traffic congestion on the A13, particularly during peak periods, is undoubtedly a problem. The Highways Agency employs a number of methods to monitor congestion on trunk roads such as the A13. These include the formulation of traffic stress maps (Narnas) which were reproduced in the Roads Review report "A New Deal for Trunk Roads in England". A copy of this document has been placed in the House of Commons library and I enclose copies of the London maps for your information. We are developing various ways of monitoring congestion from day to day including analysing data from traffic loops installed in the road and data supplied by Trafficmaster. However, none of these newer systems is yet in operation on the A13.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Traffic speed on the A13 is also an issue. Traffic speeds are monitored by DETR in a programme of speed surveys. Surveys of traffic speeds on the A13 were last carried out in 1995 and 1998. Although the 1998 survey results have not yet been published, provisional indications are that there has been a substantial fall in average speeds during peak times on the A13 between these two dates. This suggests that journey times are getting worse and congestion is increasing on the A13.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We hold regular meetings with representatives of the relevant London Boroughs to discuss the operation, maintenance and management of the A13 with the aim of making the best use of the available road space, to minimise congestion and maximise mobility. This is achieved by implementing a number of policies including ensuring that maintenance is carried out at off-peak times, undertaking small improvement schemes at junctions and optimising traffic signal timings. Acting as our maintaining agents the Boroughs also regularly meet officers from the Metropolitan Police to discuss these issues.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Demand for road space on the A13 does exceed capacity, particularly at peak times. We have nearly completed the construction of a major new route for the A13 extending from Dagenham Dock out to the M25 which will be fully open to traffic later this year. In addition tenders are being assessed for the A13 Thames Gateway Design, Build, Finance, and Operate (DBFO) project as part of the Government's roads programme. This project includes major junction reconstruction schemes at Movers Lane, the A117 near Beckton Alps and Ironbridge to Canning Town, which have been designed to ease congestion and reduce accidents on the A13 between Dagenham Dock and Central London. Subject to a satisfactory tender being accepted they are likely to be completed within five years of the letting of the DBFO contract, due to incentives provided to the DBFO company to programme the schemes early in their contract.</FONT></UL>

 The Figures in the Franchising Director's Quarterly Bulletin (December 1998)--copies in the House Library--show that for the year ending December 1997 0.6 per cent. of trains were cancelled by Great Western Trains and that for the year ending December 1998 the figure was 1 per cent.

 The information is not available in the format requested.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the report leaked from his Department on the impact of genetically modified crops on wildlife and the environment; and if he will make a statement.  [72759]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w03.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 February 1999]:</i> The discussion paper "The Commercial use of Genetically Modified Crops in the United Kingdom: the Potential Wider Impact on Farmland Wildlife" prepared by the Secretariat for the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) was published on 18 February 1999. The paper may be found on ACRE's website (www.environment.detr.gov.uk/acre/wildlife/index.htm) or in ACRE's latest Annual Report, a copy of which is in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90428w03.htm_para3">The leaked report was an early draft of the one published. This early draft had served as a basis for a meeting I chaired in June last year to advise me on the possible wider indirect effects of the use of GM crops on wildlife. I invited a number of experts, including English Nature, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the chairman of ACRE, to inform me of the issues to enable us to get an initiative started to address concerns about wider impacts on biodiversity from the use of genetically modified crops.
<P>

<a name="90428w03.htm_para4">My officials then developed the paper with ACRE. The key conclusion of the paper is that there have been serious declines in farmland wildlife, and we need to ensure that the widespread introduction of GM crops does not prejudice Government objectives to halt and where possible reverse these wildlife declines. To this end, it is important to have the capability to identify whether and how GM crops are likely to change agricultural practices which could result in indirect, delayed and long term adverse effects on farmland wildlife. I have already taken steps to address this.
<P>

<a name="90428w03.htm_para5">Before this paper was published, I requested that the remit of ACRE be extended to consider the potential wider implications of the use of GMOs, especially when the committee is requested to give advice on applications to place GM crops on the market. ACRE has set up a Sub-group on Wider Biodiversity Issues to consider the issues raised the paper in more detail. The first meeting of this Sub-group was held on 15 March. The farm-scale evaluations into the ecological effects of genetically modified crops being set up by my Department, MAFF and Scottish Office will also assist in providing baseline

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will ensure that the pay and conditions of service of service men and women serving in Macedonia are comparable with those service men and women of other NATO countries.  [82228]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The pay and conditions of service of personnel serving in the armed forces of NATO are governed by the needs and circumstances of individual member states and reflect the composition and role of their armed services. In the case of the UK, the pay and conditions of service package, which is recommended by the independent Armed Forces Pay Review Body, reflects the fully professional status of our armed forces and their expectation of unlimited liability for world-wide deployment throughout a career.
<P>

<a name="90428w05.htm_para0">Basic pay includes a component known as the X Factor, currently 12 per cent. for regulars, which recognises, among other things, the need to serve sometimes in difficult and dangerous situations. Unlike special operational allowances which may be paid to other countries' armed forces when on deployment, the X Factor is paid through a whole UK Service career and is pensionable. Other career benefits include, subsidised food and accommodation, assisted house purchase schemes and--while away on 



<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 1999 : Column: 154</I><P>
operations--a special allowance to compensate for longer periods of separation known as Longer Separated Service Allowance which is payable after three years' total service. In addition, special arrangements have been made to provide our Service men and women with a wide range of supportive and welfare measures while they are deployed to the Balkans. These include the availability of 10 minutes of free telephone calls per week, return flights for rest and recreation in UK for those deployed in excess of 4 months and some free mail facilities.
<P>

<a name="90428w05.htm_para1">Overall, it is difficult and misleading to attempt to draw precise comparisons between the different nations' armed forces serving in Macedonia based on a single aspect such as pay. A full comparison of terms and conditions of service, or the spectrum of welfare provision and facilities, is necessary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w05.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 Because of the nature of the liabilities involved, it is not always possible to quantify accurately the potential contingent liability or to provide a realistic estimate of the likely charge that would result if the liabilities were to mature. In these cases, the term "unquantifiable" is used to describe the liabilities in question. If the indemnities were to be called upon, provision for any payment would be sought through the Supply procedure.

 <i>[holding answer 26 April 1999]:</i> Surviving spouses of members of the RAF, like those of other Service personnel, are generally entitled to receive a widow's pension. There are two exceptions: pensions are not paid to widows or widowers who married their partner before 1978 but after their partner had left the armed forces; and pensions are withdrawn from widows and widowers who remarry (although they may be restored if their second spouse subsequently dies). From time to time we receive representations to extend entitlements to these groups, and we shall examine them again as part of the current review of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme.

 The Department has not undertaken any research on the ability of operating department practitioners to provide care in other areas. Guidance has been issued on good recruitment practice which applies to all National Health Service staff. All NHS employers have a "duty of care" to ensure that all their employees are qualified and competent to perform the duties for which they are employed. This duty includes ensuring that high standards of patient care are maintained at all times.

 No prisoner has been placed on home detention curfew who has been convicted of an offence to which part I of the Sexual Offenders Act 1997 applies.

<a name="90428w07.htm_para1">Of the 3,730 offenders who have been placed on home detention curfew up to Monday 19 April, 617 offenders have a current conviction for an offence of violence.
<P>

<a name="90428w07.htm_para2">Only prisoners serving less than four years are eligible for consideration for home detention curfew. All eligible prisoners must pass a risk assessment before they can be placed on home detention curfew. Prisoners who either pose a risk to the public or a risk of re-offending during the home detention curfew period, or are unlikely to comply with terms of curfew, will not be granted home detention curfew.

 We have always made it clear that the United Kingdom stands ready to receive some thousands of refugees from that region on criteria agreed with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) who gives priority to relieving pressure on the camps by giving priority to the most vulnerable and those with family links in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="90428w07.htm_para3">Under these arrangements, the first arrivals-- 161 refugees, mainly women and children--came to the United Kingdom on Sunday and are being looked after in Leeds.

<P>

<a name="90428w07.htm_para4">On arrival, the refugees were given a basic health check to determine if anyone needed immediate medical attention; none of the refugees needed immediate hospital treatment. At the reception centres, each refugee will be given a more thorough health check and be assigned a General Practitioner; children of school age will be assigned to a local school and refugees will be put in touch with any known relatives or friends.

 As shown in the table, there have been thirteen occasions on which a payment to a contractor managing a prison has been reduced. The table includes Blakenhurst prison which is also managed by a contractor. There is no distinction between a fine and a reduction in payment because a fine is made by being deducted from a due payment.

 The arrangements are set out in Prison Standing Order 5D. Prisoners can request or consent to a visit from a Member of Parliament, upon which the Governor will produce a valid special visiting order. The Governor will also ensure that the visit does not take place within the hearing of prison staff, unless either party or security considerations demand otherwise. The Governor can also permit the Member to tape record any conversation which takes place during the visit. This, along with other special visits, including those from legal advisers and priests or ministers, does not normally count against the prisoner's allowance for visits.

<P>
<a name="90428w08.htm_spnew6"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 I understand that the negotiations between the Metropolitan police and Surrey police have made good progress on the wide range of detailed issues which need to be resolved in order to ensure a smooth transfer of responsibility on 1 April 2000. These negotiations take place bilaterally or, where appropriate, in a wider forum involving Essex police and Hertfordshire Constabulary, the other two forces affected by the change to the Metropolitan police district boundary. All four forces are represented on the central consultative group which the Home Office has set up to bring together all interested parties. There has been an excellent spirit of co-operation throughout.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to his answer of 21 April 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>592</i>, on winter fuel payments, what is the additional cost of paying the winter fuel payment separately from the basic state pension.  [82190]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w09.htm_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 To include the full amount of the Winter Fuel Payment with the Retirement Pension of every eligible pensioner would involve using a qualifying week at the end of the previous winter. This is because Retirement Pension order books last for up to 20 weeks and are printed and issued well in advance. As a result, large numbers of people who retire after the qualifying week would not be eligible for a payment the following winter. In addition, allowing such a substantial interval to elapse would mean changes of household circumstances amongst many of those in the eligible population.

<a name="90428w09.htm_para22">It would be possible to make a payment of &#163;50 to every eligible pensioner at the beginning of each winter by including that amount along with their qualifying benefit. However, an exercise would then be necessary, after the qualifying week, to identify those who live alone or those who are the only eligible pensioner in their household, and make an additional &#163;50 payment. This method would correctly deliver &#163;50 payments to about 4.5 million pensioners but require two separate payments to about 5.5 million pensioners every winter.
<P>

<a name="90428w09.htm_para23">The administration cost of this option is estimated at around &#163;12.5 million in the first year and &#163;10 million in subsequent years. The cost of the present delivery mechanism is estimated at &#163;11 million each year. Therefore, including the payment along with the qualifying benefit is estimated to cost an additional &#163;1.5 million in the first year, followed by a saving of around &#163;1 million in subsequent years. The method of payment for this winter is designed to give all eligible pensioners a single, well timed payment before Christmas.
<P>

<a name="90428w09.htm_para24">Methods of payment for future years will be kept under review.

The table illustrates the combined effect of the 1999 Budget and the Government's reforms since the election which will see the numbers of those facing marginal rates of over 70 per cent. reduced by two thirds, significantly relieving the poverty trap.
<P>

<a name="90428w10.htm_para2">The increased generosity of the Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) compared with Family Credit will see an extension of in work support for families with children. Even those whose marginal rate increases as a result of this change will be better off in cash terms and see an increased return to working compared to being on benefit. On average, WFTC will give low earning families an extra &#163;24 per week compared with Family Credit.

 <i>[holding answer 31 March 1999]:</i> The Government have already allocated significant resources to these and other initiatives as part of their commitment to promote social inclusion in Scotland. The figures given relate to funding committed or estimated to be spent over the financial years 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02.
<P>

<a name="90428w10.htm_para10">For most of these programmes, some of the committed funds have yet to be allocated to specific areas of Scotland. Where this is the case, the figures given include the total already allocated; the amount already allocated to Glasgow; and the amount which remains to be allocated. Furthermore, some of the figures given are estimated rather than formal allocations.
<P>

<a name="90428w10.htm_para11">It is estimated that &#163;290 million will be spent on the New Deals in Scotland in the next three years (1999-2000 to 2001-02). Of this, it is estimated that at least &#163;54 million will be spent in Glasgow (no decision has yet been made on resources available for Glasgow under the New Deal for the Disabled). These figures make no provision for underspends in the period until March 1999.
<P>

A number of other projects are still under consideration and may receive financial support during this period. Over the next three years it is estimated that a total of &#163;12.4 million will be spent in Scotland on NFF projects.
<P>

<a name="90428w10.htm_para13">We plan to invest &#163;26 million to pilot New Community Schools in every education authority over the next 3 years. On this basis, it is estimated that &#163;1 million of the funds will be spent in Glasgow.

<P>

<a name="90428w10.htm_para17">Of the &#163;208 million which has been earmarked to councils to support New Housing Partnerships (NHPs), &#163;32 million has been earmarked for Glasgow. A total of &#163;333 million has been committed to support NHPs in Scotland over the next 3 years. &#163;125 million of that total has been set aside for assistance with debt in connection with whole stock transfers.
<P>

<a name="90428w10.htm_para18">Of the &#163;7 million to be spent under the Rough Sleepers Initiative in 1999-2000, &#163;2.4 million has been allocated to Glasgow. A further &#163;14 million has been committed to the initiative in the following 2 years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how many Commission staff will receive clearance, in accordance with 1999/218/EC (Official Journal L80, 25.3.99), for access to <i>(a)</i> confidential, <i>(b)</i> secret and <i>(c)</i> top secret material; what categories of information are covered; what is his policy thereto; what contribution to screening Government agencies will make, and at what cost; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="90428w11.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Commission Decision 1999/218/EC extends Decision C(94)3282 of 30 November 1994 on the security vetting of European Commission staff to cover documents relating to the Common Foreign and Security Policy. It does not affect the security clearance of staff already working for the Commission.
<P>

<a name="90428w11.htm_para8">There have been no applications to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (which is responsible for the security vetting of all UK nationals directly recruited to work at the Commission) by the European Commission for the security clearance of UK nationals since the publication of Commission Decision 1999/218/EC. It is expected that the numbers of Commission staff cleared by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office each year will remain the same (ie six or seven a year). Similarly, the Commission do not expect the overall number of their staff requiring security clearance to rise significantly.
<P>

<a name="90428w11.htm_para9">The vetting procedures set out in Commission Decision 1999/218/EC are applicable to classified information held by the Commission, including that relating to the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office are usually asked to clear Commission staff to see up to and including Secret material. The cost of security vetting is approximately &#163;11 for Confidential clearance and &#163;149 for Secret clearance.

<a name="90428w12.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We take the matter of illegal fishing in the Falkland Islands seriously and it is our shared objective with the Falkland Islands Government to combat the problem. Illegal fishing has the potential to undermine the Falklands economy and attempts to conserve fish stocks. Recently, there have been up to an estimated 50 unlicensed vessels in Falklands waters and we assume that all were engaged in illegal fishing activities. The number of vessels now appears to be declining.
<P>

<a name="90428w12.htm_para0">In January this year, we authorised the arming of a Fisheries Protection Vessel (FPV) with a 20mm Oerlikon cannon, which is the best weapon for the task of deterring illegal fishing and dealing with it, if necessary. The Falkland Islands Government (FIG) are responsible for the procurement and shipment of the cannon. This process has taken longer than anticipated. We have tried to help FIG speed up the shipment of the consignment but it cannot be carried on a passenger aircraft together with the ammunition needed. Accordingly, the Ministry of Defence has agreed to fly the cannon out on the next freight flight on 6 May.
<P>

<a name="90428w12.htm_para1">FIG requested approval for temporary use of a smaller, 0.50 inch, machine gun on an FPV, as an interim measure. This request was carefully considered and a decision was made not to give approval. The machine gun is not a good visible deterrent and there are concerns that warning shots, which the FPV would be required to fire to alert a suspected unlicensed vessel, would not be seen or heard.
<P>

<a name="90428w12.htm_para2">As a temporary measure, the Ministry of Defence has agreed to our request for one of the Royal Navy vessels stationed in the Falklands to accompany an FPV on its patrols. We have also made representations to the Taiwanese authorities in London and Taipei, as the majority of unlicensed vessels in Falklands waters are theirs. We shall continue to urge the Taiwanese authorities to bring their fleet under control.
<P>

<a name="90428w12.htm_para3">We have received representations on this issue from FIG and its Fisheries Department, several MPs and from members of the public. Commercial operators who are licence-holders have made indirect representations.
<P>

<a name="90428w12.htm_para4">We shall continue to support FIG in its attempts to combat illegal fishing.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the application of the provisions of the White Paper, Partnership for Progress and Prosperity, concerning environmental protection to the waters within the Falkland Islands Fisheries Protection Zone; and what plans he has to ensure that the Falkland Fisheries Department is equipped to implement that policy.  [81878]<P>

Effective management of the fishery helps in efforts to conserve fish stocks. Enforcement of the licensing regime is the responsibility of the Falkland Islands Fisheries Department which have two Fisheries Protection Vessels at their disposal. Ministers have authorised the Falkland Islands Government to purchase a 20mm Oerlikon Mk7A cannon for installation on one of the vessels to help deter unlicensed vessels from fishing in Falklands waters. There are no further plans at present.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps he has taken to assist the Falklands Islands Government to meet its international obligations in terms of conserving living resources around its coastline, as set out in the White Paper, Partnership for Progress and Prosperity; and if he will make a statement.  [81877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w12.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 As stated in the White Paper: Partnership for Progress and Prosperity, British accession to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was extended to the Overseas Territories including the Falkland Islands. Article 61 of UNCLOS requires States to take measures to conserve living marine resources in their exclusive economic zones (EEZs). In the Falkland Islands, the requirement is met through the administration of its fishery. The Falkland Islands has no EEZ, nor does it have to declare one.
<P>

<a name="90428w12.htm_para5">Article 61 also requires the Falkland Islands to co-operate within regional fisheries organisations to meet conservation and management aims. To promote such co-operation, Falkland Islands Government officials form part of the British delegation which attends regular meetings of the South Atlantic Fisheries Commission (SAFC) with the Argentines. SAFC is a forum for the exchange of information which assists with the management of fish stocks and in which ways of conserving of commercially important fish stocks in the South Atlantic are discussed. We continue to support the European Union in its efforts to encourage Argentina to help establish a South West Atlantic Multilateral Fisheries Agreement.

 The Government are committed to bringing to an end the use of child soldiers in contravention of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

As a percentage of teaching time, these times are approximately: Key Stage 1--6.3 per cent.; Key Stage 2--6.8 per cent.; Key Stage 3--8.3 per cent. and Key Stage 4--5.2 per cent. These figures do not account for travelling and changing time incurred in the provision of swimming tuition. At Key Stage 4, the figure relates to the time allowed for the National Curriculum compulsory component of PE. Pupils studying for GCSE normally have between 8 per cent. and 12 per cent. extra time for the examination course.<P>

 Decisions on how best to refurbish science laboratories in schools rest with individual local education authorities and governing bodies.

The Department provides guidance in its 1995 publication, 'Science Accommodation in Secondary Schools: A Design Guide'. This is currently being updated.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment she has made of the condition of public parks and play areas in Northern Ireland and the impact of social and policing problems related to the conflict of the past 30 years on such facilities.  [81626]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w15.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Any assessment of the condition of public parks and play areas in Northern Ireland would be a matter for individual district councils. I am not aware that a general survey of these facilities has been carried out. The impact of social and policing problems over the years has not, therefore, been considered by central government.

 The establishment and upkeep of parks and play areas in Northern Ireland are functions of district councils. The Government have no plans to provide financial assistance or to make improvements in these areas.

<P>
<a name="90428w15.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 All civil servants are required to observe rules on engagement in political activities liable to give public expression to political views. The rules are intended to protect the political impartiality of the Civil Service whilst giving individuals the greatest possible freedom to participate in public affairs.
<P>

<a name="90428w15.htm_para2">The extent to which a member of staff is permitted to engage in political activity, and whether they are required to seek permission from their department, is determined by reference to the grade of the individual and the nature of their official duties. Even where permission has been granted, the individual is required to observe fully the general rules on conduct and the code of discretion which governs the extent to which a civil servant may express political views.
<P>

<a name="90428w15.htm_para3">All staff are barred from any form of political activity whilst on duty or in uniform or on official premises.
<P>

<a name="90428w15.htm_para4">The rules on political activity are contained in the Northern Ireland Civil Service Pay and Conditions of Service Code which is available to all staff. Similar rules applying to Home Civil Servants are contained in their Staff Handbook.

 Following an internal investigation, and having considered representations made by him, the Department of the Environment (NI) concluded that the officer concerned had, by his comments and actions in November 1995, breached the Conduct section of the Northern Ireland Civil Service Pay and Conditions of Service Code. The officer consequently received, in December 1998, a formal written reprimand and a warning as to his future conduct.
<P>

<a name="90428w15.htm_para5">As disciplinary action involving a civil servant is an internal matter which is dealt with by his/her employing Department in confidence, and in strict accordance with established procedures, it is not appropriate for any papers relating to this internal investigation to be placed in the Library.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90428w15.htm_para6">I answer this question on behalf of the Northern Ireland Office because as Attorney-General for Northern Ireland I have statutory superintendence of the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland and appoint the Crown Solicitor and Senior and Junior Crown Counsel in Northern Ireland. Senior Crown Counsel is a Queen's Counsel. Both Counsels are retained by the Crown to undertake work on behalf of the Government and Northern Ireland Departments.
<P>

<a name="90428w15.htm_para7">In civil cases, in conducting Government work, the most important work would be undertaken by Senior Crown Counsel. In other cases where a Queen's Counsel is required and it is not possible to instruct Crown Counsel, either because of his workload or because of the need for specialist skills, a Queens Counsel is instructed from amongst the Bar of Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="90428w15.htm_para8">The Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland nominates three counsels, one of whom is a Queen's Counsel, to whom he would first have recourse to prosecute the most serious of prosecutions. Thereafter, in any case requiring a Queen's Counsel he would instruct counsel from the Bar of Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="90428w15.htm_para9">In determining whether a Queen's Counsel is to be instructed, the Crown Solicitor and the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland will consider the 



<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 1999 : Column: 192</I><P>
individual circumstances in each case. They will take into account, inter alia, the weight and complexity of the evidence and the degree of experience and expertise required before deciding whether Queen's Counsel should be instructed.
<P>

<a name="90428w15.htm_para10">It should be understood that Northern Ireland is a separate jurisdiction with its own laws, courts and independent Bar. The role of counsel also differs from that of counsel in England and Wales: in particular, in criminal cases, in relation to the contact counsel in Northern Ireland has with witnesses and victims. The consideration given to the instruction of counsel by the Crown Solicitor and Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland will be made in the light of the particular circumstances of the separate jurisdiction of Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="90428w15.htm_para11">Records are not maintained in a form which would enable the number of occasions on which the Crown Solicitor and the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland have instructed Queen's Counsel in the last three years, and the cost of doing so, to be given without incurring disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="90428w15.htm_para12">The Compensation Agency for Northern Ireland and the Departmental Solicitor's Office will both, on occasions, instruct Queen's Counsel on the same basis as the Crown Solicitor and the Director of Public Prosecutions of Northern Ireland.

 The latest available information relating to delayed discharges from hospital is shown by NHS Trust in the following table. Information relates to a chosen day in January 1999 (usually 31 January 1999), as reported in local authority responses to the Survey of Delayed Discharges from Hospital. The survey requested information on the numbers of hospital patients known to local authority social services departments, who were medically fit to be discharged, but were still occupying a hospital bed. All patients medically fit to be discharged are counted; this may include patients whose delay came within agreed timescales for the discharge process.

 The National Library of Wales is already planning a major exhibition about the life of Owain Glyndwr for the year 2000. I have asked the National Library and the National Museums and Galleries of Wales, in co-operation, to explore urgently the practicalities of acquiring the Seal and the Letter on loan. The nature of the artefacts is such that they could be displayed only in the strictly controlled environment that can be provided by the Library and the Museum. I have asked to be informed of the outcome, and will keep my hon. Friend informed.

 Records of cases kept by the courts do not provide sufficient information to enable a search to be made by reference to the particular legislation under which the actions have been brought. However, when product liability cases brought under Part I of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 raise significant points of law, judgments given in them would be reported in published law reports, and these are monitored by the Department. The Secretary of State made a report to Parliament under section 42 of the 1987 Act on action taken under Part II of the Act (product safety) on 25 November 1998 (ISBN O 10 252299 5).

 The possibility of a sectoral liberalisation agreement reducing tariffs on forest products and other limited sectors is being proposed by the US and other members of APEC for agreement at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle. The primary objective of the Conference is to launch a new comprehensive round of trade negotiations, including industrial tariffs, agriculture, services and technical standards and a range of other issues. The UK's priority issues were set out in my previous answer to the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) of 21 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>548</i>. The UK and the EU are concerned not to lose momentum for launching the wider negotiations at Seattle by focusing only on limited sectors. We do not rule out early agreements on tariffs including the forest product sector during the course of the new round as part of a comprehensive package of negotiations.

 Data on the incidence of rodents in England were collected in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions' 1996 English House Condition Survey on behalf of MAFF. The results should be published later this year. The sample size of the survey does not permit figures for individual local authorities to be produced.

 Consumers need information on the minimum durability of food products, so that food can be consumed within its recommended period and while it retains its specific properties. This need is met by the legal requirement to provide 'use by' or 'best before' dates for most prepacked foods. Information on the varying ages of the individual ingredients would not enable consumers to use food within the appropriate timescale.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90428w20.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 February 1999]:</i> The European Commission inspected our procedures for operating the Date-based Export Scheme (DBES) from 12 to 16 April. During their visit, the inspectors were given demonstrations of the practical operation of the DBES in three slaughterhouses--one in England, one Scotland and one in Northern Ireland. They also visited two farms, an incinerator, an Animal Health Divisional Office and the new Unit in Gloucester which will run the Scheme.

<a name="90428w20.htm_para4">The Commission are now writing a report of their inspection for presentation to the Standing Veterinary Committee (SVC). After the SVC have seen the inspection report, the Commission should set a date from which exports of UK beef produced under the DBES can start.

<P>
<a name="90428w20.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 There is no evidence, from MAFF-funded research, of cross hybridisation between oilseed rape and weeds in field trials. However, the research is still at an early stage and it is not possible to exclude the possibility that hybrids may be found. There have been reports of herbicide-resistant wild turnip in oilseed rape fields in some part of the UK. It is likely that the wild turnip, a close relative of oilseed rape, is naturally resistant to the same herbicides as is unmodified oilseed rape.
