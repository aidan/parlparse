<P>
34. <a name="31202w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Allen: </B> 
 To ask the Leader of the House if he will make it his policy to encourage Select Committees to subject all proposals for Bills to pre-legislative scrutiny on-line.  [140764]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31202w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Woolas: </B> 
 It is for individual committees to decide, when conducting pre-legislative scrutiny, whether to make arrangements for on-line scrutiny or e-consultation. I hope that committees will, as a matter of course, consider the opportunities provided by information technology, including on-line fora of the kind used successfully by the Joint Committee on the draft Communications Bill in 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31202w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 I am strongly in favour of making the Commons more welcoming for voters. I can report that the House of Commons Commission has asked the Administration and Accommodation and Works Committees to examine what improvements can be made and to report by Easter.

<P>
36. <a name="31202w01.html_wqn2"><B> Chris Bryant: </B> 
 To ask the Leader of the House what assessment he has made of the impact of the new sitting hours of the House.  [140766]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31202w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Woolas: </B> 
 In October last year, a majority of Members voted to alter the sitting hours so that the House now sits from 11.30 am on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Standing Orders were changed for the rest of this Parliament, which will allow us a sufficient period to make a considered judgment on the effect of the changes.
<P>

<a name="31202w01.html_para0">My right hon. Friend is aware that some Members have difficulty with the new hours, but that there is strong opinion on both sides.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31202w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 The Church Commissioners support the view of the McClean review group that this important and complex work cannot, and should not, be rushed.
<P>

<a name="31202w01.html_para1">Good progress has been made. The review has completed the first phase of its work (considering clergy without security of tenure) according to the timetable in its terms of reference. It will report to the Archbishops' Council on 9 December and it is hoped that there will be a debate by the General Synod in February, followed by a period of consultation with dioceses and clergy.
<P>

<a name="31202w01.html_para2">It is hoped that the second phase of the group's work (addressing the position of clergy with the freehold and any follow-up from the first phase) will be completed by the end of 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when he will publish the Cory report.  [140906]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31202w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The Government are committed to publishing Justice Cory's reports as soon as possible, in line with the judge's terms of reference. These made it clear that any issues involving national security, the criminal process or the safety of individuals, would need to be considered carefully first.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what proportion of the NHS budget for Northern Ireland in each year since 1997 was spent on private treatment; what plans he has to facilitate retrospective payment for treatment carried out privately; and if he will make a statement.  [140810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31202w01.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 Information about the proportion of the health budget in Northern Ireland relating to private treatment is not available.
<P>

<a name="31202w01.html_para3">As regards retrospective payment for treatment carried out privately, an agreement with the relevant area Health and Social Services Board for the cost to be met must be made prior to treatment commencing. To be eligible, the patient must meet certain criteria, namely that the treatment required is not available in Northern Ireland and that the patient's consultant recommends treatment elsewhere.

The following table gives a breakdown for each year and the place of recruitment of the other 1,278 volunteers. The figures for 2003&#150;04 are estimates because there are still placements to be filled.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of the outbreak of cholera in Binga, Zimbabwe.  [140467]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31202w01.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 A cholera outbreak has been reported in the two northern districts of Kariba (in Mashonaland West province) and Binga (in Matabeleland North province). A total of 173 cases and 26 deaths have so far been reported. WHO have commented that this fatality rate of approximately 15 per cent. is alarmingly high, probably due to the declining capacity of the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health to respond, and the growing food shortages. Latest reports indicate that the situation is under control in Binga, where no new infections are being recorded, but appears to be spreading in Kariba district.
<P>

<a name="31202w01.html_para4">Save the Children (UK) are using emergency response resources provided by DFID to address the situation in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, UNICEF, WHO, M&#233;dicine Sans Fronti&#232;res (Spain) and several other NGOs. The aim is to ensure that the disease does not spread further and that those communities at risk are assisted with soap and other hygiene items, as well as water purification tablets and ORS supplies to treat diarrhoea.
<P>

<a name="31202w01.html_para5">Cholera outbreaks are becoming more frequent in the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe. Save the Children (UK) are planning to use the lessons learnt during their response to this outbreak in order to conduct rapid response training for other relevant organisations involved in humanitarian operations in Zimbabwe.

There has been no error made by the Office for National Statistics.

 The Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Bill will amend the Scotland Act by breaking the link between the number of MSPs and the number of MPs from Scottish constituencies. The proposal to transfer to the Supreme Court the function of hearing devolution disputes currently held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council would also require an amendment to the Scotland Act.

 The scope of the bill, which was introduced on 27 November, is a matter for the House Authorities. However, as the bill deals only with the determination of the number of constituencies and regions of the Scottish Parliament, the number of regional members per region and the arrangements for reviewing the boundaries of constituencies and regions, my understanding is that consideration of the method of election to the Scottish Parliament will be outside its scope.

Emphasising that she was also speaking on my behalf, Fontaine proposed that a similar event involving business leaders from across the value chain should be held at EU level in order to help promote the most effective conditions for broadband. Other member states, including the forthcoming Irish Presidency, expressed strong interest in carrying the initiative forward.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment has been made of the implications for safety of the procedure of turning a rail track; whether the turning of a curved rail track has been assessed as having a safety implication; and if he will make a statement.  [141179]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31202w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 This is an operational matter for Network Rail and as with all safety issues, the Health and Safety Executive. I am however assured by Network Rail that turning or 'transposing' of rail is carefully controlled to ensure that only rail with sufficient head width is transposed. In such cases rail standards with clearly defined limits for permissible side wear exist.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what inspection methods are in place to discover <i>(a)</i> corrosion pitting and <i>(b)</i> possible problems at the foot and web of a rail track; what plans he has to improve inspection methods relevant to these conditions; and if he will make a statement.  [141180]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31202w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 This is an operational matter for Network Rail who inform me that a number of new techniques are currently under trial or development to improve the detection of rail depth, corrosion pitting and gall over sleepers.
<P>

<a name="31202w03.html_para5">Ultrasonic Testing vehicles are now routinely monitoring rail depth for most major routes and guided ultrasonic equipment is currently being trailed which carries out inspection of the whole cross section of the rail from a fixed point using low frequency longitudinal ultrasonic waves. This should enable significant changes in section in the head, web or foot of the rail to be detected whether due to cracking or loss of section due to corrosion.
<P>

<a name="31202w03.html_para6">Coated rail products are also being used successfully in the network where local environments are harsh. This provides a barrier coating to the head and foot of the rail preventing corrosion or damage.

For the 1971, 1981 and 1991 Censuses, responses to some questions which needed detailed coding and were, therefore, expensive to process were processed for only a 10% sample of forms. The samples were drawn randomly. Guidance given to users for 1971 and 1981 was to gross up the figures to 100% by multiplying the sample figures by 10. In 1991 guidance was different in that users were advised to estimate 100% figures by multiplying the sample count by a sampling factor, slightly over 10 to take account of the numbers of households imputed in the 100% figures but which were not included in the 10% sample. This grossing factor varied from area to area. For households in England and Wales it was 10.2.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of fiscal measures to <i>(a)</i> stimulate and <i>(b)</i> support the domestic production of wine.  [141065]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31202w05.html_spnew6"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government are mindful of the concerns and interests of UK wine producers. The UK wine industry has benefited from duty freezes in three out of the last six Budgets and increases only in line with inflation in the remainder of these.
<P>

<a name="31202w05.html_para2">We have not looked at fiscal measures for all UK wine producers but we have looked at the possibility of fiscal measures that would help small UK wineries to survive and grow. However, the European Directive on the structure of alcohol duties does provides for reduced rates targeted at small breweries which we have implemented in the UK, it does not provide for reduced rates targeted at small wineries.
<P>

<a name="31202w05.html_para3">Even if the UK were to press for the introduction of such a scheme, it is important to appreciate that less than 1 per cent. of the wine consumed in the UK is domestically produced. Under our European and world trade agreements we could not apply such a scheme to UK wine producers only and it is therefore likely that much of the wine that would qualify would come from overseas producers, with our own small wineries receiving comparatively very little of the benefit.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31202w05.html_spnew7"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 On 7 October, ECOFIN Council reached political agreement on a Common Position on the proposed Investment Services Directive, by qualified majority. The UK, Ireland, Luxembourg, Sweden and Finland voted against the text put forward by the Presidency.
<P>

<a name="31202w05.html_para4">The Government voted against the text proposed at ECOFIN because it contained unsatisfactory elements that the Government believed meant that it would fall short of its objective of promoting an efficient, effective and dynamic single market in investment services.
<P>

<a name="31202w05.html_para5">The Government was particularly disappointed by the outcome on the pre-trade transparency regime for investment firms that systematically internalise client orders. It believes that the regime proposed would be a step backward for some share-trading markets in the EU, including the UK, and would be a missed opportunity to increase competition and efficiency in many markets in the EU.
<P>

<a name="31202w05.html_para6">The Government will continue to press for changes to the Directive, especially through the second reading process in the European Parliament. In doing so, it will focus on achieving changes to the pre-trade transparency regime for investment firms that would be consistent with the European Parliament's first reading amendments.
<P>

<a name="31202w05.html_para7">At ECOFIN Council on 25 November, the Government secured agreement to a Declaration, to be adopted alongside the Council Common Position, which reiterates the Council's support for adoption of the Investment Services Directive by April 2004 and, more importantly, indicates a willingness on the part of the Council to consider amendments put forward by the European Parliament.

 My answer to the hon.

The gold sales reduced risk by around 30 per cent. (as measured by value-at-risk) and are not expected to deliver a loss in return when measured over the medium to long-term, the appropriate time horizon for such a decision.

 A regulatory impact assessment setting out our estimates of the fee levels and the underlying analysis was published with the Licensing Bill in November 2002 and placed in the Library of the House. No final decisions have been made about the fees to be prescribed under the Licensing Act 2003, and we are presently considering carefully information and material provided by representatives of local authorities before making those decisions. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has met representatives of local authorities to discuss fees, among other things, and my predecessor with responsibility for licensing reform, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells), also met representatives on several occasions to discuss these matters. My officials have been discussing fees, among other things, with representatives of local authorities since November 1999. These discussions have now been completed and we hope to announce shortly the fees that the Secretary of State intends to prescribe under the 2003 Act, though we will continue to meet representatives of local authorities to discuss other matters relating to the implementation of the new legislation. We have repeatedly given assurances both in the House and to representatives of local authorities that the fees will be set at a level which permits recovery of the full costs of administration, inspection and enforcement to local authorities associated with the licensing functions under the 2003 Act. The Secretary of State has also agreed with representatives of the local authorities to allow an independent review of the costs of the new licensing regime and the fee levels after the end of the transitional period, and if any changes are necessary, they will be made. All interested Government Departments were involved in discussions with my Department about the preparation of the regulatory impact assessment and my officials have more recently had discussions about fees with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Before making final decisions on the fee levels, we intend to have further discussions with all interested Government Departments.

<P>
<a name="31202w09.html_spnew5"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Regulatory Reform (Housing Assistance) (England and Wales) Order 2002 gave local authorities wide discretionary powers to provide assistance to homeowners and tenants to repair, improve and adapt their homes&#151;including, for example, equity release loans&#151;from 18 July 2002. This is subject to the authority having a policy in place setting out how it intends to use the powers. Prior to that date, local authorities had no powers to make such loans.
<P>

<a name="31202w09.html_para3">Figures on the number of equity release loans and other forms of assistance given by local authorities for renewal of private sector homes in the financial year 2002&#150;03 will be available early in 2004.
