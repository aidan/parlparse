<a name="80130w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Garnier: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, pursuant to his answer of 26 January 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>3,</i> concerning consultation on legal aid changes, if he will list the representations received, those making them and the date of them, indicating which were in favour of his proposals and which against. [26508]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80130w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The information requested is not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. In any event, before I made public the names of those who had written or had discussion with us and the substance of their representations, I would wish to ensure that I had their permission to do so. A full list will be maintained of those who respond to the formal consultation paper, which I expect to issue in the near future, which will make it clear that the names of those responding may be made public unless they request the Department not to do so.

<P>
<a name="80130w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. White: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what mechanisms are in place to establish whether a person has previously been in receipt of legal aid certificates, and what methods are used to determine if the person has a history of previous fraudulent claims. [25306]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80130w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Legal Aid Board's existing computer systems do not enable it to identify easily whether an applicant has any previous legal aid history. The Board is currently implementing a new computer system which will enable it to identify any previous transactions involving that person and search those transactions to identify any previous fraudulent activity. The new computer system is already in place in one of the Board's 13 area offices and will be implemented nationally by the end of 1998.
<P>

<a name="80130w01.html_para0">The Board will complete, in February 1998, the transfer of responsibility for civil means assessment from the Benefits Agency. This will enhance the Board's ability to identify, from its own case records, any previous fraudulent activity by an applicant for legal aid.

 Although I did not meet with any insurers between 1 and 31 December 1997, I have already given the hon. Gentleman the details of the meetings that took place between 18 October and 15 December 1997, <i>Official Report,</i> 15 December 1997, column <i>43.</i> Since then, my officials attended a meeting of the joint Insurance Industry and LCD working group on 12 January and are due to attend a further meeting on 6 February. Further meetings will be arranged as necessary. Given the existence of the working group neither my noble and learned Friend nor I have future meetings planned with representatives of insurance companies, though if requested we would be prepared to meet representatives of the industry.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will request a report from the Law Society on the matter of exclusion clauses that limit a solicitor's liability when acting as a trustee; and if he will make a statement. [25263]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80130w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I have no plans to do so. This is a matter for the Law Society. I am advised that the Law Society will be reviewing the issue of liability exclusion clauses shortly.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what procedures are employed by the Independent Tribunal Service to appoint the chairs and other members of <i>(a)</i> SSATs, <i>(b)</i> DATs and <i>(c)</i> MATs. [25405]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80130w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor appoints full-time legal Chairmen after consultation with the Lord Advocate. The statutory qualification for such appointment is to have a five-year general qualification (in England and Wales) or to have been a solicitor or advocate in Scotland of at least five years' standing. Appointments are made following advertisement and interview, usually from among the ranks of part-time Chairmen, of those who are best able to demonstrate that they satisfy the selection criteria. Part-time legal Chairmen are appointed by the Lord Chancellor in England and Wales and currently by the Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland. The statutory qualifications are the same as for full-time Chairmen. Vacancies are advertised and appointments made following interview of those best able to satisfy the selection criteria.
<P>

<a name="80130w01.html_para1">The President of the Independent Tribunal Service at present appoints all other members of those tribunals within his jurisdiction, including Social Security Appeal Tribunals (SSATs), Disability Appeal Tribunals (DATs), Medical Appeal Tribunals (MATs) and Child Support Appeal Tribunals (CSATs). Interested individuals satisfying the statutory requirements and certain other selection criteria such as age are interviewed locally by the relevant Regional Chairman and a report and recommendation are submitted by them to the President for his decision.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80130w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 A total of 161,461 cases were not proceeded with in the magistrates courts during 1997. Additionally, 7,514 cases were not proceeded with in the Crown Court. However, the Crown Prosecution Service holds no central records on the reasons why cases are discontinued. The information is held only on individual cases files in each branch and could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="80130w01.html_para2">A survey of all cases not proceeded with in the magistrates courts was conducted during November 1994. The survey showed that during this period, 28 per cent. of discontinuances were undertaken on the grounds that a prosecution was not in the public interest.

 The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), an independent body established under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 to advise the Government on drug misuse issues, has a duty to keep under review drugs which are being, or appear to them likely to be, misused and to advise the Government on measures for preventing their misuse or dealing with social problems connected with their misuse.
<P>

<a name="80130w02.html_para0">The Advisory Council considered the misuse of Gammahydroxybutyrate (GHB) in November 1996. After examining the available evidence, the Council reached the view that the harmful effects of the misuse of the drug in

the United Kingdom were not sufficient to constitute a social problem, a criterion which is laid down by the Act. It concluded that GHB should not therefore be recommended for control but that its misuse should continue to be monitored. We continue to keep the matter under review.

<a name="80130w02.html_para1">Although not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, GHB is subject to control under the Medicines Act 1968.

 <i>[holding answer 29 January 1998]:</i> Regulation 46 of the Police Regulations 1995 sets out the arrangements for managing the pay of police officer during sick leave. The regulation provides for a police officer on sick leave to receive full pay during the first six months

<P><I>30 Jan 1998 : Column: 398</I><P>
of sick leave, half pay for the second six months, and no pay if sick leave continues beyond 12 months. The regulation also provides that, subject to the discretion of the chief constable, an officer on sick leave entitled to half pay may continue to receive full pay, and an officer on sick leave entitled to no pay may be paid half or full pay.
<P>

<a name="80130w02.html_para2">The regulation is clear that it is only the chief constable who may exercise such discretion and is therefore not an issue which ordinarily I would wish to raise in the course of my discussions with individual chief constables or the Association of Chief Police Officers.

 The Government are committed to a concerted inter-agency attack on domestic violence. A Regional Forum established in 1995 brings together the main statutory and voluntary interests, including Women's Aid, Victims Support, the RUC, the Probation Service, the NI Court Service and social services. We are also bringing forward new legislation which develops and strengthens the civil law on domestic violence. Government funding towards the regional administrative costs of the NI Women's Aid Federation will be at least &#163;158,000 in 1997-98. Capital costs for women's refuges

Many departments and agencies are in dialogue with the suppliers of equipment. All departments have given some consideration to contingency planning ranging from making provision within the year 2000 programmes for project overruns to full disaster recovery planning.

 The Government committed themselves, before the General Election, to keep to the spending plans of the previous administration in 1997-98 and 1998-99. The difference in the Arts Council of England's allocation in real terms between 1997-98 and 1998-99 is a decrease of 3.5 per cent, or &#163;6.5 million in 1997-98 prices. These figures are derived from the cash allocations of &#163;186.1 million in 1997-98 and &#163;184.6 million in 1998-99, and a 2.8 per cent. increase in the GDP deflator.

 The history of Englands football anthems is very mixed. In 1990 and 1996, they were hugely popular. In some other years they have rivalled bubonic plague in their appeal. Perhaps the Football Association should hold a competition among English song writers to try and establish a permanent football anthem.

 The over-30-months Slaughter Scheme is a public health measure under which very considerable public expenditure is made. It is therefore reviewed regularly in the light of new scientific information and the budgetary provision available. Maintenance of the Scheme, which is enshrined in EU legislation, is a precondition of the Florence Agreement. Changes to the composition of the Scheme would therefore require EU approval.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80130w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 None. Public Bodies are generally required to look for best value for money in their procurement decisions, and it would contravene the Treaty of Rome to operate a buy British Policy. Nevertheless we have recently been discussing with the Ministry of Defence how we might increase the amount of British beef purchased by the armed forces.

 Estimated figures show that Total Farm Income from Farming fell by 37 per cent. in real terms in 1997. The fall shows substantial increases in incomes in recent years and reflects the lower prices for many agricultural commodities. A major factor is the strength of the pound sterling which affects all sectors of the economy. Detailed estimates of the income, output and productivity of United Kingdom Agriculture in 1997 were published this morning and have been placed in the Library.

<a name="80130w05.html_para1">The Government believe that it is important that councils and the people they serve can rely on politically disinterested service from their officials.

To that end, the Government intend that those local government officials who are in the most senior or sensitive positions should not be able to stand for election to the Scottish Parliament. The Government do, however, intend to consult on the possible reduction in the numbers or categories of officer who are affected by political restriction under the 1989 Act.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80130w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 January 1998]:</i> Naval nuclear propulsion plant is designed with significant redundancy in the protection system to ensure that the reactor is shut down safely in the event of a fault. Naval nuclear plant operators are trained to shut down plant early to investigate possible defects. Reactors have therefore been shut down on some 500 occasions since 1980 for precautionary defect investigations. It would be incorrect, however, to ascribe these shutdowns specifically to safety reasons.
<P>

<a name="80130w07.html_para0">Availability is a major factor in the design of naval nuclear propulsion plant. On all occasions following reactor shutdown at sea it has been possible to resume reactor operation safely within a few hours.

Its financial value is wholly disregarded when assessing a person's eligibility for benefits such as Income Support or Housing Benefit, although receipt of DLA would result in an additional premium being paid.

 Analysis of the data from the Summer 1997 Labour Force Survey, released by the Office for National Statistics in December 1997, suggests that over 1 million people with a long-term disability <sup>1</sup>  in Great Britain want to work. The analysis estimates that 354,000 disabled people of working age <sup>2</sup>  are unemployed <sup>3</sup>  and seeking work, and a further 935,000 disabled people who are not working <sup>4</sup>  would like to work.

It may exclude some people with progressive conditions and severe disfigurements who feel that these do not limit their work or have a substantial adverse impact on their day-to-day activities. The definition of disability in the Labour Force Survey (LFS) has been changed to take account of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, resulting in changes in the numbers recorded as disabled.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will take steps to regulate more effectively cosmetic surgery clinics to ensure that medically qualified personnel undertaking surgical procedures are full qualified to carry out these operations. [23687]<P>

<P>
<a name="80130w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The Registered Homes Act 1984 provides for the registration and inspection of private cosmetic surgery clinics by health authorities. The General Medical Council has powers to instigate disciplinary procedures in cases of alleged seriously deficient professional performance, as well as serious professional misconduct. Anyone who attempted to perform a cosmetic procedure, but who was not competent to do so, would also expose themselves to the risk of civil, and possibly criminal, liability, and/or to professional proceedings for misconduct. We will be considering whether further safeguards are needed.

 All local authorities either undertake home study assessments of prospective intercountry adopters themselves or arrange for them to be carried out on their behalf. We issued comprehensive guidance in May 1997 to enable local authorities and adoption agencies to carry out these assessments.

 <i>[holding answer 27 January 1998]:</i> The Health of the Nation targets were set as national targets. Specific local targets were not set. This was a weakness in view of the degree of variation from the national average between different local health authorities. It is part of the regional office public health role to monitor the performance of health authorities against the Health of the Nation targets, and they hold detailed information trends for the health authorities in their area.

<a name="80130w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 My letter of 16 December to all English MPs listed capital allocations to local education authorities for 1998-99. I am placing a copy in the Library. These allocations were the first stage in a process that will commit a total of &#163;922 million in central Government support for building projects at maintained schools in 1998-99, which represents an increase of 37 per cent. over original plans.

 Funding to establish new out of school childcare provision will come from the receipts of the Windfall Tax, the Out of School Child care Initiative and the New Opportunities Fund totalling &#163;300 million over five years from 1998 and 2003. Schemes will be free to determine their own fees. Many existing schemes already adjust fees according to the family's circumstances and we expect that new schemes will wish to consider doing the same.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and I raised the question of the voting procedures in Article 4 of the Schengen Protocol with Dutch Minister on three occasions. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary also raised it with the Irish Foreign Minister. It was discussed on 27 June in the Friends of the Presidency Group, whose remit was to follow up any outstanding matters relating to the Treaty text after the Amsterdam summit and subsequently four times at Coreper. UK officials also had numerous contacts with the Presidency, other Member States and the Council Secretariat about this question, from the moment that we first became aware of the change to the text until the matter was resolved.

 The purpose of clause 33.3 of the Channel Tunnel Concession Agreement is to protect the commercial or technical confidentiality of documents produced by, or on behalf of, the Channel Tunnel concessionaires (Eurotunnel) by preventing the publication of such documents by recipients. It does not prevent the publication of that information by the originator, or the publication of information produced by third parties.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the EU Regulations contained in Directive 96/79 contained in Official Journal, C, 6 December 1997, No. 335 with regard to workers employed in the animal rendering industry; and if he will make a statement on the implementation of these regulations.

 <i>[holding answer 29 January 1998]:</i> This question appears to refer to Commission Directive 97/65, published in the Official Journal L335 on 6 December 1997, which amends Directive 90/679/EEC on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to biological agents at work. In the light of recent scientific evidence of a link between Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD), Directive 97/65 adds the agent of BSE to list of biological agents.
<P>

<a name="80130w15.html_para2">It will be implemented in the UK by means of a new edition of the Health and Safety Commission's Categorisation of biological agents according to hazard and categories of containment (Approved List), made under section 15 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. The deadline for implementation is 30 June 1998.
<P>

<a name="80130w15.html_para3">The categorisation of biological agents mainly affects those working in laboratories. The change will not affect workers in the rendering industry who are already covered by the requirements of the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations 1994. In view of the past uncertainty about the risks from BSE, prudent and precautionary worker safety measures have been recommended since 1989. General guidance for occupational groups such as the rendering industry, prepared on behalf of the Health and Safety Commission, the Department of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food by the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP), was published in August 1996. Copies have been deposited in the Library. ACDP considers that this guidance continues to provide adequate control in recommending the maintenance of high standards of occupational hygiene and new methods of working to avoid or minimise exposure to tissues of cattle that may carry the agent of BSE infectivity.

The Dublin Search and Rescue Region is an enclave within the UK Search and Rescue Region, and is the responsibility of the Republic of Ireland. Details of the UK Regions are lodged with the International Maritime Organisation which advises other member states through Search and Rescue circulars.

<a name="80130w16.html_para1">Hadrian's Wall is statutorily protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and any proposals for works affecting it require the prior written consent of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The fact that the Wall is a World Heritage Site also means that its outstanding international importance is a key material consideration when planning applications are considered. The Hadrian's Wall Management Plan, published by English Heritage in July 1996, identifies medium and long-term objectives for managing the Site and provides mechanisms under which all bodies responsible for the Wall can co-ordinate their activities.

and comment on Commission project proposals before giving final approval for funding. Our experience from this process is that the extent to which assessment procedures are taken into account in project design and implementation varies across the Commission.
<P>

<a name="80130w16.html_para2">The Commission is making efforts to improve its systems. It has held meetings with environmental advisers from Member States' development organisations, including DFID, to exchange views and best practice. An independent evaluation of the environmental performance of EC-funded programmes in developing countries was completed in December 1997. DFID will receive and comment on the report shortly. We will continue to examine ways in which the Commission's systems can be further improved, taking account of the evaluation's findings.
