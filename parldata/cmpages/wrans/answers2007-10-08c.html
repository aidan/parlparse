 Public sector organisations should: use good commercial practice in managing the flows of expenditure and commitments they deal with; settle their bills on time within contractual terms in line with The Better Payments Practice Code; and be bound by The Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1988. In relation to grants, once an agreement has been made and payment schedules agreed to, public sector organisations should honour these in the same way as they would any commercial or contractual arrangements. Government departments are required to note as exceptional any interest payments in relation to late payments in their resource accounts. This is set out in the &#147;Managing Public Money&#148; guidance issued by HM Treasury on sound financial management of public funds.</p>

 The types of training delivered by the Fire Service College and the Emergency Planning College reflect their differing but complementary missions. The Fire Service College focuses on specialist training at the operational (bronze), tactical (silver) and strategic (gold) levels, and over 90 per cent. of its students are from the fire and rescue service. As officers progress through the levels, they receive increasing exposure to multi-agency operations. In contrast, the Emergency Planning College&#146;s courses bring together all the many services and organisations involved in multi-agency working at the strategic (gold) level in large-scale emergencies, including non-blue light scenarios such as influenza. As a result, fire and rescue service students comprise less than 10 per cent. of the Emergency Planning College&#146;s intake.</p>

 DFID Ministers and officials have had a productive and ongoing dialogue with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries on the issue of European Union (EU) sugar reforms. This has included meetings and correspondence and has covered the depth and pace of the reforms, the amount and allocation of transitional assistance and the implications for sugar of the EU's duty and quota free market access offer under the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA's).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="71008w0002.htm_para1"><a name="07100827000132">Most recent communication between DFID and the ACP countries has been about the European Commission's proposal to terminate the sugar protocol (SP). A number of ACP countries have been concerned about the impacts of the ending of the protocol. However, it is a logical consequence of the EU internal sugar market reforms and the offer of duty and quota free market access as part of the EPAs.</p>

 In 2003 the European Commission undertook an impact assessment of the proposed reform of the European Union (EU) internal sugar market (this was formally adopted by the Agricultural Council in February 2006). In May 2006 DEFRA undertook a comprehensive regulatory impact assessment of the reform. This assessment looked at the potential impact of the reform on all stakeholders including African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries that supply sugar to the EU market under a preferential trade agreement. In addition DFID has commissioned a number of independent studies looking at the impacts of the reform on the sugar industry in developing countries, with particular emphasis on the least developed countries (LDC's).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="71008w0002.htm_para3"><a name="07100827000136">The assessments and studies all suggest that the reform will present challenges for the ACP countries who will see the value of their preference decline.

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="71008w0002.htm_para4"><a name="07100827000137">In response to these assessments DFID successfully lobbied the Commission to provide transitional assistance for the ACP countries. As a result of the lobbying the EU has earmarked around &#8364;1.244 billion between 2007 and 2013. Allocation of these funds is based on a national Sugar Action Plan submitted independently by the ACP countries. DFID has provided technical and financial support to a number of ACP countries to draw up their individual plans.</p>

 DFID does not make its own estimates but relies on those provided by the UN. The UN uses the number of people in need of emergency aid as its criterion for defining those who are affected by conflict. This figure currently stands at 4.2 million, including 2.2 million internally displaced persons (IDPs). There are some 500,000 people across Darfur who are cut off from all humanitarian assistance and protection services. For many of the others, access to aid is only sporadic and frequently interrupted by insecurity and attacks on humanitarian staff.</p>

 Information on average waiting time on a housing list for households is not held centrally.

It is also important to bear in mind that not everyone on the waiting list will necessarily be in urgent housing need. It will also include those who consider social housing as their preferred choice, or one of a number of housing options.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 September 2007]: </i>The Gloucestershire tri-service centre will not be broken up. The centre will continue to house staff from all three emergency services and support tri-service working after the control room of the fire and rescue service is moved to the South West Regional Control Centre. The Government are committed to creating a new national network of nine resilient regional control centres which will enhance the ability of the Fire and Rescue Service to respond to major incidents and natural disasters in a co-ordinated, efficient and effective manner. We believe that the public will be better protected by this approach. The new Regional Control Centres will however build on the valuable lessons learnt on joint working from the tri-service pilots, including the recent experience of dealing with flooding in Gloucestershire.</p>

 We are committed to reducing the number of empty homes and in particular the number of homes that are left empty for long periods of time. The Government do not set a national target for the number of empty homes to be brought back into use as this can be affected by local housing market conditions. However, the Housing Green Paper makes it clear that local authorities should do more to tackle empty homes and we are exploring ways to achieve an increase in activity. We consider that all local authorities should have in place comprehensive strategies on how they intend to deal with empty homes. Many local authorities set their own empty homes targets.</p>

 On a provisional estimate, 9 per cent. of all new dwellings in England in 2005 were built in flood risk areas. A more robust estimate for 2004 shows that 10 per cent. of all new dwellings in England were built in flood risk areas during that year.

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="71008w0009.htm_para2"><a name="07100827001796">Flood risk is a major factor in the location of new development. Flood risk areas account for about 10 per cent. of land in England, including parts of major cities, and around 10 per cent. of the population already live in flood risk areas. The Government&#146;s aim is to avoid inappropriate development in areas of high flood risk. The Government published planning policy statement (PPS25) in December 2006 to strengthen and clarify earlier policy on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="71008w0009.htm_para3"><a name="07100827001797">PPS25 ensures that flood risk must be taken into account at all stages of the planning process. Development that would not be safe in the higher flood risk areas should be directed to areas of lower risk wherever this is practicable. In particular, more vulnerable development, such as housing, should not be permitted in high risk areas unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the need for the development outweighs the risk, and it will be safe, without increasing flood risk.</p>

Not everyone on the waiting list is necessarily in urgent housing need. The waiting list includes those who consider social housing as their preferred or one of a number of housing options, and those who decide to get onto the waiting list ladder before they need or want to move house&#151;particularly where the priority system is heavily based on waiting time. The size of the waiting list is not an indicator of absolute need, it is only useful as a broad indicator of housing demand in an area.</p>

 Yes. Power generation infrastructure, including electricity sub-stations is included in PPS25, table D2 Flood Risk Vulnerability Classification. They are defined as &#145;essential infrastructure&#146; as it is acknowledged that power stations and grid and primary substations may need to be located in flood risk areas. This is because power stations often need a ready supply of water and sub-stations need to be located near to the communities they supply. The PPS25 sequential test will ensure that they are located in low risk areas where possible, but where there are no alternative lower risk locations for this type of development then the exception test will ensure that they are safe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="71008w0012.htm_para14"><a name="07100827002734">Recent flood events during the summer have highlighted the importance of essential infrastructure being protected during flood events and PPS25 aims to ensure that any new electricity infrastructure that is essential in areas at risk of flooding is designed and constructed to be operational during floods.</p>

 In 2006 the Department commissioned the independent Committee on Toxicity (COT) to evaluate evidence submitted by the British Air Lines Pilots Association (BALPA) in relation to cabin air &#147;fume events&#148;. The COT received information from oil companies, airlines, engine manufacturers, independent scientific experts and pressure groups. The COT reported on 20 September 2007. Its report is published on its website:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="71008w0017.htm_para2"><a name="0710096000362">The Committee on Toxicity considered that it was not possible to conclude whether cabin air exposures (either general or following incidents) cause ill-health in commercial aircraft crews. It recommended further work, in particular, and as a priority, to ascertain whether substances in the cabin environment could potentially be harmful to health. COT considered that this work should be designed to detect any potentially harmful substances, rather than focus on named substances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="71008w0017.htm_para3"><a name="0710096000363">In keeping with its commitment to promoting healthy flying, the Department accepts this priority. Through the Aviation Health Working Group, it has recently made preparations for such a study by testing equipment which may be capable of capturing substances released during oil and hydraulic fluid fume incidents. Once effective equipment has been identified it is intended to sample around 1,000 flights using more than one sampling device, more than one laboratory to analyse the results, and an independent project manager from the academic world.</p>

 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has advised that UK air operators whose aircraft are required to be fitted with oxygen equipment must provide guidance to crews on its use in air contamination incidents.

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="71008w0017.htm_para4"><a name="0710096000366">Compliance with the guidance in the event of incidents will be monitored by routine review of Air Safety Reports and Mandatory Occurrence reports.

 The UK National Aviation Security Programme requires airports to comply with specific security measures which are subject to regular inspection by the Department for Transport to ensure that standards are adhered to. The programme does not mandate the number of security personnel required to undertake security tasks. As private businesses, decisions about staffing are rightly a matter for the airports themselves.

 Overbooking is a common practice among airlines and provides for the more efficient use of aircraft, for example where passengers have failed to check in for flights for which they have purchased tickets. The Government do not believe that denied boarding is a widespread problem, based on the relatively small number of complaints on this issue received by the Air Transport Users Council.

 The aerodrome conducted an immediate investigation into the incident that occurred on 8 August 2007 and the report was presented to the CAA. The investigation revealed that the First Choice aircraft (airbus A320) that had arrived from Reus (Spain) was unable to access the main aircraft parking area due to congestion. In agreement with Air Traffic Control (ATC) the aircraft was initially held on a taxiway until space became available.

They have also commissioned a review of the pavement strength for the main runway and other paved surfaces. The United Kingdom Aeronautical Information Package (UKAIP) entry for the aerodrome has also been amended to reflect the pavement values for the aerodrome surfaces.

 The Government regulate rail fares where operators are likely to have a high degree of market power. Increases in regulated fares are limited to RPI+1 per cent. and the Secretary of State for Transport recently announced that regulated fares will be capped at this level until at least 2014. Fares that are not subject to regulation are priced at the discretion of train operators. However, the recent White Paper, &#147;Delivering a Sustainable Railway&#148;, concluded that the fares structure requires simplification for the benefit of passengers and announced its intention to work with the rail industry to implement a simplified fares structure.</p>

 The Department has not had any discussions with the Transport Operational Command Unit on these matters. However, we keep in touch with TfL officials about a range of taxi-related issues.

 If individuals provide a minicab service without holding the requisite licences they are committing an offence.

When the repeal takes effect&#151;in January 2008&#151;it will be much harder for operators and drivers to evade licensing. A similar provision (section 54 of the Act) will bring operators and drivers dedicated to contract work in London within the PHV licensing regime&#151;in March 2008.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to the answer of 17 September 2007, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 2195-6W, on taxis: licensing, what assumptions were made about the <i> (a)</i> total number of currently unlicensed drivers, <i> (b)</i> number of vehicles, <i> (c)</i> number of operators and <i> (d)</i> average licence fees when making the estimate referred to; and how the estimate of total costs of &#163;1 million was reached.

 The estimate of &#163;1 million was included in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for the proposal to repeal the private hire vehicle (PHV) contract exemption; a copy of this is in the Library of the House. The RIA was based on the following assumptions: (a) 2000 drivers (b) 2000 vehicles and (c) 300 operators would have to be licensed as a direct result of the repeal of the contract exemption. Average fees for each of the licences were assumed to be &#163;250, &#163;200 and &#163;400 respectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="71008w0022.htm_para2"><a name="0710096001051">These estimates and assumptions were based on the fact that the terms of the contract exemption are narrow and apply in a relatively limited number of cases. They made no allowance for cases now coming to light where transport providers might have believed, or claimed, that they were covered by the exemption but were not in reality so covered. A number of these cases are, and will remain, outside the definition of a PHV in the legislation and therefore will still not need to be licensed. Others should have been licensed as PHVs in the past and repeal of itself will not therefore create a new requirement to meet licensing costs. The Department has sought the views of stakeholders on draft guidance for local licensing authorities on the impact of the repeal and we expect to publish the final version of this shortly.</p>

 Entitlement to income-related benefits requires that a person has a right to reside and be habitually resident in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or the Republic of Ireland (generally known as the Common Travel Area). If a person does not have a right to reside then he or she is treated as not being habitually resident and is not entitled to those benefits. A person who has a right to reside must also show that he or she is habitually resident in the UK unless he or she falls into an exemption category, such as that for EU workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_465"><a name="71008w0031.htm_para7"><a name="07100914000452">The term &#147;habitual residence&#148; is not defined in UK social security legislation but there is both domestic and EC case law on how that term should be interpreted. In order to determine whether a person is habitually resident, decision makers will, on the basis of the guidelines set out in the case law, consider a variety of factors about the person&#146;s circumstances. These include, for example, his or her attachment to and intentions in the UK; his or her reasons for coming here; and whether the person has family in the UK etc. Benefit decision-makers must be satisfied on objective grounds that a person who claims income-related benefits after arriving in the country has genuinely adopted the UK as his or her place of habitual residence.</p>

have been no individual support orders (ISOs) issued in Cambridgeshire up to the end of December 2005 which is the latest period for which data are available. In April this year we completed a survey of 60 areas on support available for young people on ASBOs. The headline results support anecdotal information from practitioners that where ISOs are not being made it is mostly because they are already receiving other interventions from the Youth Offending Team (YOT). The courts are obliged to consider making an ISO every time they make an ASBO on a 10 to 17-year-old and must give a reason in open court if they decide not to do so. The use of ISOs continues to be actively promoted by the Youth Justice Board (YJB) and the Home Office as an aid to helping YOTs fulfil their role in tackling antisocial behaviour.</p>

 It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences may be less than complete. Work is underway to ensure that the magistrates courts case management system currently being implemented by the Ministry of Justice reports all motoring offences to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated.<br>
 Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

 Since 1 January 2005, only overseas students who can show that they have a place to study or are already studying at an institution which appears on the Register of Education Providers (REP) have been granted entry clearances or extensions of stay as students. The REP is operated by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) and the application process requires institutions to prove that they operate out of registered premises etc. The REP has been very successful in combating bogus colleges, particularly those which were entirely fictitious. In 2004, some 1,200 were visited ahead of the REP being implemented and 25 per cent were found not to be genuine and were prevented from registering. A further 69 colleges have so far been removed from the Register through a combination of visits conducted by compliance officers in the Border and Immigration Agency (BIA) as well as removals instigated by DIUS. Since July 2007, as the BIA has expanded its compliance resource in preparation for the introduction of the new points based system (PBS) for managing migration, officers have also begun to make more pro-active visits to colleges applying to get on the REP to prevent the registration of those found not to be bona fide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_496"><a name="71008w0034.htm_para2"><a name="07100952000230">Under the PBS we have plans to go even further. Under Tier 4: (Students) of the PBS, all education institutions will need to be registered on a new register of sponsors in order to recruit international students. No private educational institution will be able to qualify for the sponsor register unless they can demonstrate that they have been independently inspected or accredited by one of a limited number of BIA-approved accreditation bodies. As announced by DIUS on 24 July 2007, accreditation will be used to provide an independent qualitative check on an institution to demonstrate it is a genuine education provider. Tier 4 is expected to replace the current system for students in the first quarter of 2009. Unaccredited educational institutions have some 16 months to obtain the necessary accreditation in order to continue bringing international students to the UK after that date and we are confident that less reputable education providers will not be able to pass this additional test.</p>

 The immigration rules set out provisions for international students to study at a bona fide private education institution which is included on the Register of Education and Training Providers. A definition of a bona fide private education institution is contained in the rules. Where it is found that an institution fails to meet this definition, it is prohibited from enrolling any more international students by being removed from the Register.

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. Between 1 April 1999 and 31 May 2000 data were collected on aggregate numbers only by police force area.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

 Maintenance expenditure within London is planned in line with an agreed estate strategy which sets the priorities for maintaining buildings in line with business objectives whilst ensuring a safe and secure working environment. Annual maintenance budgets and programmes of work are agreed in line with this strategy and on the basis of identified business and building risks. Plans and programmes are reviewed quarterly in light of changing requirements and risks, with budgets and programmes amended accordingly. Total maintenance expenditure for 2006-07 (capital and revenue) was &#163;19,145,895. Forecast expenditure (capital and revenue) for the financial year 2007-08 is currently &#163;18,796,250, a reduction in overall expenditure of &#163;349,645 over 2006-07. This reflects planned reductions in both the size of regional estate and efficiency savings achieved as a result.</p>

 The Criminal Cases Review Commission&#146;s budget for 2007-08 allows the Commission to spend up to &#163;6,858,000, as compared with &#163;6,771,000 in 2006-07, despite a reduction in the overall envelope. Departmental officials meet with the senior management team of the Commission on a monthly basis to monitor their budget and performance against targets. I understand that the Commission are currently forecasting an under-spend overall as some expenditure has been postponed, although this may change later in the year.</p>

 Prisoners, whether UK citizens or foreign nationals, with close family living abroad receive a free five minute phone call once a month if they have not had a social visit in the preceding period. There is no centrally held information about the cost of free calls nor locally of the breakdown between UK citizens and foreign nationals. Therefore, it is not possible to provide this information. Each establishment pays for such calls from their local budget, and costs are dependent on the number of eligible prisoners as well as the country they wish to call.</p>

 The precise impact on prisoners of increased prison populations and their overcrowding, alongside other factors, is unclear. Cell-sharing can be a protective factor and overcrowding itself does not explain why there are self-inflicted deaths in prisons. Most significantly, a high proportion of prisoners arrive in prison with risk factors that we know increase the risk of them harming themselves, such as substance withdrawal, uncertainty and anxiety about their own cases, the impact of and adjustment to imprisonment, family concerns, a history of previous abuse or self-harm, and mental health issues.</p>

 The Government set out in their March consultation document that dormant accounts would include bank and building society accounts where there has been no customer-initiated activity for a period of at least 15 years. On this basis, an assessment by banks and building societies suggests that between &#163;250 million and &#163;350 million lies currently unclaimed in banks, and up to &#163;150 million unclaimed in the building society sector. These figures are for the United Kingdom. There are no specific estimates for Scotland.</p>

Longer-term, constitutional reform will also be necessary for BiH to deliver effective governance for its citizens and carry out the reforms that the EU accession process will require.

resolving the Iranian nuclear problem. But addressing the outstanding issues is only one of the steps the International Community requires Iran to take in order to restore confidence in its intentions. As the UN Security Council has unanimously demanded in Resolutions 1696, 1737 and 1747, and as the IAEA Board of Governors made clear in its Resolution GOV/2006/14 of February 2006, Iran also needs to implement fully the Additional Protocol and additional measures that the IAEA has requested, and to suspend enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. Until Iran meets these obligations we will continue to follow the dual track strategy agreed with our partners in the &#147;E3+3&#148; (China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States), and to discuss further measures aimed at persuading Iran to fulfil all its international obligations.</p>

 The meeting of the Working Group on 24 September was to obtain member states' initial views on an orientation paper on setting maximum and minimum levels for vitamins and minerals in foodstuffs, issued by the Commission in late July. We have been advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that general discussions on the orientation paper in the working group revealed that many member states are yet to establish views on many issues. The Commission has asked member states to consider the various issues presented in the orientation paper in preparation for more detailed discussions at the next working group meeting which has provisionally been scheduled for November.</p>

The Commission recognised that member states have obligations to consult their stakeholders and did not place restrictions on the circulation of the paper, leaving this to the discretion of the member states. The FSA sent the paper to United Kingdom stakeholders on 8 August seeking their initial comments and held a meeting on 14 September during which the paper was discussed in detail. Further meetings between the FSA and Ministers will be arranged when necessary.</p>

 The communications agency concerned is Good Relations. Payments made to the agency for services provided to NHS Connecting for Health from 1 April 2005, when NHS Connecting for Health came into being, to 26 September 2007, total &#163;509,263 including VAT.</p>

A key priority for successful implementation of an effective, national information technology system&#151;a central plank of national health service modernisation&#151;is to ensure that the public and stakeholders are fully informed and have an awareness and understanding of the benefits. The agencies concerned were appointed to assist in this important communication process and to produce supporting materials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_749"><a name="71008w0060.htm_para2"><a name="0710106001894">The contracts have delivered value for money. Examples of outputs include videos to explain the new systems and services; exhibition stands and an outdoor exhibition trailer to support face-to-face engagement; millions of copies of associated guidance material, posters and information packs for NHS staff and patients; and implementation advice and case studies for local NHS bodies that demonstrate the value of the programme, how benefits can be realised and lessons learned from implementations.</p>

 We fully support the advice given by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England on the use of drug therapy in treating children and young people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and expect the national health service to take this guidance into account when treating patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_757"><a name="71008w0062.htm_para0"><a name="0710106002255">NICE have advised that drug therapy to treat ADHD, of which Ritalin is but one option, should only be part of a comprehensive treatment programme that includes a range of social, psychological and behavioural interventions. These are mainly aimed at the child, but sometimes involve the parents and/or teachers. NICE has recommended that drug therapy should only be initiated by an appropriately qualified healthcare professional with expertise in ADHD and should be based on a comprehensive assessment and diagnosis. Continued prescribing and monitoring of drug treatment may be performed by general practitioners, under shared care arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_758"><a name="71008w0062.htm_para1"><a name="0710106002256">Psychological interventions that may be helpful include behavioural management, parent training, family and/or individual therapy, social skills training, cognitive behaviour therapy and problem solving techniques, among others.

<p><a name="stpa_759"><a name="71008w0062.htm_para2"><a name="0710106002257">We have also asked NICE to develop a clinical guideline on both the pharmacological and psychological interventions to treat ADHD.

 Responsibility for upgrading communal television systems is a matter for landlords in consultation with residents.

The most recent research carried out by BMRB<sup>(1)</sup> and published in January 2007 showed an increase in the level of upgrade work since the 2005 survey with 32 per cent. of organisations in the process of completing the upgrade of all systems and nearly 50 per cent. having completed the upgrade of at least 30 per cent. of systems. Digital UK continues to map subsequent progress in the social sector through regional meetings and direct communications with social landlords.</p>

The most recent tracker survey<sup>(2)</sup> reports that digital conversion for households who live in flats is around 74 per cent. compared to digital take up of 80 per cent. across all tenures. Digital UK is continuing a targeted information campaign aimed at residents&#146; associations and flat-dwellers in the first four regions scheduled for switchover, as well as communicating directly with private landlords.</p>

 The searching of entrants to nightclubs can help promote the licensing objectives of public safety and the prevention of crime and disorder but, as the Secretary of State's guidance to licensing authorities makes clear, such conditions should only be imposed where necessary, taking into account factors such as the location and type of venue. Where the police believe that a premises selling alcohol is associated with serious crime or serious disorder, such as the use of knives or guns, they can apply for a fast track review of the premises licence under new powers which came into force on 1 October 2007. In such cases, licensing authorities must also consider if it is appropriate to impose immediate extra conditions, such as a requirement to search for weapons, on the licence pending that review.</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 September 2007]:</i><i> </i>The Energy White Paper identified the need both to create the right financial framework, and to lower practical barriers relating to planning and grid connection, in the light of our target of 10 per cent. electricity from renewables by 2010 and aspiration to double this by 2020. It also outlined proposals to band the Renewables Obligation, reform the planning regime and improve renewables grid connection in order to address these barriers. In the context of renewable energy use in transport, the White Paper referred to issues of sustainability, mechanical impact and costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_851"><a name="71008w0073.htm_para1"><a name="07101022000497">The 2007 spring European Council agreed an overall target for 20 per cent. of the EU&#146;s energy to be from renewables by 2020. Decisions have not yet been taken on individual member states&#146; contribution to the target, but we are already giving initial consideration to potential obstacles to further renewable deployment&#151;such as cost, technical feasibility, planning constraints, grid infrastructure, sustainability, and impact on wider energy policy goals&#151;and how these might be overcome. We will be consulting on these issues in more detail once the European Commission has issued proposals on how the EU 20 per cent. renewable energy target should be implemented.</p>

 Academies are required, by their funding agreements, to comply with admissions law and the Department's admissions codes as though they were maintained schools. This doesn't mean that they must adopt their local authority admission arrangements. Like voluntary-aided and foundation schools, academies are responsible for determining their own admission arrangements in consultation with the local school admissions forum, on which the local authority is represented, and other local admission authorities. They must also be part of the local coordinated application process. Unlike other state funded schools, academies are required to seek the approval of the Secretary of State for their admission arrangements and before making any changes.</p>

 The Secretary of State announced on 10 July 2007 that future academies will be required to follow the national curriculum programmes of study in English, maths and ICT. This is different to the previous model whereby academies had to teach English, maths, science and ICT to all pupils and the curriculum had to be broad and balanced. The change was made because the national curriculum as a whole has been made more flexible to accommodate the kind of innovation that academies have enjoyed.</p>

 The Government collect data on children who became the subject of a child protection plan. In the past this has also meant being placed on a child protection register, although these arrangements are now being altered. Figures are available for the years ending 31 March 1990 to 2001 under the category of physical injury and for years ending 31 March 2002 to 2007 under the category of physical abuse. This information is provided by local authorities and includes cases of children suffering, or at risk of suffering significant harm from parents and carers (though it will also include other cases such as those where parents are unable to protect children from others posing a risk of harm to them). This information is set out in the following tables.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_866"><a name="71008w0076.htm_para1"><a name="07101022000927">Up until year ending 31 March 2001 physical injury was recorded and could also be identified in cases where concerns about children included a mix of different categories. After that point, local authorities ceased reporting mixed categories separately so figures from year ending 31 March 2002 onwards are only available for registrations and child protection plans that are attributed to physical abuse as a single category. In the same year, there was also a change to the registration category where physical injury was redefined as physical abuse. As a result of this change in definition, the figures reported in year ending  31 March 2002 onwards for physical abuse may not be wholly comparable to the figures reported for &#145;physical injury alone&#146; in preceding years.</p>

It is not possible to make a simple comparison between exam papers from one or two decades ago with papers today: pupils learn different things today because the world is a different place, with employers demanding different skills. The improvements we have seen in success rates at A level are a result of record investment, 30,000 extra teachers, double the number of support staff and billions invested in rebuilding crumbling schools. The further improvements planned for A-level as part of our 14-19 reforms, to be introduced in 2008, will provide further stretch and challenge for the most able pupils and ensure A-levels remain robust qualifications that are respected internationally. Success at A-level today is no less demanding than it was in the past.</p>

There are also a number of factors which can influence the per pupil funding of a school, including whether the school is about to open or close, its size and age-range. For this reason, additional contextual information has been included.</p>

 The Department does not routinely collect this information. Each year the vast majority of more than half a million key stage 4 (14-16) pupils in all areas go on work experience placements. Work experience is the single biggest, co-ordinated partnership between employers and schools. Surveys show that work experience is valued by employers, schools and&#151;most importantly&#151;learners. Ofsted reported that four out of five pupils are positive about their work experience, and that three quarters of placements are well matched to pupils&#146; interests and capabilities.</p>

 The Government are taking action to reduce the total level of school balances which stood at &#163;1.6 billion nationally at the end of the financial year 2005-06. We believe it right to ensure that some of this money is used to support the education of today&#146;s pupils. We propose therefore to require local authorities to redistribute locally 5 per cent. of all positive revenue balances which, on the basis of 2005-06 figures, would apply to around 20,500 or 90.4 per cent. of all schools. That will encourage these schools to think carefully about the level of their balances and to plan ahead for their use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_902"><a name="71008w0084.htm_para3"><a name="07101022004062">It will be for each local authority in consultation with its Schools Forum to decide how the redistribution will work in their area. Because the redistribution takes place within a local authority it will reward those schools who budget prudently for a small surplus at the end of each financial year, at the expense of those schools who maintain consistently high balances. As the resources will be redistributed there is no overall cost to the school system from this measure and we estimate that a 5 percent. annual redistribution would release around &#163;75 million a year for wider use within schools.</p>

At that stage, Ofsted removed them from the category and published an inspection report. Some remained in special measures for three years or, in a minority of cases, for even longer periods. Ofsted has no power to close such schools but informs the Department for Children, Schools and Families, as well as the relevant local authority, of the progress of all schools in special measures. Since September 2005, Ofsted has continued to monitor the progress of schools in special measures and has reinspected those which have been in the category for two years or more.

 The science curriculum programmes of study do not list which experiments can and cannot be taught in the classroom. There is however legislation that restricts the kinds of experiments that can be undertaken. For example, under the Specified Risk Material (Amendment) Regulations 1997 bulls' eyes can only be taken from cattle of six months or younger; and under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1988 (amended 1992 and 2002), benzene and genuine crude oil are banned nationally. The Consortium of Local Education Authorities for the Provision of Science Services publishes tables of materials which schools can and cannot use in science, and suggests appropriate alternatives.

Some explanation of these figures may be helpful. Before September 2005, inspectors were usually informed about how classes were organised by means of pre-inspection documentation, discussion with headteachers or teachers' schemes of work or lesson plans. Under the inspection arrangements at that time, all full-time teachers were observed by inspectors. Since September 2005, the recording of class organisation has been based either on discussions with the headteacher or teacher by reference to the lesson plan at the time of observation. A much smaller number of lessons are observed than would have been seen under the previous inspection framework. Lessons seen may therefore not represent pupil grouping in the school as a whole.</p>

 The level of qualification required to teach Mandarin and Urdu will be the same as for any other modem language and teachers will normally have a post A level qualification which will be built upon as part of their training. It is not possible to state how many new teachers of a particular language there will be over the next few years or therefore what the cost of training them will be. While the Government sets the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) a target for the number of training places for modem languages as a whole, it does not specify how this should be split between individual languages. This depends on the demand from schools and local authorities for teachers of a particular language, which will then be reflected in the number of training places offered by providers.</p>

 All teachers undergo an annual review of performance and this contributes to any decisions that may be made about their progression on the pay scale or spine range for their grade, From September 2007 revised performance management arrangements will apply to teachers in England. These will ensure that every year those who manage teachers and head teachers agree objectives appropriate to the individual teacher and at the end of each year the teacher's performance will be assessed against those objectives and associated performance criteria. Our aim is that career progression and financial rewards should go to those who are making the biggest contribution to improving pupil attainment, those who are continually developing their own expertise, and those who are helping to develop expertise in others.</p>

 In April 2001, responsibility for providing careers advice passed from the Careers Service to the Connexions Service. Connexions provides services to 13 to 19-year-olds and to people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities up to the age of 24. The following table shows the amount of central Government funding allocated to the Connexions Service and the Careers Service in each of the last 10 years. Information on the amount spent on careers advice is not collected centrally. However, an independent study undertaken in 2006 concluded that, on average, around 42 per cent. of a Connexions Partnership&#146;s expenditure was on information, advice and guidance.</p>

There are over 200 apprenticeships designed by employers, available to 16 to 19-year-olds in 80 different sectors with 130,000 employers taking part. These apprenticeships give employees the opportunity to learn on the job and also through off the job training.</p>

Whilst apprenticeships are the most appropriate route for 16 to 19-year-olds in employment, 19-year-olds are also eligible for funding through Train to Gain. 16 and 17-year-olds who are in employment, and who have not yet attained NVQ level 2 or equivalent, are entitled to reasonable paid time off during normal working hours to study or train for a qualification which will improve their future employment prospects.</p>

are proposing that where employers are employing a 16 or 17-year-old for more than 20 hours a week and are not providing or arranging accredited training for them, the employer will be required to release the young person from work for a day a week to attend training elsewhere. Where employers want to offer training themselves, we will encourage and support them to do so. We will work with employers to seek flexible and low burden ways for them to get existing good quality training accredited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_945"><a name="71008w0089.htm_para4"><a name="07101022004844">Engagement in learning, and educational attainment, are critical if young people are to achieve good outcomes, and fulfil their potential. Our 14 to 19 reforms will ensure that all young people have the opportunity to choose a learning pathway which suits them and which can be the basis for progression to further learning, higher education and employment. This is essential if our young people are to have the skills they need to compete in our increasingly global economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_946"><a name="71008w0089.htm_para5"><a name="07101022004845">And our initiatives are having an effect. The number of 16 to 18-year-olds participating in education and training increased to 1.55 million at the end of 2006, the highest number ever. And, the percentage of 19-year-olds achieving at least level 2 was 71.4 in 2006. This is an increase of 5.1 percentage points since 2004.</p>
