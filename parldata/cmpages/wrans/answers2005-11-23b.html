In Antrim the waiting list for small units of accommodation is being catered for through relets. In Newtownabbey there have recently been signs of growing stability to the extent that the development programme that is currently being prepared will make provision for an additional supply of small units over the next five years.

Among other things, the plan calls on Health and Social Services Boards and Trusts to develop their own plans at local levels. The plan describes in detail the responsibilities of boards/trusts and the decisions which they will be required to make. By their nature these involve close collaboration with GPs in planning a co-ordinated response to an outbreak.

<a name="stpa_55">On 21 October the Department wrote to GPs and a wide range of other health professionals with advice on the distinction between avian flu and pandemic, enclosing with the letter a set of commonly asked questions and answers. On 7 November a further letter was issued enclosing a key facts summary on pandemic flu and a supply of leaflets to be passed on to patients seeking information about pandemic flu. Both letters also referred recipients to the Department&#039;s website to view the updated plan, which will of course continue to be revised in the light of developments.

 I have not taken any action on this matter, as it is not Government policy to interfere in the operation of normal market forces, providing competition rules are respected. I, however, appreciate the important contribution which the dairy sector makes to the agri-food industry in Northern Ireland, albeit it is heavily reliant on the manufacture of bulk commodities for export markets. I would therefore encourage the dairy industry to continue in its efforts to move from a production-led approach towards higher value-added and market-led strategies. This should help to improve the overall competitiveness of the industry and hopefully narrow the differential.

The Draft Priorities and Budget 2006&#150;08 is presently out for consultation. It allocated additional resources for health and for education and this inevitably had some implications for other programmes including roads maintenance. It is expected that the revised budget will be announced in December 2005 and allocations will be kept under review in the context of budgetary management processes.

 Officials from the Department of the Environment and the Department for Regional Development have been liaising closely with counterparts in the Republic of Ireland&#039;s Department of Transport (DoT), National Roads Authority (NRA) and National Safety Council (NSC) and, through Cross Border Steering Group meetings, with officials from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, to ensure positive road safety benefits on both sides of the border.

<a name="stpa_69">Among the most notable areas of co-operation is the joint production of road safety campaigns that have been a significant feature of the publicity programmes in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in recent years. Joint campaigns increase value for money, production costs can be shared and the partnership approach draws sponsorship at a level that would not otherwise be available. To date there have been eight joint road safety campaigns with a ninth, addressing drink-driving, in preparation.

<a name="stpa_70">Work is in hand to develop an agreement between UK and Ireland to allow driving disqualifications to be recognised in both countries regardless of where the offences took place. This will allow the worst offenders, who would otherwise be escaping the rule of law, to be removed from the road. Work is also in hand to allow each administration to recognise the penalties for driving offences at levels below that of disqualification.

At Stage 4 the Education and Library Board considers the need for a statutory assessment, following a request from parents of the child, the school or other agencies. If the board considers that such an assessment is necessary, the parents will be notified and a multi-disciplinary assessment will be made. The board may then make a statement of special educational needs at Stage 5. From the date of the initial request for statutory assessment, the board has 18 weeks, subject to certain exceptions, to issue a proposed statement, where this has been found to be necessary.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80">Water Service&#039;s second Water Efficiency Plan, which was published on 12 January 2004, set out a wide range of measures aimed at reducing demand for water through the effective use of water by both Water Service and its customers. One of the key aspects of the plan is a reduction in the level of leakage. A significant programme of investment has resulted in leakage being reduced by over 100 megalitres per day (Ml/d) from 291 Ml/d in March 2002 to the current level of 190 Ml/d at September 2005. In achieving this level of reduction Water Service has been actively encouraging customers to play their part in eliminating leakage within private property. It is estimated that some 20 per cent. of total leakage occurs within the customers&#039; pipework, therefore customers have an important contribution to make to this aim. In 2004, the Water Service introduced the &quot;Leakline&quot; free telephone number (08000 282011) to encourage customers to report any visible leaks.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81">Water Service continues to raise awareness of the need for water efficiency by providing practical advice on the actions that the customers can take. These include carrying out water efficiency audits and the installation of Hippo bags in larger toilet cisterns to reduce the amount of water used. Water efficiency is also promoted through the distribution of leaflets to customers, through public displays, exhibitions and presentations identifying how water can be used wisely in the home, school, business and agricultural premises Over the past few years, water efficiency leaflets have been issued to every property in Northern Ireland. Water Service has a double decker bus, known as the Waterbus, which contains an exhibition on water and sewerage services. The Waterbus visits schools to make children aware of the water cycle, water sources, water treatment, the efficient use of water and wastewater treatment, through a number of displays, models, experiments, video shows and computers.</p>

 It is very important that Commonwealth Caribbean countries produce appropriately costed sugar transition action plans as soon as possible in order to be eligible for European Union (EU) transitional assistance in 2006, and so that the European Commission (EC) can make realistic and appropriate plans for further financing from 2007 onwards.

<a name="stpa_92">DFID has been closely engaged with ensuring that the impact of sugar reform is fully considered for a number of years. In 2003 and 2004, DFID-funded reports were produced on the impact of reform on the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Sugar Protocol countries, the impact on the Least Developed Countries and options for transitional assistance. These reports were made public, and have enabled an informed debate on the developmental aspects of sugar reform to take place.
</p>

<a name="stpa_93">In March 2005, DFID funded a workshop in Trinidad which initiated the process of developing sugar transition action plans in the Caribbean.

 The European Union, under the UK presidency, condemned the recent attacks on non-governmental organisation (NGO) staff in northern Uganda in a statement issued on 31 October. NGOs play a crucial role in providing humanitarian relief to hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the conflict in the north. As a result of the recent attacks many agencies have severely curtailed their movement outside major towns. The World Food Programme continues to deliver essential emergency food aid as normal under heavy military escort.

 In response to the current situation where most of sub-Saharan Africa is off-track to meet the water and sanitation Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets, DFID has committed to double spending on water supply and sanitation sectors in Africa from &#163;47.5 million in 2004&#150;05 to &#163;95 million in 2007&#150;08. This will bring our global spending on water and sanitation up to at least &#163;225 million a year by 2008. We anticipate that meeting the commitment will require an increase in expenditure through all funding mechanisms, including our own bilateral programmes, but also through encouraging others such as the World Bank and the EU to do more in water and sanitation. We do not have specific country targets.

 As I noted in my oral answer to the hon.

<p><a name="st_162"><a name="51123w21.html_spnew4"><b> Jim Knight </b> 
<i>[holding answer 21 November 2005]:</i> Under current EU legislation, the rate for compulsory modulation to be applied across the EU-15 agreed as part of the 2003 CAP reforms is 4 per cent. in 2006, rising to 5 per cent. in each of the years from 2007 to 2012. The European Commission has recently suggested, in the context of the EU future financing negotiations, an increase in that rate of compulsory modulation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51123w21.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_109">In addition to this, the UK countries apply additional national modulation, which for England is 6 per cent. in 2006. It is likely that the rate in England will rise in future years, in order to provide part of the funding for Environmental Stewardship. However, the rate of any additional national modulation will depend on the outcome of the EU future financing negotiations for the period 2007&#150;13. The UK is pressing to ensure the principle of additional national modulation is available to member states in the next budget period.

 The disposal of animal carcases and other animal by-products is governed by Regulation (EC) 1774/2002. The regulation bans burial as a disposal route for animal by-products.

Notes:<br>

1. Framework changes occurred in January 2000 and September 2003. Changes in the way groupings in lessons were recorded may mean that data are not directly comparable from periods of one framework to another.<br>

2. From January 2000 to July 2003, the inspection arrangements included full and short inspections. The majority of lessons observed will have been in full inspections. The most effective schools had short inspections.<br>

This is why the priorities for public funding of adult learning are helping individuals to attain the platform of employability represented by improved basic skills and a first full level 2 qualification. In addition, work for my Department by the centre for the wider benefits of learning shows that participation in adult learning has beneficial effects on a wide spectrum of measures which relate to the quality of life both for the individual and for society as a whole. These include smoking, exercise taken, life satisfaction, and attitudes such as race tolerance, authoritarianism, political cynicism, political interest, and voting behaviour.

The strategy will ensure that substantial additional levels of public funding for FE and training are focused on the key priorities: embedding 14&#150;19 reforms and raising attainment of Level 2 at 19, supporting low skilled adults in acquiring basic skills and progressing from basic skills to Level 2 and above, increasing employer engagement and increasingly meeting the needs of employers, and continuing to raise standards in all areas of education and training.

One of the measures that the LSC will be taking, to ensure those key priorities are met, is to cease funding for very short courses&#151;below nine hours. Very short Skills for Life programmes should be part of larger programmes aiming towards a qualification achievement, while other very short courses appear to have limited benefits in terms of progression for learners.

 Each autumn the Department sets out its priorities and funding for the LSC in an annual grant letter.

Funding to cover administrative costs is based on the clear demonstration of need. When agreement is reached the additional resources are formally notified, in writing, to the LSC as additions to the grant letter. The LSC&#039;s core administration costs have fallen steadily from 3.4 per cent. of total funding in 2001&#150;02 to 2.5 per cent. of its planned total budget in 2005&#150;06. Using the figures in LSC annual accounts for 2001&#150;02, which include the set up costs occurred in the last seven months of 2000&#150;01, gives the administration budget as 4.6 per cent. of total funding.

Notes:<br>

1. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)<br>

An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

2. Patient counts<br>

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID. This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

3. Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)<br>





The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

4. Ungrossed data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

 The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has carried out surveys following up the implementation of the clinical guideline on the assessment and treatment of people with fertility problems published in 2004. The surveys measuring the impact of the guideline, available on the NICE website at www.nice.org.uk, have found that 95 per cent. of the primary care trusts (PCTs) who responded are offering at least one cycle of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) to those defined as eligible according to local criteria. We advised PCTs to offer a minimum of one cycle of IVF by April 2005 to those who meet the clinical criteria in the guideline, giving priority to couples with no children living with them. We also advised that we expected the national health service to make progress to full implementation of the guideline in the longer term.

<a name="stpa_257">The MRC does not normally allocate funds to particular topics: research proposals in all areas compete for the funding available. When appropriate, high quality research in particular areas of strategic importance may be given priority in competition for funds, but research excellence and importance to health continues to be the primary considerations in funding decisions. The MRC always welcomes high quality applications for support into any aspect of human health and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding.

However, the Prison Service recognises that sex in prisons is a reality and prison doctors were advised in 1995 that they should make condoms available to individual prisoners, on application, if in their clinical judgment, there is a risk of transmission of HIV infection during sexual activity. The Prison Service is planning to issue, in 2006, revised guidance and instructions which aim to clarify the policy on condoms so that it can be applied more evenly across the prison estate. The intention is to preserve individuals&#039; health rather than to encourage sexual relationships.
