We believe this approach is the right way to achieve the EU&#039;s objectives as set out in the Common Position of 1996, including to promote the peaceful transition to a pluralist democracy in Cuba. Normalised contact with the Cuban Government will enable the UK Government to press the Cuban Government on issues of concern&#151;especially human rights, including our call for the release of all political prisoners&#151;and to further UK/Cuba co-operation in areas of mutual interest such as the fight against crime, child protection and in developing sustainable tourism in Cuba.

 I refer my hon. Friend to my answer of13 December 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 872W. There are no plans at present to legislate to prevent cross-examination of a witness by a defendant in the criminal court, or by a respondent in the family court.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w12.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_128">Section 36 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 already gives the court discretion to prevent cross-examination by a defendant in person in criminal proceedings, if it appears to the court that the quality of the evidence given by the witness is likely to be diminished by such examination. The wide discretion afforded judges in hearing family proceedings gives them sufficient powers to ensure that victims can be protected from intrusive and unfair questioning by the respondent in family proceedings. They can offer assistance in how questions are framed and evidence is presented. The judge also has an inherent power to refuse to admit evidence at a trial if he considers that it is in the interests of justice to do so.

 If there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health, European Community legislation allows us to take appropriate safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of meat from all, or parts, of that country. At the time of the outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal, we did not judge it necessary to take safeguard action since the South African authorities had prohibited the issue of export certificates for fresh meat from the area in which the outbreak had occurred. This meant that exports from South Africa could not take place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w15.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_175">On 7&#150;8 November 2000 the European Commission informed the Standing Veterinary Committee (SVC) (now known as the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health) of the outcome of an inspection carried out in South Africa by Commission inspectors, and indicated that safeguard measures may be necessary because of some difficulties the South African authorities were experiencing in dealing with the outbreak. On 25 November the Commission published legislation prohibiting imports into the Community of fresh meat from 16 districts in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The Government were satisfied that the action taken by the Commission and controls in place in South Africa were sufficient to prevent any risk of disease entering the UK.

<p>
<a name="50221w15.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_176">By 20 December it was clear that the situation in South Africa had deteriorated. The Government reviewed the situation and a decision was taken to take safeguard action. This was delayed due to the Christmas period, and on 5 January the Government issued a Declaration under Regulation 35 of the Products of Animal Origin (Import and Export) Regulations 1996, prohibiting imports into England and Wales of meat from all of South Africa. Similar action was taken in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

<a name="50221w15.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_177">The outbreak in Mpumalanga was confirmed on 30 November. The Commission took action in February 2001 to extend EU restrictions on imports of meat in respect of Mpumalanga. By that time, the UK had already banned imports of meat from the whole country, so no further action was necessary.

 The Government have worked with all stakeholders to ensure that the REACH proposal is well focused on achieving maximum practical benefit to human health and the environment with a minimum of direct impact on industrial competitiveness.

We have recently completed a study which indicates that, if &#039;one substance, one registration&#039; were to be adopted, the cost to industry and the authorities of REACH would be decreased by at least &#8364;77 million in comparison to the Commission estimates on the basis of the current proposals.

Building on that, we will shortly publish a position statement, Defra and Social Enterprise&quot;, which will reflect the contribution of the sector to Defra&#039;s wider policy objectives, including sustainable development and environmental protection. The statement will reflect the contribution which social enterprises already make to delivering a range of environmental objectives, including those on waste management, renewable energy, and natural resource protection. It will also set out our plans to contribute to the continued growth of the sector. The position statement is the latest stage in a programme of work to embed support for social enterprise in the development of Defra&#039;s policies.

 Since the creation of Defra in June 2001 the following figures are available for lost and stolen passes. These passes are programmed electronically and once a loss is reported the pass is cancelled immediately. This greatly reduces the possibility of anyone using it illegally to enter Defra premises. The cost to produce an electronic photographic pass is approximately 10 (staff time and material). The sharp increase in lost passes in the core Department is in part due to the larger numbers of passes issued to contractors&#039; staff refurbishing buildings and losses by those staff.

The UK applied to the Parties to the Montreal Protocol for a critical use exemption for use on strawberries, to allow additional limited time to bring alternatives on line. Following technical scrutiny by the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee (MBTOC) of the Montreal Protocol and the European Commission, the Commission have licensed some 30 tonnes of methyl bromide for critical uses for strawberries for 2005.

The Government will set a target as part of the 2006 SR06 Spending Review to halve by 2010&#150;11 the numbers of children suffering a combination of material deprivation and relative low income.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment his Department has made 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Feb 2005 : Column 104W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
of the effectiveness of the 52 week linking rule; and what qualitative research his Department has commissioned to evaluate it.  [214628]</p>








<p><a name="st_209"><a name="50221w27.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 The 52 week linking rule was introduced in 1998 to allow people moving off an incapacity benefit into work to re-access any higher rates of benefit that had been in payment if their job did not work out and they needed to re-claim. It was introduced as a result of research evidence which found that people feared moving off benefit in case their job did not last, leading to difficulties in requalifying for their old benefit. The importance of linking rules was confirmed in subsequent research. For example, an evaluation in 2003 of clients eligible for the new deal for disabled people identified the most important &#039;bridge to work&#039; was the knowledge that they could return to their original benefit if needed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w27.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_291">The Department of Social Security Research Report 141 incapacity benefits and work incentives included qualitative research into the operation of the 52 week linking rule. The conclusions of the researchers were that knowing about the linking rule could influence decisions to move into work; that it reduced some of the risks and anxieties about loss of income and security attached to moving into work and that it was generally appreciated by clients. There were also indications that lack of awareness of the rule reduced its incentive effect as did anxiety that the rule would be hard to access and there was evidence that this was the case. This has been borne out by recent research. The Department for Work and Pensions Research Report A Stepping Stone to Employment&quot; published last December noted the very low levels of awareness of the linking rules amongst clients on permitted work.

<p>
<a name="50221w27.html_para3">

Notes:<br>

1.The table refers to the number of individuals whose Personal or Stakeholder Pension has received a contribution during the year.<br>

2.Status is largely based on what is reported by an individual when making their opening application, or for existing business by the provider.<br>





3.Earned income is derived from the Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) and consists of all income chargeable under Schedule E (mainly pay, private and occupational pensions, retirement annuities and state retirement pensions), Schedule D Cases I and II (self-employment income), and miscellaneous other earnings.<br>

4.The Personal and Stakeholder column includes people contributing to either, or both, a Personal and Stakeholder Pension. For this reason, it will not total the individual columns for Personal Pensions and Stakeholder Pensions.<br>

5.All figures are rounded to the nearest 10,000 and may not sum as a result.<br>

 In the period between April 2001 and September 2004 over 40 pension providers have sold nearly 2.2 million stakeholder pensions, and the average charge on personal pensions has fallen from a 1.9 per cent. Reduction In Yield in 1996 to 1.1 per cent. in 2004, a fall the Pensions Commission attributes a significant part of to the stakeholder pension charge cap. This fall in charges has ensured more of peoples savings go towards their retirement, and less is consumed by charges.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w28.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_301">However the Government recognises that it has been difficult to ensure that the pensions industry can effectively market stakeholder pensions within the constraints of a 1 per cent. charge cap, and to increase the proportion of under-savers actively targeted by providers the Government have, after commissioning an independent review by Deloitte, announced a revised charge cap of 1.5 per cent. for new members joining on or after 6 April 2005 for the first 10 years of membership, reverting to 1 per cent. thereafter. These changes will increase the number of under-savers the pensions industry can cost effectively target, while still ensuring good value for the consumer.

 The Services, as part of their system of support to bereaved relatives, seek to provide full information on the progress of inquiries. However, a Board of Inquiry is an internal inquiry held to investigate the facts of an incident in order to prevent recurrence. It is not a court of law and it does not fulfil the same function as a Coroner&#039;s inquest (or a Procurator Fiscal&#039;s inquiry in Scotland), which is to establish the cause of death. Boards of Inquiry do not sit in public; and members of the public, bereaved relatives and the press have no right to be present. It has been the policy of the MOD since December 1992 to make available to the next of kin, at no cost, copies of completed Board of Inquiry reports, subject only to the redaction of security sensitive information and third party data, and the avoidance of prejudice to any other investigation.

 As has been made clear in previous responses, the process of restructuring the infantry has been worked through by the Army in consultation with the divisions and regiments concerned. As part of this process, infantry divisions were asked to suggest options for new regimental titles. &#039;The Royal Lancashire Regiment&#039; was put forward by the King&#039;s Division as an option for the new regimental title. However, of the options put forward by the Division, the proposed title of the &#039;King&#039;s, Lancashire and Border Regiment&#039; was judged by the Army Board to best reflect all the antecedent regiments from which it will be drawn. This was felt to be particularly important because of the fact that this reorganisation involved the merging of three previously distinct regiments, into a two-battalion regiment. That the word &#039;Royal&#039; is not included in the new title should not be taken as an omission. Rather it simply reflects the fact that, of the options put forward by the Division, the one settled upon by the Army Board happened not to contain the word &#039;Royal&#039;.

 Improving interoperability between networks is a key theme of Network Enabled Capability, and there are a number of initiatives to this end. The Joint Network Management System is a programme funded by the Defence Communication Services Agency to manage tactical datalink networks in the UK. The Multiple Tactical Datalink Management System (MTDMS) forms part of a programme funded from the Equipment Plan to provide a deployable tactical datalink management capability for out of area operations. Neither programme has yet received final approval to proceed but our current planning assumption is that they will be introduced in 2006. The two systems address different requirements but they are required to be interoperable as there are circumstances when the MTDMS could be used in the UK. The MTDMS is intended to be usable in operations with US forces and we are therefore monitoring closely the development of the US Joint Interface Control Officers Support System.

 The &#039;Future Capabilities&#039; White Paper published in July 2003 explains how we plan to make the armed forces more flexible and deployable.

A robust and modern amphibious capability, based around two new ships, HMS Alibon and Bulwark, supported by the Bay Class landing ships, will provide a step change in our ability to launch and support forces ashore. For the Army, there will be a shift in emphasis towards light and medium weight forces. These will be supported by a number of new equipment programmes, including the Future Rapid Effects System family of vehicles and the Light Mobile Artillery Weapon System. In the air, aswell as introducing 25 A400M aircraft from 2011, wenow intend to buy our current fleet of four leased C-17 aircraft together with one additional aircraft, significantly increasing our strategic lift capability.

<p><a name="st_270"><a name="50221w34.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Ministry of Defence&#039;s research budget is focussed on examining technical possibilities in a variety of technology areas. These can be exploited through many different routes to new techniques, concepts and equipment. It is not possible to definitively split weaponry research out of that on materials, electronics, system integration, engines, communications and others. The development of technology into equipment is handled by the Defence Procurement Agency and it has a development budget that is spent on specific items such as satellites, communications equipment, vehicles, and weaponry, such as small arms, missiles, artillery. As we do not collate information on research activity in the way requested, it would be disproportionately expensive to provide a more detailed breakdown.

Notes:<br>

1.Finished in-year admissions&#151;A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2.Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)&#151;The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

3.Cause code&#151;The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects.<br>

4.Ungrossed data&#151;Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

These figures do not include dentists who moved to other areas and continued to work in the general or personal dental services. The dentists could have ceased doing national health service work for a number of different reasons, for example retirement or to take a short-term absence, as well as because the dentists only wished to treat private patients.

By 2006, older people&#039;s services will receive an extra &#163;1 billion a year to expand home care services, extra care housing, community equipment, services for carers and intermediate care.

It also acts as a stimulus to ensure prompt discharge.

<a name="stpa_370">We accept that continuing professional development should be flexible and responsive to the needs of individual practitioners, their patients and the organisations they work in. It is for this reason that the new GP contract specifically includes an element for protected time to allow GPs and their practice staff opportunities for development, but which also allows GPs, with support from their PCTs, to decide what their local development needs are and how best to meet them.

Finished in-year admissions<br>

A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

Finished consultant episode (FCE)<br>

An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

Ungrossed data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>





Time waited<br>

Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.Eligibility for NHS sight tests was extended to patients aged 60 and over from 1 April 1999. PCTs took over responsibilities from HAs in October 2002.<br>

2.Sight tests can not be equated to the numbers of patients. Although most people do not come back for a sight test within the year, some patients suffering from medical conditions are advised to have re-examinations sooner.<br>

3.Patients aged 60 and over are not eligible for free NHS optical vouchers for help towards glasses or contact lenses on age grounds. However, some patients will be eligible under other category such as adult income support, Pension Credits guarantee credit or holders of HC2/HC3 certificates. It is not possible to break down voucher numbers by age for these categories.<br>

It addresses key areas to improve care and support across the neurological patient pathway from diagnosis, investigation and initial treatment, through rehabilitation and long-term support, to end of life care. It does not look at specific neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, rather it identifies the common issues affecting people with long-term neurological conditions and how these may be addressed.

1.Three month vacancy information is as at 31 March 2004<br>

2.Three month vacancies are vacancies which Trusts are actively trying to fill, which had lasted for three months or more (whole time equivalents)<br>

3.Three month vacancy rates are three month vacancies expressed as a percentage of three month vacancies plus staff in post<br>

4.Three month vacancy rates are calculated using staff in post from the Vacancy Survey, March 2004<br>

5.Percentages are rounded to one decimal place<br>

6.Figures where sum of staff in post (as at 31 March 2004) and vacancies is less than 10<br>

7.Figures where sum of staff in post (as at 31 March 2004) and vacancies is zero<br>

Staff in post:<br>

1.Staff in post data is from the Non-Medical Workforce Census, September 2003<br>

General:<br>

1.Vacancy and staff in post numbers are rounded to the nearest whole number<br>

2.Calculating the vacancy rates using the above data may not equal the actual vacancy rates<br>

3.Due to rounding, totals may not equal the sum of component parts<br>

4.Strategic HA figures are based on trusts, and do not necessarily reflect the geographical provision of health care<br>

5.London Ambulance Service NHS Trust cannot be assigned to a particular Strategic Health Authority<br>

<sup>(58)</sup>In 1999&#150;2000, NHS smoking cessation services were set up in the 26 health action zones (HAZ) in England and services were rolled out across the NHS to the rest of England in 2000&#150;01.<br>

<sup>(59)</sup>The cost of the NHS stop smoking services and the cost per successful quitter in 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 included the cost of giving clients &#039;free&#039; NRT/NRT (or vouchers); from 2001&#150;02 onwards the cost of the service and the cost per quitter excluded the cost of NRT or Zyban on prescription. Only a few nicotine replacement therapy products were available on prescription until 17 April 2001, when all NRT products became available on NHS prescription. Bupropion (Zyban) became available on NHS prescription from June 2000. Therefore, the costs from 2001&#150;02 onwards are not directly comparable with the costs in previous years.<br>

<sup>(60)</sup>Net ingredient cost is the basic cost of a drug and does not take account of discounts, dispensing fees or prescription charge income. Note that some prescriptions for NRT/Bupropion are dispensed to people not using the NHS stop smoking services.<br>

<sup>(61)</sup>This figure only includes the costs of NRT, as bupropion (Zyban) was not available until June 2000.<br>

Geography is also important, as rural PCTs would need to cover a much larger geographical area to serve the same population as urban PCTs. Finally the configuration of hospitals and other health providers results in natural health communities which are not of equal size across the country.

<a name="stpa_401">The impact of these local circumstances on size is such that the Department has never given a figure for the optimum number of patients in a PCT.

 Trees provide benefits to urban air pollution, but can also have adverse effects on air quality.

<p>
<a name="50221w49.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_421"><i>Adverse effects of trees on air quality</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w49.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_422">Trees can have adverse effects on air quality. They can release biogenic emissions known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which in combination with oxides of nitrogen (NOx), can contribute to the formation of other pollutants, especially ozone and particles. Ozone and particles are known to damage human health when in the lower atmosphere. In addition, trees release pollen, which can cause allergic reactions in sensitive people, and can be associated with hay fever and asthma.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w49.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_423"><i>Beneficial effects of trees on air quality</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w49.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_424">Trees deliver air quality benefits in two ways. Firstly, the cooling effect of their shade can directly reduce evaporative emissions from vehicles and other fuel storage, and by cooling homes and offices, power generation emissions are also lessened. Cooling also reduces the speed at which atmospheric chemical reactions occur.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w49.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_425">Secondly, trees can remove various pollutants from the atmosphere via deposition to their leaves and needles. Trees can remove pollutants typically associated with urban air pollution such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and ammonia reducing atmospheric concentrations and improving air quality. The pollutants generally collect in the leaves or bark which are then shed as part of the tree&#039;s life cycle. Trees also reduce concentrations of harmful particulate matter when leaf surfaces collect airborne particles, that are subsequently washed to the ground when it rains. The trees most suited to removal of particles are those with large leaf areas, or sticky or hairy leaves. Studies indicate that the hairy leaves of lime trees can collect four times as many PM10 particles than plane trees.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w49.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_426">In addition, trees can have a positive benefit in terms of global warming by acting as a sink for carbon dioxide, which is the most common greenhouse gas. Trees remove carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen during photosynthesis. The carbon is stored in the tree and the oxygen is released back into the atmosphere.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w49.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_427">A recent report entitled Trees and Sustainable Urban Air Quality&quot;, produced under the Natural Environment Research Council&#039;s Urban Regeneration and the Environment (URGENT) programme by the University of Lancaster and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology Edinburgh, investigated the role of trees in reducing urban air pollution. The report concluded that trees that emit the least reactive VOCs and have large leaf surface areas have the best effect on air quality. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Feb 2005 : Column 188W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Scots pine, common alder, larch, Norway maple, field maple, ash and silver birch were found to remove the most pollutants without contributing to the formation of new pollutants, whereas oaks, poplars and willows were found to have detrimental effects on air quality downwind.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w49.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_428">In general, the report concludes that the effects on air quality of large scale planting of most tree species in cities would be positive and for example, by doubling the number of trees in the West Midlands, the concentration of small particles could be reduced by 25 per cent., avoiding 140 deaths that are currently caused by airborne particles each year in the West Midlands.

On our railways, passenger kilometres have increased from 32.1billion in 1996&#150;97 to 40.9 billion in 2003&#150;04, a rise of 27 per cent. In terms of improvements to air quality, emissions of the UK&#039;s two main pollutants&#151;nitrous oxides and particles&#151;fell by 31 per cent. and 27 per cent. respectively between 1997 and 2002.

<sup>(71)</sup>For the years 1997&#150;2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used by ONS to define alcohol-related deaths are listed:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>

For the years 2001&#150;2003 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>

The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in:<br>

Baker A and Rooney C (2003). Recent trends in alcohol-related mortality, and the impact of ICD-10 on the monitoring of these deaths in England and Wales. Health Statistics Quarterly&quot; 17, pp 5&#150;14.<br>

 Bulava is reported to be a new solid propellant submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM) which has been under development in Russia for several years and has a reported maximum range of approx 8000km. When it enters service, probably in a new class of submarine, it will supplement and eventually replace older SLBMs, thus enabling Russia to maintain its sea-based strategic nuclear capability. Although not expected to provide Russia with a greater capability in terms of range, Bulava is likely to incorporate more modern materials and technology than currently deployed systems.

<p><a name="st_601"><a name="50221w69.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 To ensure a shared approach across inspection, the Children Act 2004 allows for the creation of a Framework for the inspection of Children&#039;s Services and for inspectorates to carry out joint area reviews (JARs) of all children&#039;s services provided in an area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w69.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_567">The new inspection arrangements will capture how well services are delivered and how well they work together to improve children and young people&#039;s wellbeing. Through the common approach provided by the Framework, joint area reviews will provide a picture of what it is to be a child in the local authority area being reviewed. JARs will replace a number of existing separate inspections for children and young people at local authority level, including LEA inspections, Connexions service inspections and inspections of children&#039;s social care. Together, inspectorates will judge the way in which all services for education, health, social care and youth justice, both individually and collectively, contribute to improving outcomes.

 The EU Advisory Committee on Vocational Training (ACVT) met <i>(a)</i> once during the Italian presidency (26&#150;27 November 2003), <i>(b)</i> once during the Irish presidency (23&#150;24 June 2004), and <i>(c)</i> once during the Dutch presidency (25&#150;26 November 2004). All of these meetings took place in Brussels. In each case an official from the DfES attended. Officials from the TUC and CBI represent the UK trade unions and employers. The ACVT is a tripartite committee of Government, employer and trade union representatives. It was set up by Council Decision 63/266/EEC dated 2 April 1963 which laid down general principles for implementing a common vocational training policy across the EU. This decision was superseded by Council Decision 2004/223/EC dated 26 February 2004 which laid down new rules to take account of enlargement of the EU. For further information, please refer to the series of Command Papers on prospects for the EU&#151;Cm6174 (April 2004), Cm6310 (September 2004) and Cm6450 (February 2005), which cover the periods of the above presidencies and are available on the FCO website at: www.fco.gov.uk/commandpapers.

In 2004/05, funding rates for colleges meeting their targets increased by 5 per cent., while those for school sixth forms rose by 4 per cent. This trend will continue in the 2005/06 academic year.

<sup>(150)</sup> The combined LEA and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LEA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LEA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LEA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA).<br>

2 Upto and including 1998&#150;99 financial data are taken from Revenue Outturn spending returns submitted to the ODPM. From 1999&#150;00 onwards financial data are taken from Section 52 Outturn Statements submitted to the Department for Education and Skills. 2003&#150;04 data remains provisional and is subject to change by the LEA.<br>

<sup>(151)</sup> Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of moneys from local government to central government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99.<br>

<sup>(152)</sup> Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place on the 1 April 1998 where pre-LGR Lancashire LEA was split into Lancashire LEA, Blackburn with Darwin LEA and Blackpool LEA. As a result, up to 1997&#150;98 data are for pre-LGR Lancashire LEA and from 1998&#150;99 data are for post-LGR Lancashire LEA. This break in consistency is shown by the dotted line.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Financial data are collected at local authority level and not constituency level and as such the figures provided are for Lancashire LEA.<br>

2. Figures are rounded to the nearest 1,000 as reported by Lancashire LEA at 14 February 2005.<br>

Our ambition is that in the next full Parliament, subject to future spending decisions, 60 per cent. of all authorities will have started in the BSF programme, or else be given resources to renew at least one secondary school with the greatest need as a school for the future, or as an academy. Each BSF scheme will be judged on its merits, and is not necessarily contingent on school reorganisation. Other capital allocations to the council and its schools were announced on 30 November, and are set out in the following table:

The guidance suggests that any member with such an interest should withdraw from the discussion and take no part in the decision. Alternatively, where it is known in advance that a conflict of interest will arise, a member may invite an alternate, who has no interest to declare, to attend the meeting in his place.

They may also refer to other records kept by the council or the registrar of births, marriages and deaths if they consider that further checks are necessary. It is an offence under the Representation of the People Regulations 2001 to fail to comply with a request for information from an ERO or to provide false or inaccurate information to a registration officer. The electoral register is available for public inspection which enables checks to be made that only eligible electors are on the register.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

2. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

3. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

4. Length of stay&#151;duration of spell (LOS)&#151;is calculated as the difference in days between the admission date and the discharge date, where both are given. LOS is based on hospital spells and only applies to ordinary admissions, i.e. day cases are excluded (unless otherwise stated). Information relating to LOS figures, including discharge method/destination, diagnoses and any operative procedures, is based only on the final episode of the spell.<br>

5. Time waited statistics from hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority summarisation forms and primary care trust summarisation schedules, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure by the relevant HAs, and the commissioner costs of the primary care trusts (PCTs). Figures are given in cash terms.<br>

2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of HAs and PCTs.<br>

3. Figures for 1996&#150;97 to 2001&#150;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. This is to ensure consistency between years. Figures based on strategic health authority (SHA) areas have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure, which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.<br>





4. In many HAs, there are factors, which distort the expenditure. These include:<br>

the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and<br>

asset revaluations in national health service trusts being funded through health authorities or primary care trusts.<br>

5. The majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the individual health authority accounts or primary care trust summarisation schedules and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities or primary care trusts. Total expenditure on these items by the Dental Practice Board and the Prescription Pricing Authority cannot be allocated to individual health bodies. For these reasons, expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between health authorities or between different years.<br>

6. Expenditure on general dental services and pharmaceutical services accounted for by the Dental Practice Board and Prescription Pricing Authority, respectively, are excluded. This expenditure cannot be included within the figures for the individual health bodies as they are not included in commissioner accounts.<br>

 The regulatory circular Tenancy Management: Eligibility and Evictions&quot; issued by the Housing Corporation in July 2004 contains clear guidance about the corporation&#039;s expectations of registered social landlords (RSLs) (more commonly known as housing associations) in dealing with eviction and in particular housing benefit. The guidance states

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_304">&#039;Possession proceedings for rent arrears should not be started against a tenant who can demonstrate that they have (1) a reasonable expectation of eligibility for housing benefit; (2) provided the local authority with all the evidence required to process a housing benefit claim; (3) paid required personal contributions towards the charges. Associations should make every effort to establish effective ongoing liaison with housing benefit departments and to make direct contact with them before taking enforcement action. A certificate should be obtained, if possible, to confirm that there are no outstanding benefit enquires, according to Department of Work and Pensions good practice guidance&#039;.</p>

<a name="50221w87.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_690">The Civil Justice Council is working with the Department of Constitutional Affairs to issue a pre-action protocol for possessions cases. If introduced, then it would require social landlords to have carried out all the actions contained within before a court will hear a possessions case. In addition the Office of the Deputy min Minister is leading on a cross-Whitehall group on possessions and evictions which includes the Housing Corporation. We are clear that possession should be a last resort and intend to issue good practice guidance later this year which will set out the steps we would expect landlords to take in order to avoid possession action wherever possible.

The review concluded that council tax should be retained but reformed and that any further work on LIT should proceed on the basis that it is a supplement to, not a replacement for, council tax.

The inquiry will, among other things, conduct thorough analysis of options other than council tax for local authorities to raise supplementary revenue, including LIT, reform of non-domestic rates and other possible local taxes and charges, as well as the possible combination of such options.

 King Gyanendra of Nepal assumed the throne under difficult circumstances, following the massacre of King Birendra and members of the royal family in 2001. During King Gyanendra&#039;s reign the conflict with the Maoists has escalated while the security and human rights situations have deteriorated considerably. While we have welcomed the King&#039;s stated commitment to multi-party democracy and peace, the shared failure of the King and the political parties to work together to find a common way forward on tackling Nepal&#039;s problems has been disappointing. We are deeply concerned by the King&#039;s assumption of power on 1 February, which will increase the risk of instability in Nepal and undermine the institutions of democracy and constitutional monarchy in the country.

 In Guinea, DFID has supported the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and UNICEF to a total of &#163;1 million in 2004 to provide for the care and needs of all refugees residing in camps. We are assessing this support, before deciding on possible additional funding. In Liberia, Ivorian refugees are being assisted by the UNHCR and the World Food Programme. DFID has provided grants totalling &#163;2.1 million to these agencies for their work in Liberia, in 2004. DFID is not providing support to Ivorian refugees in Mali, Burkina Faso or Ghana. DFID understands that the numbers in Mali and Ghana are low. According to UNHCR, 10,000 Burkinabe migrants returned to Burkina Faso, but no Ivorian refugees have been recorded there.

 Monthly disaggregated data of this nature is not readily available. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the agency responsible for registering and monitoring formal cross-border refugee flows, the numbers of Ivorian refugees arriving in these countries since September 2003 have been relatively low. Between January 2004 and September 2004, Mali registered 805 Ivorian refugee arrivals, Guinea registered nine, and none were recorded in the other countries. Following the upsurge in violence in Cote d&#039;Ivoire in November 2004, 10,000 Ivorians were registered as newly-arriving refugees in Liberia, although more than half have since returned. The same events prompted up to 10,000 Burkinabe migrants to return to Burkina Faso, but, according to the UNHCR, there was no similar movement of Ivorians.

EC aid equals 10 per cent. of world overseas development assistance and the member states of the European Union and the EC together provide over half of global development assistance. This collective effort has given Europe the credibility to challenge its own member states and other Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors to increase ODA/gross national income targets and global development aid. EU co-ordination led in 2002 to a specific EU ODA/GNI volume target commitment of 0.39 per cent. by 2006 as an input to the Monterrey Financing for Development Conference. This has contributed to a considerable increase of aid resources by EU and non-EU donors in support of the Millennium Development Goals. Repatriating aid would reduce the UK&#039;s and EU&#039;s leverage to help secure such increases.

<p><a name="st_877"><a name="50221w99.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 Hurricane Ivan has been a catastrophe for Grenada. Two weeks after the hurricane hit the island, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) undertook a macro-socio-economic assessment of the damage caused. This assessed that 90 per cent. of housing stock was either destroyed or damaged, and around 30 per cent. of the population made homeless. The OECS/ECLAC assessment indicated that the damage to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Feb 2005 : Column 378W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
schools, hospitals, businesses and infrastructure was estimated to be in the region of &#163;500 million, or twice Grenada&#039;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w99.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_814">Grenada had been recording impressive growth rates in recent years and was expected to grow by 5.7 per cent. in 2004. With significant losses to the main productive sectors of agriculture and tourism caused by the hurricane, the economy is now expected to have contracted by 1.4 per cent. in 2004. Some 90 per cent. of hotel rooms on the island were affected by the hurricane. A staff mission from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will provide a further update on the post-Ivan macro-economic situation and the prospects for economic recovery at a donor briefing meeting in Barbados at the end of February 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w99.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_815">Unemployment has increased with an estimated 40,000 jobs directly affected by the hurricane. However, as the physical reconstruction of buildings and infrastructure gets under way, it is anticipated that unemployment levels will start to decline.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w99.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_816">The devastation to the agricultural sector caused by Hurricane Ivan was particularly severe: 95 per cent. of nutmeg trees&#151;Grenada&#039;s principal export commodity&#151;were uprooted. Regrowth and recovery of the nutmeg industry will take an estimated 7&#150;10 years. Grenada can, however, continue to export its reserve stocks for the next three years. This should help to cushion the impact of the loss of the trees on the economy. Cocoa was also affected, albeit, to a much lesser extent. 30 per cent. of the crop will need to be replanted, and it is expected that 50&#150;70 per cent. of the harvest for next year will be available.

<a name="stpa_817">At the 19 November donor conference on Grenada, the IMF announced that for the calendar year of 2004, donor contributions would fill the &#163;21 million gap in Grenada&#039;s finances. At that time, the IMF anticipated that a financing gap of &#163;4.2 million remained for 2005, which would widen in 2006 to &#163;19.2 million. The IMF currently has a team in Grenada to undertake a fuller assessment of financing needs in 2005 and 2006. The IMF team will brief DFID officials and other development partners on their findings at a meeting in Barbados on 23 February 2005.

 Officials from the Department for International Development (DFID) are in constant contact with the other major donors, and receive regular updates on commitments and disbursements. Thus far, the Government of Grenada have received considerable commitments from the international donor community to provide reconstruction and recovery assistance. At the 19 November 2004 Second Donor Conference on Grenada, the World Bank reported that the total commitments were in the order of &#163;105 million.

 DFID has had numerous discussions with the Government of Kazakhstan, to urge them to participate in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), a UK-led international initiative to promote transparency over revenues from oil, gas and mining. The UK Government believe that EITI could lead to significant improvements in resource management in Kazakhstan, and help to ensure that Kazakhstan&#039;s significant oil revenues fulfil their potential as an engine for growth and poverty reduction.

The UK Government have raised this issue at official level on a number of occasions, and will continue to do so. We also hope to be able to discuss it with Kazakh representatives at the forthcoming EITI conference on 17 March, and the issue is part of the broader UK-Kazakhstan Energy Dialogue.

 The anti-corruption ticket, which swept the Kenyan Government into power in 2002, has been almost totally discredited. Though Transparency International records a slight reduction in the perception of petty corruption and bribery, grand corruption seems to have returned to pre-2002 levels and possibly higher. The resignation on 7 February of the Permanent Secretary in the Office of Governance and Ethics, John Githongo, was a particularly severe blow to the Government&#039;s anti-corruption credentials.

 Progress on governance by the Kenyan Government has generally been disappointing. However, there have been a few exceptions. The Government established a governance, justice, law and order reform programme with support from 16 donors, including support for anti-corruption institutions, police training, and judicial reform. In addition, the investigations into the Goldenberg scandal have continued credibly; all public servants (including the president) have declared their assets; land policy has been formulated and land laws are being reviewed; and there have been wider governance achievements around improved national budgetary processes and primary school management. Progress is being made in the implementation of the national integrated Monitoring and Evaluation system at both central and devolved level, and this will be fully rolled out during 2005.

<p>
<a name="50221101.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_847">However, progress on dealing with corruption, especially on prosecutions, remains too slow.

The Public Procurement Bill has still not been passed.

DFID knows of no evidence to suggest that there are alternative crops that are high value and low volume and therefore appropriate for export from a landlocked country and whose production could be scaled up rapidly under present circumstances in Malawi to replace tobacco in the short to medium term.

However, the WHO envisages that reducing tobacco consumption will take several decades. In the more immediate term, it is likely that national and regional policy factors such as domestic trade reform in China; energy, transport and land tenure crises in Zimbabwe; and the prospects of losing market share to expanding producers like Brazil are more pressing constraints for poor tobacco-dependent economies.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures taken from a 5 per cent. sample at 31 May 2004<br>

2. Figures are in thousands and rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>

3. From November 2002, the methodology for producing these figures was changed to allow statistics to be published much sooner. This has resulted in a small increase in the reported caseload. This is because some cases which have actually terminated but have not yet been updated on the computer system are now included.<br>

This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_339">I wrote to you in March 2004 regarding our plans for this site. Since then, the future of our Beeches Road site has been still under review as part of a DWP wide exercise to review Estate holdings throughout Essex. I am aware that a somewhat misleading article was recently featured in the press relating to the closure of our site in Beeches Road.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_340">It may be helpful if I briefly describe the changes we are currently planning.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_341">With the Executive Board of Jobcentre Plus I have carefully considered how we can make benefit processing more efficient in the interests of all our customers. We have now concluded that we should consolidate this important area of our business into a smaller number of locations. Currently we carry out this work in several hundred sites and reducing this to around 77 Benefit Processing Centres by 2008 will enable us to deliver a faster, more efficient service using the improved information technology systems which are now starting to become available to us.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_342">As you are already aware, the benefit processing work we currently carry out at Beeches Road, Chelmsford will be moving to one of our new processing centres. The announcement of our planned changes was obviously a sensitive issue for the staff who currently undertake this work in Chelmsford and a number of similar sites nationally. We considered it vitally important that our people should hear about the plans as soon as possible and that they should hear the news from Jobcentre Plus Managers.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_343">We therefore planned and undertook an extensive programme of communications throughout our organisation, to MPs and to other people and organisations we work closely with. Even at this early stage, an essential part of our communications strategy was to set out the arrangements we are making to re-deploy employees who will be affected by the changes, including our commitment to avoid redundancies as far as possible. The timescale for the transfer of benefit processing work from sites such as Beeches Road has still to be determined, although our intention is that this will take place by 2008.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_344">Jobcentre Plus provides a telephone contact centre network where our customers are able to make enquiries without having to come into one of our offices. Our Beeches Road site currently houses a small part of this network. Our current plans involve this work being undertaken from another part of the network by our staff based in Derby, from 2 September 2005.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_345">Other face-to-face services will continue to be provided by staff at Beeches Road.</p>

<p><a name="st_945"><a name="50221109.html_spnew0"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 The majority of tenders received are in response to low value, low risk procurements let locally under devolved budget arrangements. The Department does not collect information centrally about these tenders and to provide a complete answer to the question would incur disproportionate cost. However, information is collected centrally on high value, high risk procurements conducted by specialist procurement teams. In 2003&#150;04 the Department let 440 contracts and framework agreements with values over the EU threshold level (about &#163;100,000). The total value of these over their full durations, which range between two and 18 years, is expected to be about &#163;2,012 million. The actual value will depend upon the volume of business we place and the quality of services delivered over the period.

 We monitor processing times for new claims and change of circumstance across all local authorities, but we have not specifically assessed the impact of the Verification Framework (VF) since 2002.

Local authority performance is affected by a multitude of factors, but using the most recent data, the average processing times for new claims for VF and non-VF local authorities are currently 45 days and 52 days respectively.

This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_377">Legislation was changed in 2002 to allow crisis loan applications to be taken by telephone. Since then, a varying level of service has been offered in different parts of the country, due to factors such as the telephony equipment available in different areas. While the telephone service has generally proved popular and efficient, in the few areas where there have been problems dealing with the high volume of calls, urgent local management action has been taken to improve the service for customers. Irrespective of the level or adequacy of the telephone service, customers retain a right to apply for a loan in person at a Jobcentre Plus office.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_378">For the future, we plan to reduce the number of offices processing Social Fund applications from 142 to around 20, and to implement a standard operating model for the Fund. We are piloting the new model in two Welsh district offices and aim to roll it out nationally from April 2005 onwards. The model includes a standard telephone service for crisis loans, supported by the 



<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>21 Feb 2005 : Column 433W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>appropriate telephone technology. The increased size of the processing units will give much greater staffing flexibility and allow us to assign staff as necessary to meet fluctuating customer demand. Although the telephone will become the normal and preferred method of taking crisis loan applications, we will retain the option of face to face interviews for people who require them.</p>

 &#039;Controlling our borders: Making migration work for Britain&#039; is the product of a review of the whole immigration and asylum system, including appeal rights and the appeals system. The strategy sets out proposals to remove appeal rights for student and employment routes into the United Kingdom, but states that we will retain the right of appeal for family visitors because we recognise the importance of family life. We are, however, confronted with rising numbers of family visit applications and appeals. We recognise that family visit appeals need to be considered quickly, if they are to be of value to appellants. We also have a duty to ensure that the asylum and immigration appeals system as a whole is able to function effectively. We have decided, in order to make the best use of available resources, and to provide a fair and efficient appeals process for appellants, that family visit appeals should be dealt with on the papers only and to limit the right of appeal to close family members.

 The Government believe that prison should be reserved for serious, violent and seriously persistent offenders. For all other offenders, alternatives to prison can often be more effective in addressing offender behaviour than short custodial sentences. The new generic community sentence, provided by the Criminal Justice Act 2003, will be commenced on 4 April 2005. This will give the courts a flexible range of tough community punishments suitable for dealing with a wide range of offenders whose offence is too serious for them to be fined but who do not fall into the serious, violent or seriously persistent category.

<a name="stpa_991">That is why the National Offender Management Service has launched a major communications campaign which aims to demonstrate that community sentences are both tough and demanding whilst providing the opportunity for offenders to give something back directly to the community.

 The date of 1 July 1997 recognises when the Brigade of Gurkhas moved their headquarters from Hong Kong to the UK. Settlement is normally granted on the basis of residence in the UK and so it was considered appropriate to enable all those discharged after this date, and who would have developed close physical ties with the UK through being based here, to be able to apply for settlement. However, applications from Gurkhas discharged before 1 July 1997 will be considered on their individual merits, and discretion will be exercised in appropriate cases. Factors such as time spent in the UK, the presence of close family members here, or a chronic medical condition will be taken into account in reaching a decision on applications that are outside the rules.

 Neighbourhood policing, of which high visibility is an important element, is a key priority for Government for the next five years. We see effective and responsive policing at the neighbourhood level as essential to sustaining the trust and confidence of the public. However, unlike previous community policing initiatives, neighbourhood policing is about more than just public reassurance and high visibility&#151;it does not stand in isolation from other levels of policing, but is essential in tackling the 21st century challenges of crime and antisocial behaviour.

I have regular bilaterals with the president of ACPO to discuss policing priorities, and I met with Chief Constables from all 43 forces in England and Wales on 12 January to discuss progress on a range of police reform issues, including the approach to neighbourhood policing set out in the Police Reform White Paper, Building Communities, Beating Crime.

 Performance testing is used by the Prison Service as a means of improving the performance of underperforming public sector prisons. Market testing is a delegated responsibility of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) and can be applied to all prisons, whether publicly or privately managed. Under market testing the bids made in each competition are assessed by an evaluation panel which includes independent members. Performance testing and market testing processes are liable to be the subject of regular scrutiny by Parliament, the National Audit Office, and other independent bodies and there are no plans to establish any additional independent monitoring of these processes.

 Prison governors keep staffing levels under regular review. During the last two years, the public sector Prison Service has been successful in attracting new prison officer recruits. 2,420 new officers were recruited in 2003 (an increase of 50.5 per cent. on 2002), and 1,983 officers were recruited in 2004. Leaving rates are currently less than four per cent per year across the service. There are a range of reasons why vacancies may occur in individual prisons, including retirements, exits, promotions and transfers, and the time taken for the recruitment and training processes.

<p>
<a name="50221119.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_1013">It is not realistic to expect staffing levels to exactly match the operational staffing requirement at any particular time. However, at 31 January 2005, the difference between the total operational staffing availability in the public sector Prison Service (including officers working contract supplementary hours) and the operational staffing requirement for prison officers, senior officers, principal officers and operational managers was just one per cent (269 full-time equivalent officers against an operational staffing requirement of 25,704). The Director General considers this to be an acceptable operating margin.
