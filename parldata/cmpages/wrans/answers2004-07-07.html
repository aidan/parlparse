 Neither I nor the Secretary of State have had discussions with Kerrier district council regarding radon levels in the council&#039;s area. However, Department officials met with council representatives on 4 July 2003 to discuss the development of a local action plan to roll out Defra&#039;s radon programme in its district. Representatives from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) and the Building Research Establishment (BRE) attended that meeting as the organisations engaged by the Department to support the council on implementing the action plan. I wrote to my hon. Friend on 12 September 2003 about the commencement of the plan, and members of the Department, NRPB and BRE have been working closely with Kerrier district council to help to deliver the action plan since then.

<p>
<a name="40707w01.html_para1">
Kerrier district council&#039;s main actions, supported by the Defra programme, are designed to raise awareness about radon and, in particular, to encourage remedial 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Jul 2004 : Column 687W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
action in the community. These have included the offer of free radon tests and retests sent to over 31,000 householders living in homes with a greater than 5 per cent. probability of radon levels being at or above the &#039;Action Level&#039; of 200 becquerels per cubic metre of air (Bq m <sup>-</sup>  <sup>3</sup> ). The council is using a mobile exhibition to visit communities in the district in order to raise awareness and offer advice about radon&#151;its health effects and remedial measures. Familiarisation seminars have also been held specifically for council staff, professionals in the housing sector, and local builders and builders merchants. In addition, a series of advice workshops have been run for householders needing to take action to reduce radon levels, to provide advice and guidance on the type of radon remediation that might be most appropriate for their homes. Both NRPB and BRE have been closely involved in helping the council to carry out these actions.
</p>

I am aware of the dwellings in Kerrier recently discovered, through Defra&#039;s programme, to have very high radon levels. The Department, Kerrier district council, NRPB and BRE have been liaising to ensure that the owners of these properties have full access to the support available under Defra&#039;s programme, enabling prompt action to be taken to remedy the problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40707w01.html_para3">
Once all the results from the radon tests are available, officials will consider the need for another meeting with Kerrier district council, NRPB and BRE to review the work that has been undertaken so far and discuss what further action might reasonably be taken in the light of the results that have been obtained.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the implications for her Department of the Sustainable Development Commission&#039;s report on the Air Transport White Paper.  [181945]</p>








<p><a name="40707w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Sustainable Development Commission acts as a critical friend to Government in appraising their performance in delivering sustainable development. Its report on the Government&#039;s Air Transport White Paper is a useful contribution to the debate about aviation&#039;s role in a sustainable society, and we will consider it carefully with the Department for Transport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40707w01.html_para4">
Both the Energy and Air Transport White Papers recognise that the aviation industry must take action to take account of, and where appropriate reduce, its

 Data on the area of commercial orchards grown are collected in the annual June Census of Agricultural and Horticulture, which is available in the House of Commons Library.

<p><a name="40707w02.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Environment Agency does not anticipate that there will be many chicken farms that will be required to go beyond the Assured Chicken Production scheme (ACP) and Best Available Techniques (BAT). Many of the BAT for the sector has been adopted by the ACP, but the latter does not embrace all of the former. Only where a significantly higher level of environmental protection is required would techniques which go beyond BAT be necessary. Furthermore, it would first have to be demonstrated that those techniques could achieve the required level of protection. Greater environmental protection might be necessary in the case of a farm which is located close to a Special Protected Area of a Special Area of Conservation.

Overall, the Conference successfully built on the commitments made at the World Summit on Sustainable Development at Johannesburg and heightened international attention on the crucial role of renewable energy in addressing climate change and providing access to energy in the developing world.

The International Action Programme is a collection of, to date, over 160 voluntary commitments on the part of governments, business, NGOs and other stakeholders to concrete action to deliver increased use of renewable energy. The UK submitted a series of actions to the programme, including the extension of the renewables obligation to 2015, renewable obligation certificates, the European Marine Energy Test Centre, round two of the off-shore wind farm development and the Energy Efficiency Action Plan. As one of the founders of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP), we also submitted the REEEP Future Work Programme as an important contribution to the Action Programme.

The adoption of an effective framework to follow up these outcomes and ensure that the commitments made in the International Action Programme are delivered will be crucial. The Political Declaration envisages &quot;an appropriate arrangement&quot; for measuring progress and the establishment of a multi-stakeholder &quot;global policy network&quot;, taking into account the work already being undertaken by existing partnerships in order to promote a sharing of experience in the development and application of renewable energy.

The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership launched last year by the Secretaries of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Trade and Industry will have a key role to play in this Policy Network. The Partnership, with partners from governments, business, finance and civil society across the globe, aims to share knowledge and experience in order to spread best practice and overcome barriers to the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency. The Partnership has grown considerably over the last year and generated a considerable amount of interest at Bonn, with the Governments of Senegal, Yemen and Australia all signing up as Partners at, or shortly after, the Conference.

The Employment Relations Bill also contains provisions extending the coverage of trade union rights to all workers.

<p><a name="40707w06.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The great majority (around 95 per cent.) of minimum wage cases are solved at present without the need for any formal enforcement action. In tackling the minority (5 per cent.) of more difficult cases, compliance officers may first serve an enforcement notice which requires the employer to start paying the minimum wage and make good any arrears of pay. In most of these cases, the employer then pays the arrears due. But in the small number of cases where an employer ignores the enforcement notice, the officer may then serve a penalty notice. The penalty notice imposes a financial penalty on the employer of twice the adult rate of the minimum wage (currently &#163;9 per hour) for each worker named in the enforcement notice from when it was issued.

 In March 2004 the Government introduced the National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 (Amendment) Regulations 2004. These Regulations come into effect in October 2004 and require employers to pay all output workers, including home workers, the minimum wage for every hour they work, or pay a fair piece rate that allows an average worker to earn the minimum wage. From April 2005 employers will have to increase the fair piece rate by a factor of 1.2, so at that point an average output worker will be able to earn 120 per cent. of the minimum wage.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the future of the State Aid Programme.  [179941]</p>








<p><a name="40707w06.html_spnew4"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The EU state aid rules are intended to prevent payments that unduly distort competition in the Single Market. The Government support an effective state aid regime and are committed to the conclusions agreed at the Lisbon and Barcelona European Councils for less and better-targeted state aid. An effective state aid regime helps create a level playing field for business across the EU. And greater competition between businesses leads to lower prices for consumers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40707w06.html_para2">
At the same time it is important that the Government can pursue their objectives of creating a business-friendly environment, raising skills levels and enhancing our science and technology base, so that we improve prosperity in all regions of the UK. While many business support measures do not constitute state aid at all, it is important that the state aid regime is sufficiently flexible to enable us to support economic development by tackling the causes of economic under-performance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40707w06.html_para3">
The Government are therefore pursuing a broad state aid reform agenda. This includes, for example, encouraging the Commission to reform their procedures so that less distorting aids, intended to correct market failures and economic underperformance, can be granted more simply. The Commission&#039;s new proposals for a &quot;fast track&quot; approval route for aid which has a limited effect on the market derives directly from pressure applied by the UK for a more modernised and flexible state aid system. Many of the instruments under which State aid may be approved are due to be reassessed and, if necessary, revised by the European Commission over the next three years (e.g. the &quot;horizontal&quot; rules on aid for SMEs, Research and Development, risk and venture capital, environmental protection, training and employment creation) and the Government will be ensuring that the UK&#039;s views are taken into account by the Commission.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40707w06.html_para4">
In particular, the European Commission has recently issued proposals to amend the guidelines governing regional aid (which define assisted areas and aid intensities allowed within them) after 2006. I made a statement to the House on the Commission&#039;s proposals for regional aid reform on 14 June 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 19&#150;20WS. As I noted in that statement, investment aid is only one way in which the Government work with business in the regions; most business support schemes do not depend on the Regional Aid Guidelines. In addition, the &quot;horizontal&quot; guidelines will continue to allow aid to be granted anywhere post-2006. Regional 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Jul 2004 : Column 704W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
aid nevertheless remains an important tool and the Government therefore want to ensure that under the new Regional Aid Guidelines, regional aid can still be granted in the areas where it is most needed to help address regional disparities and local deprivation. The present proposals from the Commission do not deliver this effectively as they do not adequately allow for disparities within regions, given that poor areas exist side by side with rich areas. I announced that the Government were issuing a consultation document seeking the views of all interested parties on the Commission&#039;s proposals. The consultation document is available on the DTI&#039;s website at www.dti.gov.uk/ewt/stateaid.pdf or www.dti.gov.uk/consultations/stateaid.pdf.

 During the past year my Department has looked at a number of other jurisdictions&#039; models for resolving conflict in cases of disputed contact between separated or divorced parents and their children. These included the &quot;Florida&quot; or &quot;Early Interventions&quot; approach from the United States. This model provides both parents with a court-approved regulated pattern of contact with their children, following divorce or separation.

The Government are aware there are concerns about effective support for court ordered contact arrangements. We announced the &quot;Family Resolutions Pilot Project&quot; in March this year as one of the steps we are taking to tackle this. The pilot is designed to test a range of measures&#151;parents in group discussion, raising parents&#039; awareness of their own parenting skills and co-operative discussions between ex-partners&#151;in helping parents reach agreement about contact with their children, after divorce or separation. It will run over one year from September in three areas&#151;Brighton, Sunderland and Inner London.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40707w06.html_para7">
This is a genuine pilot with no in-built assumption about what works. However it will be implemented in the context of the law in England and Wales (Children Act 1989) which has the interests of the child, rather than the rights of parents, as the paramount consideration. Therefore, we could not have adopted the &quot;Florida&quot; or &quot;Early Interventions&quot; model. The project will emphasise the key principle of parents continuing to work together in the best interest of their children, even if the adult relationship has broken down.

We are also providing an additional &#163;3.5 million for child contact centres from 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06, including 14 new supervised contact centres.

<p><a name="40707w08.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 When a train is late, the rail industry record the number of minutes it is late at various monitoring points along its journey and at the final destination. These delay minutes do not equate to the minutes of delay from a passengers point of view, as delay minutes can be accumulated along the journey but the train may make up time and still arrive at its final destination on time. For this reason performance is measured and published using the Public Performance Measure (PPM). PPM records whether a train arrives at its final destination within 5 minutes of its timetabled arrival time (10 minutes for long distance operators), cancellations are also counted as late and recorded. There are no plans to change this method of recording and reporting performance.

 Part 12 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, which came into force on 14 February 2002, did not introduce any new offences, but made two main changes to the law of corruption:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Section 108 put beyond doubt that the existing offences of corruption apply to the bribery of foreign public office holders. This change mainly clarified existing law.</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Section 109 was the significant change: it gave our courts jurisdiction over certain offences of corruption when they are committed overseas by UK nationals or by bodies incorporated under UK law. The relevant offences are <i>(a)</i> common law offence of bribery, <i>(b)</i> the offences under section 2 of the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889; and <i>(c)</i> the first two offences under section 1 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906.</p>

<a name="40707w16.html_para1">
The Home Office Court Proceedings database does not contain details of the circumstances of offences for which prosecutions are brought, so the figures collected on these offences, cannot identify the status of the persons involved.

 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40707w18.html_para6">
In December 2001, the National Treatment Agency (NTA) set waiting time targets, against which drug action teams are held to account. Since then, average waiting times have fallen substantially in all treatment categories, from between five to 11 weeks in December 2001, to two to four weeks in May 2004.

The NTA and the National Institute for Mental Health in England have developed a national programme to improve access to treatment for drug misusers.

<p><a name="40707w18.html_spnew8"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The legislation on driving and other aspects of motoring applies to persons from the new EU member states as it does to other drivers. Enforcement of the law is a matter for the police, who will decide what approach is most effective in different circumstances. It is then for the Crown Prosecution Service to reach a decision as to prosecution. We recognise there are practical difficulties if someone from another country returns home before a trial and are currently examining possible ways of meeting this problem.

 The European Court of Human Rights delivered its final judgment in the case of Ezeh and Connors on 9 October 2003 when it confirmed the decision not to award them compensation for the additional days that they served in prison as a result of the disciplinary punishments. Accordingly, the Prison Service does not propose to compensate those finding themselves in a similar position.

 The Home Office has not commissioned any research on the use of the LD50 procedure in animal testing.

Indeed, following the adoption of OECD Guidelines 420, 423 and 424, and the deletion of the less refined OECD Guideline 401, no project licence authorities for lethal testing using the OECD 401 Guideline have been granted under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

Notes:<br>

1. Projections with this breakdown are only available for private households. In addition to pensioners in private households, there are approximately 200,000 pensioners in care homes eligible for pension credit. The figures in Tables 1 and 2 above do not include pensioners in care homes.<br>

2. Estimates for private households and individuals in 2004&#150;05 are based on the Family Resources Survey data for 2002&#150;03 projected forward to 2004&#150;05 to reflect changes in taxes, benefit rates and pensioners&#039; incomes.<br>

3. For projections beyond 2004&#150;05 it has been assumed that pensioners&#039; incomes will rise in line with average earnings; the guarantee credit will be uprated in line with average earnings; and the savings credit threshold will be uprated in line with prices.<br>

4. It has also been assumed that the eligible population will tend to rise in line with the general projected growth of the pensioner population.<br>

5. Projections have been rounded to the nearest 50,000 cases, are subject to a wide margin of error and should be used as broad indications of the likely eligible population only.<br>

6. A pensioner household is defined as single persons aged 60 or over and couples where at least one partner is aged 60 or over. Individuals are single pensioners with eligibility and both partners in a couple with eligibility.<br>

<p><a name="40707w22.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 Under the private finance initiative, the estate of the former DSS was transferred to the private sector in April 1998 for the provision of fully serviced accommodation. Following the formation of the Department for Work and Pensions, the estate of the former Employment Service became subject to the same partnership contract in December 2003. Within the contract, there are specific clauses that cover environmental impacts and encourage the private sector partner to develop environmental improvements. The Department&#039;s Estates partner, Land Securities Trillium, whose Environmental Management System is accredited to International Standard ISO 14001, works closely with the DWP corporate Sustainable Development Team to identify opportunities for environmental improvements. The Sustainable Development Team contract manages this element of the partnership and continually assesses performance. Regular partnership meetings are held between the Department and Land Securities Trillium to monitor progress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40707w22.html_para0">
The partnership approach has enabled innovative measures to be developed&#151;such as the use of spend to save projects designed to improve energy and water efficiency across the estate, and a programme to maximise the recycling of paper waste. Full details of all measures can be found within the annual DWP Sustainable Development Report, to which Land Securities Trillium make a full contribution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40707w22.html_para1">
The current Departmental Approvals process includes sustainable development as an overarching commitment that all change programmes need to incorporate into their plans. This will ensure that any future private finance initiatives include sustainable development issues, as PRIME did successfully from the outset.

 The Department for Work and Pensions does not specifically provide information to older workers on contracting back into the State Second Pension. It does however publish information leaflets that contain guidance on both State and private pension provision. This guidance stresses how important it is that people regularly review their pension arrangements including decisions about whether to contract in or out, to make sure that they have the income that they need when they retire; and that they should consider taking independent advice if they feel it necessary to do so. Estimates on the number of employees contracted out of and contracted into the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) in 2000&#150;01 (the latest year for which the information is available) broken down by age and gender, are in the following table.

In Colombia, the area under cultivation is shown to have fallen by 16 per cent. However, it is difficult to judge what impact these falls in the area cultivated may have had on the overall production of cocaine because, as the surveys point out, it is unclear whether crop yields per hectare are rising or falling.

Many do not of course fit neatly into just one of these categories. In some areas, we would have liked the amendments to have gone further than those we eventually secured (e.g. team Presidencies or the European Foreign Minister).

Following this sustained international pressure, including from the United Kingdom, there are small indications that the Turkmen Government are willing to engage in dialogue on human rights issues.

Turkmenistan sent a high level delegation, headed by the Foreign Minister, to Brussels for the EC/Turkmenistan Joint Committee meeting in January 2004.
