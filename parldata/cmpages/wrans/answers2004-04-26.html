<p><a name="40426w01.html_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) review of the Over Thirty Month rule was completed in July 2003 and recommended that it would be acceptable on public health grounds to replace the Over Thirty Month rule with BSE testing of cattle in two stages. Cattle born after August 1996 could be allowed into the food chain, after being tested for BSE, with the possibility of complete replacement of the rule from July 2005. Health Ministers are still considering the FSA advice, but it has already been decided that, for practical reasons, cattle born before August 1996 will be permanently excluded from the food chain. We are now unlikely to see any changes to the OTMS before January 2005, due to the legislative process that must take place once a decision has been reached by Ministers.

 Fruit growers were generally not eligible for the subsidies which are to be replaced by the single payment.

Single payments cannot be made anywhere in the European Union in respect of land under permanent crops, which includes orchards.

<p><a name="40426w02.html_spnew0"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Government regularly reviews progress with the Voluntary Initiative on pesticides and reports its broad conclusions in the Budget and Pre-Budget Report. In Budget 2004 the Government confirmed its view that, provided the Initiative is fully implemented, it should be the most effective way of reducing the environmental impacts of pesticide use. However, to cover the potential case that the Initiative might fail to deliver the required environmental benefits within a reasonable timescale, the Government continues to keep the options for a tax or economic instrument under review.

<p><a name="40426w02.html_spnew5"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no plans to introduce legislation to amend the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 in this respect. After Turner&#039;s death in 1851, the dispute over the terms of his will went to Court. In 1856, the Court decreed that 100 finished pictures, 182 unfinished pictures and 19,049 drawings and sketches were to be held in trust by the National Gallery, a decision which took precedence over the provisions in Turner&#039;s wills and codicils. The National Gallery and Tate Gallery Act 1954 effected the legal separation of the Tate Gallery from the National Gallery and the trusteeship of the Turner Bequest was transferred to the Trustees of the Tate Gallery. The Museums and Galleries Act 1992 established the Tate Gallery as a corporate body and it became Trustee of the Turner Bequest, subject to the conditions of that trust and subject to the powers, duties and responsibilities of the Trustees as established by the 1992 Act.

<p><a name="40426w03.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the reasons are for the abatement of pensions under Armed Forces Pension Scheme rules; on what grounds those rules are applied for those in full-time reserve when contributions have been paid; and if he will make a statement.  [168060]</p>








<p><a name="40426w03.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Caplin </b> 
<i>[holding answer 23&nbsp;April 2004]:</i> Successive Governments have maintained the policy that the pensions of public servants who are re-employed in public service should be abated in certain circumstances: these include where an individual is re-employed by the same employer and where an appointment is made 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 Apr 2004 : Column 724W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
under closed competition. The broad terms of this policy apply to all public service pension schemes, including the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS). Abatement avoids the position where a re-employed member could receive a higher income from public funds, taking account of pay and pension, than a colleague of the same rank, seniority and trade with whom he or she might work. It also provides a safeguard against the potential abuse of re-employment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w03.html_para0">
Members of the AFPS make no direct contribution towards the cost of their standard pension benefits. However, as part of its overall review of remuneration, the independent Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) compares the value of benefits provided under the AFPS with those provided by comparator pension schemes in the civilian sector and makes an adjustment to pay to reflect any difference. At present the AFPRB makes a 7&nbsp;per cent. abatement of comparator pay, and in particular take account of the fact that AFPS benefits accrue faster and are paid earlier than those of civilian comparators. This adjustment takes account of the overall terms of the AFPS which include arrangements for the abatement of pension on re-employment in public service.

<p><a name="40426w03.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 The work of Dr. Nicholson has been monitored as part of the Ministry of Defence&#039;s consideration of research into Gulf veterans&#039; illnesses. In line with its normal approach to issues relating to the health of Gulf veterans, the MOD takes medical and scientific advice from a range of internal and external sources. In this instance, there was no requirement to consult formally with the Defence Medical Services although they are aware of the matter. In the light of trials funded by the US Government based on Dr. Nicolson&#039;s work, we have concluded that there is no evidence to support a connection between illness among veterans and mycoplasma infections or that aggressive antibiotic treatment would benefit veterans. Assessments undertaken by the US Armed Forces Epidemiological Board similarly support the view that there is no evidence that ill health is linked to the presence of squalene anti-bodies. It would be inappropriate to subject veterans to tests for which there is no clinical indication.

<p><a name="40426w05.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 For state aid purposes a block exemption is a Commission Regulation which allows member states to implement state aid schemes complying with stipulated conditions without obtaining advance approval from the Commission. However, member states are obliged to inform the Commission of such schemes within 20 working days of their coming into force. Block Exemption Regulations exist covering aid to SMEs (recently extended to include research and development), aid for training and aid for employment.

<p>
<a name="40426w05.html_para0">
DTI&#039;s role is to advise those contemplating introducing state aid schemes and to help them with the notification process. It forwards all notifications to the European Commission via the United Kingdom Permanent Representation to the European Communities, sometimes after amendment in consultation with the aid scheme administrators. The Department does not turn down notifications, although on some occasions an aid scheme administrator may withdraw a notification on advice from DTI that the proposed aid scheme would not comply with the terms of the relevant state aid rules and would not therefore be approved by the Commission.

<a name="40426w07.html_para5">
The study will draw on international experience, for instance in Denmark, and we will learn as much as possible from our own installations.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what consultations she has <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;undertaken and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;planned with maritime groups concerned about the impact of offshore wind farms on maritime navigation.  [168359]</p>








<p><a name="40426w07.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 I had a useful and productive meeting with representatives of the shipping, port and marine aggregates industries on 16&nbsp;March this year about the second round of offshore wind farms planned for the Greater Wash, Thames Estuary and North West.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w07.html_para6">
These industries have had an opportunity to make their views known on the Department&#039;s plans for offshore wind farming. In November 2002, the Department issued a consultation paper, Future Offshore: A Strategic framework for the offshore wind industry. As a result, the Department decided that the future allocation of leases for sites for offshore wind farms would take place in a structured series of bidding rounds, following a strategic environmental assessment of the defined areas of the sea selected for potential development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w07.html_para7">
In May 2003 the Department consulted on an environmental report which assessed the impact of wind farm development in three strategic areas&#151;the Greater Wash, outer Thames Estuary and the North West (from North Wales to the Solway Firth)&#151;on a range of matters including maritime navigation. Following this consultation the Department asked The Crown Estate to arrange a bidding round for site leases in these three strategic areas, with the exception of a coastal strip of 8&nbsp;to 13 kms wide, which was excluded because of the particular sensitivity to development of shallow coastal waters. The Crown Estate announced before Christmas last year that it had offered site leases for 15 wind farms.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w07.html_para8">
The developers of these proposed wind farms must obtain statutory planning consents from Government before they can be built. The Department has already organised one workshop and is planning a series of further meetings to bring together the developers with the main stakeholders, including representatives of the maritime community, who should be consulted in preparing an environmental impact assessment of the project. When a formal planning application for the project is received the Department will consult a range of organisations including those representing shipping and port interests.

<p class "tabletext">Based on information provided by respondents to the survey the number of households in Great Britain paying more in net council tax than in income tax was approximately 4.8&nbsp;million in 1997/98 and 5.5&nbsp;million in 2001/02. More recent information is not yet available. Net council tax is defined as gross council tax less reported council tax benefits and discounts.

 There is no reliable overall estimate of the revenue lost as a result of the shadow economy.

The Revenue continues to monitor new developments in this area.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the Adventure Capital Fund.  [165884]</p>








<p><a name="40426w12.html_spnew1"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 The Adventure Capital Fund was launched in December 2002 to pioneer a new form of long-term investment in community enterprises. The Fund represents a unique partnership between the Government Departments (the Home Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department of Trade and Industry), and several Regional Development Agencies, as funders, and four leading voluntary organisations in the field of social and economic regeneration, as delivery partners. The delivery partners are the Development Trusts Association, the Scarman Trust, the New Economics Foundation and the Local Investment Fund which is the accountable body for the fund.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w12.html_para0">
The aim of the fund is to demonstrate an effective way of providing &#039;patient capital&#039; to fill the investment gap faced by community organisations wishing to move 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 Apr 2004 : Column 758W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
from grant dependency to sustainability through developing enterprise. This gap was clearly identified in the Social Investment Task Force report (October 2001) and the more recent Bank of England Report on Finance for Social Enterprise (May 2003).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w12.html_para1">
In 2003, Home Office Funding totalling &#163;2&nbsp;million was invested in 10 community enterprises, with a further &#163;375,000 being awarded to 25 organisations in pre-investment business development grants with funding from four Regional Development Agencies (Yorkshire and Humber), East Midlands, East of England and London). In 2004, a total of &#163;4.5&nbsp;million is available from Home Office assets recovery and the DTI Phoenix Fund, plus some further allocations from RDAs for business development grants. All grant and investment recipients receive one-to-one organisational development support. The cost of this support, of management of the Fund and evaluation of the programme has been met by ODPM&#039;s Neighbourhood Renewal Unit.

<p><a name="40426w12.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Timeous receipt of the decision letter by the applicant is of no relevance to whether a delay to the date for an appeal hearing may be granted. No appeal hearing can be fixed until an appeal has been lodged. Receipt of a decision determines the start of the time limits that apply to lodging an appeal as set out in my answer to the hon. Member on 13&nbsp;April 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, 420 column 86W.

The date of appeal hearings are not the responsibility of the Immigration Service or any other part of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. They are the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsibility of the independent Immigration Appellate Authority. The appeal would not be listed for hearing until it has been received by the Immigration Appellate Authority. A party to the appeal can request an adjournment of the hearing to a later date, but only if they can show good reason why an adjournment is necessary, and have satisfied the adjudicator or Tribunal that the appeal cannot otherwise be justly determined.

 When dealing with the Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS), Capacity Building is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about ensuring that Voluntary and Community Organisations (VCOs) have the skills, knowledge, structures and resources to realise their full potential. Capacity building supports and develops VCS infrastructure through the provision of developmental assistance and advice, enabling VCOs to achieve their objectives. It is as much about releasing existing capacity as about developing new capacity.

The Government&#039;s recent review of community capacity building examined the support needed, particularly at neighbourhood or community level, to increase active citizenship and build strong communities, as key contributors to our broader goal of civil renewal. The resulting consultation paper defined community capacity building as &quot;the activities, resources and support that strengthen the skills and abilities of people and community groups to take effective action and leading roles in the development of their communities&quot;. The review findings also recognised the importance of organisational development and culture change within public bodies, to ensure public servants are equipped to engage effectively with communities and the voluntary and community sector.

<i>[holding answer 26&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The protection of the public from the risks posed by sexual offenders has been strengthened by a number of legislative measures and funding decisions the government has taken.&nbsp;The monitoring and treatment of sexual offenders comprise a range of activities, which the police and probation services co-ordinate through the multi-agency public protection arrangements (the MAPPA). It is not possible to breakdown the costs of each MAPPA activity because they will vary according to the level of risk posed by each offender and their circumstances.

The UK has been in discussions with the Netherlands about how to maintain the momentum around this subject during the UK&#039;s Presidency of the EU in 2005.

 Recent heavy rains have led to flooding in Western Kenya as in other parts of the country. It is estimated that approximately 14,000 people are affected in western Kenya.

The Government are distributing food to seven districts, and KRCS is distributing non-food items. Neither are currently asking for additional assistance from the international community. The Kenya Meteorological Office is predicting that average to above average rains will continue in parts of western Kenya. The Rapid Onset Disaster Committee is planning for a potential figure of 60,000 affected, should the heavy rains continue into May. If this were to happen, then the Government of Kenya may ask the World Food Programme and others for assistance. DFID Kenya will continue to monitor the situation closely.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what estimate he has made of the number of new jobs that need to be created annually in the developing world if the Millennium Development Goal to eradicate extreme poverty is to be achieved.  [167210]</p>








<p><a name="40426w15.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The MDG for income poverty targets a reduction by 50&nbsp;per cent. of the proportion of the population living in extreme poverty (defined as an income of less than US$1 per capita per day in purchasing power parity terms) between 1990 and 2015. The World Bank&#039;s <sup>1</sup>  latest estimates indicate that about 1.1 billion people worldwide live in extreme poverty. If projected growth remains on track, global poverty rates will fall to 13&nbsp;per cent.&#151;less than half the 1990 level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w15.html_para2">
Reliable estimates of the number of new jobs required to eliminate extreme poverty do not exist. The majority of poor people in developing countries are outside formal employment, and progress towards the MDG can be achieved by improving opportunities in subsistence agriculture and the informal economy as well as by creating more formal sector jobs. Thus 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 Apr 2004 : Column 770W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
poverty can be reduced without necessarily involving the creation of additional formal sector jobs&#151;for example, India has witnessed a sharp fall in poverty with little expansion of the formal sector job market. While a well-paid job can lift an entire household out of poverty, a poorly paid job may not lift anyone out of poverty. The International Labour Organisation (ILO)&#039;s &#039;Decent Work&#039; agenda <sup>2</sup> emphasises that the quality as well as the quantity of jobs is important. The rate of economic growth is the most critical factor in determining the attainment of this MDG.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent assessment he has made of progress towards the Millennium Development Goal of reducing maternal mortality by 75&nbsp;per cent. by 2015.  [167212]</p>








<p><a name="40426w15.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The Millennium Development Goal of improving maternal health has a target to reduce the maternal mortality ratio (the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) by three-quarters between 1990 and 2015. This is equivalent to an annual reduction of 5.4&nbsp;per cent. Approximately 529,000 women die annually from complications of pregnancy and childbirth.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w15.html_para3">
Trends in maternal mortality are difficult to measure, but available data suggest that progress in reducing the maternal mortality ratio has been slow in recent years. With an average annual decline of 3.2&nbsp;per cent. in the 1990s, the developing world as a whole is off target. While some countries have reduced maternal mortality, data suggest that some parts of Africa have seen an increase. A recent World Bank analysis suggests that only 17&nbsp;per cent. of developing countries, containing 32&nbsp;per cent. of the world&#039;s population, are on track to achieve the target.

<p><a name="40426w15.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for child health is to reduce the rate of mortality in children under five by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. The indicator that measures progress against this target directly is the under-five mortality rate. Infant mortality (deaths of children under one year old) and the proportion of one-year old children immunised against measles are used as intermediate indicators of progress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w15.html_para4">
Globally child mortality is declining, and between 1990 and 2000 the under-five mortality rate was reduced from 92 to 82 deaths per 1,000 live births. The infant mortality rate declined from 64 to 57 deaths per 1,000 live births in the same period. There is, however, considerable regional variation in the rates of progress being made. Latin America is expected to meet the MDG target, but there has been much slower progress in South Asia, and slowest progress in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for over half of all under-five

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assistance is being given to help women who were raped during the genocide in Rwanda and who now suffer from HIV/AIDS.  [167826]</p>








<p><a name="40426w15.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 HIV/AIDS is a serious problem in Rwanda. Rwanda does not yet have the health infrastructure required to effectively deliver anti-retroviral therapy (ART) countrywide. But the Government have produced a comprehensive &quot;Strategic Framework for HIV/AIDS Control&quot; and all the major donors, including the Clinton Foundation, the Global Fund and the World Bank, have committed to support it. This framework includes the progressive provision of ART to all who need it, through a network of health centres. Through a partnership between UNAIDS and five of the leading multinational pharmaceutical companies (the Accelerating Access to HIV/AIDS Care, Treatment And Support Initiative), Rwanda is one of the countries that have reached agreement with manufacturers on significantly reduced drug prices in the context of its national HIV care and treatment plans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w15.html_para5">
The UK has committed &#163;25&nbsp;million through the International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa Programme (IPAA) to increase capacity in certain National HIV/AIDS Commissions, including Rwanda. DFID is currently considering whether we can build on this engagement, to ensure that Rwanda has the capacity to manage and direct the various programmes of support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w15.html_para6">
DFIF is also providing direct assistance to the survivors of the genocide through the Government&#039;s Survivors Fund (FARG). This assistance is currently running at some &#163;200,000 per annum, and planned additional support up to &#163;850,000 will enable FARG to broaden the services it provides to include advice and counselling on issues around HIV/AIDS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w15.html_para7">
I have a specific concern over the inequity in access to Anti-Retroviral Treatment between the defendants and the witnesses at the International Criminal Tribunal (ICTR) for Rwanda, which is considering crimes committed during the genocide. While defendants have access to health care including ART, witnesses generally do not. I wrote to the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, asking how the United Nations and the international community could work to resolve this inequity. The UN Secretary General replied, reporting that UNAIDS/WHO were identifying suitable health care providers, but seeking assistance from the UK to fund ART treatment for witnesses. I have responded positively and offered DFID assistance up to &#163;200,000 for ICTR witnesses and others called by the Tribunal to receive healthcare, including ART, from a centre in Kigali.

The UK is committed to introducing biometric passports, but not until end-2005. UK Government officials are also in discussions with the relevant US authorities on this issue. We hope that an extension will be granted to the 26&nbsp;October 2004 deadline, which would minimise disruption to travellers. It is too early to be able to predict the outcome of these discussions. In the interim, some 400,000 UK citizens planning to visit the US would need visas. Those holding passports issued prior to 26&nbsp;October 2004, provided that they were machine readable, would continue to be able to travel to the US under the Visa Waiver Programme.

 Since the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations into force in 1999, hundreds of new trains, which comply with the high standards of access for disabled people required by the regulations, have been introduced. These include 1,400 new carriages which have come into service in the last 2&#189; years. Another 1,000 are due in the next 18 months. In addition, many older trains, while not meeting full RVAR standards already have wheelchair accommodation and other features to assist disabled passengers.

We have recently consulted on a number of proposals to amend the rail provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act. These include setting an &#039;end date&#039; by which time all rail vehicles would have to comply with the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations. We have not yet taken a final decision on the best date to set. We are currently analysing the consultation responses and looking carefully at the costs and benefits of a range of options, including 2020. We will consult on the draft regulations needed to implement our proposals when the required new primary legislation is introduced in the form of the Disability Discrimination Bill.

In addition, we have now adopted a significant new approach to encouraging the integration of early years services. Since this manifesto commitment was made, the Children&#039;s Centres initiative has been launched and is now our key contributor to the growth of integrated early learning and childcare provision. Our intention is that 43,000 new integrated places will be created in Children&#039;s Centres by 2006. By 2008 we are committed to having Children&#039;s Centres in the most disadvantaged areas in England. Our long term aim is to have a Children&#039;s Centre in every community.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what measures are in place in the proposed higher education reforms to ensure that students from <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;less advantaged and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;other family backgrounds can attend the higher education institution of their choice.  [165425]</p>








<p><a name="40426w25.html_spnew3"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 We remain committed to fair access and believe that all those who have the potential to benefit from higher education should have the opportunity to do so. The social class gap among those entering higher education is unacceptably wide, particularly at the extremes. We are putting in place a range of measures, several of them through the HE Bill (so subject to Parliamentary approval), that support students&#039; prospects of attending the higher education institution (HEI) of their choice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w25.html_para0">
<i>(a)</i>&nbsp;For students from less advantaged backgrounds, we will provide help in a number of ways:

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">by introducing a new Higher Education Grant, worth up to &#163;1,000 a year, for new students who start courses from this September. Students with a family income of &#163;15,200 or less will receive the full &#163;1,000 grant, and those from families with income from &#163;15,201 to &#163;21,185 will qualify for a partial grant;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">by proposals to raise the maximum rate of the student maintenance loan to match median student expenditure on basic living items as measured by the latest Student Income and Expenditure Survey. The biggest increase will be for those students living independently in London. The loans will continue to be means tested as now for those from higher family income backgrounds. The higher rate of maintenance loans will be available to both new students and those who entered higher education prior to 2006;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">by proposals to introduce a new maintenance grant, for new students starting courses from 2006/07, of up to &#163;2,700. This will benefit students from low income households thereby helping broaden access to higher education. We are proposing that an element of this new grant will be in substitution for the maintenance loan. In addition, students may choose to reduce the level of maintenance loan they apply for still further in the light of this new grant being made available and, in doing so, reduce their outstanding debt;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">by continuing to provide additional targeted financial support for vulnerable students via higher education institutions through the Access to Learning Fund. This will ensure that more of them are able to access and remain in higher education;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">by requiring any institution that wants to charge higher variable fees to give more help to poorer students, in terms of bursaries and other financial support, to do outreach work to encourage a wide range of students to apply to higher education, and to provide clear information on the financial help available to those from the poorest backgrounds. Details will be set out in an access plan, and agreed with the Director of Fair Access; by the operation, from August 2004, of the new integrated Aimhigher programme. This will help to raise young people&#039;s levels of educational attainment and aspirations. It will include supporting a range of activities that bring young people into

</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w25.html_para1">
<i>(b)</i>&nbsp;For those from all family backgrounds there are a range of other measures that will help prospective students make and pursue their choice of higher education institution:

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">provision of support on tuition fees&#151;from 2006, all full-time undergraduate students will be entitled to defer payment of fees until after they graduate and are earning more than &#163;15,000. Repayments will then be made under a generously subsidised, income-contingent repayments system, with no real rate of interest;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">development with the National Union of Students of a new guide which will help students understand and access the range of information available and so make more effective decisions and choices;</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">the availability, from 2004/05 onwards, of much more information about the quality and standards of academic provision at institutions.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many local education authorities have been taken over by an improvement team in each year since 1997.  [167576]</p>








<p><a name="40426w26.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 Following agreement with the local authority in question, we have used various models of intervention to address poor performance in education services depending on the local circumstances. On the occasions where these models include the outsourcing by authorities of various education functions to another body, statutory directions have been used to enable that outsourcing to take place. Directions have been issued to the following nine local education authorities to contract out differing ranges of functions:

</ul>

<p>
<a name="40426w26.html_para0">
Non-outsourcing solutions have frequently been adopted. They have included (sometimes in combination) the restructuring of internal management; partnerships 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 Apr 2004 : Column 806W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
with other local education authorities; partnership boards involving local stakeholders and members with external and independent expertise in the local education authorities&#039; strategic decision making processes; and the establishment of predominantly private sector brokerage alongside a partnership board.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w26.html_para1">
None of the interventions have resulted in a local&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;education authority being &quot;taken over&quot; by an improvement team or any other body. Whatever the model adopted, the local education authority has retained overall responsibility and accountability for the quality of its education services.

<p><a name="40426w26.html_wqn1"><b> Bob Spink: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) what level of IQ would as a general rule indicate that a pregnant woman, without a partner, is so severely learning disabled her child should be removed at birth for adoption; whether the support and help of the woman&#039;s parents would be a factor in the decision; and if he will make a statement;  [165102]

<p><a name="40426w26.html_spnew1"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 A general duty is placed on local authorities by section 17 of the Children Act 1989 to safeguard and promote the welfare of children under 18 who are in need by providing a range of services appropriate to meeting those needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w26.html_para2">
Assessments undertaken by local authorities of children who may be in need focus on the needs of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child, the capacity of the parents and wider environmental factors, rather than solely on the characteristics of the parents. Whether or not any particular child is considered to be in need will depend upon the individual circumstances, taking all relevant factors into consideration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w26.html_para3">
The White Paper &quot;Valuing People&quot; (2001) recognises that &quot;social services have a duty to safeguard the welfare of children and in some circumstances a parent with learning disabilities will not be able to meet their child&#039;s needs. However, we believe that this should not be the result of agencies not arranging for appropriate and timely support&quot;. This means that the removal of children from parents with learning difficulties should be rare, but may be necessary in particular instances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w26.html_para4">
Learning disability, whether moderate or severe, does not necessarily indicate that a person will be unable to care for their child, with adequate support where necessary. Factors such as communication skills and social functioning are also important.

<p><a name="40426w27.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Cousins: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will set out the sequence of changes in financial allocations to the Newcastle Children&#039;s Fund Partnership for 2004&#150;05; whether the clawback of funds in the 2003&#150;04 year has been reversed; what the outline annual planning figures are for the partnership for <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;2004&#150;05 and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;2005&#150;06; and whether underspending in earlier years can be added to future planning totals.  [161949]</p>








<p><a name="40426w27.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 Newcastle Children&#039;s Fund has an allocation of &#163;1,215,059 for 2004&#150;05. This is a small reduction from the original allocation of &#163;1,250,000. The partnership had &#163;65,135 identified as genuine underspend in the 2003&#150;04 mid-year review and this was reallocated by the Department. I am keen to give partnerships as much flexibility as possible within Government Accounting Rules. This means I have restored flexibility to re-profile from one quarter to the next during the year and I am allowing partnerships to carry forward end year underspend.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w27.html_para0">
We are also giving partnerships more flexibility in delivering their commitment on joint working with local Youth Offending Teams to prevent crime. We have moved away from the rigid menu approach, although we are continuing to emphasise the need to focus on effective projects, such as Youth Inclusion Support Panels and Junior Youth Inclusion Panels. Where partnerships already have a strong focus on tackling antisocial behaviour and youth crime, they will be able to count those activities towards their collaborative working with Yots.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w27.html_para1">
The allocation for 2005&#150;06 will be announced by August 2004. However we recognise that partnerships are keen to get some indication of funding levels for 2005&#150;06, in order to help them plan effectively. The Secretary of State has therefore indicated to partnerships at this stage that the budget for 2005&#150;06 will be no less than &#163;110&nbsp;million. We hope this provides a clear framework for partnerships to plan and maintain Children&#039;s Fund activity right through to the end of 2005&#150;06, the end of the current Spending Review period. Beyond that, the Chancellor, in his Budget statement, has signalled a commitment to the Children&#039;s Fund until 2008.

The level of resources in school budgets after 2005&#150;06 will be announced in due course and will take account of the spending settlement for the Department for 2006&#150;07 to 2007&#150;08.

<p>
<a name="40426w27.html_para2">
However, workforce reform cannot simply be about the use of additional resources. Schools need to consider how they make best use of their existing resources, for example, by extending the role of support staff, maximising the impact of ICT and reducing reliance on expensive short term supply teachers.

<p><a name="40426w33.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton </b> 
<i>[holding answer 22&nbsp;April 2004]:</i> All patients requiring urgent hospital treatment should be transported to hospital without delay. There are no maximum transport times which ambulances should take in transporting pregnant mothers to hospitals in emergencies. There are, however, targets for response times. As with all emergency calls to ambulance services, guidance on response times is based on medical need.

Current ambulance response targets include:

<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Category A calls: Presenting conditions which may be immediately life threatening and which should be responded to within eight minutes irrespective of location in 75&nbsp;per cent. of cases.</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 Apr 2004 : Column 833W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>






<p><a name="40426w33.html_spnew5"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The decision as to whether to request a hospital post-mortem examination is for the treating clinician and the deceased&#039;s family. However, we are aware that in the past the taking and use of organs and tissue without consent at post-mortems has damaged public and professional confidence in the hospital post-mortem examination.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w33.html_para4">
We have issued new guidance to the national health service to help restore that confidence. This takes the form of a code of practice for those involved in communicating with families where a post-mortem may be necessary or desirable. It includes a revision of the consent forms required to be completed by relatives with the aim of helping families understand the procedure and enabling them to grant an informed consent to a post-mortem and the disposal of organs or tissue. This guidance is available on the Department&#039;s website at: www.dh.gov.uk/tissue Later this year we will be making available to NHS trusts a short video/DVD produced with the support of the Royal College of Pathologists that explains the reasons for, and benefits to be obtained from, a post-mortem and encouraging the consent of families to the procedure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40426w33.html_para5">
We are also taking positive action to change the law to secure further changes to re-establish confidence. The Human Tissue Bill, currently before Parliament, ensures that whatever is done with the human body and its parts after death within the NHS will be done only as part of a transparent process and with appropriate consent. It will also introduce penalties for organ retention without consent as additional reassurance for the integrity of the new procedures.

<p><a name="40426w34.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 In our present state of knowledge, chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) remains medically unexplained with various associated risk factors, and with variable symptoms from various systems in the body, including some neurological, immunological, cardiovascular, digestive and psychological symptoms. There are many different views on what causes these symptoms, and some of them are strongly held.

<p>
<a name="40426w34.html_para0">
In its report to the Chief Medical Officer in 2002, the independent working group on CFS/ME noted that there is no cure for CFS/ME but identified three specific strategies as potentially beneficial in modifying the illness: graded exercise, cognitive behavioural therapy, and pacing. Graded exercise focuses on gradual but

progressive increases in aerobic exercise, such as walking or swimming. Cognitive behavioural therapy aims to empower patients to identify, understand, and modify their belief systems and behaviours. Pacing is an energy management strategy in which patients are encouraged to achieve an appropriate balance between rest and activity.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant and within one health care provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1&nbsp;April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2.&nbsp;The main operation is the first recorded operation in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

3.&nbsp;Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

4.&nbsp;Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are un-grossed).<br>

 No. We believe that decisions on local health care provision should be made locally. Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible within the national health service for commissioning and funding services for their resident population, including palliative care. PCTs are at the centre of the local planning process, working with voluntary health care providers such as hospices for adults or children who are viewed as important players and partners in the planning, provision and development of these services. The process of discussion leading to NHS funding agreements applies equally to hospices providing support and services to children as it does for those supporting adults in need of palliative care.

1.&nbsp;Results are based on the 2001&#150;02 DWP Family Resources Survey.

2.&nbsp;Estimates are based on an initial assessment of cases modelled as eligible non-recipients from the underlying microdata. Therefore, they do not take into account the possibility that a significant proportion of those appearing to be eligible non-recipients will not be true eligible non-recipients, and a significant proportion of true eligible non-recipients may not be identified. As a result, along with the effects of other data imperfections, the estimates should be interpreted with caution; and only percentage estimates can be provided.<br>

Friend, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is responsible for the Northern Ireland scheme. The value of individual payments made in each constituency so far this winter is in the table which has been placed in the Library.

Please note that the amounts for individual payments made refer only to the main payment run, i.e. they do not include the late payment run figures. We estimate that there are approximately 100,000 people in Great Britain paid via late payment runs (0.8&nbsp;per cent. of all payments). However, since late payment runs are mainly in respect of non-system cases whose claims had not been received by the Qualifying Week, they are heavily skewed towards men aged 60.
