<P>
<P>
<a name="31113w01.html_wqn0"><B> Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Leader of the House what evaluation he has made of the proposals put forward by the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees of Parliaments of the European Union (COSAC) in respect of the relative powers of national Parliaments.  [138068]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31113w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 I am aware of COSAC's Contribution of 7 October, and have noted that it proposes that all Parliaments within the EU should hold simultaneous debates on the Commission's legislative and work programme. I shall consider further, in discussion with colleagues, what forum might be most appropriate for debate of the Commission's programme.
<P>

<a name="31113w01.html_para0">I note that the Contribution also endorses the provisions in the draft constitutional treaty for direct transfer of Commission documentation to national Parliaments and for an "early-warning mechanism" by which national Parliaments would be able to present a reasoned opinion if they felt that legislative proposals breached the principle of subsidiarity. The Government strongly support these provisions.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what the cost was to his Department for <i>(a)</i> ministerial cars and drivers, <i>(b)</i> taxis, <i>(c)</i> train travel, <i>(d)</i> the use of helicopters, <i>(e)</i> airline tickets and <i>(f)</i> chartered aeroplanes in each year since 1997.  [123088]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31113w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The responsibility for the provision of ministerial cars and drivers has been delegated under the terms of the Framework Document to the Government Car Despatch Agency. I asked its Chief Executive, Mr. Nick Matheson to write to the hon. Member. A copy of his letter has been placed in the Libraries of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what interim measures she plans to put in place to tackle discrimination on the grounds of <i>(a)</i> sexual orientation, <i>(b)</i> religious belief and <i>(c)</i> age in advance of the establishment of a Commission for Equality and Human Rights in 2006.  [137465]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31113w01.html_spnew4"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Regulations to prohibit discrimination at work on the grounds of sexual orientation and religion or belief come into force on 1 and 2 December 2003. We are working to ensure that employers, individuals and intermediaries have access to information and advice about the Regulations. A guide to the sexual orientation and religion or belief regulations has been available on the DTI website since the summer. Acas has just published practical workplace guidance on implementing the new legislation, after extensive consultation with a wide range of bodies concerned with employment issues, including the TUC and CBI.
<P>

<a name="31113w01.html_para5">This guidance has been available in draft form on the Acas website since the summer. In addition, DTI is raising awareness with intermediaries, including through regional events and by making available funds for which organisations from advisory, faith and lesbian, gay, bisexual backgrounds have been able to bid to provide relevant training. Acas are conducting a programme of training for intermediaries and employers.

<a name="31113w01.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 No, other than in the very limited circumstances where being of a particular sexual orientation is a genuine occupational requirement for a job.

An assessment for Defra in 2001 suggested that the economic risk of coastal flooding could increase up to fivefold by the latter half of the century without any adaptation of defences.

<a name="31113w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 6 November 2003]:</i> Any new variety of a GM crop which has been approved for cultivation under Directive 2001/18 also has to comply with the relevant seeds legislation before it can be added to the National List or the EU common catalogue of plant varieties. The new variety must conform with certain requirements which include an assessment of its value for cultivation and use. The yield achieved in commercial cultivation of a crop depends on many factors including the particular variety chosen, the management system, the quality of the farmland, weather conditions and so on. Therefore predictions cannot be made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31113w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 6 November 2003]:</i> The published results of the farm-scale evaluations present the most in-depth study of the efficacy of Liberty (GA), as used in the evaluations, ever conducted. For full details see Heard et al. 2003; "Weeds in fields with contrasting conventional and genetically modified herbicide tolerant crops. 1. Effects on abundance and diversity"; <i>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</i> (B). 358 (1439): 1819&#150;1832. A copy of this journal has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="31113w04.html_para8">As part of the procedure to issue consent for the release of a herbicide tolerant GM crop the applicants must present evidence that the use of the associated herbicide (eg Liberty in this case) does not lead to environmental harm through the development of resistance in common weeds. This includes a consideration based on any available research findings. The issue of weed resistance to herbicides is not unique to GM crops.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31113w04.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 6 November 2003]:</i> The FSE research team measured surrogates of crop yield rather than yield directly. In particular these included repeated measurements of crop development for both the GM and non-GM crops. The data show little difference between the GM and non-GM. For further details see Champion et al. (2003) "Crop management and agronomic context of the Farm Scale Evaluations of genetically modified herbicide-tolerant crops". <i>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</i> (B). 358 (1439): 1801&#150;1818.

Growers may only use approved herbicides in a mixture in compliance with the statutory conditions of approval for each of the products.
<P>

<a name="31113w04.html_para10">In practice throughout the farm-scale evaluations growers used the herbicide glufosinate ammonium alone on the GM maize fields.
<P>

<a name="31113w04.html_para11">The recommended individual and maximum permitted application rates of the herbicide glufosinate ammonium used on GM maize in the farm-scale evaluations were defined by the conditions of the simulated product licence that formed part of the experimental pesticide approval. This specified a maximum permitted rate of 8 litres per hectare and a recommended individual rate of 4 litres per hectare, depending on the weeds present and their growth stage. Application was permitted until the nine-leaf stage of maize. Before glufosinate ammonium could be used on a commercial scale on GM maize it would need full pesticide approval. In seeking approval the necessary data package would have to be supplied by the applicant and be subjected to the considerations of human and environmental safety which have been established for all pesticide uses. Any approval given would specify recommended and maximum application rates in the same way as the experimental permit. These conditions would be determined by the Pesticide Safety Directorate taking due account of advice from their expert advisory committee the Advisory Committee on Pesticides.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when during the GM farm scale evaluations she was informed that neither the use of Liberty alone on GM maize nor the use of Atrazine on the non-GM control crop would replicate the herbicide use and management regimes which would be used in commercial plantings in the UK in future years.  [136808]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31113w04.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2003]</i>: The farm-scale evaluations were set up to assess the relative impact on wildlife of GM and non-GM management of four crops, based on practices current at the time. They were not set up to investigate the impact of any potential future management changes for either crop, although they will provide an invaluable baseline in our understanding of any such future changes.
<P>

<a name="31113w04.html_para13">The decision to phase out Atrazine in the EU was taken on 3 October 2003, over a year after the completion of the last maize field trials. During the time of the trials (1999&#150;2002) conventional maize practice predominately involved the use of Atrazine; this therefore formed a large part of the sample of FSE fields.
<P>

<a name="31113w04.html_para14">In 2002 some evidence emerged that farmers in the US often mixed Atrazine with glufosinate ammonium for use on GM maize crops. In the FSE, farmers of GM maize used glufosinate ammonium alone. The industry asserted that the UK and US differed in conditions and that glufosinate ammonium alone was typical of the likely practice in the UK. The scientific steering committee, whose role it is to advise me on the conduct of the FSE, considered that in the absence of evidence

<P><I>13 Nov 2003 : Column 414W</I><P>
either way to justify the need for Atrazine to be used in conjunction with glufosinate ammonium in the UK that trials would continue as before. Accordingly, I was not advised that any action was necessary.
<P>

<a name="31113w04.html_para15">Now that Atrazine is being phased out it clearly will not be permitted on any fodder maize crop, GM or otherwise. However, the issue of whether other licensed herbicides could be mixed with glufosinate ammonium on GM crops remains.

 There is no equivalent of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 codifying the investigatory powers of Defra investigators. There is a patchwork of powers. In relation to a range of offences Defra investigators (and inspectors) have fairly standard statutory powers to enter and inspect business premises, powers to inspect and copy business documents and powers to require provision of information in relation to the conduct of the business&#151;all these powers are normally set out in the specific legislation which creates the offence under investigation.

 The Environment Agency is the statutory body which has a duty to secure the proper use of water resources in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="31113w05.html_para7">Since the Water Summit in 1997, there have been a number of developments in terms of securing long-term future water resources. Each water company in England and Wales has produced a water resources plan setting out how it proposes to maintain the supply and demand balance of water for the next 25 years. These plans were assessed by the Environment Agency and are reviewed on an annual basis.
<P>

<a name="31113w05.html_para8">As part of the fourth periodic review of water company prices, water companies are submitting updated water resource plans to the Environment Agency. The agency will report to Ministers on these plans as part of their advice for the fourth periodic review. The Ministerial guidance for the periodic review will be published in early 2004, and cover any related water supply issues.

her Department is taking to reduce the importation of wild caught <i>(a)</i> parrots and <i>(b)</i> other birds into the UK.  [135811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31113w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The international trade in all parrots and many other species of wild birds is strictly regulated under Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97, which implements the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) within the EU. It is an offence to import CITES specimens without the appropriate documentation and trade is only permitted if we are satisfied that the specimens have been lawfully acquired and that the trade will not be detrimental to the wild populations of the species concerned.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact of Government support for the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species on the volume in trade of wild caught <i>(a)</i> parrots and <i>(b)</i> other birds imported into (i) Europe and (ii) the UK since the UK signed the Convention.  [135820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31113w05.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) aims to protect certain plants and animals by regulating and monitoring their international trade to prevent it reaching unsustainable levels. Currently CITES regulates international trade in over 30,000 species, of which approximately 25,000 are plants. The Convention came into force in 1975, and the UK became a party in 1976. Pre-Convention figures concerning the importation of parrots and other birds are not available.
<P>

<a name="31113w05.html_para13">No specific study has been made of the impact of the Convention on the trade in these species. However, all EU member states are required to provide annual reports on the trade in CITES species. These are closely monitored by the European Commission, and powers are available to enable member states to take urgent action in the event that a particular pattern of trade is judged to be unsustainable.

 The Government's key economic targets are contained within the Treasury's latest Public Service Agreement (PSA), agreed as part of the 2002 Spending Review (SR2002). The Technical Note for these targets, published on the HM Treasury website, sets out exactly how performance will be judged, and the National Audit Office will validate the data systems underpinning each of the SR2002 PSA targets at least once during its lifetime. Furthermore, many of the key data used to measure performance against these targets are published as National Statistics, and thus compiled in accordance with the National Statistics Code of Practice.

<P>
<a name="31113w07.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The remit of the Immigration Crime Team (ICT) is to tackle serious and organised immigration crime including, where relevant, identity fraud and theft. Since its inception in January 2002 it has conducted three major operations into identity fraud. Others are under development. The first concerned the identity theft of British passports and led to the arrest of 29 persons in a series of co-ordinated raids. The second involved the arrest of two men for the manufacture and supply of forged British passports and the dismantling of their criminal enterprise. Both pleaded guilty, one received a five year sentence and the other 18 months. The operation resulted in one of the largest ever seizures

Targeting identity fraud is a key priority for Reflex and while the ICT has been at the forefront of major operations other successes have been recorded by other Reflex partners. For example using Reflex funding the Metropolitan police have established a joint intelligence unit under Operation Maxim involving the Immigration Service and UK Passport Service (UKPS) with a remit to investigate identity fraud alongside related criminality.

 The projected net effect on the prison population of the implementation of the provisions to reform the sentencing framework is an increase of about 1,000 by 2009. These measures include the generic community sentence and more flexible types of custody such as intermittent custody, custody minus and custody plus. The long-term impact, once all these provisions have been implemented and sufficient time has passed for their full effects to be seen, is estimated to be an increase in the prison population of about 500.

custodial sentence for unauthorised possession of a prohibited firearm. The estimated effect on the prison population of the implementation of these provisions, and the implementation of the provision providing for an increase in penalties for certain driving-related offences causing death, is an increase of about 500 in the prison population.
<P>

<a name="31113w07.html_para12">The life sentence provisions in the Bill will provide for the determination of a minimum custodial term in relation to mandatory life sentences. It is unlikely that the effect of these provisions on the prison population will be felt for at least a decade.

A further study is being conducted to assess the likely effect on the prison population of the introduction of a presumption against the grant of bail to defendants who have failed to surrender.

It was important to ensure that the commissioners together were able not only to provide an appropriate range of experience and skill, but also diversity of background. Geographical origin was one of a number of factors considered. The fifth commissioner, who was appointed after the first four, is based in Sheffield and the shadow chair comes from Cheshire.
<P>

<a name="31113w08.html_para1">The appointment of the shadow chief inspector, as for any chief executive appointment, took no account of geographical origin as this was not regarded as relevant. As it happens, the chief inspector is from the North of England where he has spent much of his career.

<a name="31113w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 As mandated by HM Treasury and in accordance with Government Accounting regulations, the Ministry of Defence applies the Modified Historic Cost Accounting convention to asset valuations. This requires assets to be valued at their actual or estimated current value to the Department. A mixture of regular professional valuations and the application of appropriate indices between formal valuations are used to meet the requirement. During 2002&#150;03, some 95.4 per cent. of the eligible asset base was professionally revalued as reported in the Annual Report and Accounts published on 30 October.

The amount of money in this current account will vary considerably during the month, typically from in excess of &#163;2 billion at the beginning of the month to under &#163;200 million at the end of the month.

 The original course, which was approved by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, took the vessels through the Casquets Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) in the eastbound lane.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31113w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The net economic benefits estimated for Gatwick and other south east airport options take into account the externalities associated with aviation's climate change impacts. In producing calculations of economic benefits of additional capacity at all south east airport options, it was assumed that by 2015 an economic instrument would be in place to meet the climate change impact of aircraft emissions. This has the effect of reducing forecast passenger numbers by 10 per cent. and reducing the net economic benefits of all the capacity options.

Privately financed train construction has also enabled a major fleet replacement programme which will again benefit passengers as new trains are safer and more comfortable.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what action the Government is taking to assist older people in rural communities who do not have access to a car.  [138164]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31113w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 We are providing specific funding to improve public transport services for rural communities generally, including many of direct benefit to older people without access to a car. This funding is supporting new and improved scheduled bus services and the development of more flexible transport solutions such as demand responsive buses, dial-a-ride schemes and shared taxis. These developments will be further assisted by the forthcoming introduction of regulation changes to make possible the registration of flexibly routed local bus services which will also be entitled to receive Bus Service Operators Grant.
<P>

<a name="31113w11.html_para0">We are also making legislative changes to improve older people's ability to access public transport. We have introduced the national statutory minimum concessionary fare scheme for older and disabled people. This guarantees half fare travel on local bus services with a free pass and covers rural areas which previously had no concessionary fare scheme. Also from 1 April 2003 we have ensured that concessionary travel schemes are available to men aged 60&#150;64, bringing them into line with women of the same age. We have also introduced regulations to ensure that public transport is designed to meet the needs of older people with mobility problems.

<a name="31113w11.html_spnew2"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The Department for Work and Pensions has targets set by the Cabinet Office to help contribute to a reduction in public sector sickness absence. These involve an average working days lost figure of eight days by March 2006, and an interim target of 10 days by March 2004. The cumulative average working days lost figure for the period April to September 2003 was 12 days.
<P>

<a name="31113w11.html_para3">Ministers and senior managers in the Department fully recognise the importance of good attendance. They are committed to ensuring that managers have effective tools to enable them to manage sickness absence, including support for individuals to facilitate a return to work after illness. People who work for the Department and who have to bear the consequences of colleagues' absence, together with the customers the Department serves, have a right to expect that level of commitment.
<P>

<a name="31113w11.html_para4">A new Departmental Attendance Management policy was implemented in February 2003. This aims to encourage good attendance and provide support to enable people to return to work as quickly as possible following an absence. Formal unsatisfactory attendance action can be considered when an absence reaches eight days in a rolling 12-month period. To measure the effectiveness of the policy, an evaluation exercise will start shortly.
<P>

<a name="31113w11.html_para5">Each of the businesses that comprise the Department has initiatives in place aimed at getting sickness absence levels down.

a return to work, or effecting a termination of an individual's contract. The Department is also participating in the 'Well-being at work' pilots that are being run by the Health and Safety Executive. These are intended to combat workplace stress. In addition, the Department is committed to discharging its responsibilities to people with disabilities by making reasonable adjustments to the workplace to facilitate an individual's return to work. A pilot will also commence shortly that will involve the early intervention of occupational health nurses in addressing, quickly, those absences which have the potential to become long term.

 The UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Eritrea has said that the situation has improved slightly but there is still major cause for concern. While the harvest is expected to be better than in 2002 it will be well below its full potential. We will continue to play our part in helping address urgent humanitarian needs, and have recently committed &#163;500,000 to the UNICEF Appeal.

 Malaria is endemic in The Gambia. It is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality especially among children under the age of five and pregnant women. It has a significant negative impact on productivity and is a major cause of poverty. Recent studies in The Gambia have shown that malaria is on the increase. In 2000, it accounted for 60 per cent. of all out patient consultations and 57.2 per cent. of all admissions and 36.9 per cent. of all deaths, including 25 per cent. of all deaths in children under five years of age <sup>1</sup> .

<a name="31113w12.html_para1">The Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), to which DFID contributes, has recently agreed to provide US$13.8 million over five years for the prevention and treatment of malaria in The Gambia, The goal of this project, which is particularly focused on the coastal area, is the reduction of malaria morbidity and mortality in children under five years of age and pregnant women by 30 per cent. by the end of the project in the focus area.

 The UK has a long-term commitment to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM). We recognise that in order to be effective the GFATM needs predictable and sustainable financing&#151;which is why the UK recently extended its pledge by a further two years to 2008 bringing our total contribution to US$280million.
<P>

<a name="31113w12.html_para2">In addition, the Prime Minister has encouraged European Union member states to contribute to the GFATM. Last month the EC agreed to accelerate the disbursement of Euros 170 million to the Fund. Currently the 15 EU member states and the Commission are the largest donor to the GFATM, having contributed around 55 per cent. of the total pledge so far of US$4.8 billion.
<P>

<a name="31113w12.html_para3">The Global Fund is one of a number of instruments to tackle these terrible diseases. Since 1997, the Department for International Development has stepped up its spending on HIV/AIDS from &#163;38 million in 1997&#150;98 to more than &#163;270 million in 2002&#150;03. According to UNAIDS, UK is currently the 2nd largest bilateral donor active in the field of HIV/AIDS.

[137690]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31113w12.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 We continue to provide substantial assistance for St. Helena, which this year is expected to be more than &#163;10.5 million. Much of this support is needed to maintain essential government services, including education and healthcare, and to subsidise the island's vital passenger/supply ship. These and other services will be maintained: but we hope increasingly to devote a greater share of our assistance to activities that will generate more local revenue and reduce St. Helena's reliance upon our aid.
<P>

<a name="31113w12.html_para10">For example, in parallel with evaluating options for the possible development of air access and with the St. Helena Government we are reviewing the routing and scheduling of the RMS 'St Helena' to see if a better call pattern for the island can be established. We also are considering further strengthening of the St. Helena Development Agency (SHDA), in addition to some existing support through the SHDA from the FCO's Economic Diversification Fund, to help stimulate private sector growth. As regards staffing, some key posts in St. Helena have been advertised recently on enhanced terms that are designed to encourage key personnel to remain and/or to attract back suitable people with St. Helenian status who are living overseas.

 DFID routinely subjects all proposals for UK funding to detailed technical appraisal before spending is approved. In the case of food aid to Zimbabwe, our most recent pledge of &#163;5 million to support the Emergency Operation of the World Food Programme (WFP) followed close examination of the operational procedures set out in the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the WFP and the Government of Zimbabwe on 25 September. This included the process for identifying those members of the community who are in greatest need, regardless of political considerations or affiliation. WFP conducts rigorous training of its Implementing Partners (NGOs) on these procedures
<P>

<a name="31113w13.html_para0">In addition to UK's support for the WFP Emergency Operation, DFID is also providing funds directly to international and local NGOs who are undertaking humanitarian work in Zimbabwe, focusing on HIV/AIDS affected households, malnourished children and other vulnerable groups.

(WFP). In response to pressure from the UK and other donors, the WFP has already strengthened its own internal monitoring, evaluation and reporting activities. Particular emphasis is placed on monitoring and reporting of any incidences of political interference. WFP also undertakes post-distribution monitoring, in which vulnerable households who were targeted for assistance are interviewed to assess their views of the selection and distribution processes. Donors and the UNDP have jointly established a Relief and Recovery Unit with the purpose of co-ordinating information about all ongoing humanitarian activities funded by the international community. This covers not only food but also other forms of assistance such as medicines, seeds and fertilisers. It also covers the operations of NGOs directly funded by donors, outside the UN Emergency Operation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps the Government is taking to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons-related technology.  [136771]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31113w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 Preventing the spread of technology with WMD application is a high priority for the Government. All licences for the export from the UK of nuclear technology with possible weapons-related application are rigorously scrutinised. I refer the hon. Member to the Statement made by the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw) on 15 March 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1298W.
<P>

<a name="31113w14.html_para0">The UK is a leading and active member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), an international export control regime which seeks to contribute to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons by controlling the export of nuclear related and dual use items and related technology. These are identified in the NSG technical annex and are incorporated into national and EU legislation.
<P>

<a name="31113w14.html_para1">Within the NSG the UK chairs the Licensing and Enforcement Experts Meeting where customs and other enforcement officials exchange information and intelligence relating to procurement methods, and discuss case studies on interdiction. The UK also provides technical experts who revise the lists of controlled goods to ensure that the NSG keeps pace with developments in technology, weapons systems and procurement methods.
<P>

<a name="31113w14.html_para2">Within the NSG and other export control regimes the UK supports outreach activities, in the form of bilateral talks and awareness raising seminars, which play a key role in our efforts to promote and support the implementation of responsible export controls around the world. In addition, joint teams of officials from FCO, DTI, MOD and HM Customs and Excise conduct dedicated export control bilateral meetings to address the practical issues surrounding the implementation of export licensing and enforcement systems.

<a name="31113w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We regularly discuss the fight against terrorism with the Pakistani Government, most recently when I, and my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, met the Pakistani Foreign Minister, Khurshid Kasuri, on 4 November.
<P>

<a name="31113w14.html_para3">On 3 November the al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council added Dawood Ibrahim's name to its list of individuals linked to al-Qaeda. Like all UN members the UK is accordingly under an obligation to freeze his assets, and has now done so.

 The UK Government undertake regular dialogue with Russian counterparts at both official and ministerial level about the on-going conflict in Chechnya and its resolution. The UK Government also substantially fund humanitarian aid by international organisations and NGOs in the region, totalling around &#163;74 million.
<P>

<a name="31113w14.html_para4">We have monitored the political process in Chechnya closely since its inception. We were disappointed by the conditions under which the recent Chechen Presidential elections were held, as I made clear in my 6 October press statement. A copy of the press release is available on the Foreign and Commonwealth website: www.fco.gov.uk/policy/news/press-releases. The UK supported similar statements by the EU. We have called on the new Chechen President to promote a genuinely open political process.

All RRU operations are presently implemented from the Headquarters in Harare, which is feasible but more difficult to manage. At meetings with DFID and other donors, the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator in Zimbabwe has agreed to continue to press the Zimbabwe Government to allow the regional offices to operate.

 There are no plans for such designation. However the need for co-ordination between Agencies in dealing with flooding emergencies has been given priority with the establishment of an inter-Agency Flood Strategy Steering Group (FSSG). Under the direction of the FSSG, the Rivers Agency, in conjunction with Water Service, Roads Service and others are progressing measures to improve inter-Agency response.

 Literacy standards among Key Stage 3 pupils are steadily improving and are currently at their highest ever. The literacy strategy element of the School Improvement Programme is particularly aimed at raising standards among all underachieving pupils, including boys, and this improvement reflects the contribution made by all education partners to its delivery. Specific guidance has been given to schools on maximising the performance of boys, particularly in literacy.

 The Department for Employment and Learning supports adult learners to develop IT skills through a range of programme and policy initiatives, These include the New Deal for 25+ for long-term unemployed people, which offers participants a range of appropriate training courses. Clients who are eligible for the Training Grant of New Deal 50 plus can access up to &#163;1,500 over a two-year period for in-work training which can include IT skills. In the further education (FE) sector enrolments on information and communications technology (ICT) courses attract an enhanced level of financial support. Some 75 per cent. of current enrolments comprise students aged 25 or over, Learndirect plays a major role in the delivery of ICT programmes. 34 community-based learning venues throughout Northern Ireland offer all adults flexible access to a range of IT programmes at minimal cost to disadvantaged learners, including those over the age of retirement. Recent modifications to the learndirect learner funding model have been introduced to attract older learners on low income.

However, the Code of Guidance makes clear that, in determining relative priorities for an allocation, authorities are able to have regard to whether or not applicants have a local connection with the district. The Code of Guidance does refer specifically to the rights of persons leaving the armed forces to be included in council waiting lists.

 Section 179 of the Housing Act 1996 requires local housing authorities to ensure that advice and information about homelessness and the prevention of homelessness is available free of charge to anyone in their district. The Homelessness Code of Guidance, to which local authorities must have regard by law, states that advisory services need to be accessible to everyone in the district, and well publicised. The Code also states that authorities need to monitor the provision of advisory services to ensure they continue to meet the needs of all sections of the community.

 Options for a Northern Distributor Road form part of a review of the Norwich Area Transport Strategy currently being undertaken by Norfolk County Council. If, as an outcome of the review, the council decides to go ahead with preparation of plans for the Distributor Road, it would need to undertake a full appraisal of the scheme, covering the environmental impacts as well as the economic, safety, integration and accessibility effects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31113w17.html_spnew2"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The estimated maximum cost of adjudications would be &#163;19 million. However, this is based on the assumption that the rate of disputes inside a statutory scheme (requiring adjudication) would be the same as the current rate of alleged unreasonable withholding of deposits.

<a name="31113w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 In February 2001 a decision was made by the Ministerial Group in charge of the Golden Jubilee to award a medal to commemorate the Queen's Golden Jubilee. The Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal would be awarded to members of the armed services, and Royal Fleet Auxiliary, who had completed five years service on 6 February 2002. In December 2001 a decision was made by the Ministerial Group to extend the eligibility for the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal to the those members of the emergency "999" services, that had also completed five years service on the 6 February 2002. There are no plans to review these criteria and the Ministerial Group has long since been disbanded.

 The Department is working closely with the Home Office's Active Community Unit (ACU) to ensure that volunteering by young people contributes to the Government's overall drive to increase community participation. One important element of the new Citizenship curriculum in schools is the involvement of pupils in the life and concerns of their neighbourhood and communities, including learning through community involvement and service. Since September 2002, we have been funding Active Citizens in Schools (ACiS)&#151;a pilot which builds on aspect of Millennium Volunteers to encourage 11&#150;15 year olds to

<P>
<a name="31113w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 November 2003]:</i> The issue as to whether the national nutritional standards should be food or nutrient based was debated thoroughly during extensive consultation prior to the introduction of the standards in 2001. The overwhelming consensus was that food based standards would be simpler to implement and monitor, and would be consistent with cross Government messages aimed at teaching children to make healthy eating choices. There has been nothing in the intervening period to suggest that this decision should be reversed.

 The information requested is not currently available.
<P>

<a name="31113w17.html_para2">The number of pupils known to be eligible for free school meals is collected in January each year via the Annual Schools' Census. As a result, data on the number of pupils known to be eligible for free meals since the introduction of new rules in April 2003 will not be available until spring 2004.

 The table shows the information that is available centrally. It relates to pupils who are known to be eligible for, and claim, free school meals. Equivalent information for the take-up of free school meals is not collected at pupil level and therefore cannot be broken down by ethnic group.
