<a name="90727w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if he will make a statement on the <i>(a)</i> purpose and <i>(b)</i> activities over the past 12 months of the (i) Horizontal Questions Working Group, (ii) General Affairs Working Group and (iii) Quality of Legislation Working Group, meeting at European Communities level.  [91877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The Horizontal Questions Working Group reports to the Internal Market Council, and deals with cross-cutting issues concerning the internal market. Cabinet Office interest in the Working Group is confined to discussions on better regulation and simplification of legislation at the European level.
<P>

<a name="90727w01.htm_para0">The General Affairs Working Group reports primarily to the General Affairs Council (i.e. Foreign Ministers) and deals with a very wide range of general EU internal (co-ordination, institutions, etc.) and external (foreign relations) matters. Cabinet Office interest is via the Civil Service Corporate Management (CSCM) in discussing terms and conditions of employment of European civil servants (i.e. those employed in the Commission, Council Secretariat, European Parliament Secretariat, etc.) and in terms and conditions for MEPs.
<P>

<a name="90727w01.htm_para1">The Quality of Legislation Working Group, a time-limited group is working on the negotiation of an Inter-Institutional Agreement (i.e. between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council) on the quality of drafting of Community legislation. Cabinet 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 156</I><P>
Office interest is via the Cabinet Office Legal Advisors (COLA), the Regulatory Impact Unit (RIU) and its legal advisers.
<P>

<a name="90727w01.htm_para2">My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office will not be making a statement at this stage.

<a name="90727w01.htm_sbhd1"><H4><center>Public Appointments</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Joan Ruddock: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office how many appointments to public bodies were made by his Department in <i>(a)</i> 1997-98 and <i>(b)</i> 1998-99, broken down by (i) gender and (ii) ethnicity; and if he will list the chairmen appointed to those bodies in those years, similarly broken down.  [92518]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 For the purposes of this answer it includes appointments made by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and those made by the Prime Minister to public bodies for which the Cabinet Office is responsible.
<P>

<a name="90727w01.htm_para3">The public bodies for which my right hon. Friend is responsible as Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster are: the Advisory Committee on Advertising; the Advisory Committee on Justices of the Peace in Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside; the Better Regulation Task Force; the Civil Service Appeal Board and the People's Panel Advisory Group.
<P>

<a name="90727w01.htm_para4">The Prime Minister appoints members to: the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments; the Committee on Standards in Public Life; the Security Commission and Security Vetting Appeals Panel; the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee; the British Government Panel on Sustainable Development and the Senior Salaries Review Body. There are no ministerial appointments to positions in the Women's National Commission.
<P>

<a name="90727w01.htm_para5">The details of appointments made are given in the table. However, while appointments have been made to women and members of ethnic minority groups I am unable, with the exception of gender information for the Advisory Committee on JPs, to disclose the numbers as to do so would risk identifying individuals without their consent.

 Local drug service providers can bid to provide services under the prison service drugs strategy programme and the health and social services programmes and for contracts to provide services for the probation service.
<P>

<a name="90727w01.htm_para7">It is the role of Drug Action Teams and local commissioning agencies to ensure that individual services work coherently within a local strategic framework. Local service providers may seek guidance from the Drug Action Team on making bids for funding. Bids should be made to the relevant statutory agencies.

 As part of the Government's commitment to ensuring that their policies are relevant to the lives that people live today my Department is working with the Women's Unit, Home Office, and DfEE to develop good practices for ensuring that our policies meet the changing needs of all members of society.
<P>

<a name="90727w01.htm_para8">"Policy Appraisal for Equal Treatment", published by the Cabinet Office, Home Office, DfEE and the Women's Unit in November 1998, has been circulated to staff within my Department to ensure that the effects of any policy changes on all sections of the population are considered at the earliest stage of policy development.
<P>

<a name="90727w01.htm_para9">As part of the Modernising Government White Paper, we have made a commitment to increasing the number of female senior civil servants from 18 per cent. to 35 per cent. and those from ethnic minorities from 1.6 per cent. to 3.2 per cent. by 2004-05.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Dr. Jack Cunningham: </B> 
 The Modernising Government White Paper was published on 30 March 1999 (CM3981). It set out key policies and principles underpinning the Government's long-term programme of reform to modernise public service. The programme involves everyone working in public services and everyone who uses them.
<P>

<a name="90727w01.htm_para10">I have today published a document setting out the milestones that need to be reached in order to meet the commitments we made in the White Paper. As we make clear in the document, our approach to ensuring that these commitments are taken forward means identifying key strategic drivers for change as well as the achievement of

specific targets. We will be doing more work to develop measurable outcomes and will include them within the work on the next round of public service agreements.
<P>

<a name="90727w01.htm_para11">The document describes progress to date in Modernising Government and work that will lead to further changes over coming months. The table of milestones names officials able to provide more detail on specific aspects.

 No money from the Sure Start programme has been granted to projects in the parliamentary constituencies of Birkenhead, Wallasey, Wirral, West and Wirral, South. These parliamentary constituencies were not included within the 60 areas of the country invited to develop a local Sure Start programme in the first round. The 60 areas were chosen as trailblazers because they were areas which scored highly on an index of local deprivation and were areas where there was existing local capacity, so that they could set up quickly and therefore play a mentoring role to future programmes.

These routes may include changing courses or institutions, repeating years or leaving higher education for a year or more before continuing their studies.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment announced his proposals for the review of the National Curriculum in England in May 1999.

All Jobcentres have detailed instructions explaining that they must only take job vacancies that meet the requirements of the National Minimum Wage Act.

<P>
<a name="90727w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 All schools seeking grant in relation to the National Grid for Learning are expected to agree with their local education authority a development plan for the use of Information and Communications Technology. Information about the number of schools which have already done so is not held by the Department.

<a name="90727w05.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 BT, in common with other companies operating in the telecommunications and ICT industries, has a role to play in making a range of services available to schools and other organisations in order to enable those institutions to make optimum use of the Information Age.

 Information on the NGfL funding devolved to each school is not held centrally by the Department. However, the total amount of grant allocated to each authority from the National Grid for Learning Standards Fund programme in 1998-99 and 1999-2000 is set out in the tables. LEAs are required to devolve 95 per cent. of their allocation to schools.

 Latest estimates indicate that 51 per cent. of primary schools and 90 per cent. of secondary schools and 100 per cent. of universities are connected to the Internet. An April 1999 survey suggested that 100 per cent. of colleges of further education had internet access.

<a name="90727w05.htm_para3">Statistics collected late in 1997 found that 5 per cent. of public library service points offered public Internet access. The Library and Information Commission is currently compiling updated statistics, as part of the development of the Public Library ICT Network which will link all public libraries, where practicable, to the NGfl by 2002.
<P>

<a name="90727w05.htm_para4">While targets for connection by the end of 1999 have not been set, our aim is that all schools, colleges, universities, libraries and as many community centres as possible should be online and able to benefit from access the National Grid for Learning by 2002.

<P>
<a name="90727w05.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 This information is not yet available from this year's survey of ICT in schools. The Government anticipate that the impact of its &#163;657 million Standards Fund programme for the NGfL up to 2002 will be substantial, as will arrangements which they have announced this month for the availability of higher quality managed ICT services to schools at competitive prices.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w05.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The overall implementation of the National Grid for Learning, including school's purchasing strategies, is subject to a rigorous programme of independent evaluation. This also focuses on the Grid's impact on classroom practice and on students' achievements. Interim findings form these studies should be available early in 2000.
<P>

<a name="90727w05.htm_para5">The British Educational Communications and Technology agency, on behalf of the DfEE, is also carrying out evaluation of the classroom application of the Grid via the Multimedia Portables for Teachers project. Teachers are currently participating in curriculum groups, which provide feedback on the Grid's curriculum materials and identify any gaps in that provision.

<a name="90727w06.htm_para0">It is too early to predict recruitment to PGCE courses in 1999-2000. However, following the introduction of &#163;5,000 incentives in maths and science, applications have gone up substantially, by 37 per cent. for maths to 1,306 and 24 per cent. for science to 2,784. Within the figure for science there have been increases of 33 per cent. for physics and 27 per cent. for chemistry. We are therefore confident that the decline in recruitment since 1995 will be reversed this year.The following table taken from the Higher Education Statistics Agency's Student Record Survey shows the percentage of those commencing PGCE

These are the subjects of first degree and not necessarily the subjects or phase in which the student is undertaking teacher training. Information for the current year and 1998-99 is not yet available. There are a significant proportion of students for whom the first degree subject is unknown. The subjects of first degree do not include combined courses, or closely related courses such as engineering.

 The Teacher Training Agency (TTA) awarded a contract for the administration of the Maths and Science Placement Scheme in April. Over the next year, the programme will recruit 600 mature graduates in maths and science and match them to suitable vacancies in schools on the Graduate Teacher Programme. Approximately 300 will train as maths teachers and 300 as science teachers. We are still at an early stage of the scheme, but the TTA have already received 436 applications.

This will bring serving teachers up to the same standard as teachers emerging into the profession whose training will have followed, in part, the Initial Teacher Training Curriculum for ICT in Subject Teaching which was introduced in September 1998.
<P>

<a name="90727w06.htm_para2">To underpin the training we are making available over &#163;300 million to increase the number of computers in schools, so teachers can have access to them. The availability of computers must go hand in hand with the training. In addition we recently made &#163;23 million available for the purchase of 9,500 multimedia portables for teachers so that they can learn about IT in their own time.

 During the Summer Term 1999, training within the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) ICT teacher training programme has begun in approximately 20 education authorities. NOF is actively engaged in collecting data on this training from Approved Providers, 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 182</I><P>
and it is too early to give firm information on the number of teachers trained. These data will be available from NOF in September.
<P>

<a name="90727w06.htm_para4">Training was initiated during this term to meet the needs of those schools which are particularly advanced in the provision of ICT hardware. However, the majority of the approved training providers are not proposing to start training teachers before the next school year (1999-2000). The NOF programme will last three years, and is integrated with Government initiatives to roll out the necessary hardware in schools, for example via the Standards Fund. NOF thus expects demand to build steadily during the next school year. The programme is designed to reach all serving teachers over its lifetime.

<P>
<a name="90727w08.htm_spnew10"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Ministerial Task Force on Truancy and School Exclusion, which I chair, has today sent its first annual report on truancy and school exclusion to the Prime Minister. The report sets out the action we have taken to implement the recommendations in the Social Exclusion Unit's report, including examples of good practice, and sets out our priorities for 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="90727w08.htm_para1">We are pleased to report that permanent exclusions have fallen by 3 per cent. (from 12,700 in the 1996-97 school year to 12,300 in 1997-98). This is particularly good news because it is the first time that permanent exclusions have fallen since my Department began collecting information on exclusions in 1994-95.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what has been the increase in the <i>(a)</i> staff and <i>(b)</i> expenditure of the Standards and Effectiveness Unit since its inception; and what assessment he has made of the impact of this increase on (i) the bureaucratic burdens on schools and (ii) the number of circulars issued by his Department.

<a name="90727w09.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 At its inception in May 1997 the number of staff in the Unit was 44, this rose to 107 in May 1998 and at the end of June 1999 stood at 152. The budget for the Unit in 1997-98 was &#163;2.4 million; for 1998-99, &#163;4.8 million; and for 1999-2000 it is &#163;5.9 million. The numbers of staff in the Unit must be viewed against the numbers of staff and budget for the Department as a whole, both of which have remained stable over the last two years. The increase of staff in the Unit, therefore, reflects a refocusing of resources towards our top priority of raising standards in schools.
<P>

<a name="90727w09.htm_para3">The increased resources devoted to the Standards and Effectiveness Unit have led to a clearer focus on raising standards in schools, not to increased bureaucracy. The work of the Unit has not led to any significant increase in the number of circulars issued by the Department over the last three years. We draw a clear distinction between unnecessary bureaucratic activity, which hinders teachers' efforts to raise standards, and those activities that are integral to achieving higher standards. We have provided training and support materials as part of the strategies to improve standards in key areas such as literacy and numeracy and this has been welcomed by teachers.
<P>

<a name="90727w09.htm_para4">Following a systematic review of bureaucracy, the Department has initiated firm action to reduce the burden on schools.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment when the Employment Service's Annual Report and Accounts for 1998-99 will be laid before Parliament.  [93823]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w09.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 I have today laid before the House the Employment Service's Annual Report and Accounts for 1998-99 which gives full details of the Agency's performance and expenditure for that year.
<P>

<a name="90727w09.htm_para5">The Annual Report notes the very significant achievements of the Employment Service in 1998-99. In particular, the Employment Service successfully launched the New Deals for 18-24-year-olds, for those aged 25 and over and for Lone Parents through ground-breaking local partnerships of private, voluntary and public sector organisations.
<P>

<a name="90727w09.htm_para6">At the same time, the Report notes that during 1998-99 the Employment Service:
<P>

<a name="90727w09.htm_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>handled 2.5 million job vacancies;
<P>
<BR>
placed directly into work over 1.2 million unemployed people including some 180,000 people who had been unemployed for more than six months and almost 100,000 people with disabilities;
<P>
<BR>
helped nearly a quarter of a million young people through the New Deal for 18-24-year-olds and directly placed 70,000 of them into jobs.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90727w09.htm_para8">Although the Employment Service did not succeed in meeting its main targets for the number of unemployed people placed into jobs, its performance needs to be seen against the background of further falls in unemployment over the year with numbers of long-term unemployed people at their lowest level for 20 years, a continuing emphasis on ensuring that all job placings were properly and accurately recorded and validated and the successful delivery of a very substantial agenda of other major developments, including New Deal implementation, by and within the Agency.

<P>

<a name="90727w09.htm_para9">I am particularly pleased that the Employment Service is changing rapidly. People are noticing the difference. I am particularly pleased that standards of customer service in Jobcentres exceeded the target set and reached their highest recorded level ever.
<P>

<a name="90727w09.htm_para10">The Agency has also continued to play a key role in implementing our Modernising Government agenda including the introduction, on a pilot basis, of its new telephone job finding service, Employment Service Direct; the opening of its Peterlee Call Centre to improve services to employers throughout the Northern Region; and the introduction of Webvacs, its first internet jobs database.
<P>

<a name="90727w09.htm_para11">As the Chief Executive points out in his Report, none of this would have been possible without the quite remarkable effort and commitment of people throughout the Employment Service. I, too, am very grateful to them and wish them every success in 1999-2000.

<P>
<a name="90727w10.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 We are aware of the techniques that researchers at Dundee plan to use should their research proposals be adopted but we have serious doubts about their general applicability to nuclear test veterans. One of the techniques, the detection of chromosome aberrations, has already been the subject of a pilot study by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB)

involving test veterans and was found to lack resolution since the level of such aberrations is naturally elevated in people of this age group.
<P>

<a name="90727w10.htm_para0">Of the other techniques, the magnitude of the dose required to produce long-term effects in the organs to be studied is very high. It is extremely unlikely that veterans could have received radiation doses sufficient to produce such effects 40 years after the alleged exposure. This is borne out by the fact that two robust epidemiological studies have shown no increase in leukaemia rates and no overall increase in mortality, either in cancer or non-cancer diagnoses. It would therefore be inappropriate to allocate public funds to this work.

<a name="90727w11.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Kapton is a trademarked material. It is one of a range of polyamide coverings used to insulate aircraft wires. The MOD has been aware of potential problems associated with polyamide insulated wires since they were first identified in 1985. Accordingly the use of polyamide insulated wires in MOD aircraft is reviewed regularly. Work has included a detailed assessment of each aircraft installation; a review of defence standards on aircraft wiring; and work with the British Standards Institute to develop standards that are suitable for all airborne electrical wires and cables. We have also developed clear procurement guidelines and improved inspection and husbandry techniques. Decisions about wiring installations on MOD aircraft are made by experienced engineers who are responsible for assessing the risks and benefits, and for making safety and value judgments accordingly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w12.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The independent Animal Welfare Advisory Committee, chaired by Dr. Jeremy Lucke, has recently published its third annual Report. The Committee was set up in 1996 specifically to keep under review the care and welfare arrangements of animals used in defence research. I am placing a copy of the Report in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="90727w12.htm_para4">The use of animals in defence research is concerned with providing the Armed Forces with safe and effective protection against hazards encountered while conducting their duties, and is kept to the absolute minimum.
<P>

<a name="90727w12.htm_para5">The Committee's Report highlights the work being done by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency to find alternatives to the use of animals. In particular, the increasing use of in-vitro studies will lead to a reduction in the number of animals used. For example, use of such technology means that experiments to test the effectiveness of decontaminant and barrier creams against a chemical warfare agent, which would otherwise have needed up to 90 animals, was achieved without using any animals at all.
<P>

<a name="90727w12.htm_para6">There is still much to be done in developing technologies which allow the use of animals in experiments to be further reduced. We welcome continuing scrutiny by the Animal Welfare Advisory Committee and aim to minimise the use of animals as far as possible, against the continuing requirement to research effective measures to counter the hazards faced by the armed forces in the conduct of their duties.

 The Technology Readiness and Risk Assessment Programme is a three year programme which was initiated following the Strategic Defence Review. It forms part of the Corporate Research Programme. Its purposes are (i) to monitor developments in the potential threat and the technologies available to counter it and (ii) to establish a position from which a national requirement for fielding an active ballistic missile defence system could be developed, should one become necessary. The programme focuses on the characteristics of ballistic missiles, the performance of radar and other sensors, the guidance of interceptors, and their potential to defeat ballistic missile warheads including those containing biological or chemical agents.

I announced on 25 February 1999 that my Department would fund a further study to address the incidence of multiple myeloma among nuclear test veterans. This is because there was some uncertainty about the incidence of this particular illness following the first NRPB study; and we wish to assess whether or not there is any significance in the recently reported increased rates.

Those reasons included the relatively poor state of the spawning salmon stock, the very substantial modification by man of the watercourse and discharges into the river environment. The Government have proposed five other rivers to the European Commission as candidate SACs for Atlantic salmon which we believe better meet the selection criteria of the Habitats Directive.

<a name="90727w17.htm_spnew0"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Appropriate integration of the two streams of the research funding has been recognised for some time as an important matter. The Science and Engineering Base Co-ordinating Committee--which draws its members from the senior officials of the Research Councils, the Funding Councils (including SHEFC), the UK and devolved departments with responsibility for Higher Education and the Office of Science and Technology--aims to co-ordinate science and engineering base research activity across the UK and to ensure that it is consistent with, and targeted on, Government objectives.

<a name="90727w18.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 I have no plans to do so. It is important to note that the actual market value of the home does not determine eligibility for legal aid. The means test instead takes account of the equity value of the home--that is, the difference between its current market value and the 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 221</I><P>
amount required to redeem any mortgage secured on it. This amount depends on the personal circumstances of the applicant and not on where they live. The present amount of equity disregarded for the purposes of determining legal aid eligibility is &#163;100,000. This level was set in the Civil Legal Aid (Assessment of Resources) (Amendment) Regulations 1996. The Lord Chancellor consulted widely on those regulations, which were introduced to deal with the problem of apparently wealthy applicants receiving legal aid, and there was broad agreement that exempting a universal amount of equity was the correct way to proceed. The amount is the same as the maximum value up to which mortgage interest is paid for people receiving Income Support. Since eligibility for legal aid is related to movements in benefit levels, it would not be appropriate to make any changes independent of the benefit system.

This will require equality schemes to be drawn up by public authorities, including arrangements for impact assessments with consultation and publication.

 The Government have taken a number of steps to seek to ensure that the education system in Northern Ireland develops the range of skills which are likely to be required by employers now and in the future. A major schools improvement programme which will be supported by new investment in the school system for the 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 225</I><P>
period up to 2002 is underway. That, together with a new educational technology strategy and a review of the curriculum, will seek to ensure higher and more relevant educational attainment and prepare young people for future vocational development. In addition, I have published a set of proposals on lifelong learning, "A new Learning Culture for All", in which I set out Government policy for improving general skill levels and for meeting the skill needs of Northern Ireland for the future. Included in the proposals are initiatives to widen and increase access to education and training provision, put in place a skills identification and monitoring system and significantly increase the number of higher and further education places available. I have established a Northern Ireland Skills task Force to advise the Department of Education and the Training and Employment Agency on issues related to skills identification and responses to labour market and skill needs. The Industrial Development Board will play a significant role in that task Force ensuring that its focus includes the target sectors for inward investment and company expansion.
<P>

<a name="90727w19.htm_para0">The information and advice from the Skills Task Force and from our labour market research will enable us to focus the education and training provision in Northern Ireland, at all levels, on the future needs of the local economy. This is an issue addressed in the recently published Economic Development Strategy, "Strategy 2010".

<P>
<a name="90727w20.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 The Northern Ireland Child Support Agency published its 1998-99 Annual Report and Accounts on Friday 23 July. I have arranged for copies to be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90727w20.htm_para0">The Agency has met five of the six Ministerial targets and all Milestone targets. An outturn of &#163;14.7 million was achieved for the Maintenance Collected target of &#163;15.8 million and, although this target was not achieved, the maintenance collected is an increase of 16 per cent. on 1997-98 and a 51 per cent. increase on 1996-97.
<P>

<a name="90727w20.htm_para1">The Agency has placed a strong emphasis on improving the quality of service to customers and it is gratifying to see that an outturn of 71 per cent. has been achieved for the processing of maintenance assessments against a 65 per cent. target Improvements in quality are also evident with an outturn of 85 per cent. for the accuracy of assessment target of 75 per cent. The Report included details of the contribution which the Northern Ireland Agency makes to the overall performance of the Great Britain Agency through its partnership contract to deliver services to the people of Eastern England.
<P>

<a name="90727w20.htm_para2">The Agency recognises that customers have a right to good service provided by skilled staff and the foundations for continuing improvements are in place. Major changes in service delivery, including additional hours of contact with customers and more use of the telephone, will improve customer contact and the service provided. However, the Agency has a long way to go in improving the quality of its work, particularly in the accuracy of maintenance assessments which it makes.
<P>

<a name="90727w20.htm_para3">In the longer term, the Government's recently published proposals for a thorough reform of the child support system represent the best opportunity to radically improve services to customers especially, and most importantly, by putting children first.

<a name="90727w20.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The number of salmon and grilse and sea trout taken by anglers in each of the rivers in the Foyle Fisheries Commission area is shown in the table. These figures are compiled from returns made by anglers. The figures are incomplete as a varying percentage of anglers make returns each year. No figures are available for brown trout catches.

 What matters most is that Ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, as required by the Ministerial Code. The use of clear and concise English can be the best way of achieving this. However, I do not think it necessary to proscribe the use of any particular phrase.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) works with national governments, multilateral agencies and civil society groups in over 150 countries to enable more poor people to benefit from good quality reproductive health care, including voluntary family counselling and services; HIV/AIDS/STD prevention, treatment and care; essential obstetric care, including treatment for the consequences of unsafe abortion and, where legal, elective termination of pregnancy. Around 7.5 per cent. and 2.5 per cent. of DFID's 1998-99 health expenditure of &#163;200 million was invested via UNFPA and IPPF respectively in order to enable poor people to exercise their basic right to reproductive choice and reproductive health.

<a name="90727w21.htm_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Our aim is to mobilise the international system to achieve the internationally agreed target of reducing by half the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by 2015. In the Comprehensive Spending Review published in July 1998, we set out key targets to be achieved by the end of this Parliament, including annual growth of 1.5 per cent. in Gross Domestic Product per capita, and quantified measures for progress in health and education, strategies for sustainable development, improvements in the effectiveness of the international system and increased effectiveness of the United Kingdom's bilateral aid programme. Progress against these targets, which closely reflect the International Development Goals, will be rigorously monitored in the Department's annual Output and Performance Analysis which will be made publicly available.

 The Government are committed to working to increase public awareness and understanding of international development issues and to monitoring the effectiveness of this work. We are therefore conducting a baseline survey this month through the Office for National Statistics' Omnibus Survey, and will make the results publicly available. Further surveys will be undertaken periodically, in order to measure progress against our objectives.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w21.htm_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We have recently agreed to provide &#163;9.76 million to support the Government of Bangladesh's Fourth Fisheries Project. The project will engage government, non-governmental and community based organisations in improving aquatic resource management of inland waters and coastal polders. Fourteen per cent. of the funding will support a component for improving the shrimp production system. Our contribution is 25 per cent. of the total project requirements, which will be parallel financed with the World bank and the Bangladesh Government over five years.
<P>

<a name="90727w21.htm_para1">As a major supporter of sustainable fisheries development in Bangladesh for many years, we share local concerns about the environmental and social impact of past development of the shrimp industry. We have been able to influence development partners in this sector, using our expertise to provide strong environmental and social analyses in the design of the new project. This helped to put poverty elimination and environmental sustainability objectives at the centre of project design. For the shrimp component, we also helped to modify the focus of the project to the creation of more diverse and stable livelihoods in areas where shrimp are produced.

<a name="90727w22.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90727w22.htm_para2">Workers exposed to asbestos have been found to have up to ten times the risk of lung cancer compared with other workers. A typical smoker, not exposed to asbestos, has about fifteen times the risk of contracting lung cancer compared with non-smokers. When both exposures are present the risks can be--approximately--multiplied together. The total risk of lung cancer faced by smokers exposed to asbestos will depend on the type of fibre to which they are exposed, on the amount to which they are exposed and for how long, but it will be much higher than for non-smokers. The development of asbestosis is unaffected by smoking.

 <i>[holding answer 5 July 1999]:</i> For all the first wave of prioritised major private finance initiative schemes any leasehold interest held by the private sector partner will either "fall away" at the end of the contract period or the National Health Service trust can exercise an option to take back the leasehold interest, in both cases returning full ownership of the asset to the NHS trust. This principle is set out in NHS Executive guidance on the PFI and will be followed by all subsequent schemes.

<a name="90727w22.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 In 1999-2000, London health authorities received modernisation funds of &#163;13.1 million for improving primary care as part of their unified allocations. It is for health authorities, in partnership with National Health Service trusts, primary care groups, local authorities and local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health and modernisation services. In doing so they must however deliver at least the guaranteed floor level of expenditure on general practitioner practice infrastructure costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w22.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Government obtain advice from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) on the risks to health from exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs), including those emitted by mobile phone masts. At locations accessible to the public the exposure to EMFs emitted by mobile phone transmitters are well below the maximum exposure levels recommended by NRPB in their guidelines. (Restrictions on human exposure to static and time varying electromagnetic fields and radiation. Documents of the NRPB, 4, No 5,7-63 (1993)). These guidelines are intended to prevent acute adverse responses to increased heat load and elevated body temperature. Copies of the guidelines have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90727w22.htm_para5">Concerns have been expressed that there may be other, non-established, health effects of exposure to EMFs, particularly cancer. The question of possible long-term health effects, and specifically cancer-related issues, associated with exposures to electromagnetic fields and radiation has been addressed by the NRPB Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation (chaired by Professor Sir Richard Doll). The Group has concluded that there is no firm evidence for the existence of a carcinogenic hazard from exposure to electromagnetic fields but there is a need for further good quality research to be carried out. This view is supported by international bodies, including the World Health Organisation.
<P>

<a name="90727w22.htm_para6">Research into the possible long term health effects of electromagnetic fields in general is being undertaken on a worldwide basis. The Department is currently contributing to the World Health Organisation International Electromagnetic Fields Project which includes health effects of electromagnetic fields and is funding studies investigating possible biological effects from EMF generally. A three year study in the UK of occupational exposure to radiofrequency fields, including those from TV and radio transmitters, was launched in November 1998. The Department is supporting this study.
<P>

<a name="90727w22.htm_para7">We recently announced a working group, chaired by Sir William Stewart FRS FRSE, to assess the current state of research into the health implications of mobile telephones usage. Further details of the group will be announced shortly.

 Prohibited weapons may not be possessed without the express authority of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department. During the passage of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 through Parliament, it was agreed that provision could be made for competitors in pistol events in major competitions such as the Olympics or Commonwealth Games to be granted temporary authority to allow them to bring their pistols into the country for the duration of the event. Indeed, the European Police Pistol Championships were held in this country shortly after the prohibition on handguns took effect, and I understand the arrangements worked smoothly and no problems were experienced by any of the competitors.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport which organisations applied to hold meetings in Trafalgar Square, London on 18 July; in what order the applications were received; which organisation held a meeting on 18 July at Trafalgar Square; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w25.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 July 1999]:</i> The Turkish Cypriot Network (TCN) and the National Federation of Greek Cypriots (NFGC) made requests by telephone some time ago to use Trafalgar Square on 18 July and the NFGC by letter on 4 January. Both organisations were advised that the normal practice is to consider applications no more than 3 months in advance and that they should re-apply at that time.
<P>

<a name="90727w25.htm_para0">The TCN applied to hold a party and were invited on 20 April to submit details of their intentions: these were submitted on 30 April and permission was refused on 7 May since the proposed celebrations were inappropriate to and out of scale with Trafalgar Square. On 3 May the NFGC sent by facsimile a copy of a letter dated 18 April seeking approval to hold a rally in Trafalgar Square with speeches; similar rallies have been held in Trafalgar Square by this group for a number of years.
<P>

<a name="90727w25.htm_para1">The TCN submitted a revised proposal on 12 May. Two other requests to use Trafalgar Square on 18 July were made during this period, but no details were given and no reply received to the Department's request for further information.

<P>

<a name="90727w25.htm_para2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's judgment was that the proposal from the NFGC of 7 May was the first which constituted an application for an event suitable for Trafalgar Square and he noted that such an event had taken place in previous years: this application therefore received consent. The TCN were invited to consider alternative venues for their event. A march from Marble Arch to Belgrave Square, which we understand TCN attended, was held by the British Council of Turkish Cypriot Associations on 18 July.

 I have approved new operational guidelines on the use of baton rounds, which will be issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers, replacing current Home Office guidance. These will come into force on 1 August 1999. With the agreement of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the guidelines will apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.




<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 247</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90727w25.htm_para5">The new guidelines will clarify that baton rounds may be used where other methods of policing to restore order have been tried and failed or are likely to fail; and there is a risk of loss of life or serious injury arising from serious public disorder; or a risk of serious and substantial damage to property which gives rise to a risk of loss of life or serious injury. The new guidelines clarify that, in assessing the risk of loss of life or serious injury occurring, account should be taken of the risk to police officers and members of the emergency services as well as to members of the public and others. The revised guidelines place the use of baton rounds within the current command and control structure for dealing with serious public disorder and other critical incidents.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on charging for Home Office travel documents.  [93899]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w26.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Home Office has issued travel documents to refugees, stateless persons and some other third country nationals for many years. This service has always been subject to the payment of a fee. These travel documents are issued under the Royal Prerogative, but there is no specific legal power for the taking of fees in connection with such documents. The Home Office first received legal advice raising questions about the legal basis for charges and advising that specific powers should be taken to charge for these documents on 9 February 1999. I have, therefore, decided that it would be right for applications outstanding on that date to be processed free of charge, as will applications received between that date and the date on which new fees regulations are made. These applicants need take no action. Refunds, where appropriate, will be offered automatically by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, although it is likely to be some months before all applicants receive their refunds.
<P>

<a name="90727w26.htm_para0">Until 31 December 1993, refunds were made to all applicants whose applications for a travel document were refused. Since then, the practice has been to charge for processing applications, whether or not a document is issued. It is not proposed to offer refunds to applicants whose cases were completed before 9 February 1999, who were charged in good faith and who received the document for which they applied. But there are an estimated 1,500 applicants who received neither a travel document, because their application was refused, nor a refund, because their application was determined after 31 December 1993. It is proposed to offer refunds to such applicants provided they apply before 30 November 1999. It is, however, not possible to identify such applications from Home Office records and we are inviting those immigration advisers who are members of the Immigration and Nationality User Panel to help to trace those who may be eligible for a refund.
<P>

<a name="90727w26.htm_para1">An information line has been established which gives more detail about eligibility for refunds, how to apply if necessary, and how refunds will be made. The number of the information line is 020 8681 5615. Information is also being placed on the Immigration and Nationality internet website--www.homeoffice.gov.uk./ind/hpg.htm.
<P>

<a name="90727w26.htm_para2">In the light of the legal advice which has been received, I have decided that it would be right to put beyond doubt the power to levy fees in connection with Home Office travel documents. A new clause to this effect will 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 249</I><P>
accordingly be brought forward to the Immigration and Asylum Bill, which is currently before the House of Lords. The clause will be retrospective--it will have the effect of making charges imposed by the Home Office in the past, in connection with travel documents, lawful.
<P>

<a name="90727w26.htm_para3">In the meantime, there is an enabling power in the Finance Act 1973 to charge for services provided by the Government pursuant to any international treaty to which the United Kingdom is a party. This would cover documents issued to refugees and stateless persons in accordance with the relevant United Nations Conventions, although not other types of travel document. I have decided to exercise these powers pending the enactment of wider powers in the Immigration and Asylum Bill. When the Bill has received Royal Assent, regulations will be made covering fees for the full range of travel documents.

<a name="90727w26.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 An update on the impact of the National Lottery on the horserace betting levy has been published today and copies have been placed in the Library. This fulfils an undertaking made during the passage of the National Lottery Bill.
<P>

<a name="90727w26.htm_para4">The paper, which has been prepared by the Economics and Resource Analysis Unit of the Home Office, examines continuing trends in off-course betting expenditure, on which the levy is closely dependent.
<P>

<a name="90727w26.htm_para5">The statistical analysis suggests that, in 1998, approximately &#163;1.1 billion was diverted from off-course betting expenditure as a direct result of the National Lottery. This equates to off-course betting expenditure being about 13.2 per cent. below the level it would have reached in the absence of the Lottery. Horserace betting accounts for about 69 per cent. of off-course betting expenditure and, therefore, the levy yield is likely to have been similarly affected. This can be only an approximate figure, and the effect of the Lottery may vary over time.

 The local authority secure estate is used both to accommodate any child who is being looked after by the local authority under the Children Act 1989, and to hold those who are sentenced under section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, those sentenced to a secure training order under section 1 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 and those who are held on secure remand. Since 1994, the number of approved secure places, those children accommodated and the occupancy rate of secure units available <sup>1</sup>  in England and Wales <sup>2</sup>  (as at 31 March) is given in the table:

Where a court remands a child or young person to local authority secure accommodation, it must designate a relevant local authority. Under section 23(4) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, there is a requirement on the court to consult the designated local authority before it imposes a security requirement. The purpose of such consultation is to allow the local authority to provide the court with information so that the court is best placed to make an appropriate decision depending on the circumstances of the case. Such information should include the nature and availability of local provision to support a remand in the community, and the nature and availability of secure and non-secure local authority accommodation. Where the court then remands a child or young person to local authority secure accommodation, the designated local authority is under a duty under section 61 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 to comply with the security requirement.

 The Prison Service is in the process of developing its 'Nature of Adolescence' training for staff who work with young people in custody. This work is being carried out in collaboration with the Trust for the Study of Adolescence. Separately, the Youth Justice Board has begun tendering for the provision of training for all staff who work in the youth justice system, which will make with special provision for those who work in secure facilities. This is to support the implementation of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, and the delivery of the principal aim of the youth justice system which is to prevent offending by children and young people.

<a name="90727w27.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The availability of the fast-track service operated by the Public Caller Unit (PCU) at the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) is normally determined by the category of application rather than the nationality of the applicant, as well as by the individual facts of each case. The only exception to general policy is in respect of North Korean and Libyan nationals. However, in the light of the recent resumption of diplomatic relations with Libya, we are in the process of reviewing our policy towards Libyan nationals. In recent months, because of pressures resulting from the major changes which have taken place in IND, the PCU fast-track service has had to be restricted and occasionally suspended altogether.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what strategies he is planning to ensure that the Immigration and Nationality Directorate is able to cope with the forecast increase in applications for naturalisation expected 12 months after the granting of indefinite leave to remain to refugees and those affected by the backlog clearance programme, without lengthening current waiting periods.  [93336]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w27.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 No increase in applications for naturalisation resulting from output elsewhere in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate is expected imminently. By the time these applications start to reach

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if the Ministerial Group on the Family will consider the effect of the immigration rules and the nationality legislation on families with members abroad.  [93454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w27.htm_spnew12"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 In "Supporting Families: summary of responses to the consultation document", published on 8 June 1999, we said that the Ministerial Group on the Family is working on five new initiatives; support for boys, young men and fathers; supporting stepfamilies; adoption policy and practice; the support available to families at different crisis points; and ensuring that Government funding for families fits together well. Given the existing priorities of the group, it has no plans to look into the effect of immigration rules and nationality legislation on families with members abroad at present.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w27.htm_wqn13"><B> Fiona Mactaggart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to review the funding of immigration advice under section 23 of the Immigration Act 1971.  [93452]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w27.htm_spnew13"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Subject to the approval of Parliament, funding for advice, assistance and representation will be available through legal aid from January 2000. In due course, when we have had the opportunity to assess the true level of need for immigration advice, we will consider whether funding under section 23 should be transferred from the Home Office to the Lord Chancellor's Department.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w27.htm_wqn14"><B> Fiona Mactaggart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to curtail the use of prison accommodation for those detained solely under Immigration Act powers; and by what date he expects to cease to use prison accommodation.  [93516]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w27.htm_spnew14"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Government are committed, as resources become available, to the pursuit of a strategy of detaining those detained soley under Immigration Act 1971 powers in dedicated detention centres and holding centres, not prisons. Key to this strategy is the replacement of the Harmondsworth centre and the use of Her Majesty's Prison Rochester by two larger, purpose designed centres at Heathrow and Aldington. These facilities are expected to be available by the spring of 2002 and will offer an increase of some 250 beds. There are more immediate plans to provide a dedicated centre in the North of England for about 150 detainees within the next six to nine months. This will reduce the ad hoc use of prisons. In order that this can be delivered quickly, it is likely to be provided and managed by the Prison Service. It will however be a self contained, discrete unit solely for the use of Immigration Act detainees.
<P>

<a name="90727w27.htm_para4">This strategy will ensure a net gain of about 300-350 detention places by 2002 and will greatly reduce the use of prison accommodation. However the Government accept that there will always be a need to use prisons for a minority of detainees, due to their special requirements, and this practice will continue. The number of such detainees detained in prison accommodation by 2002 is expected to be minimal.

 Aviation security is the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR). I am, however, advised that the Transport Security (Aviation) section of the DETR maintains a voluntary reporting system of aviation security incidents at airports, but the information does not categorise incidents of this kind. Similarly, the Immigration Service does not hold information about immigration offences in the form requested.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many decisions to deport, pursuant to section 3(5)(a) Immigration Act 1971 have been taken, in the past 12 months for (i) failure to report to a medical officer, (ii) failure to support and accommodate without recourse to public funds, (iii) obtaining leave to enter by deception, (iv) obtaining 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 260</I><P>
leave to remain by deception, (v) assisting the entry of another person an illegal entrant and (vi) assisting the entry of another person as an asylum claimant.  [93334]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w27.htm_spnew19"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 3,930 decisions to deport were taken under section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 in 1998. 210 of these were for breach of conditions but the records do not show the nature of the conditions which had not been compiled with. It is, therefore, not possible to identify whether any of this latter group of decisions were taken for either of the first two reasons listed in the question other than by examining the individual case files.
<P>

<a name="90727w27.htm_para6">Someone who obtains leave to enter by deception is an illegal entrant and would not be subject to deportation action under section 3(5)(a). Someone who obtains leave to remain by deception is currently liable to deportation under section 3(5)(aa) of the Act. No more than five decisions to deport were taken under that section in 1998.
<P>

<a name="90727w27.htm_para7">It is extremely unlikely that someone who had assisted the entry of an illegal entrant or an asylum claimant contrary to section 25(1) of the Act would be subject to deportation under section 3(5)(a). In those circumstances, deportation action under either section 3(5)(b) or, where applicable, section 3(6) of the 1971 Act would be more appropriate. 120 decisions to deport were taken under section 3(5)(b) in 1998 and 340 people were recommended for deportation by a court in that year, but again records are not sufficiently detailed to show whether or not the decision was taken for one or other of the last two reasons listed in the question and this information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examining each individual case file.

This includes, for example, Parentline, a national helpline for parents, and funding for Fathers

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many drug seizures occurred in each of the last three years per region; and what was the estimated value of the drugs.  [92888]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w28.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Regional data relating to drug seizure numbers and value are not available because relevant information from the Regional Crime Squads, Her Majesty's Customs and Excise and British Transport Police cannot be disaggregated into regions. These three authorities contributed nearly three-quarters of total seizures by weight, and therefore value in the United Kingdom in 1997.

<P>
<a name="90727w28.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 I have no plans for police patrol or any other police functions to be carried out by the private security industry, except that we have proposed that the escorting of certain abnormal loads should, in future, be carried out by the private sector. Representatives of the police and other bodies have raised many matters in discussions, but neither I nor my Ministerial colleagues have proposed any changes to responsibility for police patrolling. No Ministerial committees or Working Groups are currently examining any such proposals.

 Information as to the age of offenders is available only for those cautioned or convicted. The average age cannot be calculated exactly from data on the Home Office Cautions and Court Proceedings databases, but the median age in 1997 for violent offence was 23 years, for property offences it was 22 years; and for sex offences it was 33 years. The table shows the number of persons cautioned or convicted from which the median age has been derived.

Because of difficulties encountered at the first two offices (Liverpool and Newport) to change over to the new system, further roll out has been postponed.

Following performance improvements, the level of penalties imposed on contractors has decreased substantially.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the accuracy of police stop and search statistics; and if he will make a statement.  [92889]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w29.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Police forces submit statistics on the number of recorded stops and searches under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) annually to the Home Office. These are published in 'Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System', a copy of which is available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90727w29.htm_para0">The Government accept that there is likely to be a disparity between the number of stops and searches made by the police under the PACE and the number of stops and searches recorded by police officers. Home Office research 'Ethnic Monitoring in police forces: A beginning' (FitzGerald and Sibbitt 1997) noted variations in the recorded use of stop and search under PACE in different police areas, with the possibility that under- recording is higher in the provincial forces than in the Metropolitan Police Service.
<P>

<a name="90727w29.htm_para1">There is also likely to be a higher public perception of stops given that most people do not distinguish between voluntary non-recorded stops, and stops carried out under PACE which should be recorded.

<a name="90727w29.htm_para2">The Stephen Lawrence report recommended that a record be made of all stops and stops and searches, including "voluntary" stops. The Home Office is considering further this recommendation and has commissioned research to gather information on current practices within forces with a view to testing the practical implications of the Inquiry's recommendations. The Metropolitan Police Service has been running its own pilot projects to help develop a plan to manage the tactic fairly and effectively. The Home Office will work with the Metropolitan Police Service in testing the Stephen Lawrence Report's recommendations.

[93606]<P>

<P>
<a name="90727w29.htm_spnew3"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police has provided the following summary of information on stop and search for the years 1994-1998 for Edmonton and Enfield Police Divisions. The Divisions make up an area which equates to the London Borough of Enfield plus Cheshunt (Hertfordshire) to the North.

The Presidency has, however, indicated its intention to make such dates available on its Presidency website.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department on how many occasions in the past 12 months for which records are available the recommended period, in respect of persons held under Immigration Act powers, of five days in policy custody was exceeded by <i>(a)</i> extending, <i>(b)</i> renewing and <i>(c)</i> transferring a detainee from one station to another.

 The Immigration (Places of Detention) Direction 1996 specifies that an individual may be detained in a police station for a maximum of five nights with an additional two nights only where Removal Directions have been set.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) on how many occasions his Department has issued consent certificates to remove the rule of specialty in respect of extradition proceedings where consent was granted to <i>(a)</i> the Irish Republic and <i>(b)</i> other countries which have extradition treaties with the United Kingdom;  [92949]

<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w31.htm_spnew2"><B> Kate Hoey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 July 1999]:</i> It is very rare to depart from the rule of specialty in respect of extradition proceedings. Formal certification to waive the rule is only required in relation to our extradition arrangements with Ireland, where in recent years just two such certificates have been issued.
<P>

<a name="90727w31.htm_para1">In one of these cases, the offence for which specialty was waived related to a suspected murder. In this case, the Irish authorities knew of the offence at the time of the request, but had insufficient information to include it with other lesser offences listed in the request for the individual's return. In the other case, the waiver certificate is currently subject to court proceedings, and so I cannot comment as the matter is sub judice.
<P>

<a name="90727w31.htm_para2">Figures relating to other countries are not recorded. Officials estimate that there have been three or four specialty waivers in the past three years, but exact numbers, and the reasons for them, could only be obtained with disproportionate cost.

 The criteria for waiving charges are contained in Appendix A of the publication entitled "Charging Procedures. A Guide for Carriers", commonly known as the "Green Guide", a copy of which is in the Library. In addition, charges are normally waived in respect of passengers arriving without documents from stations with Approved Gate Check (AGC) Status. The criteria for AGC status are contained in section 7 of the "Green Guide". Charges are also waived in respect of inadequately documented passengers who are granted full refugee status in accordance with the 1951 United Nations Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the status of refugees, as described in section 5 of the "Green Guide". Charges are also not imposed where a false document is produced unless the falsity of the document is reasonably apparent nor where a carrier is able to show that the required documents were produced to them when the passenger embarked for the United Kingdom.

 In Great Britain, lists of tendered votes issued at general elections are retained by the Clerk of the Crown and, unless ordered by the House of Commons or the High Court, are destroyed after 12 months. Lists compiled at the European Parliamentary elections are retained by the local returning officer for 12 months and lists compiled at local elections are retained by the proper officer of the authority for six months and then, unless directed by order, respectively, of the High Court, or a county court or election court, are destroyed. The lists of tendered votes for the 1997 and 1998 elections are thus no longer available but those for the 1999 elections are available locally for inspection.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent question asking if staff in the Benefits Agency aged 60 or over are allowed to continue in employment on a year to year basis until the age of 65.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Retirement age in the Department of Social Security was restored to age 60 for all staff with effect from 31 July 1998. However, the policy provides for retention of staff for business reasons for periods of 12 months at a time until the age of 65 for administrative grades and until 62 for junior managers. Middle managers and above are required to retire at age 60.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The availability of the facility for retention beyond age 60 is reviewed annually and is dependent upon the projected staffing requirements; staff are currently able to be retained until 31 July 2000.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The WPA is committee to reducing the processing times and this was why I commissioned the review of the Decision Making and Appeals Process.

The team is testing the feasibility, implications, timing and costs of implementing the recommendations. They are specifying and proposing in greater detail what is required to take forward the changes necessary to improve the service we provide. As the Senior Accountable Official, I am chairing a Steering Group which includes the DSS Policy Manager and the Chief Medical Adviser.

Some changes, which are IT related, will need more careful consideration, including the funding and business case aspects. Others, in particular those involving matters of policy, will need much wider consultation with stakeholders and interested parties to assess the impact and to canvass opinion.</FONT></UL>

<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 298</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Each year the Benefit Agency (BA) brings forward the production of order books, Girocheques and Automated Credit Transfers (payment directly to bank accounts) so that people receiving direct and manual payments of benefits can have their money in advance for holiday periods when Banks and Post Offices are closed. These arrangements will again be made for people in receipt of all BA benefits, including disability benefits, for the forthcoming Christmas and New Year period.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Throughout the year, the BA has continuity planning arrangements in place which could involve manual payments being implemented where problems such as postal disruption are anticipated. In the most vulnerable cases, such payments could be issued to the customer in the office the same day. The BA will also consider sending a visiting officer to those who are unable to attend the office.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Over the Christmas and New Year period BA local offices will be open on 24, 29 and 30 December, and 4 January (except in Scotland, where offices return to normal working hours on 5 January). Working hours will be advertised in the local office.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The BA also provides an out of hours service (OOHS) to help customers who find themselves in particular need outside normal office hours. On weekdays this service operates until at least 20.00 hours. At weekends and on statutory holidays, it will operate for at least six hours daily, normally between 9.00 and 20.00 hours. Contact with the OOHS is normally made through the social services or police who liaise with a central emergency officer through a telephone message service. The officer then considers the individual person's needs in consultation with outside agencies.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition, the BA has been aware for some time of the issues which my arise as a result of the Year 2000 date change. A full programme of work was established in 1996. Most of the major mainframe systems (the benefit payment computer systems) hold their dates in a way which is largely unaffected by the Year 2000 problem. Nevertheless, a full regime of checking has taken place and all benefit payment systems are now full year 2000 compliant.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Interfaces with external computer systems, including the systems which pay benefits directly to bank accounts (BACS), have been rigorously tested, or plans are in place to do so. An intensive testing process is also under way on our major benefit paying systems to provide additional assurances. For example, BA has recently concluded a business confidence review of Job Seekers Allowance and Income Support that did not identify any risks of material disruption to payment of benefits.</FONT></UL>

1. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred and displayed as thousands. Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number.<P>

2. Estimates are based on a 5 per cent. sample of all Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance claimants and will therefore be subject to a degree of sampling error eg the true population value for an estimate of 2,000 could lie within the range of approximately 1,500 to 2,500.<P>

3. Children are defined as dependants aged 15 years old and less.<P>

4. Adults refer to all adult beneficiaries of Income Support or Jobseeker's Allowance i.e. Claimants, partners and dependants aged 16 years old and over.<P>

5. Cases are allocated to the Local Authority Districts by matching postcodes against the 1999 version 1 of the Postcode Directory.<P>

6. Cases were allocated to Edmonton Constituency by matching postcodes against the 1999 version 1 of the Postcode Directory and as such represent Constituency boundaries as at May 1997.<P>

7. Estimates for Jobseeker's Allowance include income-based, contribution-based Jobseeker's Allowance and cases where nil benefit is in payment.<P>

8. Population estimates used in the percentage calculation were taken from the Office for National Statistics mid year estimates for 1997.<P>

9. It has not been possible to provide an estimate of the percentage of the population in the Edmonton constituency area who are beneficiaries of either Income Support or Jobseeker's Allowance. Instead, data has been provided for Enfield Local Authority.<P>

10. Estimates for the United Kingdom can not be provided as requested, as social security in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, but Great Britain totals have been supplied.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w37.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Rapson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when he intends to introduce the benefit run-on for lone parents starting work; what effect this will have on the housing benefit and council tax benefit extended payments scheme; and if he will make a statement.  [93901]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w37.htm_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The lone parent's benefit run-on will give extra help, and financial security, to lone parents during the transition from welfare to work. It will allow lone parents who have been getting Income Support (IS) or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance for at least six months to be paid IS for their first two weeks in work, provided that work is expected to last at least five weeks. We expect more than 100,000 lone parents to benefit from the run-on in a full year (about 5,000 at a point in time), at a cost of between &#163;15 million and &#163;25 million.
<P>

<a name="90727w37.htm_para1">We also intend to make consequential changes to the Housing Benefit (HB) and Council Tax Benefit (CTB) extended payment schemes. At present, these schemes give four extra weeks HB and/or CTB to a number of groups--including lone parents--moving from income- related benefits to work, provided they claim it. Lone parents getting the IS benefit run-on will automatically retain entitlement to maximum HB/CTB during the run-on period, and will then receive extended payments for the next two weeks without the need for a separate claim. This should ensure that they continue to receive maximum HB/CTB for the first four weeks of work.
<P>

<a name="90727w37.htm_para2">The benefit run-on complements other aspects of welfare-to-work policies, in particular the New Deal for lone parents. It is a positive response to concerns that the abrupt withdrawal of what has been a regular income, 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 300</I><P>
the gap between starting work and receiving wages and the wait for in-work benefits can combine to form a barrier to making the move into work. These concerns can be particularly acute for lone parents, who often have to meet child care costs in advance.
<P>

<a name="90727w37.htm_para3">We are also taking this opportunity to broaden the scope of the HB/CTB extended payments scheme to include sick and disabled people moving from income-related benefits into work. This will benefit an estimated 22,000 people a year at an annual cost of &#163;3 million.
<P>

<a name="90727w37.htm_para4">Draft regulations have been referred to the Social Security Advisory Committee and consultation with representatives of Local Authority Associations is under way. Following this, we plan to lay the regulations during September to bring the scheme into place in October to coincide with the introduction of Working Families Tax Credit.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w38.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 To date there have been 110 parliamentary questions arising from the implementation of the new National Insurance Recording System (NIRS2). Between 1 June 1998 and 31 March 1999 the Secretary of State for Social Security received 87 parliamentary questions. Since 1 April 1999 a further 23 have been received of which 11 were transferred to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>

<a name="90727w38.htm_para16">There have been 240 letters specifically relating to NIRS2 of which 85 were received by Ministers, 73 by the Benefits Agency and 82 by the former Contributions Agency.
<P>

<a name="90727w38.htm_para17">Between 1 April 1998 and 31 March 1999 752 letters were received with queries about the rates of Retirement Pension, 366 were addressed to Ministers and 386 to the Benefits Agency. Some of these will relate to the implementation of NIRS2.
<P>

<a name="90727w38.htm_para18">Information about the numbers of complaints, received at local benefit offices, arising from the NIRS2 computer system, is not available. However, the Benefits Agency has completed over 13,600 clerical calculations of Retirement Pension and Widows Benefits.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the written answer I gave to the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) on 22 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>575-76</i>.
<P>

<a name="90727w38.htm_para19">It is estimated that there were up to 285,000 pensioners affected by the NIRS2 problems who therefore potentially may have been underpaid at retirement date.
<P>

<a name="90727w38.htm_para20">Contingency arrangements were put in place to minimise the effect on customers claiming Incapacity Benefit, Maternity Benefit, Jobseeker's Allowance, Retirement Pension and Widows Benefit. These arrangements included

making emergency payments to people claiming Retirement Pension and Widows Benefits where information was not available, interim payments of Jobseeker's Allowance and payment of some Incapacity Benefit claims based on information provided by the customer. Parliament was kept informed of the arrangements.
<P>

<a name="90727w38.htm_para21">In order to provide adequate protection for the public purse, those who receive payments under emergency procedures are required to sign an undertaking to repay benefit where subsequent inquiries show that the amount due was less than the amount paid. This procedure has been followed in the case of the payments made as a result of the NIRS2 problems and recovery of any overpayments will be pursued in accordance with laid down procedures. Early figures from the Benefits Agency's work on reviewing affected cases indicates that overpayments have occurred in only a very small proportion of those examined. In addition, I have instructed the Benefits Agency to ensure that cases are dealt with as sensitively as possible and with full regard to the individual's circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w38.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The All Work Test is an objective test of the effects of illness or disability on functional capacity, which assesses whether a person reaches the level of incapacity at which they are not required to work, or seek work, as a condition for receiving social security benefits. 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 303</I><P>
Full account is taken of factors such as pain, fatigue and the ability to repeat an activity reliably and safely. Doctors and decision makers are required to look at what a person is able to do over a period of time, not just at the time of a medical examination.
<P>

<a name="90727w38.htm_para22">ME, also known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or post viral fatigue disease, is a complex and widely variable condition and each case needs to be assessed on individual findings. The Department's Chief Medical Adviser issues guidance to examining doctors and ensures that guidance and training is reviewed in the light of the latest developments in the understanding of ME.
<P>

<a name="90727w38.htm_para23">The Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill replaces the All Work Test with the Personal Capability Assessment. The criteria for entitlement to benefit, and the way in which entitlement decisions are reached, will not change but the new assessment will also provide information on what individuals are able to do despite their illness or disability and medical advice on practical measures which might help them return to work. For conditions such as ME, this will include information about, for example, the ability to sustain activities and the effects of stress and of fluctuation in the condition.

<a name="90727w39.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Since July 1998, the Government have been working on the detail of its proposals for the reform of utility regulation. This further work has resulted in the modification of some of the proposals.
<P>

<a name="90727w39.htm_para8">First, the Government originally concluded that, for the energy and telecommunications sectors, individual regulators should be replaced with full-time executive boards composed of a chairman and two others. In the light of further analysis, the Government have decided that Ministers should be able to appoint any number of board members, who may be full or part-time, and executive or non-executive, so that the size and composition of each regulatory board meets the requirements of each office, and can change, over time, in response to developments. For the water sector, where the demands and pressures on the regulator are somewhat different from the other sectors, the Government now intend to retain the existing provision for an individual regulator. However, the Government intend to introduce a provision requiring the individual regulator to be supported by an advisory panel appointed by Ministers.
<P>

<a name="90727w39.htm_para9">Second, the Government originally concluded that they would introduce legislation to extend to all regulators powers of the type held by the gas regulator to impose 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 307</I><P>
monetary penalties for breach of overall and individual service standards. Those powers related only to current and likely future breaches of licence conditions and other relevant requirements. They would not, as currently drafted, allow the imposition of penalties in relation to breaches, however serious, which were discontinued by the company when an enforcement notice was issued, or which ceased before enforcement action could be taken. This significantly weakens the effectiveness of monetary penalties as an enforcement mechanism. The Government now intend, therefore, to give regulators powers to impose penalties for past as well as for continuing breaches of licence conditions and other statutory requirements (but not including breaches committed before the legislation to introduce the powers is enacted). These powers will not extend to likely future breaches. Similar powers have recently been proposed for the Strategic Rail Authority.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w39.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I have today granted consent under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 to Scottish Power plc for construction of a 60 MW gas-fired Combined Heat and Power station at the Sappi paper mill at Feniscowles, near Blackburn, Lancashire. The station has also today been given clearance as a gas-fired station under Section 14 of the Energy Act 1976 and planning permission has been deemed to be granted, subject to 52 planning conditions agreed with the Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council and Lancashire County Council. The decisions have been taken in accordance with the policy set out in the White Paper entitled "Conclusions of the Review of Energy Sources for Power Generation and Government response to fourth and fifth Reports of the Trade and Industry Committee" (Cm 4071).

 The Government are fully committed to introduction of the Limited Liability Partnerships Bill as soon as possible. I am aware that the professional business community are keen to see progress on this, and I can assure them that the Bill will be introduced as soon as the Parliamentary timetable permits. To assist business, and to enable them to see the Bill as we expect it to come before the House, we will publish it in draft for a second time shortly, alongside revised draft regulations, which are being published to show changes made as a result of consultation last September.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to his reply on 19 April 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>456</i>, what measures have been instigated 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 308</I><P>
by his Department to ensure that they provide accurate information about the export of tear gas and other riot control equipment.  [93522]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w40.htm_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 As noted in my earlier answer, the export of tear gas is controlled under a variety of entries in the legislation, depending whether it is bulk tear gas or tear gas incorporated in any of a range of possible devices. The term riot control equipment could describe a wide range of items and, as noted in the answer of 23 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>76</i>, to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett), several of the entries in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order (the so-called Military List) might be capable of playing some role in riot control.
<P>

<a name="90727w40.htm_para0">In her answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) on 30 October 1997, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>870-71</i>, my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche) explained that, because of the problems that had been identified with the Export Control Organisation's databases, all information relying on data derived from those databases and given in response to Parliamentary Questions or in correspondence should be read in conjunction with a caveat set out in her answer.
<P>

<a name="90727w40.htm_para1">However, the information on export licensing decisions between 2 May and 31 December 1997 set out in the Government's Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls, which includes a summary description of all military equipment licensed for export during this period as well as the ratings of the goods concerned, is not subject to the caveat set out in my hon. Friend's answer of 30 October 1997, notwithstanding that it relied on data obtained from the Export Control Organisation's databases. On the contrary, as stated in the Annual Report, the information
<P>

<a name="90727w40.htm_para2"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may be treated as definitive subject to the constraint that there is always a risk of human error in the compilation of such a large body of data".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90727w40.htm_para3">Furthermore, as noted in my hon. Friend's answer of 30 October 1997, among the steps taken to improve the situation she described was the decision to develop a new database for recording information about standard individual export licences. This database became operational on 1 March 1999 and will be used to supply information for future Reports. Because the database allows for information to be accepted and transferred electronically, it will be easier for exporters to submit their licence applications and it will greatly enhance the integrity of the data, although human error can never be eliminated altogether.
<P>

<a name="90727w40.htm_para4">Finally, I should note that the information on physical exports of military equipment from the UK included in the Annual Report was in part supplied by HM Customs and Excise and in part based on information provided for the UK's contribution to the UN Arms Register; the Export Control Organisation does not compile records of licensed exports.

 The export to any destination of leg-irons, gangchains and shackles, specially designed for restraining human beings, excluding handcuffs the maximum overall dimension of which when locked does not exceed 240mm, are controlled under entry PL5001 in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, as amended.
<P>

<a name="90727w40.htm_para5">In accordance with their policy requirements, as determined by them, applications for a licence to export handcuffs controlled under this entry are circulated to the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for advice in light of the Foreign Secretary's announcement on 28 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>65-66</i>.

 Production equipment and technology, components and sub-assemblies whose export from the UK is subject to control are set out under a range of headings in the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, as amended, and the Dual-Use and Related Goods (Export Control) Regulations 1996, as amended, and Council Decision 94/942/CFSP, as amended (which has effect through Council Regulation (EC) 3381/94). While a valid export licence is needed for the export of controlled goods or technology, exporters are not required to obtain one before they conclude an agreement for production overseas.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what practical research projects he has commissioned into solar energy; what discussions he has had with his counterparts in (i) Japan and (ii) Germany on this subject; and if he will make a statement.  [92277]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w41.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 My Department has had a solar energy R&D programme for a number of years, as part of the New and Renewable Energy Programme. The budget for the photovoltaics (PV) element has doubled from &#163;0.5 million to &#163;1 million over the past 2 years.
<P>

<a name="90727w41.htm_para2">The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) has also run a significant photovoltaics R&D programme, with a budget of &#163;1 million per annum for the past four years. PV is now included in the EPSRC's new &#163;3.5 million per annum programme on Renewable and New Energy Technologies.
<P>

<a name="90727w41.htm_para3">In addition, the Foresight S<i>c</i>olar Programme, which aims to put PV systems onto 100 schools and colleges across the country by 2000, is receiving funding from Government for &#163;1 million of the total &#163;2.5 million costs.
<P>

<a name="90727w41.htm_para4">In my speech at the Manchester DTI/EPSRC PV Conference on 17 February, I announced three major new PV initiatives:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a) a call for proposals for the development of PV components and systems, with the aim of enhancing the competitiveness of UK companies;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>b) a field trial for at least 100 homes across the country to test a variety of actual PV installations under UK conditions;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>c) development of a scheme to demonstrate the use of PV in large-scale commercial building applications.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90727w41.htm_para5">The total value of these three initiatives is expected to be &#163;15 million, with &#163;5 million coming from the DTI. In the case of the demonstration scheme the final go-ahead will have to await the outcome of the Renewables Review.
<P>

<a name="90727w41.htm_para6">The subject of solar energy has not arisen in recent discussions with my counterparts in Japan and Germany, but our embassies in those and other countries keep my officials regularly updated on their programmes in this area.

<P>
<a name="90727w42.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list the codes of practice which he regards as unsatisfactory and which his Consumer White Paper refer to as little more than sales devices.  [93369]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w42.htm_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 No. There is currently a wide spectrum of codes ranging from the comprehensive and effective, through those which are well intentioned but do not work as well as they could, to those which exist as adjuncts to seemingly legitimate logos but have no practical effect. The Director General of Fair Trading has no power to disapprove codes at present, merely to encourage the preparation and dissemination of consumer codes. The Consumer White Paper "Modern Markets: Confident Consumers" (Cm 4410) proposes to give the OFT a power to give a seal of approval to codes that put the core principles into effect so that consumers, including those with poor literacy skills or who do not speak English, can see at a glance which codes are satisfactory; and that OFT will publicise decisions to approve or reject codes.

 The MMC concluded that Milk Marque's planned increase in its milk processing capacity may be expected to operate against the public interest, by enhancing its ability to exploit its monopoly power. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State concluded that, while Milk Marque remained a monopoly supplier of raw milk to the processing sector, it should not be allowed to extend its milk processing activities in this way. The Secretary of State therefore asked the Director General of Fair Trading to seek undertakings from Milk Marque that it would not take any further steps towards making or carrying out any agreement to acquire or build a processing plant without the prior agreement of the Director General, as the MMC recommended.

 The Department receives frequent correspondence from members of the public regarding different aspects of conditions of employment for temporary workers.
<P>

<a name="90727w43.htm_para0">The Employment Relations Bill, currently before Parliament, will abolish provisions which currently allow employees working under specified fixed term contracts to waive their right to claim unfair dismissal at the end of the term.

 Temporary workers will benefit in the same way as those on indefinite contracts from the range of improved employment conditions we have introduced. The Working Time Regulations 1998 provide protection for workers from long working hours and the right to rest and paid leave; the qualifying period for general unfair dismissal claims has recently been reduced from two years to one; and the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, which took effect on 1 April, sets minimum wage rates for workers aged 18 or over. We are also consulting on updated regulations to protect the interests of those finding work through employment agencies. Proposals in the Employment Relations Bill, now in Parliament, will ensure that employees working under fixed term contracts cannot waive their right to claim unfair dismissal at the end of the term.

On 5 June 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>385</i>, I announced that UKAEA would not accept any new contracts for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel at Dounreay, so there are no contracts under negotiation with Spain or any other country. Nor does UKAEA have any outstanding contracts with Spain.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w45.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Anthony D. Wright: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he intends to proceed with the proposed public private partnership for National Air Traffic Services Ltd.; and if he will make a statement.  [93540]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w45.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 The Government issued a consultation paper in October 1998 outlining our preferred option for a public private partnership (PPP) for NATS as set out in our White Paper on the future of transport. We are grateful to those organisations and individuals who responded to our consultation. Their views have been taken into consideration as part of the policy development process for this PPP.
<P>

<a name="90727w45.htm_para1">NATS' operational strengths, and their safety record, are among the best in the world but they need a wider range of management skills, and access to capital, to meet the challenges of the future, in particular the ever- increasing rise in traffic. The Government want to build on NATS' strengths, bring in new management skills such as project management expertise, improve aviation safety, secure long-term investment of &#163;1 billion over 10 years, including completion of Swanwick and the New Scottish Centre, and retain public accountability in a strategic industry.




<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 327</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90727w45.htm_para2">We have a number of principal objectives for the PPP. These are:
<P>

<a name="90727w45.htm_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to maintain and build upon the excellent record of aviation safety in the UK, which was reflected in the Select Committee's recent report;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90727w45.htm_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to ensure that NATS has adequate funding for investment and to provide it with the commercial freedom to develop its business within a robust framework of economic regulation; and
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90727w45.htm_para5"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to maintain effective civil/military joint working of the national air traffic system for the benefit of all users and to accommodate national needs in crisis, war and emergency.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90727w45.htm_para6">The Government are also keen to ensure that best value is obtained for the taxpayer, that NATS' employees should have the opportunity to acquire an interest in the undertaking in which they are employed and to which they have contributed so much, and to preserve the pension rights of both existing and retired employees.
<P>

<a name="90727w45.htm_para7">The Government have concluded that NATS should be separated from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which will then become the independent, separate safety regulator of air traffic services. This separation will ensure that safety regulation and service provision are undertaken in separate organisations, as the Select Committee has recommended over many years. This will help to maintain and build on some of the most stringent safety standards in the world.
<P>

<a name="90727w45.htm_para8">We intend to effect this new and innovative PPP through the introduction of a strategic partner who will acquire a controlling interest in NATS. The company will then become a New Partnership Company, structured to create a genuine partnership between the public and private sectors and involve the employees, airlines, and other stakeholders in a new Stakeholder Council. Subject to legislation, the PPP could be put in place by the end of the year 2000. Full details of our conclusions thus far are contained in the Government's report on the response to the public consultation, a copy of which has today been placed in the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how the controls on the marketing of genetically modified crops provided for in Part VI of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 are applied in the absence of a marketing consent issued thereunder.  [85951]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w45.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The commercial growing of genetically modified (GM) crops requires specific consents to be issued at the Community level under Directive 90/220/EEC. All member states have an input into this decision-making process. Once an approval has been issued, it may be used throughout the Community, provided any specific conditions on use, or on types of environment and geographical areas for release are complied with.
<P>

<a name="90727w45.htm_para9">The controls on the marketing of GM crops in the UK provided for in Part VI of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 would apply to a consent issued by another member state in the same way as they would to a consent issued by the UK Competent Authority.

<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 328</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w45.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the RSPB's recommendations on the plantation of genetically modified crops.  [87937]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w45.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 July 1999]:</i> My Department takes very seriously the concerns of The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds regarding the commercial planing of genetically modified crops and has actively sought the advice and involvement of RSPB scientists to take forward recent initiatives to address biodiversity issues.
<P>

<a name="90727w45.htm_para10">The RSPB have raised the concern that herbicide tolerant crops will lead to a rise in the use of broad-spectrum herbicides on fields, and that this in turn could decrease biodiversity in the fields and reduce food available to birds. My Department is spending &#163;3.3 million on the 'farm-scale evaluation' research programme to study the effect of the management of GM crops on the abundance and diversity of farmland wildlife. This research programme began earlier this year and will last at least until 2002. The research is being overseen by a scientific steering committee that will ensure the research is scientifically robust. A scientist from the RSPB is present on this committee.
<P>

<a name="90727w45.htm_para11">The RSPB have also raised the concern that the introduction of insect resistant crops could have an unacceptable impact on biodiversity. Again my Department takes these concerns very seriously. In October last year I announced that the industry had agreed not to introduce insect resistant GM crops into commercial agriculture in Britain for three years. Research is in place to ensure that risks posed by these crops to the environment are thoroughly investigated.
<P>

<a name="90727w45.htm_para12">The RSPB note the possibility of GM crops cross-pollinating with wild relatives. Each application for the release of genetically modified crop is supported by a risk assessment, which is evaluated by Government experts and independent scientists on the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE). ACRE consider in detail the potential for each GM crop to cross-pollinate with wild relatives and a GM crop will be granted consent only if ACRE are satisfied that the risks presented are negligible.
<P>

<a name="90727w45.htm_para13">The RSPB hold a wider concern that the introduction of genetically modified crops could lead to landscape changes and/or changes in crop rotations. This potential wider impact of the commercial use of GM crops has been discussed in the recently published paper "The Commercial use of GM crops in the UK: the potential wider impact on farmland wildlife", published by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE). Following publication of this report the remit of ACRE has been widened with the setting up of a sub-group to discuss and advise on the issues raised. This includes representatives of English Nature and the RSPB. The sub-group will review the risk assessment of GMOs to include a greater consideration of the wider biodiversity impacts which have been made possible via the revision of directive 90/220/EEC on the release to the environment of genetically modified organisms.
<P>

<a name="90727w45.htm_para14">We agree with concerns expressed about the wider impacts on wildlife of the large scale introduction of GM crops. Until GM crops are planted on a larger scale, it is 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 329</I><P>
difficult to assess accurately all the effects which they may have on biodiversity. This process must be managed carefully. The Government have therefore reached agreement with the industry on a voluntary code of practice which will strictly limit the first farm-scale plantings and ensure that we are able to monitor any effects on the environment and, in particular, on populations of farmland wildlife and only if no damage has been found to the environment. Full-scale commercial planting will not take place until the results have been carefully assessed. If these results show that particular genetically modified crops harm the environment, we have the powers to withdraw their approvals for commercial planting and we will use them.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w45.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 5 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>367</i>, (1) if he will ensure that no further consents are issued which allow the products of a genetically modified crop trial to enter the food chain; and if he will take steps to establish the fate of the products of genetically modified crop trials where consents were given for them to enter the food chain;  [91251]
<P>
<UL>(2) which company or companies were given consents to use the products of genetically modified crop trials as animal feed in <i>(a)</i> August 1994 and March 1997 in respect of genetically modified oil seed rape and <i>(b)</i> April 1996 in respect of genetically modified maize; what were the locations of these trials; and what information concerning these trials and the consents given to use their products as animal feed was made available to hon. Members and the public, prior to the crops being grown.  [91252]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w45.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 No genetically modified (GM) crops are currently being grown for food, feed or processing in the United Kingdom. Any future applications for material of a GM Crop trial to be used as food or feed would be subject to a scientific assessment of risk carried out on a case-by-case basis.
<P>

<a name="90727w45.htm_para15">The two consents in respect of GM oil seed rape mentioned in my earlier reply had approval for the meal from the trial crop to be used as feed, but the material was not in fact used in this way and did not therefore enter the feed chain. Both consents were issued to Plant Genetic Systems NV and the trials took place at NIAB, Cambridge in 1994-95 and at Inkwell, Bedfordshire in 1997-98.
<P>

<a name="90727w45.htm_para16">The GM maize referred to in my earlier answer has Europe-wide approval under Part C of Council Directive 90/220/EEC for agricultural use leading to animal consumption. The consent for the trial was issued to Sharpes International Seeds Ltd. covering six sites: Boothby Graffoe, Lincolnshire; NIAB, Cambridgeshire, Dartington, Devon; CWS/Gainseed, Cheshire; NIAB, Winchester, Hampshire; and Great Dunmow, Essex. Of these, only material from the site in Cheshire was ensiled to use as animal feed.
<P>

<a name="90727w45.htm_para17">All information on releases of GM crops, apart from that considered commercially confidential as set out in my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith) on 5 May 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>390,</i> is available to the public on request.

The term is not defined in law and each request is considered on merit.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w47.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 do not require employers to differentiate between participants on the New Deal programme and other employees when making a report to the HSE under these regulations. The information is therefore not available.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the responsibility for the measuring and monitoring of noise levels at properties where motorways have been built.  [93203]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w47.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 There is no requirement for noise levels to be monitored after a road has been built. But within six months of the final offers of noise insulation under the legislation applying to new or substantially altered roads, residents living within 300 metres of such a road who had not been offered insulation have an opportunity to appeal for the assessment to be reviewed. In such cases, it is not general practice to undertake noise measurements, but to calculate the statistical level of noise required by the Regulations from the flow of traffic and other relevant factors.

 Following our announcement on 22 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>50-51</i>, of a ring-fenced budget for the Highways Agency to undertake noise mitigation measures in the most serious and pressing cases on existing roads, a large number of locations where concern has been expressed about noise have been assessed against the stated criteria.

There is rarely a loss of separation between aircraft during a reported overload, with only four occasions where a loss of separation was associated with an overload event since 1996.
<P>

<a name="90727w49.htm_para1">Despite a reduction in the number of airproxes recorded in 1998, there was a noticeable increase in the number of overloads reported by controllers at London Air Traffic Control Centre. This was partly due to management encouraging staff to report such incidents so remedial action can be taken.All reports of overload incidents are investigated thoroughly by the Civil Aviation Authority and, wherever possible, action is taken to ensure that the lessons learned are implemented.

 Licences issued by members of the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), other than those restricted to use within the member state issuing them, are subject to indefinite mutual recognition. The holder may use such a licence in the UK subject to the driving licence regulations but otherwise without restriction. There is no requirement to exchange the licence, except where there is a material change in entitlement.
<P>

<a name="90727w51.htm_para0">Licences to drive vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes (cars and small vans) issued by the countries or territories which have been designated by order for recognition may be used for up to one year. After that the holder must exchange the licence for a British equivalent in order to continue driving. Countries designated for this purpose are: Australia, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Canada, Republic of Cyprus, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, Kenya, Malta, New Zealand, Singapore, Republic of South Africa, Switzerland, Zimbabwe.
<P>

<a name="90727w51.htm_para1">Holders of licences to drive larger vehicles from designated countries may only use such licences to drive vehicles which have been temporarily imported, but they must pass a British driving test for the category of licence if they wish to drive such vehicles permanently in the UK. This restriction on the driving of larger vehicles (whether lorry or passenger carrying) also applies to licences issued by non-designated countries.
<P>

<a name="90727w51.htm_para2">Licences to drive vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes issued by non-designated countries may be used in the UK for up to one year continuously.

[93298]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w51.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) currently funds over 500 (Rounds 1-4) regeneration schemes managed by local partnerships. A large number of these are likely to have multiple objectives, and cover a wide range of activities depending on local regeneration needs and priorities. It is not possible to break down expenditure to say how much has benefited one objective, therefore no information is available on the amount spent on building new social housing or on renovating social or private sector housing.
<P>

<a name="90727w51.htm_para4">There is no specific matching funding requirement for SRB bids but partnerships are encouraged to maximise the leverage of private sector investment and funding from other public spending programmes. In the four Rounds to 31 March 1999, it is estimated that the total lifetime SRB allocation of &#163;3.4 billion will lever in around &#163;7.6 million of private sector investment over the same period.

 A mooring occupied by a boat which is somebody's sole or main residence is deemed to be a "dwelling" for council tax purposes and will therefore attract a council tax liability in the same way as other domestic types of property. The amount of council tax payable in respect of a mooring occupied by a boat will depend primarily on the valuation band to which the dwelling is assigned. We do not hold information on the number of moorings occupied by boats which are somebody's sole or main residence.

<a name="90727w52.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Planning Inspectorate's Annual Report and Accounts for 1998-99 was published yesterday. Copies have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90727w52.htm_para2">Overall, the Inspectorate met seven out of 10 targets set for its work in England. Handling times for hearing and inquiry cases, although much improved, missed the target. For inquiries, this is partly due to an increase in refusals by parties of dates offered by the Inspectorate. It is important that all parties co-operate and observe the deadlines set to enable the Inspectorate to deliver further improvements in performance.
<P>

<a name="90727w52.htm_para3">The unit cost for written representation cases has increased. This is mainly due to a programme of investment in IT--upgrading PCs, and developing systems to improve performance and customer service. The Inspectorate continues to meet its efficiency target.
<P>

<a name="90727w52.htm_para4">The Inspectorate has also maintained the programme of development plan inquiries to a high standard, helping to create greater certainty for all involved in the planning process as more areas are covered by up to date development plans.
<P>

<a name="90727w52.htm_para5">The Inspectorate's quality target was met and exceeded, with reduced numbers of justified complaints against decisions issued. Surveys continued to show that its decisions are widely respected. It has also produced an 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 354</I><P>

In the climate of a rapidly changing environment it is always ready to take on new areas of work in dispute resolution.

The guidance requires those airports which have 1,000 or more scheduled and charter passenger air transport movements per annum to set up Forums.

<P>

<a name="90727w53.htm_para5">Our intention remains to implement the recommendations of the Local Government Commission for England as soon as practicable on a normal election date for councils. Our consultation has shown that there is no consensus on holding additional elections to implement PERs, and we have concluded that it would not be desirable to do so.
<P>

<a name="90727w53.htm_para6">Accordingly, we intend to implement the Commission's recommendations as follows. For district councils that hold whole council elections and where final recommendations are received by July 2002, implementation is to be on the normal election day in May 2003. For district councils that elect by thirds, where final recommendations have already been received, implementation is to be on the normal election day in May 2000; where final recommendations are received between August 1999 and 2001, implementation is to be on the normal election day in May 2002; and where final recommendations are received no later than July 2002 on the normal election day in May 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90727w53.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The then Energy Efficiency Minister announced on 19 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>374</i>, that as part of my Department's ongoing programme of research into rain penetration of cavity walls, she had asked for precautionary checks to be carried out on the condition of galvanised steel wire wall ties in a sample of houses with cavity walls filled with insulation. This followed the preliminary results of research at the BRE which indicated that there was a possibility that the life expectancy of green coloured galvanised steel wire wall ties might be shortened when used in conjunction with urea formaldehyde from cavity fill.
<P>

<a name="90727w53.htm_para9">These checks have now been completed along with further experimental research and an independent review of the findings.
<P>

<a name="90727w53.htm_para10">In the houses examined, there was no premature deterioration of galvanised ties with or without the green identification film in contact with urea formaldehyde foam cavity insulation.
<P>

<a name="90727w53.htm_para11">The further experimental research was carried out on galvanised ties with and without the green identification film. The research comprised accelerated corrosion tests and chemical interactive tests with urea formaldehyde foam. Neither of these experiments indicated any discernible loss of galvanising.
<P>

<a name="90727w53.htm_para12">With these results to hand and with the benefit of an independent review undertaken by consultants WS Atkins, BRE re-examined their earlier experimental findings. They have concluded that the accelerated corrosion observed under the experimental conditions could have been caused by vapour from the urea formaldehyde which under certain conditions of very high humidity can lead to very high rates of corrosion of galvanising. The conditions under which this could happen were present in the preliminary experimental research, but were unlikely to occur in houses.
<P>

<a name="90727w53.htm_para13">The work concludes that there is no evidence that urea formaldehyde foam cavity wall insulation shortens the lifetime of galvanised wall ties.

 Plans for the millennium holiday have not yet been finalised but for the solar eclipse First Great Western (FGW) and other operators are planning to run more services to Cornwall. There are capacity constraints which limit the number of additional services which can be accommodated. Wales and West are planning to strengthen the services they run normally by adding extra vehicles.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to his answer of 16 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>192-93</i>, on genetically modified foods, if the feeding studies on animals over the period 1994 to 1996 used crops treated with Round-up; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="90727w54.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Following an extensive compositional analysis of Monsanto's genetically modified soya beans, the ACNFP concluded that treatment with glyphosate did not alter the composition of the soya beans themselves. The only difference seen when the GM soya beans are treated with glyphosate is a slightly greater level of the metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid. The toxicity of glyphosate and its metabolites have been studied as part of the approval process for glyphosate and shown to be of low toxicity to humans. The ACNFP was thus satisfied that the safety of Monsanto's GM soya beans had been fully characterised and that the sacrifice of further animals in additional feeding studies using glyphosate treated soya beans was therefore unnecessary.

 Existing UK rules on organic honey production require that hives are not placed within four miles of conventionally farmed land, private gardens, or areas subject to inorganic pollution. Following the recent agreement on Community livestock standards, including rules on honey production, the United Kingdom Register of Organic Food Standards (UKROFS) will be re- examining existing UK standards to determine the changes that will need to be made. This is likely to include the issue of controls on possible GM contamination.

 Since the beginning of June, a number of imported beef forequarters containing small sections of spinal cord have been discovered by Meat Hygiene Service and State Veterinary Service staff at a cutting plant in Great Britain.

<P>

<a name="90727w57.htm_para1">In response to the Chief Veterinary Officer's request for urgent action by the authorities in the Republic of Ireland, the veterinary authorities there have undertaken to penalise the veterinary inspectors responsible for certifying the beef. They have also told the Irish Meat Association that any failure by a member company to implement the specified risk material (SRM) controls will result in the withdrawal of the Supplementary certification for export to the UK. Their unannounced inspections will also be stepped up.

 Under new animal health trade rules agreed during the last UK Presidency of the EU Council, a case requesting designation of Great Britain as officially EBL-Free was submitted to the EU Commission in May. The Standing Veterinary Committee voted in favour of a Commission Decision granting the status to Great Britain on 2 July. It came into effect on 1 July. The Decision also retained EBL-Free status for Northern Ireland. From 1 July 1999 all herds in GB are to be regarded as officially EBL-Free unless the presence of the disease is suspected in a particular herd.

Officials are writing to all members of the Scheme and to the cattle industry to consult them on the future of the Scheme. The formal acknowledgement of our EBL-Free status from the EU is good news for farmers and will reduce bureaucracy. We will of course maintain controls on cattle imports in accordance with EU rules.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The relatively high failure rate for the FWPS Applications was due to the diversion of staff resources in two of the RSCs to higher priority work.<P>

2. The relatively poor performance for the ESA Schemes was primarily caused by uneven workloads, staff turnover and the introduction of a new computer system.<P>

3. The 87 per cent. response rate to complaints to the RSCs is explained by the fact that often cases require referral to HQ or the National Scheme Management Centres and thus take some time to resolve. It must be stressed however that in all cases where the 10 day target was not met a holding letter was issued to the complainant.<P>

<i>General Notes:</i><P>

(i) The total percentage has been calculated by setting the entire number of applications or claims cleared within the target time, against the total number received. Applications and claims not cleared due to reasons beyond our control (incorrect information supplied by applicant, etc.) are not included as failures to meet target.<P>

(ii) The Farm Conservation Grant Schemes 1989 and 1991 Applications and Claims and Pilot NSA Claims have been omitted from the table since these schemes are now closed.<P>

(iii) During the year 16 formal complaints were made to MAFF's central Complaints Adjudicator, of which two were referred elsewhere and three are still outstanding. Of the cases dealt with, six were determined in the complainants favour and five were not upheld. <P>

 We recognise states rather than Governments. Therefore the question of recognition of President Lukashenko does not arise. In its declaration of 20 July, the EU made clear its view that President Lukashenko's mandate under the 1994 Constitution expired on that day.

 The Government's welfare reform programme aims to tackle the root causes of poverty, help people to earn a decent income through work, and provide security for those unable to work. We have announced an ambitious programme of support for families including increases in child benefit, a new Children's Tax Credit, increase in the Working Families Tax Credit and Income Support, and a new Sure Start Maternity Grant of &#163;200. By the end of this Parliament, we will be spending an extra &#163;6 billion a year on children. The Working Families Tax Credit will benefit 1.5 million families who will receive an average of &#163;24 a week more than Family Credit. It will provide a guaranteed minimum income of 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 388</I><P>
&#163;200 a week for a family with someone in full-time work on the national minimum wage, and more for families with more than one child.
<P>

<a name="90727w62.htm_para3">Families with children will, on average, be &#163;740 a year better off as a result of measures in the last two Budgets. We estimate that 800,000 children will be lifted out of poverty as a result. The definition of poverty which underpins this statement was explained in the written answer which the Economic Secretary gave to the hon.

 The provisional assessment of HM Customs and Excise based on their work in progress to monitor the scale of such smuggling (chiefly of cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco) is that the total amount of revenue (excise duty and VAT) evaded through all forms of smuggling of tobacco products in 1998 was around &#163;1.7 billion.

 <i>[holding answer 26 July 1999]:</i> The Government have clearly recognised that the UK has a long history of under-performance in investment. That is why they have put in place a comprehensive range of measures designed to tackle this weakness, including macroeconomic reforms to provide a stable environment and a tax framework to encourage investment, such as reducing the rate of corporation tax to its lowest level ever.

<P>
<a name="90727w63.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 As indicated in the consultation document published by Customs and Excise on Budget day, coal and gas used in chemical reactions will not be subject to the levy. Officials at Customs are having useful discussions with industry about how to apply the exemption to fuels used both for chemical reaction and for heating, such as in the steel industry. In the light of the representations received on the treatment of electrolysis, we propose to extend this to electricity. We propose that electricity used for electrolysis, either for the production of chloralkalis or the primary smelting of aluminium, will be exempt from the levy to the extent that it is used in chemical reactions. Again, Customs will discuss precisely how this will work with the industries involved with a view to the revised treatment being included in the draft clauses to be published in the autumn.

 Duty differentials are not the only factor involved in the legal and illegal cross-border trade in excise goods between the UK and other EU member states. Other factors involved include pre-tax price, manufacturers' and retailers' margins, and transportation costs. It is not possible to isolate the effect of duty differentials alone.
<P>

<a name="90727w65.htm_para0">HM Customs and Excise estimates of revenue lost through cross-border shopping and smuggling are set out in their technical paper deposited in the House of Commons Library on 19 November 1998.

 Officials in the Office for National Statistics are holding discussions with their counterparts in Scotland and Wales to consider their requirements for enhanced samples. As a result of these discussions it has been established that samples in many cases are sufficient, while some other samples have already been enhanced, particularly in the area of business statistics. I expect these discussions to continue.

 The Working Families Tax Credit is central to the Government's aim of making work pay. It will benefit nearly 1.5 million families, providing a minimum guaranteed income for a family with a full time worker of &#163;200 per week. Together with the national minimum wage, increases to child benefit, and reform of tax and national insurance, it will lift around 800,000 children out of poverty.
<P>

<a name="90727w65.htm_para1">It is vital that the right people get the information they need to apply for the tax credits they are entitled to.

 There are no publicly available official estimates of Russia's total debts or of its arrears. At the Koln Summit G8 Heads welcomed the outline agreements recently reached by Russia with the IMF and the World Bank and looked forward to their speedy implementation as a further important step in Russia's reform program.

 Ministers have now approved plans for the refurbishment of the Treasury building under the terms of an innovative PFI deal with Exchequer Partnership plc (EP), the Treasury's Private Sector Partner. This flagship PFI project at the heart of Whitehall confirms the Government's commitment to PFI in the accommodation sector. On completion, the project will 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 1999 : Column: 401</I><P>
bring together the whole Department in one modern, efficient office building fit for the 21st century. It is the first to follow the recently published Treasury Task Force PFI Standard Contract Guidance. It is also the first project where the service provider, in partnership with the Treasury, will put debt financing out to competition.
<P>

<a name="90727w65.htm_para2">This will be the first, major refurbishment of a building nearly a century old. While it needs some remedial work, the building's services also require major updating, and more flexible and efficient use needs to be made of the space within it to meet business needs. The project will achieve both, as well as providing very good value for money for the taxpayer. Work on site is expected to commence in the spring of 2000 and take two years to complete. The Department will remain at the eastern (Whitehall) end of the building while its new accommodation at the western (St. James's Park) end is refurbished. The move is scheduled to take place in Spring 2002, and the Treasury will then be occupying just under half of the building. The Treasury will pay as and when its accommodation needs are delivered to specified standards.
<P>

<a name="90727w65.htm_para3">Under the terms of the PFI deal, EP are responsible for securing town planning permission and listed building consent. It is also for EP to let the non-Treasury space to another public sector tenant.

<P>

<a name="90727w66.htm_para0">The joint Treasury and DSS consultation paper "Helping to deliver stakeholder pensions: flexibility in pension investment" suggested that ppis could help the successful launch of stakeholder pensions. Most responses to the paper agreed, and many pressed for a joint introduction. Also, financial services firms are still dealing with year 2000 compliance, and many will be introducing change freezes around the millennium period. It therefore makes good practical sense to introduce the two reforms together.
<P>

<a name="90727w66.htm_para6">These investments offer appropriate security and risk spreading for savers. They also give the flexibility required to match investments with the length of time from retirement. Again this is consistent with the responses from consultation, and strikes the right balance between minimising investment risk and allowing choice and innovation.

<a name="90727w66.htm_para7">ONS's performance against its key targets was good and in the case of the compliance plan and efficiency savings both targets were exceeded. In a few cases the target was missed marginally. Targets for 1999-2000 are set out in the ONS Business Plan 1999-2002, which was published in March. Copies of the Business Plan are in the Library.

 Data are compiled by the DETR on behalf of the eight Rent Registration Areas in Wales which are largely based on the former county council areas. The latest published figures from that source are for quarter ended September 1998.
<P>

<a name="90727w67.htm_para0">The following data have been compiled as at 1 April by direct reference to the eight Rent Offices in Wales and have been provided as a guide only. The information is not collected in the way it has been requested.
<P>

<a name="90727w67.htm_para1">Information for flats is not separately available, therefore the details provided relate to all two room accommodation (ie one bedroom and one living room).
<P>

<a name="90727w67.htm_para2">The Local Reference Rent is specific to an individual property and is meant to reflect the general level of rent for properties of the same size in the locality. In order to arrive at a single figure, an average has been calculated.
<P>

<a name="90727w67.htm_para3">Rent Officers are required to determine rents based on the size and type of accommodation in a locality which may be different to a local authority area and localities could also cross local authority boundaries. The information has, therefore, been estimated to cover local authority boundaries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what assessment he has made of the effect on the finances of the National Assembly for Wales, and on council taxes in Wales, of his proposals included in the Statement on Funding Policy for the National Assembly for Wales, that adjustments in respect of council tax benefit subsidy for Wales should be based on relative percentage changes in council tax; and by what means the Barnett Formula will provide the necessary additional funding for Wales for these purposes.

 <i>[holding answer 30 April 1999]:</i> In future years, local authorities in Wales and the National Assembly will determine the level of local authority self-financed expenditure, including council tax.
<P>

<a name="90727w68.htm_para4">The precise effect of council tax benefit subsidy on the finances of the National Assembly will depend on individual local authorities' budgeting decisions and the Assembly's decisions on how and whether to use its reserve powers to control council tax increases. The detailed rules have yet to be finalised, but it is currently estimated that each percentage point difference between the relative change of council tax in Wales and that in England will require a balancing adjustment to the Assembly's Departmental Expenditure Limit of approximately &#163;1 million. Any adjustment to the Assembly's funding in respect of council tax benefit subsidy will not directly effect council tax.
