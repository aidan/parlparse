 Since 1999 Nicaragua (US$ 4.5 billion), Honduras (US$1 billion) and Bolivia (US$ 2.06 billion), have all received substantial debt relief through the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. In  <br>

addition, since its implementation last year these countries have also benefited from the 100 per cent. cancellation of debt stock owed to the World Bank, IMF and African Development Bank under the multilateral debt relief initiative (MDRI). Last year, the MDRI relieved debts of $968 million to Nicaragua, $1.3 billion to Honduras and $1.75 billion to Bolivia. DFID has monitored the spending of this money through our work with the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund. This helps to ensure that the money gets targeted to items in the budget that directly impact on the poor, such as health and education. We have cancelled all outstanding bilateral debt owed to the UK, including contributing to the debt relief provided under HIPC and MDRI.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="70329w0002.htm_para0"><a name="07040322000465">Despite good progress on multilateral debt relief, Nicaragua still has about $1.3 billion in outstanding debt from commercial creditors who are not part of either HIPC or MDRI. This debt hinders how Nicaragua can use other debt relief to address poverty, and is subject to &#145;vulture funds&#146; which buy the debt when Nicaragua is least able to pay, and then press for repayment at several times the debt's face value, when economic prospects are looking better. DFID has just committed $3.5 million to the elimination of this debt, in a deal with the World Bank and other donors. The deal itself reduces the debt to $64 million. The Nicaraguan Government itself will contribute $3.5 million. With contributions from the Government of Nicaragua, World Bank, DFID and others, it is hoped that this will fully eliminate the outstanding commercial debt owed by Nicaragua.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="70329w0002.htm_para1"><a name="07040322000466">In addition, the Inter-America Development Bank has recently announced debt relief to the five poorest countries in the region. This amounts to $3.4 billion and $1.0 billion of future interest payments from its fund for special operations (FSO). This will provide immediate relief of $1 billion for Bolivia, $984 million for Nicaragua, and $467 million for Guyana among others. However, the UK has abstained from voting on this deal, along with several other European countries. This was because of concerns that the deal would hinder access of the poorest countries to concessionary IADB financing in the future. Access to continued flows of concessionary lending from the FSO of the IADB will be important to the achievement of the millennium development goals in countries such as Nicaragua. The UK is currently in discussions with IADB and other shareholders on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="70329w0002.htm_para2"><a name="07040322000469">Food security problems, particularly related to drought, are severely affecting more than 900,000 people. Health indicators remain at a critical level, with acute malnutrition among children under five having increased to 12 per cent. over the last five years. Protection remains a central issue, including for children directly affected by the conflict. Significant numbers of those displaced during the conflict have been returning&#151;either spontaneously, or with facilitation, though many internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees continue to face protection concerns. 107,000 Bhutanese refugees remain dependent on international aid. In addition to the humanitarian challenges exacerbated by the conflict, Nepal&#146;s mountainous terrain means that it continues to be vulnerable to natural disasters including landslides, floods, and earthquakes.</p>

 The UK is one of the largest bilateral donors of humanitarian support to Zimbabwe, supporting over 1.5 million of the poorest people. DFID spent &#163;138.9 million bilaterally in Zimbabwe in financial years 2001-02 to 2005-06. Our funding prioritises HIV/AIDS, food insecurity and supporting orphans and vulnerable children. Our current programmes will help ensure that an additional 30,000 people receive anti-retroviral treatment, will provide health care for around 350,000 children, promote food security in both urban and rural areas and assist extremely vulnerable displaced people. The UK does not give direct funding to the Government of Zimbabwe. All DFID&#146;s bilateral funding is channelled through NGOs and UN agencies, much of it programmed jointly with other donors. We do not believe in cutting direct assistance to poor Zimbabweans and thus punishing them further for their unaccountable government.</p>

At present, there is no central record of those subject to disqualification orders and this is regarded as a significant handicap to effective law enforcement.

Of the two remaining applications, both from farmers, one application, which was seeking to interfere with a badger sett, was refused after due consideration, while the other application has been placed on hold.</p>

 There are strict controls on the management and disposal of all wastes, including waste chemicals, and producers of waste have a duty to ensure that it is lawfully managed. Section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 makes it an offence to illegally dispose of waste and carries a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine, or five years imprisonment, or both. The Government have been developing and implementing its waste crime strategy for a number of years now. We will continue to do so as I believe that all forms of illegal waste disposal need to be prevented as far as possible. Where they do happen, incidents and offenders must be dealt with promptly and efficiently by the enforcing authorities.</p>

1. A number of counter-fraud schemes have operated from 1997. These are the Weekly Benefit Saving Scheme, the New Incentive Scheme, the Security Against Fraud and Error Scheme and the Verification Framework. The figures include set up and ongoing costs for the Verification Framework in addition to money claimed by local authorities for work done under the Weekly Benefit Saving Scheme, the New Incentive Scheme and the Security Against Fraud and Error Scheme.<br>
2. The main changes in expenditure between years can be explained as follows: A tightening of the rules in 1998-99 reduced the amounts local authorities could claim for counter-fraud work. The increase in 2001-02 was due to the replacement of the Weekly Benefit Saving Scheme by the New Incentive Scheme.<br>
A further increase in subsidy paid in 2003/04 stemmed from increases in the rewards for anti-fraud work.<br>

<i> [holding answer 1 March 2007]</i>: Some people will return to new deal after leaving the programme, but this is inevitable in a dynamic labour market. New deal 25 plus has to be considered in the context of the people it sets out to help. People who suffer long periods of unemployment can find it particularly difficult to get back to and remain in work. The longer they are unemployed, the greater the barriers to getting work, and helping them into work is a considerable achievement.</p>

 The most common and internationally recognised threshold to measure poverty is income below 60 per cent. of median. We do not present information covering 40 per cent. of median income in our Households Below Average Income series as it is not a good measure of poverty. This is because households stating the lowest incomes to the Family Resources Survey (FRS) may not actually have the lowest living standards. Many people who report very low incomes appear to have high spending. Hence any statistics on numbers in this group may be misleading.</p>

This annual report, which is a National Statistics publication, includes the numbers and proportions of individuals, children, working age adults and pensioners with incomes below 50 per cent., 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median income, and the proportions in persistent poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="70329w0016.htm_para1"><a name="07040322002893">Pension credit has been highly successful in reducing pensioner poverty; since its introduction, the number of pensioners in relative poverty has fallen by over 700,000. Now, for the first time in a period of sustained economic growth, pensioners are less likely to be in poverty than the population as a whole, after housing costs are accounted for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="70329w0016.htm_para2"><a name="07040322002895">We continue to make every effort to ensure that pension credit goes to those who are entitled to it. It is more challenging to reach those entitled to smaller amounts, or to the savings credit only, who may be less familiar with the entitlements available to them. The Pension Service has contacted pensioners to encourage them to take up entitlement to pension credit many times already as part of extensive marketing activity. Over 70 per cent. of those pensioners who appear to have entitlement to pension credit have been contacted over five times already. And around 25 per cent. of customers visited about pension credit say that they do not want to make a claim. However, we are committed to improving take-up and are continually looking at further ways to target these groups and encouraging them to apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="70329w0016.htm_para3"><a name="07040322002897">The information requested for pensioners in Great Britain is shown in the following tables. Estimates of entitled non-recipients of MIG or pension credit should be treated with caution. This is especially the case given that we are looking at the extreme of the income distribution and so are less sure of pensioners&#146; modelled entitlement. Results are based on small sample sizes and have not been corrected for biases that may be inherent in estimates of entitlement to income related benefits&#151;that is, they may be based on the data for those who appear to be entitled non-recipients but will not all actually be entitled non recipients and vice versa. Figures are therefore presented as proportions of the total pensioner population below the 40 per cent. of median household income.</p>

1. Figures are presented after housing costs as this is our preferred measure for pensioners.<br>
2. Estimates of the pensioner population cover those above state pension age (60 for women and 65 for men). The estimates therefore exclude some men aged 60 to 64 and partners of pensioners aged under 60, who may have been eligible but not claiming pension credit.<br>
3. Estimates also exclude those cases where respondents have reported they are awaiting the outcome of a claim for a benefit and have been modelled as entitled to that benefit.<br>
4. Estimates cover the private household population of Great Britain. The data source is the Family Resources Survey.<br>
5. These figures are calculated using OECD equivalisation factors. Prior to 2002-03 they are based on a GB median and from 2002-03 it is based on a UK median. This is consistent with low income estimates published in the latest edition of Households Below Average Income. The GB median is similar to the UK median.<br>
6. minimum income guarantee (MIG) was introduced for pensioners in April 1999 paid through income support.<br>
7. Pension credit (PC) was introduced mid-way through 2003-04; therefore, estimates for 2003-04 cover those pensioners who were entitled but not receiving either MIG or PC. As this relates to the first six months of pension credit the figures should be treated with some caution.<br>
8. For the purposes of this analysis, benefit unit based data (take-up statistics) were combined with household equivalised income based results (Households Below Average Income statistics).<br>
9. Estimates for 2000-2001 and 2003-2004 onwards incorporate the results of a data matching exercise, which links the Family Resources Survey with DWP administrative data in order to identify &#145;hidden recipients&#146; of MIG-PC, i.e. those people who tell the FRS they do not receive pension credit, but actually do.<br>
10. Estimates are presented as proportions of the total pensioner population below the 40 per cent. of median household income, as the analysis is based on single-year survey data and the absolute numbers of such pensioners who were not claiming the pension credit or minimum income guarantee they were entitled to might be biased due to small sample sizes.<br>
11. These analyses have not been corrected for the biases that may be inherent in estimates of entitlement to income-related benefits&#151;that is, they may be based on the data for those who appear to be entitled non recipients (ENRs) but will not all actually be ENRs and vice versa&#151;and so they should be treated with some caution.<br>
12.The estimates relate only to those who were modelled as entitled to receive benefit but were not identified to be in receipt of any amount of benefit. It therefore does not include cases where a pensioner is in receipt of some benefit, but this is less than the amount they are truly entitled to. Including these cases may not give a reliable indication of full take-up due to the potential error that exists in modelling entitlement. <br>

Once this schedule is complete Social Fund will be processed from 20 sites throughout the country. As we are only halfway through this process (with some of the rolled-out offices still to migrate Social Fund work into their sites), it is too early to make an assessment of the impact of centralisation. The decision to centralise this activity was to address performance variation and to concentrate our staff expertise to improve service to our customers.</p>

A small part of this would have been used to assess the BS7971 suite of standards against the police operational requirement. The police operational requirements are produced and owned by the Association of Chief Police Officers with input from HOSDB.

 Section 2 of the Identity Cards Act 2006 clearly establishes that only those aged 16 and over are eligible to be registered on the National Identity Register and issued with an identity card. Thus, there are no plans to record fingerprint biometrics of those aged under 16 on the National Identity Register for the purpose of issuing identity cards.

Passports issued to those aged between 11 and 15 years are of a five year validity. They need to match the physical and technical standards of those issued to adults as the holders of such passports hold them when they become more economically active and move into adulthood, possibly continuing to use such passports up to the age of 20. For example it would be anomalous for one 19-year-old to have a passport which incorporated fingerprint biometric data and another 19-year-old to have a passport which did not incorporate fingerprint biometric data as it was issued when the holder was under 16 and not treated as an adult.</p>

 Other than previous debates in the House and representations made by individual MPs on behalf of their constituents, no specific representations have been made by the drinks industry or other stakeholders on the use of plastic in licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003 already provides for the police to apply for licence reviews and for conditions to be attached to licences. For example, that the licensed premises should use toughened drinks glasses and bottles. The Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 will in due course also provide a new fast track alcohol licence review process that could lead to such conditions being applied in cases of serious crime and disorder. We are also committed to reviewing the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England that was published in March 2004, later this year.</p>

 With our strong support the EU is working hard to create a more dynamic and internationally competitive single market for broadband and mobile services accessible to all across Europe. Its current work is largely through the i2010 programme for the information society which was developed and agreed during the UK's presidency, came into effect on 1 January 2006 and lasts until 2010 with a mid-term review in 2008. The i2010 programme includes measures to improve the regulatory framework for electronic communications services like broadband and mobile as well as measures to promote innovation and inclusion including take-up in the less developed regions of Europe. On broadband coverage the Commission is working with a wide range of regional and other interests on the proposals in its Communication last year, "Bridging the Broadband Gap", and has been working with member states and regional authorities to enable public funding of broadband in rural and other areas in accordance with state aid rules. On mobile the EU is also taking action to reduce charges for roaming between national mobile networks.</p>

 The Government through their Market Transformation Programme (MTP) have analysed the performances of over 630 televisions sold in 2004, 2005, and 2006 and have concluded that the difference in energy consumption between analogue and integrated digital televisions (IDTVs) is negligible.</p>

 UK Ministers and officials have had ongoing discussions with the European Commission and others, following the consultation launched by the Commission in 2006 on the Community Patent and other initiatives to improve the European Patent system. Negotiations on a Community Patent have been ongoing for a number of decades, and have been complicated by questions around language and jurisdiction. As the European Commission Consultation in 2006 noted, there appears no imminent prospect of achieving the unanimity required in order to establish a Community Patent. The consultation aimed to find steps which could be taken to improve the European patent system in the near future, which would help us to make progress towards the long term goal of a Community Patent. We anticipate that the Commission will publish its Communication on those next steps in the next few months.</p>

 Acute hepatitis C infection usually occurs without symptoms, and there are no laboratory tests to differentiate between acute (recent), chronic (long-standing) or resolved hepatitis C infection. Therefore, trends in the number of laboratory diagnoses reflect the number of individuals being tested, rather than the incidence of infection, and those infections identified may have been acquired years or even decades earlier.</p>

 While we are strongly encouraging forum members to become involved in the new local involvement networks (LINks), we do not wish to prescribe that they should automatically become members because we want all aspects of the arrangements for LINks to be locally determined.

 It is Government policy to devolve power to local authorities, which will make decisions on priorities according to local needs.

 We are clear that LINks must be able to be flexible and reflect the nature of local communities. Therefore we do not wish to centrally prescribe details on membership.

 In June 2006, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published guidance for the national health service on the use of docetaxel for the treatment of prostate cancer. NICE recommended the use of this treatment for particular groups of patients.</p>
