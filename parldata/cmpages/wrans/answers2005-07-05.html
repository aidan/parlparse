<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50705w01.html_spnew1"><b> Nick Harvey: </b> 
 The cost of conducting the risk assessment of communal hairbrushes and combs in Members&#039; washrooms was staff time only. The assessment involved Serjeant at Arms staff and professionals from the Parliamentary Occupational Health, Safety and Welfare Service and was undertaken as part of their normal duties. Advice was sought from other professionals in relevant enforcement authorities (i.e. Westminster Council&#039;s Environmental Health Department and the Health and Safety Executive) at no cost to the House.

<a name="stpa_0">There have been no reported cases of communicable diseases or infestations relating to the use of communal combs and hairbrushes in Members washrooms over the last 10 years. However health, safety and hygiene standards now mean that the House has a duty of care properly to control health and safety risks to those working at or visiting the House of Commons. A risk assessment was undertaken resulting in the removal of communal combs and hairbrushes as a preventative health measure, following submission of the matter to the Administration Committee in the last Parliament. The risks of communicating disease or infection was one of a number of risk factors highlighted that contributed to the overall risk assessment and decision, though it is acknowledged in the risk assessment that the likelihood 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Jul 2005 : Column 232W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
of contracting HIV or hepatitis is extremely low. A copy of the risk assessment as provided to the Administration Committee has been placed in the Library.

 In June 1999, bids were invited for contracts from solicitors firms and not-for-profit organisations to undertake civil legal aid work. Over 6,000 bids for contracts were received. At the start of the new scheme on 1 January 2000, there were 5,156 contracts signed. Approximately 90 per cent. of existing contracted solicitors re-bid for their contract during the bid round in 2003, with the other 10 per cent. being let to solicitors firms moving into new categories of law or who were new to legal aid, and not-for-profit agencies. The present contract began on 1 April 2004. At the start of the 2004&#150;05 financial year 6,242 solicitors firms had been awarded contracts. The number of contracts continues to change between bid rounds, with firms joining as well as withdrawing.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps her Department is taking to protect and enhance <i>(a)</i> the habitats and <i>(b)</i> the number of the dormouse population in England; and what estimate she has made of the dormouse population in England in each of the last five years.  [9212]</p>




<p><a name="st_56"><a name="50705w05.html_spnew1"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The dormouse is a priority species with an individual Species Action Plan that is led jointly by English Nature and The Wildlife Trusts. It has also been the subject of an English Nature Species Recovery Programme since 1991. The main reasons for the decline of the dormouse appear to be the fragmentation of our woodlands coupled with inappropriate woodland management. The dormouse recovery programme has sought to address these issues. Guidance on woodland management to favour dormice was published in 1996 and has been followed by a series of training courses for woodland managers. Awareness of the needs of the dormouse is now very high. In addition, the Forestry Commission has a large programme to restore planted ancient woodland sites, which will favour the dormouse. An innovative research programme, carried out at Royal Holloway, University of London, showed the importance of hedgerows for dormice and guidance on hedgerow management was published by English Nature in 2002. &#039;Dormouse friendly&#039; hedgerows are now an option in the Government&#039;s new Environmental Scheme. A greatly-expanded conservation handbook on dormice will be published later this year.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Jul 2005 : Column 248W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50705w05.html_para1">
As well as efforts to improve the countryside for dormice, the species has been reintroduced into some parts of England from which it was lost. A partnership between English Nature and the People&#039;s Trust for Endangered Species, with veterinary support from the Institute of Zoology, has now carried out 14 reintroductions to 11 counties, using dormice supplied by the Common Dormouse Captive Breeders Group. Follow-up surveys have confirmed the success of this approach, with the first reintroduction now more than 10-years-old. The most recent reintroduction was to the Chatsworth Estate, Derbyshire in June this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50705w05.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_29">Estimating the number of dormice is difficult as the species is very under-recorded. The first Great Nut Hunt in 1993 greatly increased the number of known sites for the species and a national inventory of more than 1,300 sites is now available through the National Biodiversity Network. More than 200 of these sites now contribute to the National Dormouse Monitoring Programme by counting the number of dormice in nest-boxes every summer. These data, summarised in the report of the Tracking Mammals Project, have shown that, nationally, the dormouse population has declined by 23 per cent. since 1993, though it has been relatively stable in recent years. However, there are indications that the species remains vulnerable at the edge of its range, particularly in the marginal uplands, so there is an on-going need for conservation work. A recent estimate of the national population suggested that there are in the region of 45,000 dormice in Britain.

<i>[holding answer 30 June 2005]:</i> The EU Emissions Trading Scheme works at an installation rather than state-level, and therefore any potential profits or losses from the Scheme are accrued by the individual operator.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50705w05.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_30">The two categories of payments from individual operators under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme are regulator fees and civil penalties. Fees are imposed by the regulator to cover the costs incurred in administering the scheme. The regulator also administers the collection of civil penalties, levied when regulations have been broken. Regulation 41 of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Regulations 2005 requires the regulator to collect any civil penalties, and then to pass them to the &quot;appropriate authority&quot;, before entering the Treasury&#039;s Consolidated Fund. The appropriate authority is the Secretary of State for installations in England and offshore installations, the Scottish Ministers for installations in Scotland, the Welsh Assembly for installations in Wales, and the Department of Environment for Northern Ireland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50705w05.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_31">Operators can avoid paying civil penalties by purchasing (and surrendering) additional allowances from other operators, in line with their obligations under the Scheme.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will assess the merits of including aircraft emissions in the European Emissions Trading Scheme.  [8745]</p>




<p><a name="st_58"><a name="50705w05.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Aviation accounted for approximately 3 per cent. of the EU&#039;s carbon dioxide emissions in 2001. While this is a relatively modest share, this represents an increase of 68 per cent. from 1990 levels. Furthermore, in their 1999 Special Report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that the total climate change effect from aviation is approximately two-four times larger than the effect of its CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions alone. The EU has recognised the need to tackle this growing area of emissions in the absence of other international action.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50705w05.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_32">The use of emissions trading allows the coverage of environmental costs through a mixture of emissions reductions within the sector and purchase of reductions that can be produced more cheaply by other sectors. The advantage of emissions trading is that, through the use of a defined emissions cap, it guarantees a desired environmental outcome in a way that other instruments, such as charges, do not. Furthermore, it ensures that the emissions reductions required to achieve a particular environmental outcome take place in as cost-effective a manner as possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50705w05.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_33">For an international industry, an international trading regime is the best solution. The Government have made taking forward the work programme for the inclusion of aviation emissions into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme a priority for the UK presidency of the EU. While there are further instruments that may be appropriate, our focus is on emissions trading as the most cost effective way of delivering our environmental objective.

<sup>(3)</sup> Number of days when a forecast for high air pollution was published for one or more of the pollutants included in the air quality banding and index system. Details of the air pollution banding and index system are available at http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/standards.phpband<br>

<sup>(4)</sup> There are no numbers available for the individual years 1993 and 1994. The numbers presented are the average for 1993 and 1994. The same applies to 1999 and 2000.<br>

<sup>(5)</sup> The guideline values for some air pollutants were changed in 1997 following advice from the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) and a public consultation. A statement from COMEAP is available at http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/statementsreports/airpol9.htm. Before 1997 the air quality guidelines for &quot;poor&quot; air quality were: nitrogen dioxide, 191 microgrammes per metre cubed as an hourly average; sulphur dioxide, 333 microgrammes per metre cubed as an hourly average; and ozone, 180 microgrammes per metre cubed as an hourly average. From 1997 onwards, the thresholds for the definition of high pollution were defined as: nitrogen dioxide, 573 microgrammes per metre cubed as an hourly average; sulphur dioxide, 532 microgrammes per metre cubed as a 15 minute average; ozone was unchanged. In 1997 guideline values for particulate matter (PMio) and carbon monoxide were added. These are: PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub> , 97 microgrammes per metre cubed, gravimetric equivalent; carbon monoxide, 17.4 microgrammes per metre cubed.<br>

<sup>(6)</sup> High forecasts up to 30 June 2005.<br>

For example, the UK contributes 7.4 per cent. of the budget of the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), likely to be &#163;20 million in 2005&#150;06. In 2004, DFID also provided some &#163;4 million in humanitarian assistance to Haiti in response to the political unrest, the May floods, and Tropical Storm Jeanne.

 Health care professionals are clearly a crucial element of any health system and the UK Government are concerned about the severe shortages of health workers in some developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Migration of health workers to the UK and elsewhere can contribute to these shortages, which is why the UK has a Code of Practice for International Recruitment of Healthcare Professionals available at http://www.dh.gov.uk. The Code of Practice prevents the NHS from actively recruiting health care professionals from low and middle-income countries unless there is a Government-to-Government agreement in place.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Jul 2005 : Column 266W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
lack of training capacity, workers leaving the health sector due to poor pay and working conditions, difficulties in deploying staff to rural areas, and the effects of HIV and AIDS.

<p>
<a name="50705w10.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_66">DFID believes that addressing these shortages requires the development and implementation of comprehensive country-led plans, which increase the numbers of health workers trained, but also include measures to improve pay and incentives, working conditions, distribution, effective planning and management, and improving the performance of existing workers. An example of where DFID is supporting such a plan is Malawi where we are working with the Government to implement an emergency human resource programme, which aims to almost double the number of health workers in Malawi over the next six years.

<a name="stpa_96">In view of the health risk from smoking, our policy is to prevent uptake of the habit and to assist smokers to stop. We evaluate impacts, on the economy in general and employers in particular, in the context of specific policies. On Monday 20 June, we launched a consultation on the smoke free elements of the Health Improvement and Protection Bill. Alongside the consultation, we published a partial regulatory impact assessment on smoke free enclosed public places and workplaces. This contains estimates of the costs and benefits, including the impact of smoking and smoking breaks on the economy. A copy is available in the Library.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will exempt state pensions from income tax and national insurance contributions.  [9403]</p>




<p><a name="st_136"><a name="50705w15.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 State pensions are not subject to national insurance contributions. Successive Governments have believed that a pension, whether State or occupational, is a form of income like earnings and as such should be taxable, subject to any age related personal allowances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50705w15.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_97">While state pensions are subject to income tax, the age related personal allowances for people aged 65 and over mean that in 2005&#150;06 no pensioner aged 65 or over will be required to pay tax on income of less than &#163;136 a week in 2005&#150;06, considerably more than the basic state pension of &#163;82.05.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50705w15.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_98">This means that around half of all pensioners do not pay income tax. Exempting the state pension from income tax would therefore only benefit the better off pensioners; the Government instead continues to focus resources on the poorest pensioners.

 Local housing authorities can already discharge a duty to secure accommodation for a homeless household by arranging the provision of an assured shorthold tenancy in the private sector. The provision of such a tenancy can be used to provide temporary accommodation, pending the availability of settled accommodation. Moreover, where a main homelessness duty is owed to an applicant under section 193(2) of the Housing Act 1996, the offer of an assured shorthold tenancy will bring this duty to an end (as settled accommodation) if the offer is a qualifying offer and the applicant accepts the offer.

In July 1997, we extended the reasonable preference categories to include people owed the main homelessness duties. This effectively restored the long-standing rights of people owed the main homelessness duties that had been removed by the Housing Act 1996. In 2002, the reasonable preference categories were revised and broadened to include people owed other homelessness duties and people who were homeless, whether owed a duty or not.

 The Housing Act 2004 requires the mandatory licensing of larger, higher-risk housing of multiple occupation (HMOs).

<p><a name="st_226"><a name="50705w23.html_spnew2"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 Mobile phone mast and base station developments near schools are subject to the normal planning regulations in place throughout England, unless exempted by the regulations set out in part 24 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (GPDO). The planning arrangements for telecommunications developments were significantly strengthened in 2001 and include improved requirements for consulting local people about mast proposals. The changes to the GPDO were underpinned by revised guidance, set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 8, Telecommunications. The changes to the planning guidance also underlined that school governors must be consulted on all proposals for new masts on or near a school or college.

 Government policy, set out in planning policy guidance note 8 on Telecommunications, states the importance of keeping the numbers of radio and telecommunications masts and of the sites for such installations to the minimum consistent with the efficient operation of the network.

<a name="50705w23.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_163">Parliament has given local planning authorities the responsibility for development control in their areas. The Secretary of State does not seek to interfere with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities unless it is necessary to do so.

<p><a name="qn_228"><a name="50705w23.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what topics will be covered by the research commissioned by his Department into the future direction of mobile phone technology; what the timetable for the research is including <i>(a)</i> the date on which the research was commissioned, <i>(b)</i> when the research commenced, <i>(c)</i> what interim reports will be submitted, <i>(d)</i> when the research findings and recommendations will be submitted to Ministers and <i>(e)</i> when and how the research will be made public; what the estimated cost of research is; and who is conducting the research.

<p><a name="st_228"><a name="50705w23.html_spnew4"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 On 4 April I announced the Government&#039;s intention to commission further research to identify the future direction of mobile phone technology and the future need for mast developments. Officials from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have discussed these research proposals with other departments and research institutions and are currently preparing a specification. These studies form part of a wider programme of work around planning arrangements for telecommunication masts.

 There are approximately 45,000 base stations across the country at present for all mobile phone network operators, this includes 2G and 3G networks. The licences to operate 3G networks require that 80 per cent. of the population will have access to the network by the end of 2007. The mobile phone operators have estimated that in total 50,000 base stations will be required.

<a name="stpa_181">The Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill removes appeal rights for all students refused entry clearance, a policy that was announced in the Five Year Strategy Controlling our borders: Making migration work for Britain. Once the Act comes into effect genuine students will continue to be granted entry clearance to study in the United Kingdom. The majority of applications for entry clearance as a student are granted and data from 2003 indicates that only about one percent of students who gained entry into the UK did so as the result of a successful appeal. Since 2001&#150;02 the number of people granted entry clearance to study has increased by over 20 per cent. from 121,466 to 146,538 in 2003&#150;04. Entry into the UK to study should be a privilege and not a right and changes to the appeals system reflect this distinction. We will maintain appeal rights where fundamental issues are raised, such as when people are refused entry clearance to visit family members. Other countries, including Canada and Australia, confer no appeal rights on people who are refused entry clearance as students. Proposals are currently being developed to increase, in a manageable way, the number of people coming to the UK to study; to provide these people with a high quality education; and to ensure the integrity of the immigration control.

<i>[holding answer 23 June 2005]:</i> Our objective is to ensure that people have a well-informed choice between private and readily accessible national health service dental treatment. In addition, we wish to ensure people on low incomes, who are particularly vulnerable to dental disease and are exempt from dental charges, continue to receive free treatment. This would not be guaranteed through the provision of either vouchers or refunds, because the dentist could require the voucher to be topped, while the refund might not meet the full cost of private dental treatment. We are, therefore, concentrating resources on the reform of NHS dentistry. In this financial year, funding for NHS dentistry in England is set to rise by &#163;250 million&#151;an increase of 19 per cent., compared with spending in 2003&#150;04. People requiring NHS dental treatment may contact NHS Direct, who are able to respond, to 90 per cent. of inquiries with information on a dental practice accessible within locally agreed standards.

 We welcome this new development in the fight against malaria, which continues to claim the lives of one to two million people world-wide each year. Reducing morbidity and mortality due to malaria depends on a coordinated attack on the mosquito vector by personal protective measures, for example, insecticide-impregnated bed nets, and community mosquito control programmes, on prompt diagnosis and treatment of malaria in individual patients with antimalarial drugs. Vaccines are under development but will not be available in the short to medium term.

 Monsanto conducted a standard 90-day feeding study in rats given diets containing 11 per cent. or 33 per cent. of MON 863 maize grain, or equivalent amounts of non-genetically modified (GM) maize grain. The results revealed a small difference in the parameters mentioned in the question between the animals fed the highest amount of MON 863 maize, compared with those in one given one of the diets containing non-GM maize. Such findings are not unusual in studies of this type, where several dozen parameters are being evaluated across a number of treatment groups and interpretation of the results requires expert analysis of the statistical basis for the apparent differences and their biological significance. These data have been analysed independently by expert groups in the United Kingdom and at the European Food Safety Authority, who have concluded that the results of the study are not indicative of adverse effects due to the consumption of MON 863 maize.

Notes:<br>

(a) -1, -2, -3, 1, 2, 3 shows that data refers to 1, 2 or 3 previous or following year(s).<br>

(b) Obesity rates are defined as the percentage of the population with a BMI over 30. The BMI is a single number that evaluates an individual&#039;s weight status in relation to height (weight/height<sup>(27)</sup> , with weight in kilograms and height in metres).<br>

(c) For Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, figures are based on health examinations, rather than self-reported information. Obesity estimates derived from health examinations are generally higher and more reliable than those coming from self-reports, because they preclude any misreporting of people&#039;s height and weight. However, health examinations are only conducted regularly in a few countries.<br>

<i>[holding answer 20 June 2005]:</i> For men who suspect that they have chlamydia, diagnoses and treatment are provided through genitor-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics. The public health White Paper, &quot;Choosing Health&#151;making healthy choices easier&quot; published in November 2004 sets out a number of measures to improve access to, and modernise, GUM services. These measures are backed by &#163;130 million additional revenue and capital investment over three years, and will support clinics in moving towards the target of maximum 48 hour waiting times for clinic appointments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50705w36.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_225">In terms of detecting asymptomatic chlamydia infection, the Department&#039;s policy is to promote greater uptake of chlamydia testing and treatment through the national chlamydia screening programme. This opportunistic programme targets sexually active men and women under 25, who are most at risk of infection. We recognise that there are particular challenges in encouraging young men to access chlamydia screening as they do not attend health services as regularly as young women. We are, therefore, encouraging local programmes to evaluate which venues work best in terms of screening young men, for example colleges, workplaces and sports facilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50705w36.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_226">Young men and women are also targeted with information about chlamydia through our national sexual health media campaigns, including a major new campaign to be launched later this year, as announced in the White Paper.

The White Paper, also included a commitment to accelerate the roll-out of the national chlamydia screening programme, with the goal of making this available across the country by March 2007, backed by investment of an extra &#163;80 million to achieve this aim.

Notes:<br>

1. The &quot;all persons&quot; column represents the average for men and women.<br>

2. The smoking attributable percentage data for PCTs provides figures relating to the percentage of deaths over 35 years of age from diseases related to smoking that are smoking attributable. Figures are provided for males, females and persons. The percentages are based on the estimate of smoking attributable mortality across the five years from 1998 to 2002 and the observed deaths, from those over 35, for 1998 to 2002.<br>





3. The estimates of smoking attributable mortality as a percentage of all deaths are derived in the following way:<br>

a) For London PCTs, the percentages are based on the estimate of smoking attributable mortality across five years of data from 1998 to 2002 and the observed number of deaths from all causes, all ages across these same five years.<br>

b) For all other PCTs, the percentage is based on the annual average estimate of smoking attributable mortality across 1998 to 2002 and the observed number of deaths from all causes, all ages for 2002.The percentage is based on the annual average estimate of smoking attributable mortality across 1998&#150;2002 and the observed number of deaths from all causes, all ages for 2002.<br>

The systematic review of water fluoridation undertaken by the University of York identified over 3,000 reports of research projects on fluoridation of which 735 met their criteria for inclusion in their study. The researchers did not find any evidence of an association between water fluoridation and bone cancer, but we are not complacent and are committed to strengthening the evidence base. In this context, we have been informed by the oral health division of the Centers for Disease Control that the author of the thesis has invited them to review her findings as part of the peer review process conducted before a research study is published. We have asked to be kept informed.

 Antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) have been available to the courts since one April 1999. From commencement up to 31 May 2000 data were collected, on aggregate numbers only, by police force area. From copies of the orders received, since 1 June 2000, we are able to determine the local government authority areas in which restrictions are imposed. The number of ASBOs issued, as notified to the Home Office, in the local government authority area of Dacorum borough council, in which the Hemel Hempstead constituency is situated, from 1 June 2000 to 30 September 2005 (latest available) is seven.

 Information on the total number of asylum seekers currently in the UK, including failed asylum seekers, is not available. This could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records. In addition some applicants may leave the United Kingdom without informing the Immigration Service. E-borders and ID cards will enable us to monitor this more precisely in the future. The Home Office published on 30 June, the outcome of the assessment of the applicability to the UK of the methods used by researchers and Government agencies in other countries to estimate the size of the illegal population. The methods had been identified in the report by the Migration Research Unit (MRU) of University College London on &quot;Sizing the Illegally Resident Population in the UK&quot;.

As in other countries, the number of &quot;unauthorised&quot; or &quot;illegal&quot; migrants&#151;including failed asylum seekers&#151;in the UK is unknown. The MRU report published last year reviewed the methods used in other countries and assessed their viability for use in the UK. That report suggested that a method which could be applied in the UK is the &quot;residual method&quot; used in the United States. The new report details how that method has been applied in the UK. It must be emphasised that, while this method is one that can be used with data available for the UK, over-reliance must not be placed on this result in the absence of the means to produce other estimates using different methods.

 The Immigration Nationality Directorate (IND) does not recognise the term &quot;illegal asylum seeker&quot;. It is not illegal to seek asylum. However, a proportion of those who enter or remain in the United Kingdom illegally will subsequently seek asylum. IND will treat as an offender liable to be removed any person who has entered the United Kingdom without permission or who has obtained permission to enter the country by deception or who has overstayed. However, where a person states that they have a fear of return to their country of origin and claims asylum, the application is considered in the light of all the known circumstances before any action to remove is undertaken. Illegal entrants and overstayers are liable to detention or may be granted temporary admission with conditions to reside at a particular address and report regularly to an immigration reporting centre while their asylum claim is under consideration.

In the 2003 OCJS one in 10 incidents reported (10 per cent.) were committed when the offender had taken alcohol. Across offences as a whole, 6 per cent. of offenders said what happened was at least partly due to being drunk, when asked for their motivation for offending. A much higher proportion of criminal damage incidents (26 per cent.) and vehicle related thefts (16 per cent.) were attributed to drunkenness than violent incidents (7 per cent).

Figures are available within the suite of Strategic Performance Indicators for the police, relating to domestic violence &quot;incidents&quot; notified by police forces in England and Wales, however this is whether or 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Jul 2005 : Column 383W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
not they are subsequently recorded as crimes. The British Crime Survey (BCS) routinely provides information on the number of incidents of domestic violence against men and women (but not on the actual number of victims), but this is not broken down by age (see the following table). The 2003&#150;04 BCS estimated that there were, in total, 298,000 incidents of domestic violence against women in England and Wales, and 150,000 against men. The number of incidents of domestic violence as measured by the BCS has decreased by 42 per cent. from 1999 to 2003&#150;04 BCS interviews. The BCS figures are estimates only. As they are derived from a sample they are subject to sampling error, also the context of the face-to-face BCS interview means the estimates are certain to be underestimates of the true extent due to the fact that some respondents may be unwilling to reveal experience of domestic violence to interviewers. To address this, self-completion components for those aged 16&#150;59 on domestic violence have been included in the 1996, 2001, 2004&#150;05, and 2005&#150;06 BCS. Results from the 2001 BCS self-completion module on domestic violence were published in Home Office Research Study No. 276, deposited in the Library. This more confidential approach to measurement, revealed prevalence (percentage of population victim at least once) rates for last year domestic assault that were approximately five times higher than in the main face-to-face BCS. This report also provides the prevalence risk of domestic violence for men and women by age group (Table 5.12). This showed that risk of victimisation generally decreased with age, for both men and women.

<i>[holding answer 23 June 2005]:</i> Statistics on the number of persons charged with an offence are not collected centrally. Offences involving domestic violence are not identifiable on the Home Office Court Proceedings database as no specific statute covers such offences. Prosecutions brought might range from common assault to homicide depending on the level of violence, and as the circumstances of the offences for which prosecutions are brought are not collected centrally, offences involving domestic violence cannot be distinguished from other offences within these categories. However, we have now developed a new Key Diagnostic Indicator with the Crown Prosecution Service that will complement the new Compass Case Management System, to track domestic violence cases. This new indicator was implemented in April 2005.

 We received around 4,500 responses to the consultation paper on firearms controls. These have all been read and analysed and we are considering how we want to proceed.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what research he has commissioned into the link between gun and drug crime.  [3702]</p>




<p><a name="st_43"><a name="50705w42.html_spnew0"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The Home Office sponsored New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) survey, which involved interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, included questions on carrying guns. A paper based on the data has been published by T H Bennett and K Holloway, &quot;Possession and use of illegal guns among criminals in England and Wales&quot; (Howard Journal of Criminal Justice, Vol 43, No three, pp 237&#150;252). The Home Office has also conducted an arrestee survey which may highlight this issue. The results of this survey will be published later this year. There have also been discussions in the context of the Home Secretary&#039;s round table on gun crime, which has looked at possible links and appropriate interventions. This research is used to inform policy and legislative proposals. The Violent Crime Reduction Bill includes a number of measures designed to further tighten the firearms legislation, including a ban on the manufacture, import or sale of realistic imitation firearms, an increase from a maximum of six to 12 months sentence for carrying an imitation firearm in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, and an increase in the minimum age for possession of an air weapon to 18. The Bill also includes a new offence of using another person to look after, hide or transport a dangerous weapon. These measures complement existing legislation and demonstrate our determination to tackle gun crime.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he expects all families who have applied for indefinite leave to remain under the one-off exercise to allow families who have been in the UK for at least three years to stay to be informed of the decision.  [7469]</p>




<p><a name="st_46"><a name="50705w42.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 It is not possible to provide a precise time scale of when all those currently being considered under the exercise will have had a decision made on their case. The time it takes to reach a decision depends both on individual circumstances and on the number of cases in the consideration process. Sometimes people do not complete the Family ILR Exercise Questionnaire properly, or fail to provide the documentation requested. The checks we conduct on potentially eligible applicants can also take some time to complete, depending on individual circumstances. We also encounter a number of complex cases that can take some time to resolve. The main factor, though, which makes providing a meaningful completion date for the exercise difficult, is the substantial number of cases we still have to consider. In addition, cases we had not previously identified for consideration under the exercise continue to come to light which we are also required to respond to. We are hoping to have completed consideration of the majority of cases by the end of April 2006. Key statistics relating to the Family ILR Exercise were published as part of the quarterly asylum statistics on 17 May. These show the current status of the exercise up to and including 31 March 2005 and are available to the public on the Home Office (HO) Research Development and Statistics (RDS) website. The full web address is:www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html. These statistics will be updated in August to cover the second quarter of 2005.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will seek to change the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Jul 2005 : Column 404W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
legislation relating to the drinking of alcohol to make it an offence to drink in public if a person is under the age of 18.  [3892]</p>




<p><a name="st_71"><a name="50705w46.html_spnew2"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The Government carried out a fundamental review of the alcohol licensing regime which resulted in the Licensing Act 2003. The suggestion that a change to the legislation relating to the drinking of alcohol to make it an offence to drink in public if a person is under the age of 18 did not feature in the responses to the public consultation on those proposals, nor during the passage of the Bill through Parliament. The Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997, as amended by the Licensing Act 2003 to allow the confiscation of sealed containers, already provides the police with a power of confiscation where young people are drinking on the street. The 1997 Act was designed to allow the police to deal with situations where drinking causes a nuisance to others or may lead to further bad behaviour. It does not create an offence for a young person to have an alcoholic drink in a public place and the police are not under a duty to confiscate alcohol from underage drinkers. During the course of the legislation, Parliament made it clear that it did not wish the power to be used where young people&#039;s drinking was not perceived to be a problem, for instance at a family picnic.

 The Violent Crime Reduction Bill provides for exemptions to be made from the charge in Alcohol Disorder Zones, where the principal use to which the premises is put do not include alcohol, and the availability of alcohol is not the main reason why individuals enter or remain on the premises. The intention is to exclude restaurants from the charge. Providing that a hotel also met the above criteria, then the establishment would be exempt from the charge.
