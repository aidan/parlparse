<a name="70520w01.html_wqn0"><B> Rev. W. Martin Smyth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the health needs of those with Gulf War Syndrome. [608]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Government are committed to discharging their responsibilities to those who served their country in the Gulf and are now suffering ill health. They are, accordingly, determined to make a fresh start in ensuring that the health needs of Gulf veterans are met. In order better to understand their concerns, I have invited Gulf veteran's representatives into the Ministry of Defence for a meeting on 29 May.
<P>

<a name="70520w01.html_para0">In the meantime, I have already announced a range of measures to improve my Department's response to their concerns. I have directed that additional resources be made available to clear the backlog of patients waiting to be seen by my Department's Medical Assessment Programme. This aims to provide all those who believe that they are ill as a result of their service in the Gulf with a clinical diagnosis of their medical condition so that appropriate treatment can be recommended to their doctor. This will ensure that my Department more urgently responds to the health needs of Gulf veterans.
<P>

<a name="70520w01.html_para1">In addition, I have announced that research will be undertaken into the possible interaction between the vaccinations and Nerve Agent Pre-Treatment Sets given to our troops to protect against the very real threat of biological or chemical attack. This, together with the two epidemiological studies into the prevalence of ill health amongst Gulf veterans which my Department is already funding, will allow us better to understand the health needs of Gulf veterans.

<a name="70520w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what proposals he has to increase the number of employees from ethnic minorities within his Department.[238]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 As part of its overall commitment to equal opportunities my Department has in place a substantial range of measures aimed at increasing the proportion of civilian staff employed from ethnic minorities. These include: outreach work by recruitment staffs among the ethnic communities; contact with them through careers fairs and schools; targeted job advertising; the inclusion of welcoming statements in job adverts; ethnicity monitoring and numerical targets in the Departmental Management Plan. In addition, my Department has sponsored a number of Windsor Fellows in recent years and is a member of the "Race for Opportunity" campaign. Future proposals for action in respect of civilian employees will emerge from work currently being undertaken to take forward the implementation of the recommendations of a recent study into MOD's ethnic minority employment initiatives.

<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. John Cryer: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans he has to erect a memorial to Britain's post-1945 National Servicemen. [174]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has no plans to erect a memorial to Britain's post-war National Servicemen.
<P>

<a name="70520w01.html_para2">It has been a long-standing policy of successive Governments that the cost of memorials is usually met not from public funds but from private donations or public subscription.
<P>

<a name="70520w01.html_para3">In the event that such funding were to be found, my Department would be happy to assist in identifying a suitable site and to provide representation at any dedication ceremony.

<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is his Department's policy on the limited use of nuclear weapons to warn an aggressor. [257]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Government fully support NATO policy on the continuing requirement for a sub-strategic capability as a crucial element of credible deterrence. In extreme circumstances of self-defence such a capability would allow the limited use of nuclear weapons to send an aggressor a political message of the Alliance's resolve to defend itself.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what discussions his Department or its agents or

consultants have had with Tilshead Parish Council on the <i>(a)</i> choice of route, <i>(b)</i> construction and <i>(c)</i> management of the southern range road in Salisbury Plain Training Area. [92]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 All Parish Councils affected by the Southern Range Road, including Tilshead, were informed about the proposals and the consultation process in April 1996. Following this, the Works Project Sponsor and his consultant visited representatives of Tilshead Parish Council on 13 May 1996 to discuss route selection and answer queries on other aspects of the proposal. The Project Sponsor and his consultant visited representatives of Tilshead Parish Council again on 18 December 1996, the date on which my Department submitted a Notice of Planned Development to the three District Councils involved, to inform them of the chosen route and to answer any further queries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the authorities, agencies, organisations, companies and individuals who have had <i>(a)</i> correspondence and <i>(b)</i> meetings with his officials or agents to discuss the future use of the Chilmark section of the former RAF Chilmark. [93]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The following authorities have all been involved in discussions over the future of the Chilmark section of RAF Chilmark: Wiltshire County Council, Chilmark Parish Council, Dinton Parish Council, Sutton Mandeville Parish Council, Wiltshire Wildlife Trust, the Rural Development Commission, English Nature, English Heritage and the Environment Agency. I am withholding information on the companies and individuals who have expressed an interest in the site for reasons of commercial confidentiality under exemption 7 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will ensure the fullest possible consultation with elected representatives and other authorities prior to any decisions being taken on the future of the Broughton Moor former RNAD dump. [586]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 A decision on the method of disposal is not anticipated for some time. Full consultations with elected representatives and other authorities will be undertaken on the future of the former RNAD Broughton Moor before any decision is taken.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Rhodri Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the principal steps taken by his Department to clarify responsibility for registering the death of Rudolf Hess and for providing proper certification of it. [759]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Following an approach by the Hess family in 1995, it was found that the record of Rudolf Hess's death had been incorrectly passed to the General Register Office under a statute which was not applicable. The registration, which had not previously been questioned, was therefore cancelled by the Registrar General after consulting my Department and the Foreign and 



<P>
<P><I>20 May 1997 : Column: 26</I><P>
Commonwealth Office. This decision does not, however, affect the validity of the death certificate, which was issued as the result of an autopsy conducted under arrangements agreed by the Four Powers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what arrangements were in force under the relevant quadripartite agreements to carry out <i>(a)</i> an autopsy and <i>(b)</i> certification of cause of death as regards deaths of prisoners in Spandau prison at the time of the death of Rudolf Hess. [761]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Under arrangements agreed in 1983, by which time Hess was the only remaining prisoner in Spandau prison, an autopsy was conducted by a British pathologist at the British Military Hospital in Berlin in the presence of observers representing the Four Powers. Responsibility for certifying the cause of death lay with the pathologist.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if the quadripartite agreement of 20 March 1952 governing deaths of prisoners in Spandau prison (HCOM/P(152)17) was still in force at the time of the death of Rudolf Hess. [760]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w01.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 We are aware of a document with the reference HICOM/P(52)17. This was not a quadripartite agreement but a discussion paper drawn up by the Law Committee of the Allied High Commission Germany. As such, it was not in force at any time.

<P>
<a name="70520w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many <i>(a)</i> service and <i>(b)</i> Ministry of Defence civilian personnel were employed at bases and establishments in Yorkshire and Humberside (i) in 1979, (ii) in 1992 and (iii) at the latest date for which figures are available. [599]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The strengths of service and Ministry of Defence permanent civilian personnel employed at bases and establishments in Yorkshire and Humberside at the given dates are as follows:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
(i) 1979--13,900 service; 10,300 civilian.
<BR>
(ii) 1992--15,800 service; 5,500 civilian.
<BR>
(iii) 1996--12,200 service; 3,300 civilian.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70520w02.html_para0">The strengths refer to situation date 1 July except for 1979 civilian strength which refer to 1 January. 1 July 1996 is the latest date available. Civilian numbers are full-time equivalents. In 1979 and 1992 part timers were counted as half of full time. In 1996 they were counted by the proportion of conditioned hours worked.

<P>
<a name="70520w02.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 In recruiting staff, DFEE aims to ensure that vacancies are brought to the attention of all groups in the community, including people from ethnic minorities. To achieve this, the Department has used a range of methods including advertising vacancies in publications which are widely read by people from ethnic minorities; direct recruitment in universities with high numbers of students from ethnic minorities; and asking Job Centres recruiting on its behalf to use outreach methods to make all groups aware of vacancies, for example through local community organisations and educational institutions. The Department will continue to make appropriate use of such methods, and to monitor their effectiveness.

 Responsibility for this matter has been delegated under the terms of its framework document to the Property Advisers to the Civil Estate (PACE) under its Chief Executive, Mr. Malcolm Bowles. The Agency is therefore responding to this question.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
You will know from our letters to you, dated 29 April 1996 and 22 January 1997, that PACE has responsibility for Archway Tower which is held on a lease by the Secretary of State for the Environment and would need extensive modernisation and refurbishment prior to re-use as offices.
<BR>
The annual cost of holding the building is approximately &#163;1,100,000 including security and maintenance. In addition, renovation works are shortly to be carried out to the ground floor exterior and approaches, to accord with the London Borough of Islington's Urban Design Strategy for Archway and to improve the prospects of disposal.
<BR>
Letting agents are appointed to dispose of the lease for offices but demand is coming significantly from residential developers. Discussions are continuing with the owners of the property and the local planning authority to consider a change of use of the building to residential. In order to leave no stone unturned, the possibility of a joint disposal with our landlords is as you know also being actively pursued by our consultants.

 Professor James' report was published on 8 May, and welcomed by the Prime Minister as an excellent foundation upon which the Government could build. The Prime Minister added that we need to create a structure that is open and transparent, and which acts--and is seen to act--in the interests of consumers.
<P>

<a name="70520w03.html_para2">The Prime Minister has established a new Ministerial Group on Food Safety, which I will chair, to take forward Professor James' proposals. Members will include Ministers from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Department of Health, the Cabinet Office, the Scottish Office, the Welsh Office and the Northern Ireland Office. As a first step the Government are consulting widely on Professor James' Report. Consultees have been invited to send their comments to the Cabinet Office by 20 June.
<P>

 The Government support market testing as one means to secure better value for money in the provision of public services.
<P>

<a name="70520w04.html_para0">Initial steps in the market testing process are to identify the feasibility and scope of services subject to market testing, and to check whether the potential value for money gains are sufficient to outweigh the costs of testing the market.

<P>

<a name="70520w04.html_para1">KPMG have now delivered their report, and I have considered it carefully. The touchstone must be value for money, that is achieving the most efficient and cost-effective method of delivering the forecast.
<P>

<a name="70520w04.html_para2">After extensive consultations, both inside and outside the Treasury, KPMG have noted that the quality of Treasury forecast output is generally perceived to be high, and that a decision to opt for an outside provider is unlikely to turn on this issue. In considering whether the market test would yield better value for money, KPMG have advised that the balance of potential resource savings and costs would not justify a market test. A copy of the KPMG report will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="70520w04.html_para3">In the interests of securing best value for money, I am content to accept the KPMG advice, on merit, that the Treasury's forecasting function should not be subject to market testing, because in this case market testing would not lead to savings. I am concerned, however, to ensure that the forecasting function remains of high quality, and that it is carried out with the greatest efficiency. I intend to set rigorous targets for achieving that. With this in mind, I have noted that KPMG outlined possible internal reforms designed to use Treasury forecasting staff more flexibly and broaden their experience. I have asked my officials to pursue these suggestions.

 The Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Edinburgh will consider a report on Commonwealth membership criteria.

 We welcome the successful completion of parliamentary elections in Yemen last month. They marked a further step in Yemen's recovery since the damaging civil war of 1994. Yemen's democracy is young, and although there were some irregularities, the international observers concluded that, on balance, the elections were "reasonably free and fair". We welcome this, and look forward to future co-operation with the new Yemeni Government and Parliament.

 The sale price is commercial in confidence and the use likely to be allowable for the site under Tower Hamlets' development plan and following the planning inquiry held last year. The sale was announced by the LDDC on 12 May as "unconditional" which means solely that it was a straight sale without restrictive covenants. The new owners cannot build what they like on the land and they must gain approval for any development through the normal planning process. The planning authority for the Hermitage Riverside site is Tower Hamlets.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w07.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Government do not require local authorities, or other interested sectors, to provide returns detailing Local Agenda 21 expenditure. There would be considerable methodological difficulties in trying to identify such expenditure because sustainable development is essentially about carrying out existing functions, including planning and economic development, in ways that are environmentally sustainable.
<P>

<a name="70520w07.html_para1">The Government's support for Local Agenda 21 includes modest funding for the co-ordinating and promotional work of the Local Government Management Board. But the bulk of Government funding for local authorities and others for projects in line with Local Agenda 21 principles is associated with other mechanisms such as regeneration programmes or the Environmental Action Fund.
<P>

<a name="70520w07.html_para2">The Government are determined to work in partnership with all sectors of society in pursuit of sustainable development. Local Agenda 21 initiatives, involving local authorities, business, the voluntary and community sectors, have a vital contribution to make. The UK is generally acknowledged to be one of the leaders in the field, with 70 per cent. of its local authorities committed to Local Agenda 21, and it is to be hoped that next month's UN Special Session will encourage other countries to make similar progress.

<a name="70520w08.html_para0"><i>Letter from R. M. Bradley to Mr. Alex Salmond, dated 20 May 1997:</i>
<P>

<a name="70520w08.html_para1">The Secretary of State for Transport has asked me to reply to your Question, transferred from the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, about the safety training of crew working on UK registered fishing vessels and to your Question, transferred from the Secretary of State for Scotland, about fishing vessel compliance with safety regulations.

The onus for complying with the Fishing Vessels (Safety Training) Regulations 1989 rests on the individuals concerned and on the skippers and owners of their vessels. We do not hold data on which crew members meet the requirements and which do not (those crew members born before 1 March 1954 do not need to meet the requirements) but we have asked the Seafish Industry Authority for advice on the information held in their database about fishermen who have undergone safety training.
<BR>
The Marine Safety Agency monitors compliance with all fishing vessel safety regulations by means of inspections of the vessels. If such an inspection finds non-compliance the vessel may be detained and the owner and the skipper can be prosecuted. In the particular case of safety training regulations, if any of the crew members do not comply, the owner of the vessel, the skipper and the individuals concerned can be prosecuted.

 The Government's concerns about the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority report have been put to the Channel Tunnel Intergovernmental Commission (IGC) by the UK delegation. As a result the IGC has requested from Eurotunnel a detailed timetable of its programme for meeting the Safety Authority recommendations for consideration by the IGC at its next meeting on 22 May 1997.

 Since the incident of the 18 November 1996, the undersea crossover doors have been subject to an enhanced testing and maintenance regime by Eurotunnel, which will continue. This has achieved a much higher level of reliability than previously obtained. The test reports are regularly examined by the Channel

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority has taken to ensure that Eurotunnel had full safety training and audits in place for its staff. [59]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70520w08.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jackson: </B> 
 Safety training is one of the key elements identified by the Safety Authority in Eurotunnel's proposals for the restart of HGV shuttle services. The Safety Authority will carefully examine Eurotunnel's reports on their certification of staff trained in new procedures, including the report of an independent assessor, before making any recommendation to the Intergovernmental Commission.
<P>

<a name="70520w08.html_para2">More generally, the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority and its specialist working groups meet regularly with Eurotunnel to review the safe operation of the Channel Tunnel. The Safety Authority also has 22 safety inspectors available from national authorities who conduct regular safety inspections and check the performance of Eurotunnel's Safety Directorate.

 Travel concessions for ex-BREL staff are a matter for ADtranz (ABB Daimler Benz Transportation Ltd.).
<P>

<a name="70520w08.html_para3">In privatisation resulting from the Railways Act 1993, travel entitlements for staff in post prior to 31 March 1996 were contained in contracts of employment which transferred to the new employers under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981. Travel concessions for staff taken on by these employers after 31 March 1996 are a matter for the employer. Travel concessions for railways staffing privatisation before this Act were separately negotiated for each sale.

 Our manifesto emphasised the crucial part we expect public/private partnerships to play in our spending plans. Our policy is to improve the private finance initiative in the national health service by taking forward the proposals set out in our 12-point plan in our business manifesto and we have already introduced the NHS (Private Finance) Bill which aims to ensure that NHS trusts have the statutory power to enter into PFI contracts. This will provide the private sector with the reassurance it needs to enter into PFI contracts and enable the major whole-hospital PFI schemes which have already signed commercial contracts to proceed to financial close.

 The objective of resource allocation is to promote equity through the use of a capitation formula which weights the population for the effects of:

 The total payments to Camden and Islington health authority for the years 1992-93 to 1997-98 are shown in the table. Health authorities' cash limited revenue allocations are informed by the national weighted capitation formula, not by their own estimates of need. The non-cash-limited funding is demand led.
