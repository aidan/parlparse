[78798]</p><p><a name="06061946000041"><b><a name="06061946000257">Dr.
Howells:</b> My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has
had no discussions with her US counterparts regarding proposals to
crop-spray in Afghanistan. The Government of Afghanistan&#146;s
eradication policy, as set out in the National Drug Control Strategy,
is based on ground based eradication targeted where there is access to
legal rural livelihoods. The UK has no plans to undertake or support
aerial
eradication.</p><p><a name="06061946000042">Eradication
on its own will not solve the drugs problem in Afghanistan. It is a
useful deterrent where there is access to legal livelihoods. But
tackling the drugs trade requires a range of activities including
arresting and convicting the traffickers who profit from the trade, and
putting in place the development programmes which enable farmers to
move away from growing poppy. That is why the UK is spending
&#163;270 million over a three-year period on supporting the
Government of Afghanistan&#146;s National Drug Control
Strategy.</p><p><a name="06061946000043"><b><a name="06061946000258">Mr.

alternatives to farmers who grow poppy in Helmand Province. When in
Afghanistan last week, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for
International Development announced a UK contribution of &#163;30
million over the next three years in Helmand. However, whether farmers
choose to pursue alternative livelihoods to poppy in Helmand also
depends on effective law enforcement and a credible threat of
eradication. That is why the UK is supporting the multifaceted approach
set out in the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy. We believe that
the focus on the four key priorities&#151;targeting the trafficker,
strengthening livelihoods, reducing demand and developing effective
institutions will together have a greater impact on the drug
trade.</p><p><a name="06061946000045">In

individual financial assessment to calculate how much each individual
can afford to pay towards the cost of their care, it is entirely a
matter for each individual and their advisors to decide how best to
meet any charges. Current Northern Ireland legislation provides a
12-week disregard of the value of a residents home following permanent
admission to a care home. I am not, however, proposing to promote
amending legislation to totally exclude the value of a resident's

priorities by introducing regular and systematic "face the people"

benefit biodiversity including: a national Biodiversity Action Plan
(BAP) has been introduced across the public sector operated Prisons
Estate, primarily an overarching document covering its designated
sites, which encompass seven SSSIs, 1NNR and RAMSAR site and a site
within a National Park (HMP Dartmoor). There are now six individual
designated sites which have their own BAPs, a further 11 locally
biodiversity significant sites also have BAPs and a pilot scheme for
eight inner-city/urban BAPs is being implemented. Further plans are now
being incorporated that will see biodiversity management plans rolled
out across the remaining public sector prison
estate.</p><p><a name="0606206000211">As well as a
BAP network the public sector Prison Service has in place a Statement
of Commitment for biodiversity and a Statement of Action for
biodiversity which were signed by the Director General Phil Weatley in
March 2003. Also supporting this the Prison Service has set up a
strategic biodiversity group which involves a "central partnership"
incorporating representatives from English Nature, the Wildlife Trusts,
the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the British Trust for
Conservation
Volunteers.</p><p><a name="0606206000212">In support
of this work the Prison Service has carried out biological surveys at
21 biodiversity significant sites to identify local flora and fauna for
action. The service has now put in place over 43 habitat and species
action plans involving over 20 separate lead
partners.</p><p><a name="0606206000213">In
recognition of the work that has been carried out on the prison estate

Coaker</b><i> [holding answer 15 June 2006]: </i>We are not
aware of there being any safe houses specifically for accommodating
victims of child trafficking. However, there are accommodation
facilities in many locations that will cater for children in need who
it is believed may have been trafficked. Planning for children's
services is carried out on a locality basis throughout the UK. It is
the statutory duty of local authorities under the 1989 Children Act to
ensure that safe arrangements are in place to look after individual
children at risk, including children from
abroad.</p><p><a name="0606206000541">It is also the
responsibility of the local authority to assess any risk of harm and to
arrange for the provision of a suitable range of accommodation for all
the children in their area. Any lone child in the UK in contact with
any statutory or child welfare agency will be urgently referred to the
appropriate local authority. The Home Office National Asylum Support
Service (NASS) reimburses local authorities who receive unaccompanied
asylum seeking children (UASC) into their care with a total of
&#163;140 million p.a. Partnership plans to provide safer
arrangements for children who have been trafficked are being
incorporated in a Home Office/DfES joint review of how local
authorities accommodate children from
abroad.</p><p><a name="0606206000542">The review will
aim to deliver improvements by ensuring UASCs are placed in local
authority areas where specialist services are in place&#151;including
local authority social workers who can recognise and deal appropriately
with UASCs who may have been trafficked to the UK. The review is also
designed to increase specialisation, end inconsistencies in treatment
and enable the retention and development of
expertise.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0606206000026">Illegal

with the Information Commissioner, was published in March 2006. This

is no longer adequate or up to date; or it is excessive or not
proportionate to the
risk.</p><p><a name="0606206000628">The guidance
states that all records will normally be held for a minimum of six

deciding whether to retain records for longer. The MOP guidance states
that historical data&#151;which it defines as anything recorded prior
to the date that the guidance came into effect&#151;must be reviewed
when the subject of a record comes to police attention, and that
resources dedicated to reviewing other historical records should focus
on information relating to certain public protection

1,671 for 2003 and 1,712 in 2004. The information requested on arrests
is not available centrally. There are a number of ways in which private
security offices may engage with local police forces. Usually this is
through active involvement with crime reduction partnerships, many of
which are tailored specifically to address the needs of the business
sector. The Home Office has supported the work of the British Retail
Consortium in developing business crime reduction partnerships, and has
provided over &#163;900,000 of funding for them to set up and run the
Action Against Business Crime (AABC) Group. This Group provides central
co-ordination and support for a national network of business crime
reduction partnerships in town centres, shopping centres and industrial
estates across England and Wales in their work to prevent business
crime. The Home Office also encourages businesses to set up
&#145;Business Watch&#146; schemes in their area, or to consider
involvement in the business improvement district (BID) scheme. There is
an accredited Business Crime Partnership in the &#145;Safer
Swansea&#146; Community Safety Partnership. One of the first actions
of the partnership was to set up a panel which included local
businesses and independent members to consider whether those caught
shoplifting should be banned from the city centre shopping area. The
scheme has been successful and will be rolled out to other retail sites
in the borough. Additionally, South Wales police have been actively
promoting the ShopWatch scheme in Swansea, which encourages shop staff

1. Estimates of the numbers eligible are given as ranges in order to
account for possible biases inherent in estimates from data that is
less than perfect. They also take account of the effects of sampling
variation.  2. Estimates cover all those aged 60 and over in
the private household population of Great Britain. The data source is
the Family Resources Survey.  3. As pension credit was
introduced mid-way through 2003-04, estimates of the numbers entitled
in 2003-04 are only based on six months&#146; data, and should
therefore be treated with caution.  4. For the purposes of
this analysis, the unit of analysis is the benefit unit. This is either
a single person aged at least 60 years old or, if a couple, both will
be termed pensioners if one is aged at least 60 years old. This is
consistent with both the definition used in &#147;Income Related
Benefits Estimates of Take-up&#148; publications, and with the fact
any individual aged 60 or over is entitled to pension credit. 
5. The data source for eligibility estimates is the Family Resources
Survey. Estimates of eligibility for 2005-06 and 2006-07 are based on
the Family Resources Survey data for 2003-04 and 2004-05, with incomes
and benefits projected forward into the future in order to estimate the
eligibility for each pensioner household on the survey. They are
calibrated to the 2004-05 National Statistics estimates of
non-eligibility to pension credit, which adjust 2004-05 Family
Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in
reporting.  6. The latest estimates of the take-up of pension
credit can be found in the DWP report entitled &#147;Pension Credit
Estimates of Take-Up in 2004/2005&#148;. Copies of the publication
are available in the Library.  7. Estimates have been rounded
to the nearest hundred thousand.  8. Projections of
eligibility may be adjusted following publication of future editions of
the National Statistics take-up
estimates.<br></td></tr></table><br><table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="2"><i> Table

protection offered to scheme members when these events occur. It
provides a mechanism for the trustees to be able to take action to
pursue the debt. It also means that employers will be liable for a debt

Defined-benefit schemes are schemes where all the benefits (other than
benefits secured by additional voluntary contributions) are on a
defined-benefit basis. Such benefits are most commonly based on factors
such as earnings or length of service. The survey does not separately
identify final salary schemes, which are a type of defined-benefit

in prisons provide prisoners with interviews with Jobcentre Plus
Advisers prior to release to discuss employment and training
opportunities. Our Freshstart programme guarantees a pre-arranged
interview for prisoners who wish to claim Jobseeker&#146;s Allowance
as soon as possible on release at which jobs, training and benefits are
discussed.</p><p><a name="06062014000242">Offenders,
together with others facing the most severe disadvantage in the labour
market, are included in one of the priority groups within the Jobcentre
Plus target and performance structure. This ensures our advisers are
encouraged to provide particular help and support to people who have
additional barriers to work. Because of their disadvantage in the
labour market, offenders can also gain early entry into our New Deal
programme, which can provide them with the training and skills needed
to get a job.</p><p><a name="06062014000243">Our
progress2work LinkUP programme is designed to help those with multiple
disadvantage, including offenders and ex-offenders, overcome the
particular employment barriers they face. Jobcentre Plus Advisers and
other relevant agencies refer customers to specialist providers who
work with prisons and local probation services to encourage offenders
to make use of their services. The programme helps people get and
sustain employment and is currently available in 15 Jobcentre
