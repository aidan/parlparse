<P>
<a name="90125w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 As I told the House earlier today, <i>Official Report</i>, column 7, my Department has a programme of research into Gulf Veterans' illnesses covering four main areas. So far, about &#163;1.9m has been spent on these studies and we estimate that they will cost a further &#163;4m to complete.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what research he has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated concerning the health effects on service personnel of depleted uranium shells used in the Gulf War.  [64225]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence is currently funding four research programmes into different aspects of Gulf veterans' illnesses. However, none of these programmes is specifically aimed at investigating the relationship between possible exposure to depleted uranium (DU) and the illnesses being experienced by some Gulf veterans. The MOD has previously published the Defence Radiological Protection Service's (now the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency's Radiation Protection Service) 1993 assessment of the radiological and chemical hazards of DU. The MOD continues to monitor published research which may be relevant to the issue of Gulf veterans' illnesses, including any material concerning DU.
<P>

<a name="90125w01.html_para0">I have asked my Department to collate the information which it possesses concerning mechanisms which would be used to test for the presence of uranium in the human body. I will publish this work shortly.
<P>

<a name="90125w01.html_para1">The MOD is well aware that a link has been suggested between exposure to DU and Gulf veterans' illnesses. However, this is only one of a number of factors which have been suggested as causes of Gulf veterans' illnesses and, pending further medical and scientific evidence, my Department is keeping an open mind on this issue.

 We already provide a wide range of education and training opportunities for Armed Forces personnel. Our 'Learning Forces' initiative extends from recruitment to resettlement and beyond. It is a major contribution to the Government's commitment to improving educational opportunities and to ensuring that the qualifications Service personnel receive are fully recognised and transferable when they return to civilian life.

<P>
<a name="90125w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 This Government are fully committed to improving the present state of the Defence Medical Services. To this end, as I announced recently, an additional &#163;140 million pounds is being put into the Defence Medical Services as a result of the Strategic Defence Review. This sum is spread over the current financial year and the next three years to March 2002. We plan to maintain increased expenditure in subsequent years.

 Horseshoe Barracks and Old Ranges, including Gunners Park at Shoeburyness have been declared surplus to MOD's requirements and are now being prepared for disposal. A draft Planning Brief, which was subject to a public consultation exercise was approved by the Borough Council's Planning and Transportation Committee on 19 January and will be placed before the full Council on 25 February. Marketing of the site will begin once the Council have approved the brief. DERA are currently examining possible development opportunities at the New Ranges. Should any part of the New Ranges become surplus to MOD requirement, the Borough Council has suggested that it be the subject of a separate Planning Brief.

 We are fully committed to supporting the Cadet Forces. Our planned expenditure in the current financial year totals some &#163;58 million. As a further indication of its commitment, the Government previously announced an increase in cadet forces' expenditure of &#163;3 million over the next four years. This is in addition to up to &#163;12 million which will be made available in order to ensure that those cadet units affected by Reserve Forces' Restructuring announced within the Strategic Defence Review will be provided with alternative accommodation.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the effectiveness of Operation Desert Fox.  [65539]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 Operation Desert Fox was a success. It met our military objectives. We assess that 87 per cent. of targets were damaged or destroyed and that the ability of Saddam Hussein to make or use chemical and biological weapons or otherwise threaten his neighbours has been set back significantly. I have sent a full report on the effects of Operation Desert Fox to all Members and a copy has been placed in the Library of the House.

<a name="90125w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Blunt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is his estimate of the number of civilian casualties caused by the bombing of Iraq during December 1998.  [65480]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The risk of civilian casualties was a major consideration in selecting targets during Operation Desert Fox and only precision guided weapons were used where there was any risk of collateral damage. Indeed, Operation Desert Fox was the most accurate bombing campaign in which we have ever been involved. Whilst the Iraqi regime have prevented UN humanitarian workers from independently viewing all but a carefully selected few of the sites hit, we are confident that civilian casualties were minimal.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w01.html_wqn12"><B> Sir Peter Emery: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if the selection of targets during the recent bombing of Iraq was influenced by reports received from any member of UNSCOM.  [66001]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 January 1999]:</i> I do not discuss detailed operational issues and withhold such information under category 1a (National Security and Defence) of the Code of Conduct. Both the UK and US Governments have made it clear, however, that all information exchanges between themselves and UNSCOM have been strictly in pursuit of UNSCOM's mandate to dismantle Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction capability. Target selection for Operation Desert Fox was a very thorough and detailed process involving information from a wide variety of sources.

 Russia continues to maintain physical security arrangements at its nuclear weapon storage sites. Matters relating to tactical nuclear weapons are a subject of discussion in the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council. We and Allies continue to seek to develop the dialogue in this area. International efforts to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear materials are also co-ordinated through the International Atomic Energy Agency.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 We are firmly committed to addressing overstretch in the armed forces. We are taking a number of steps to increase recruitment to the armed forces which continues to improve for all three Services. The Army, in particular, anticipates meeting its challenging target for soldier recruitment this year, for the first time since 1991.
<P>

<a name="90125w02.html_para0">We are also making efforts to improve retention in the armed forces. Our new "Policy for the People" is designed to make the services a more attractive career, both for those already serving and for those considering joining. The Policy includes significant educational and training opportunities for service personnel, and improvements to Service life, for the forces themselves and their families.
<P>

<a name="90125w02.html_para1">In addition, the outcome of the Strategic Defence Review should reduce overstretch in the Services by improving the flexibility and operational effectiveness of the armed forces through better assignment of resources to commitments.

<P>
<a name="90125w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 HMS Norfolk was sent to Sierra Leone to demonstrate the UK's commitment to promoting peace and stability and to support our diplomatic and humanitarian efforts there. The ship is liaising with the Government of Sierra Leone and the Military Observer Group of the Economic Community of West African States forces. The ship's helicopter has already delivered some much-needed medical supplies provided by the UK Government to the devastated main hospital in Freetown. There are no plans for UK armed forces to become involved in the military conflict in support of the Government of Sierra Leone and the Military Observer Group of the Economic Community of West African States.
<P>

<a name="90125w02.html_para2">It is planned that the Royal Fleet Auxiliary tanker Oakleaf will re-supply HMS Norfolk on 26 January. We are using Oakleaf's spare container capacity to transport further humanitarian aid to Freetown provided by the UK Government.

One outcome of the Strategic Defence Review was our decision that each Trident submarine will carry a reduced load of 48 warheads. This is a 20 per cent. reduction in warheads carried.

 There are at present two Infantry battalion Headquarters in Wales, one in the North of the principality and the other in the South. The amalgamation of TA infantry units in Wales into one battalion will require only one of these headquarters in the future, necessitating a choice to be made between the two for the new TA Infantry battalion Headquarters. Taking into account the recommendation of the TAVRA, we decided that the Infantry battalion Headquarters should 



<P>

 <i>[holding answer 21 January 1999]:</i> The Common New Generation Frigate, CNGF, is a French/Italian/UK collaborative project, comprising of two programmes, the Horizon warship and the Principal Anti-Air Missile System--PAAMS. We have achieved satisfactory progress on PAAMS with our partners, but we require urgent and similar progress on the Horizon warship. We are looking to a successful outcome to the current difficulties; an affordable, effective warship and the establishment of a robust industrial structure to manage the development and build of the warship and its systems. The National Armament Directors met on 14 January 1999 to discuss, among other things, progress on CNGF. No final decisions have been taken, and industry has been asked to provide definitive responses on the areas of concern. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence intends to meet his French and Italian counterparts shortly to discuss these issues further. Clearly, if rapid progress on these matters is not forthcoming, we would need to consider the option of alternative strategies, including a national warship, to 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 1999 : Column: 9</I><P>
ensure that the Royal Navy's requirement is fulfilled. The departmental spend on the Horizon programme to the 31 December 1998 was &#163;75 million. The majority of this spend was on feasibility and assessment Studies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 A full costing of the move will depend on finalising what modifications are required at the Queensferry site, the cost of re-locating staff who transfer to the new location, the cost of any redundancies found to be necessary, and the cost of re-locating the HQ's equipment and vehicles. From the costings to date, it is already clear that running cost savings will arise from the co-location of HQ 101 Battalion REME at the Queensferry site.

 The Strategic Defence Review set out our plans to replace our existing aircraft carriers from 2012 with two larger new-generation carriers, each capable of operating up to 50 aircraft, fixed wing and helicopters.

The assessment phase is expected to be completed in 2003, paving the way for the full development and construction of the two new aircraft carriers.

<a name="90125w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 I do not believe that it is possible or worthwhile to attempt to establish the true cost of the Year 2000 preparations for the public sector as a whole given that each organisation assesses its costs in different ways. Typically departments' plans include the additional costs posed by the bug such as contractors, and new systems. They do not tend to include in house resources or routine system up-grades. I do publish the cost estimates for central Government and key elements of the public sector as part of the quarterly reports to Parliament. The total cost for central Government is estimated at &#163;400 million, and will be found from within existing budgets. This figure has remained fairly stable over the last year.

<P>
<a name="90125w05.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 January 1999]:</i> The Government made the fight against fraud one of the priorities of the UK Presidency of the EU, ensuring that it was kept high on the agenda. Priority was given to work on the recommendations of the High-Level Group on Organised Crime. Progress was reported to the Cardiff European Council, including conclusion of the pre- accession pact on organised crime with applicant countries, establishment of a European judicial network to improve practical co-operation and improvements to the mechanism for collecting and analysing data on organised crime. Progress was made on legislation to improve the working of the transit system and preparation of the new computerised transit system, aimed at making the Community transit system less vulnerable to fraud. Work continued on the SEM2000 initiative with measures to improve financial management and fight fraud both in the Commission managed programmes and in the 82 per cent. of the EC budget which is administered by Member States. The 19 May ECOFIN Council was devoted to financial management and anti-fraud issues including considering the annual Fight against fraud report and the Commission's anti-fraud work programme for 1998-99. The Council conclusions emphasised the importance of this work.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will publish figures for the total tax and social security contributions from 1997-98 to 2002-03 on the basis used in Table 4.5 of the July 1997 Red Book, HC 85.  [64638]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w05.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The figures for net taxes and social security contributions as a per cent. of GDP in table B9 of the Pre-Budget Report (PBR) are on a cash basis. The 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 1999 : Column: 18</I><P>
corresponding figures in table 4.5 of the July 1997 Financial Statement and Budget Report (FSBR) are on an accruals basis. Moving from a cash to an accruals basis requires the addition of accruals adjustments to the cash figures. Accruals adjustments for tax receipts were forecast to be about 0.1 per cent. of GDP in 1998-99, and to remain at about this level in each of the forecast years shown in table B9 of the PBR.
<P>

<a name="90125w05.html_para3">Under national accounts conventions at the time of the July 1997 FSBR, a small amount of MIRAS and of life assurance premium tax reliefs were scored as public expenditure. These amounts do not significantly affect the PBR tax/GDP ratio. The Working Families Tax Credit will only be introduced in October 1999 and hence no assumptions about its treatment were made at the time of the July 1997 FSBR.

 The Government have no intention of rejoining the ERM.

The Recommendation of the Commission under Article 109j(2) in March 1998 and the Decision of the Council under Article 109j(4) in May 1998 both avoided a mechanical approach to the application of the criteria, allowing for the exercise of judgment provided by the Treaty.

<P>

<a name="90125w07.html_para1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has further extended its support for the creation of a South Asia Regional Coral Reef Monitoring Network in Sri Lanka, Maldives and India, being a contribution to the global network sponsored by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). The programme has trained national managers to monitor the biophysical status of reef resources and the use of these resources by dependent coastal communities. DFID has also supported their participation in regional and international planning processes. An independent review in September 1998 concluded that the DFID/IOC programme has laid a very solid foundation for future development of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network.
<P>

<a name="90125w07.html_para2">A UK/Caribbean Regional Workshop in Jamaica during October 1998, funded by FCO and DFID, attracted representatives from 22 Caribbean States to consider the conservation status of marine biodiversity in the Caribbean including threats to the coral reefs of the region. The results of this Caribbean meeting were reported to the Second London Oceans Workshop sponsored by Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), attended by delegations from 40 countries, at which the keynote address by the Deputy Prime Minister focused on 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 1999 : Column: 23</I><P>
the central role of coral reefs as indicators of the health of the oceans, and on the need to take action to protect both reefs and other sensitive marine ecosystems.
<P>

<a name="90125w07.html_para3">During December 1998, DFID approved funding of &#163;0.6 million to extend for a further three year period the programme implemented by the International Centre for Living Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM) studying the social, economic and environmental benefits which have arisen from the protection of coral reefs in Jamaica and in British Virgin Islands.
<P>

<a name="90125w07.html_para4">DFID has also approved new support for the Coastal Resources Management Project providing advice to the Government of Turks and Caicos Islands for the protection and management of a marine protected area including some spectacular coral reefs, and the development of local capacity and infrastructure to ensure that this is a long sustained process.

<a name="90125w08.html_para1">The Government are keen to ensure that UK consumers are not disadvantaged by anti-competitive practices. The new Competition Act 1998 therefore gives the Director General tougher powers to investigate anti-competitive practices.

Agreement on FP5 marks a major step forward in Europe's research effort, opening up new opportunities for collaborative research tackling major European challenges relating to competitiveness and the quality of life. I look forward to continued strong participation by UK researchers.

The industry and the unions decided to take the initiative forward and have formed the Textiles and Clothing Strategy Group. My Department will provide the Group's secretariat. To ensure that the Group is wholly representative of the industry and its supply chain, the Group is to include representatives from trade associations, unions, the retail sector, manufacturing, academia and Government.

 The Government's policy on waste disposal, including used oils, is being reviewed as part of the review of the waste strategy. The consultation paper, Less Waste More Value (DETR 1998) sets out the policy that decisions on the management of waste should be based on the Best Practical Environmental Option (BPEO) with the waste management hierarchy as a guide to making decisions under this principle. Under the hierarchy the most effective solution is, usually, not to produce the waste at all. Failing that, value should be recovered from waste. In Less Waste More Value the Government set out their view that incineration with energy recovery should not be undertaken without consideration first being given to the possibility of 



<P>

 The introduction of catalytic converters on vehicles has been a major factor in reducing traffic pollution and contributing to improvements in air quality. The Government have a range of measures promoting cleaner vehicles, but these are not aimed either at favouring or displacing catalyst technology. Tighter exhaust emission standards to be introduced in 2000, with a further tightening in 2005 and beyond, will see an expansion of effective emission reduction technology on new petrol, diesel and gas powered vehicles. Catalysts are also a key factor in the development of future fuel cell technology. Only pure electric vehicles have no need for catalysts.

 <i>[holding answer 21 January 1999]:</i> All applications for consent to release GM crops are assessed on a case by case basis. The applicants for consent are required to submit evidence regarding the potential impact on the environment. This evidence may be based on the applicants own trials and on studies carried out by independent workers.
<P>

<a name="90125w12.html_para0">In deciding whether or not to grant consent, the Government are advised by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE). A consent would only be granted if the evidence suggests that the GMOs are unlikely to result in harm to human health and the environment occurring.
<P>

<a name="90125w12.html_para1">Further evidence is gathered through a Government funded research programme which investigates specific issues in order to underpin the risk assessment and decision making process.
<P>

<a name="90125w12.html_para2">An ACRE sub-group will be set up shortly to consider the wider biodiversity implications of the introduction of GMOs, taking into account current practices and the Government's Biodiversity commitments, to halt and where possible reverse declines in farmland wildlife.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 January 1999]:</i> Horizontal gene transfer technologies are the basis of modern biotechnology and allow the transfer of genes between unrelated species under contained laboratory conditions. Such work often involves the production genetically modified viruses and bacteria as vectors for gene transfer or research tools. All such work is subject to a risk assessment which considers the potential to unintentionally create new viruses and bacteria that may be pathogenic to man or harmful in the wider environment. If the risk assessment indicated there may be a danger then the work would either not be allowed or it would proceed under the highest containment levels. If a risk assessment turned out to be deficient or incorrect it could unwittingly lead to the production of new viruses or bacteria. However, experience of this technology over the last 25 years both in the UK and worldwide has demonstrated that such events are unlikely.

The risks of eating honey made by bees that have visited GM plants have been considered by MAFF.

 Bridge closures and weight-limits are decided by the highway authority in each case following risk assessment procedures published by the Highways Agency last year. We have no central record of the numbers of temporary closures and weight limits imposed by local highway authorities pending strengthening of structures.




<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 1999 : Column: 42</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90125w12.html_para4">However, the Directive does allow authorities to place permanent weight restrictions on structures where strengthening is not regarded as necessary on the basis of strategic importance for HGVs. The Transport Policies and Programmes submitted in July 1998 suggest that some 1,000 permanent weight restrictions have been placed as a result of the bridge assessment programme. These are largely on minor roads.

 Guidance on limiting exposure to electro-magnetic radiation is issued by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB), which has a statutory function to provide advice to Government on all radiation matters. The Board continuously reviews and assesses the published scientific studies covering the fields of biology and medicine, epidemiology and dosimetry, and has concluded that there is no convincing evidence that exposure to emissions from telecommunications transmitters below the recommended guideline levels causes any adverse effects on people's health. In respect of telecommunications base stations, the NRPB further advises that experience with typical personal telecommunications installations has shown that the specified maximum exposure power densities are only likely to be exceeded within a few metres and directly in front of the antenna. However, the strength of radio waves at ground level and in regions accessible to the public tend to be many times below guideline levels and should present

no health risk. My Department has issued for consultation the draft of a joint circular on land use planning and electro-magnetic fields (EMFs).

<P>
<a name="90125w12.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 It is important that the public has an opportunity to comment on the proposed installation of telecommunications masts. Where it is proposed to erect a mast subject to a planning application, the statutory requirement for a local authority to publicise any planning application will apply. In respect of mast development carried out under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (GPDO), we last year consulted on a number of proposed changes to that Order, including one designed to improve opportunities for informing the public. Following consideration of the responses to our proposals, my hon. Friend the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning announced in November our intention to introduce a new 42 day prior approval procedure in respect of ground-based masts which it is proposed to erect under the GPDO in place of the current 28 day procedure. This will include a new requirement that the developer should erect a site notice to publicise the development proposed. Local planning authorities will also be advised of the importance of giving additional publicity to the proposal. In this way people will have a better opportunity to comment on the siting and appearance of all proposals to erect ground-based masts under the GPDO.

 Last year we published our first "Transport Trends" report containing key indicators relevant to many of the objectives set out in the White Paper. We will continue to publish these reports each year so that progress against key indicators can be monitored. The indicators will be developed to include breakdowns by income groups, rural and urban areas and by age and gender so that we can monitor the impact of policies in tackling social exclusion. We will carry out the further work needed to ensure that the range of published indicators is appropriate, seeking advice from the independent Commission for Integrated Transport which is being set up to monitor and advise on progress towards our objectives.

 As stated in paragraph 2.70 of the White Paper, noise is one of the areas where further work is needed to ensure that indicators are appropriate and effective. This work is being taken forward in conjunction with current work on noise indicators by the European Commission which aims to harmonise methods of calculating noise exposure as part of a proposed Framework Directive on Noise. It would be premature for us to reach conclusions about noise indicators until that work is further advanced.

 There are no plans for the introduction of a general register of either pecuniary or non-pecuniary interests for judges. However, in my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Mr. Cohen) on 18 January 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>325</i>, I referred to the steps already taken by the Lord Chancellor to ensure the proper disclosure of interests in any individual case by Members of the House of Lords in its judicial capacity.

 Thirteen Regional Legal Services Committees (RLSCs) have been established to advise the Legal Aid Board on the nature and extent of need for legal services throughout England and Wales and how need should be prioritised. Each RLSC is developing a Regional Strategy which identifies local need for legal services and makes recommendations for supply in relation to that need. The assessment of need is based on census data, the Index of Local Deprivation, the number of Income Support claimants, Housing Benefit claimants and Disability Living Allowance claimants.

 In 1998 there were over 8,000 applications for around 1,000 student places for pre- registration nursing and midwifery education in Wales. While this suggests that there is not a recruitment problem to nurse training in Wales, action is being taken to ensure that this situation continues. This includes ensuring that 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 1999 : Column: 59</I><P>
entry to pre-registration programmes remains as wide as possible; offering a range of programmes from diploma to undergraduate level all of which lead to registration; and encouraging the development of recruitment initiatives by individual education providers including formal links with local schools and colleges.

 Information received from workforce planning data and the nurse executive survey in 1998 showed that there were around 500 funded vacancies for qualified nurses in the NHS in Wales. About 600 students completed their training and qualified in 1998 to meet this need. Recruitment difficulties are limited to a small number of individual Trusts but the year on year increases in training numbers should help to alleviate such problems.

 The Flintshire Community Safety Executive, consisting of a variety of agencies from the local area including Flintshire County Council and the North Wales Police Authority, has been set up in order to meet the requirements of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The Executive which has now met on three occasions has set out a programme of work and initial targets for the completion of a crime audit and a crime and disorder reduction strategy in line with the requirements of the Act. The crime audit was produced by a team of staff from various agencies and was published in November 1998. There has been widespread consultation on the crime audit. At the latest meeting of the Executive on 18 January 1999 the partnership agreed a draft crime and disorder reduction strategy which will be the subject of discussion at a Public Consultation Meeting to be held in mid-March in Flint.

records and/or excessive vehicular speeds for treatment. On some urban and residential roads research has shown that 20 mph is a realistic, sensible and effective level at which to set speed limits. When properly enforced, dramatic casualty reductions can be achieved. The Government have decided to amend the legislation to free local authorities from the requirement to seek the consent of the Secretary of State to introduce 20 mph zones.

 The Welsh substance misuse strategy 'Forward Together' was launched in 1996. As part of this 5-year strategy, Drug and Alcohol Action Teams (DAATs) have been established in each of the five health authority areas in Wales, including North Wales. Each DAAT has reviewed the extent of the substance misuse problems in its area and has developed a local strategy to tackle them. 'Forward Together', and the subsequent formation of the Flintshire Local Advisory Team, has led to a marked increased in the joint delivery of services and a better co-ordination of activity across Flintshire with significant progress against a number of the strategy's objectives.

 Staff recruitment remains a service issue. However, no major recruitment difficulties were identified in 1998 workforce planning round for midwives. The predicted demand from NHS Trusts in Wales for newly qualified midwives in 1999-2000 is 70. Training numbers across Wales will meet this demand. Information for 2000-01 will be available, following the outcome of the workforce planning exercise, in May 1999.

<P>

 None. The running of schools is a matter for their governing bodies. Local education authorities (LEAs) have powers to intervene if they have serious concerns about a school; or if governors do not address failure or serious weakness identified in an inspection carried out under section 10 of the School Inspections Act 1996.
<P>

<a name="90125w18.html_para1">The Secretary of State in turn can intervene if an LEA is failing to perform its functions. I have no evidence that any LEA in Wales is failing in its responsibilities towards schools where problems have been identified which would justify intervention.

Friend and placing a copy in the Library. The United Kingdom's Fourth Periodic Report to the Committee will be prepared in consultation with all interested Departments, as has been the case with earlier reports.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to the letter of 21 July (FL/98 333/1039/3 PO 10689/98) to the hon. Member for Linlithgow, what progress has been made in the joint research programme between the Forensic Science Service and the police on the development of the national DNA data-base.  [65398]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 January 1999]:</i> The development of the National DNA database is currently being reviewed by the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Forensic Science Service (FSS) on the basis of its performance to date, the elimination of the analysis backlog in the spring, and the emerging results from joint projects between the FSS and individual police forces. I will write to my hon. Friend when the results are available.
<P>

<a name="90125w20.html_para0">On wider issues of the usefulness of DNA analysis which was also covered by the letter of 18 June 1998, the joint research programme has assessed the value of an alternative and more sensitive method of DNA analysis known as Mitochondrial DNA. This can be used to analyse human material such as hair shafts, faeces and fingernails, which cannot be analysed using conventional DNA methods. This has proved valuable in casework. Other research to identify and use commonplace characteristics is on-going.

Additional funding for speed enforcement camera is being considered under those criteria.

<a name="90125w21.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Government will be introducing a series of measures to minimise the risk of electronic attack. This will enhance the United Kingdom's reputation as a safe place to undertake electronic commerce. The present risk should not be exaggerated but we must take action. The measures include:
<P>

<a name="90125w21.html_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ensuring that within Government all critical systems are identified and that the protection of those systems is effectively managed and audited; working with the private sector to develop measures, which keep pace with the levels of risk, to ensure adequate standards of protection for the key systems falling within the critical national infrastructure;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90125w21.html_para8"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>raising awareness and standards of information security more generally in the private sector by pursuing existing initiatives to promote best practice; and developing a dialogue on these issues with international partners.

<a name="90125w21.html_para9">In view of my responsibilities for crime prevention and public protection, I will be taking lead responsibility within government for this new work. Government Departments will ensure that the security of their systems is kept under review and, in relevant cases, existing initiatives are pursued with the private sector.
<P>

<a name="90125w21.html_para10">Ensuring that our electronic systems are properly protected from electronic attack is a longer-term enterprise which will not be at the expense of the immediate challenge we are facing to deal with the Millennium Bug.

 Winter quarters are not defined in animal welfare legislation, but are taken as meaning the place where the circus animals are kept during the winter while the circus is not touring.
<P>

<a name="90125w22.html_para0">Under the Performing Animals (Regulation) Act 1925, local authorities and the police have the power to enter at all reasonable times and inspect any premises in which performing animals are kept for training or exhibition, and to inspect the animals kept there.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 We estimate that about 135 prisoners will meet the eligibility criteria under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to be considered for a home detention curfew starting on 28 January 1999. All prisoners eligible to be assessed for the home detention curfew scheme would be subject to a rigorous enhanced risk assessment if this was judged necessary in the particular case.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the timetable for further releases after 28 January under the home detention curfew provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998; and what is the most recent estimate of the number of prisoners to be released.  [66992]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 From 28 January, prisoners eligible for home detention curfew under the provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 will, if assessed as suitable for home detention curfew, be placed on curfew on their home detention curfew eligibility date, or as soon as possible thereafter once the assessment has been completed. Prisoners whose eligibility date falls on a weekend or bank holiday will not be released until the next working day. The numbers of offenders on home detention curfew will build up over the 60 days after 28 January to reach the standard number of offenders likely to be on curfew at any one time.
<P>

<a name="90125w22.html_para3">The numbers of prisoners placed on home detention curfew will depend on the assessments conducted by prison governors. On the basis of trials of the risk assessment conducted in a range of establishments last year, it was provisionally estimated that around 4,000 offenders might be on home detention curfew at any one time.

 We estimate that about 135 prisoners will meet the eligibility criteria under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to be considered for a home detention curfew starting on 28 January 1999. If 50 per cent. of those eligible were suitable for release on home detention curfew, this would mean that an estimated 60-70 prisoners would be placed on home detention curfew on 28 January.
<P>

<a name="90125w22.html_para4">No eligible prisoner will be placed on the home detention curfew scheme without the completion of a rigorous assessment of their suitability.

[67314]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 We estimate that about 45 prisoners serving sentences as a result of convictions for violence, about 40 prisoners serving sentences as a result of convictions for burglary, and less than 10 prisoners serving sentences as a result of convictions to which Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 applies, would, on 28 January, meet the eligibility criteria set out in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 for the home detention curfew scheme. However, no offender serving a sentence as a result of convictions for offences to which Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 applies will be placed on a home detention curfew other than in exceptional circumstances and following the most rigorous enhanced risk assessment.

<P>
<P>

 A prisoner who is serving a sentence of ten weeks imprisonment would normally be entitled to automatic release once he had served half of that period. The period in custody may last, however, up to the full ten weeks if the prisoner is subject to additional days imposed by the prison governor for disciplinary offences.
<P>

<a name="90125w22.html_para5">An offender serving a sentence of three months imprisonment would normally be entitled to automatic release after serving half that period. If he were allowed home detention curfew, he could expect to spend 30 days in custody, and then serve the period until the halfway point of sentence on a curfew enforced by electronic monitoring. Home detention curfew is not an entitlement, and only those prisoners who pass a risk assessment will be allowed on the scheme. The period in custody may last up to the full three months in custody if the prisoner is subject to additional days imposed by the prison governor for disciplinary offences.

<a name="90125w23.html_spnew1"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The judgment of the European Court in the case of Calfa (C-348/96) has no effect on criminal law in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom does not have legislation requiring automatic deportation akin to the Greek law at issue in this case. Nor does the judgment significantly further the development of an European Union system of criminal law. The judgment is in line with previous jurisprudence of the Court and is concerned with the compatibility of the Greek law with Community law on free movement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w23.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Governors have a range of sanctions available to deal with visitors, prisoners and young offenders involved in such activity. But I am keen to see a more consistent approach across the prison estate. To this end, I have asked the Director General of the Prison Service to introduce a more standardised response.
<P>

<a name="90125w23.html_para1">It is clear that most drugs coming into prison are brought in by visitors. I intend to provide governors with a new power to ban a visitor for a specified time. The imposition of a ban, and its duration, will be determined by the quantity and type of drugs passed, the relationship between the visitor, prisoner or young offender and the circumstances of the offence. I would expect a typical ban to be at least three months. In cases where a ban is not justified, visitors may be subject to warnings, closed visits and increased security. Prison and Young Offender Institution staff will continue to report all attempts to smuggle drugs to the police.
<P>

<a name="90125w23.html_para2">Prisoners and young offenders believed to be involved in bringing in drugs will face the increased use of closed visits, regular targeted mandatory drug testing, and disciplinary proceedings.
<P>

<a name="90125w23.html_para3">These measures will support one of the key elements in our overall prison drugs strategy namely supply reduction. The Prison Service will also maintain its commitment to the provision of drug treatment and education within prisons. Last year's Comprehensive Spending Review resulted in an additional &#163;14 million for treatment, &#163;6 million for throughcare and &#163;2.5 million for voluntary testing.
<P>

<a name="90125w23.html_para4">A short implementation phase for the new measures will take place, enabling relevant parties to be briefed on the new arrangements, before they are universally implemented on 1 April 1999.

 I have today placed a copy of the report of the Interdepartmental Working group in the Library. This follows their interim report on abuse of trust which I placed in the Library on 25 November last year.
<P>

<a name="90125w23.html_para7">The Working Group have made a number of recommendations in principle for establishing an integrated scheme to help prevent unsuitable people from working with children. Following a written consultation exercise they undertook initial discussion of the emerging proposals with a number of organisations outside Government before making their report and received their broad support. Their report acknowledges there is much work to be done on the scheme including further consultation. The detailed elements of the scheme will need to be worked up before firm proposals can be made.
<P>

<a name="90125w23.html_para8">The Government welcome the report as the basis for an integrated scheme to provide greater protection for children and, in due course, vulnerable adults.

Primary legislation will be required to put the new scheme in place.
<P>

<a name="90125w23.html_para9">The integrated scheme envisages a central access point for three sources of information, criminal records (with certain offences attracting a ban on working with children); List 99 (maintained by the Department for Education and Employment); and the Consultancy Index (maintained by the Department of Health). This central access point would be the Criminal Records Bureau. The Protection of Children Bill currently before Parliament makes provision for the necessary amendment to Part V of the Police Act 1997 for the Bureau to act as a one stop shop able to receive and pass on information from List 99

Chief Constables will generally maintain records of the cost of major police operations and investigations not only for the purposes of sound financial management, but to keep their police authorities and the public informed.
<P>

<a name="90125w24.html_para0">We issued guidance on efficiency planning to Chief Constables and police authorities last November. We are also working with the service to develop a robust and consistent approach to activity costing, which will help the service to identify and manage the pressures it has.

In this way, they differ from legislation adopted under the Treaties establishing the European Communities, which forms part of community law.

[67393]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The Employment Service (ES) have been interviewing people with disabilities to help them, where appropriate, into work for many years. Since 1995 the Employment Service has been implementing a planned programme of works in its Jobcentres to improve access and facilities for disabled people, including disabled toilets. 64 per cent. of all Jobcentres have disabled toilet provision.
<P>

<a name="90125w24.html_para1">Where dedicated disabled toilets are not available, Jobcentre staff are sympathetic to the needs of their disabled clients and make staff facilities available to them. Where wheelchair access is a problem and there are no disabled toilets available, disabled clients can if they wish, be interviewed at another nearby Jobcentre with facilities or, if necessary in their own homes.

<P>
<a name="90125w24.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 None. As I have explained in my replies to previous questions on the subject of reorganisation which may result from parents voting in favour of ending selection, the law only requires the admissions authorities of the grammar schools involved to change their admission arrangements. Any other changes would be a matter for decision at local level.

<a name="90125w24.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 If parents choose to trigger a ballot and vote in favour of removing selection, the law would only require the admissions authorities of the grammar schools involved to change their admission arrangements. Any other changes would be a matter for decision at local level. If schools and local education authorities agreed other changes, they would plan them within the resources available.

The Zone was awarded &#163;391,000 from the European Social Fund towards its 1998 costs. Overall expenditure in 1998 is likely to be less than anticipated; this will correspondingly reduce the amount of European Social Fund grant.

 More than 650 responses to the consultation paper on the regulation of early education and day care were considered in developing the proposals relating to nannies, including those advocating a national register. The Government concluded, like the Better Regulation Task Force, that a register would be bureaucratic and unworkable and would raise false expectations among parents. Rather, the Government propose to work with the industry to establish new, higher standards for nanny agencies which are clear to parents, supported by guidance to all parents on employing child carers in the home.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) if he will list the occasions when sea anglers have been prohibited from landing fish consequent upon the need to close fisheries to vessels under 10m in length;  [67150]

<P>
<a name="90125w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3760/92 of 20 December 1992, establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture, requires Member States to ensure that non-commercial activities do not jeopardise the conservation and management of resources covered by the common fisheries policy. The annual EU Council regulations, laying down total allowable catches and quotas for the coming year, make no exemption for landings by vessels fishing for pleasure.
<P>

<a name="90125w26.html_para0">Fisheries closures orders have applied to sea angling since the introduction of the current quota management arrangements in the mid-1980s. The table lists the closures for 1998 which have applied to both commercial vessels of 10m and under in overall length and to vessels fishing for pleasure. Most of these closures would have had little, if any, impact on recreational sea angling because of the stocks involved or the timing of the closure.

<P>
<a name="90125w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Agricultural crops that have been genetically modified to contain biopesticides are regulated under EC Directive (90/220) on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment rather than under pesticides legislation. Foods derived from such crops are regulated under the EC Novel Foods and Novel Food Ingredients Regulation (258/97). The aim of both these sets of regulations is to ensure that all crops that have been modified to improve insect resistance, and their products, have been thoroughly assessed for environmental and food safety before being allowed onto the market. In this respect they provide comparable environmental and consumer protection to the legislation on pesticides.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what experiments have shown the presence of BSE infectivity in cattle feed.  [66506]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 None. Existing methods for the surveillance of compliance with the statutory feed bans detect the presence of mammalian proteins rather than infectivity. The detection of infectivity would require inoculation of laboratory animals on a very large scale without guaranteeing a satisfactory outcome.
<P>

<a name="90125w26.html_para5">However, experiments have shown that if material which is rendered to produce meat and bone meal is artificially infected with either BSE or scrapie containing brain before rendering, detectable levels of infectivity can be found in the meat and bone meal resulting from the rendering processes which were in use in the UK in the late 1980s. Until July 1988, meat and bone meal was a permitted constituent of feed for cattle and sheep.

<a name="90125w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 In May 1997, SEAC recommended an abattoir survey of sheeps' brains to determine the likely exposure of the human population to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in sheep submitted for slaughter. Sampling of material took place between August 1997 and August 1998 from almost 3,000 sheep selected at random from approximately 130 abattoirs throughout Great Britain. Tests have been carried out using histological, scrapie associated fibril (SAF), and immunocytochemical examinations. The preliminary findings are inconclusive with no cases of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy definitely confirmed. SEAC received a preliminary report in November 1998 but have not yet scheduled a substantive discussion on it. Further examination of brains and tonsils collected are expected to commence shortly. These tests will not differentiate whether the brains from the abattoir survey will have BSE or scrapie.

<P>

<a name="90125w26.html_para9">Currently, the only way of definitively differentiating BSE from scrapie involves testing suspect material in a panel of specially bred mice and observing the characteristics of any disease that develops. It takes 1-2 years for them to succumb to a disease, if they are incubating BSE, and longer if they are not. Two research projects are underway to examine clinical scrapie cases using this method. No cases of BSE have been found in any of the sheep from the national flock tested so far in this assay.

<a name="90125w26.html_para10">At their meeting on 9 November, SEAC discussed a draft report from their sheep sub-group which had been looking at research and surveillance for TSEs in sheep. A further draft is being prepared by the sub-group. It is expected that the final report will indicate the priority of recommendations for further work.

If a clinical diagnosis of scrapie was made by a veterinary officer a movement restriction notice was served to prevent the movement of the suspect animal off the premises. Once the animal had died, or was slaughtered with the owner's agreement, the head was submitted to a veterinary investigation centre (VIC) for laboratory confirmation of scrapie. This was on the basis of examination of the brain material either by histological examination or by electron microscopy examination for scrapie associated fibrils at the Veterinary Laboratory Agency.

<a name="90125w26.html_para19">Although scrapie has been notifiable since 1993, not all cases were submitted for laboratory confirmation. From 1 January 1993 to 3 July 1996, in general, only the first case reported and subsequently confirmed on a holding in a 2 year period was sent for laboratory examination. Second and subsequent diagnoses were made on clinical grounds only. There were 75 of these between 1993 and 1996. These have been included in statistics as confirmed cases.

 The Ministry, through the Alternative Crops Unit, promotes alternative crops including biomass at agricultural shows and farmer workshops and through a dedicated Website. In 1998 we secured, at the June Agriculture Council, an increase in the ceiling for the grant which can be paid to establish biomass crops, and the Forestry Commission immediately implemented this for a short-rotation coppice near the UK's first biomass-fuelled power station. Expenditure on strategic research and development totalled around &#163;400,000. Future development of biomass crops depends on support to make them competitive with more traditional agricultural activities. This will depend on the outcome of Agenda 2000 and on finding the necessary resources.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what has been the level of price increases which the Royal London Hospital Trust has charged health authorities using its services <i>(a)</i> last year and <i>(b)</i> in the current year; what is the proposed increase for next year; what measures it is taking to achieve its three per cent. efficiency savings target; and if he will make a statement.  [66100]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w28.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Information on the level of service agreements between individual National Health Service trusts and health authorities is not routinely collected by the NHS Executive. A national schedule of reference costs, published on 2 November 1998, contains information on hospital costs for 1997-98 and is available in the Library. Information on 1998-99 costs will be available in June 1999.
<P>

<a name="90125w28.html_para0">The NHS as a whole is expected to achieve an overall 3 per cent. efficiency improvement in 1999-2000. Details of measures taken by individual NHS trusts will be available from NHS trusts themselves.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what targets for the reduction of sickness absence rates have been set for NHS trusts in England for the period to <i>(a)</i> 2001 and <i>(b)</i> 2003; and what account was taken in setting these targets of trusts' individual current sickness absence rates.  [65911]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Targets for reductions of sickness absence rates for National Health Service trusts have been set at 20 per cent. by 2001 and 30 per cent. by 2003.
<P>

<a name="90125w28.html_para1">These targets reflect those defined by the Cabinet Office for the public sector as a whole, and therefore do not take into account individual NHS sickness absence rates.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90125w28.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are employing a twin track approach to enable the National Health Service to secure the physiotherapists it needs by ensuring that training levels are sufficient to get a better match between supply and demand and by investing in initiatives to improve the recruitment, retention and return to practice of qualified staff, including more supportive and family-friendly ways of working.

(20) Figures for December 1998 are extrapolated from figures for August 1997. They assume no change in the number of staff on each grade or incremental point, and incorporate all parts of the 1998-99 pay settlement for nursing, midwifery and health visiting staff.<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

It is not possible to show annual percentage changes because the available figures do not cover a discrete 12 month period. Between August 1997 and December 1998 components of the 1997-98 and 1998-99 national pay settlements for nursing staff would have been implemented.<P>

Total annual average pay was estimated across all incremental points for each grade.<P>

 We are satisfied that the present undergraduate curriculum covers cosmetic dentistry adequately and that there are sufficient training opportunities for qualified dentists to update their skills. If my hon. Friend knows of a particular problem, we would be happy to investigate.

 In 1996-97, the latest figures for which information is available, 50.4 per cent. of beds in private hospitals and clinics in England registered under Section 23 of the Registered Homes Act 1984 were occupied at the time of inspection.

 As it is difficult to predict the rate of take-up, an estimate for such a relatively small population would not be meaningful. Nationally, we estimate that, from 1 April 1999, some 6 million to 7 million more people aged 60 and over will become eligible for free National Health Service sight tests and, in 1999-2000, there will be between 2 and 3 million more NHS tests.

However, road vehicles are likely to be a significant source, particularly in built-up areas. Action taken to implement new European legislation to reduce emissions from new passenger cars and light duty vans in 2000 and 2005 is likely to reduce emissions of hydrocarbons (including aldehydes) from road transport. Further changes to improve fuel quality from 2000 and 2005 are also expected to reduce significantly the level of noxious emissions from the existing vehicle fleet.

 <i>[holding answer 21 January 1999]:</i> We recognise the very important links between poor housing and ill health. That is why Ministerial colleagues within the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions have released substantial additional resources for housing, regeneration and energy efficiency measures. Additional Government action to tackle poverty, unemployment and unhealthy lifestyles will also play a key role.

 <i>[holding answer 21 January 1999]:</i> Carbon Monoxide (CO) poisoning causes 50 accidental deaths and nearly 200 serious injuries in the United Kingdom each year and is still a significant public health issue. First, we welcome the Department of Trade and Industry's recent campaign "Carbon Monoxide Can Kill--Keep Your Family Safe". This campaign will help to raise the awareness of the dangers of CO to those made at risk.
<P>

<a name="90125w31.html_para3">The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) has regularly reminded all doctors over the last two years, through his update, of the importance of identifying cases of CO poisoning. To reinforce the message even further and more widely the CMO and Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) published a letter "Carbon Monoxide: The Forgotten Killer" in September last year, which provided the most up-to-date information about CO to community nurses, midwives, health visitors, general practitioners and other health professionals. In particular, health professionals were reminded about the similarity of the symptoms of long-term exposure to lower levels of CO to food poisoning and influenza.

 Following a stroke patients are entitled to expect that an appropriate service will be provided, but that service will not necessarily be within a specialist stroke unit.

However, an external reference group is currently working with the Department of Health to develop a national service framework covering all aspects of National Health Service care for people with coronary heart disease.

<P>
<a name="90125w32.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 In order to operate their cooling systems all nuclear power stations need access to either the Grid or to their own power sources. As a result of the severe weather that affected the West of Scotland on 26-27 December 1998 connection to all 4 power Grid lines to Hunterston B was lost shortly after midnight. Staff safely shut down both the reactors at Hunterston B. Back-up generators were activated automatically to prevent overheating.
<P>

<a name="90125w32.html_para0">The generators were shut down when the Grid connection was restored. However, they did not restart automatically when the Grid connection was lost for a second time. An on-site emergency was declared early on the morning of 27 December. Management at the station took that decision to ensure that additional technical staffing resources were available to deal with the on-site consequences of the power loss as rapidly as possible. By this time the reactors had been safely shut down for nearly 11 hours. There was no damage to, or release of radioactivity from the plant.

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 1999]:</i> The table shows the allocation of grants made to local authorities in 1997-98 and 1998-99 by Central Government for the provision of criminal justice social work services. Allocation of grant for 1999-2000 has yet to be made. Most of the grant allocated to authorities is used for revenue funding: the capital element is very small. The total funds available for criminal justice social work services in 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02 are &#163;40.8 million, &#163;42.8 million, and &#163;44 million respectively. All of the funding for criminal justice social work will come under the control of the Scottish Parliament.

<P>
<a name="90125w35.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Galbraith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 January 1999]:</i> The Millennium Festival Fund has been established to help the nation to celebrate the Millennium. Like other National Lottery expenditure, it is not subject to annuality. Each of the National Lottery distributing bodies operating in Scotland--the Scottish Sports Council, the Scottish Arts Council, the National Lottery Charities Board, the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Millennium Commission--has contributed towards a Scottish fund of some &#163;10.4 million.
<P>

<a name="90125w35.html_para2">Applications for large grants, over &#163;5,000, were invited in May last year, with a closing date of late October. Details of the successful projects will be announced late next month. A further funding round, aimed at local communities and small organisations seeking grants of &#163;500-&#163;5,000, is expected to be launched shortly. It will be operational until June 2000.
<P>

<a name="90125w35.html_para3">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland will shortly make an announcement on the involvement of Scottish Ministers in National Lottery distribution after devolution.

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 1999]:</i> The Working for Communities and Listening to Communities programmes were introduced earlier this financial year. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced in May 1998 that two initial pathfinders would be established in Greater Easterhouse (Glasgow) and Wester Hailes (Edinburgh) under the Working for Communities programme; I expect the total cost of the two pathfinders in the current year to be between &#163;250,000 and &#163;300,000. An annual allocation of up to &#163;200,000 is available to support each of the two pathfinders for the following three years.
<P>

<a name="90125w35.html_para4">Funding of &#163;315,000 is being made available to support the development of New Community Schools in this financial year. Funding for this initiative will in future years be made available through the Excellence Fund for Schools.
<P>

<a name="90125w35.html_para5">A total of &#163;3.3 million is available to support the Working for Communities and Listening to Communities programmes in each of the next two financial years, rising to &#163;6.3 million in 2001-02. I have already announced the broad objectives for these two programmes and I expect to make a further announcement on the allocation of funds under these programmes before the end of March.

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 1999]:</i> Throughout the PFI process our guiding principle has been to ensure the completion of proper economic appraisals and assure the delivery of value for money at all stages of this project.

<P>

<a name="90125w37.html_para6">The disposal of excess sites by the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh NHS Trust has been done in such a way as to ensure that the Trust has received the proper value for the sites based on independent valuation and has been safeguarded against development gains.

<a name="90125w37.html_para17">The disposal of surplus sites within a PFI deal is the responsibility of the Trust. It is a generally accepted principle of PFI that such sites are included in the PFI deal. The average time taken to dispose of surplus NHS property is about 16 months. Where a site is not sold prior to becoming vacant the NHS has to bear the continuing costs of security and maintenance. I am content that when considered alongside the risks transferred to Consort Healthcare and the reduction in interest charges generated by the prepayment, the Trust has, as demonstrated in the Full Business Case approved by The Scottish Office and HM Treasury, achieved best value for money.

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 1999]:</i> Such work is funded by the local authorities from the general resources available to them for capital expenditure across a range of services, including educational building. Capital allocations to the authorities, which are, in effect, general borrowing consents, are neither project nor programme specific. However, provision under the Comprehensive Spending Review allows for an increase of &#163;185 million in local authority capital expenditure on school buildings over the three years from April 1999.
<P>

<a name="90125w38.html_para0">As part of the New Deal for Schools announced in the July 1997 Budget, &#163;115.7 million is being made available to authorities over five years, in addition to the general resources available under the normal capital allocation arrangements, to tackle the backlog of repairs to school buildings and to improve facilities for ICT. These resources are being distributed to authorities on a formula basis through capital grant. The amounts payable to authorities in the 1997-98 and 1998-99 financial years are listed in the table. Project information is not available centrally in the form requested. Authorities have been advised that the distribution under this grant arrangement in 1999-2000 is expected to be broadly the same as in the current year.
<P>

<a name="90125w38.html_para1">An announcement about the distribution of the general resources available to local authorities for capital expenditure in future years is expected late next month. Capital allocations to local authorities will come under the control of the Scottish Parliament.

 Prospective Honorary Consuls are nominated by Heads of Mission and their appointment is approved by the Head of Consular Division in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The candidates are usually individuals of some standing in the local community. They may be foreign nationals.
<P>

<a name="90125w40.html_para0">Honorary Consuls are not salaried employees. They give their time free of charge and receive a honorarium; the maximum currently is &#163;1,835. They may claim certain admissible expenses e.g. official postage. Their consular functions are carried out from their private or business address. Generally no payment is made from official funds towards rent.
<P>

<a name="90125w40.html_para1">Honorary Consuls perform statutory and non-statutory functions. Statutory functions include duties under the Merchant Shipping Acts, notarial acts, and levying of Consular Fees. Non-Statutory duties include protecting the interests of British nationals, particularly those in distress; and promoting British commercial interests. They do not register births and deaths or issue standard passports. They are not expected to undertake political reporting or information work.
<P>

<a name="90125w40.html_para2">Honorary Consul appointments are for a period of five years and may be terminated by either side giving not less than one months's notice. At the end of the initial term and subsequent five year terms, the appointment may be renewed subject to the exigencies of the public service and provided the Head of Mission is satisfied with the incumbent's performance. The retirement age is 65.
