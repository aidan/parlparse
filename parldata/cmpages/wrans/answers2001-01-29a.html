 The backlog of renovation and improvement work required to the council housing stock in England is estimated to be around &#163;19 billion. This backlog will be addressed through a combination of increased investment in council stock and, where it has the support of tenants, transfer to a Registered Social Landlord (RSL). Last year's Spending Review announced significant increases in resources for the next three years provided to local authorities for housing investment, including &#163;460 million for arms length companies and &#163;760 million for council housing PFI schemes, and funds to support transfer of up to 600,000 dwellings over the period. The total resources for 2003-04 will be more than &#163;2.9 billion, three times the amount provided in 1997-98.

<sup>(1)</sup> The primary and secondary education expenditure data in columns three and four is net current expenditure as reported by local authorities on the revenue outturn (RO) forms for 1999-2000. It is defined as expenditure on employees and running expenses less income from sales, fees and charges, internal recharges, and other non-grant income but it is gross of expenditure funded by specific grants. It is therefore not comparable with SSA sub-blocks which do not include specific grants. It is not possible to derive expenditure that is comparable with education SSA sub-blocks.<P>

<sup>(2)</sup> The net current expenditure data is not available for Halton, as we are still awaiting the receipt of their completed returns. <P>

 The Secretary of State, acting through the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, has power to revoke a test pass certificate only under the provisions of paragraphs 5 and 8 of schedule 1 to the Road Traffic (New Drivers) Act 1995. However, by virtue of section 89(1)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (which replaced the 1972 Act) a test pass certificate may be produced as evidence of entitlement to the granting of a full driving licence only if the test was passed during a period of two years ending with the date of the licence application.
<P>

<a name="10129w02.html_para15">A driving test must be passed in two parts, the theory test being taken first. By virtue of regulation 47(6) of The Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 1999--made under the 1988 Act--a theory test pass certificate has a validity period of two years.

<a name="10129w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Worcestershire county council placed a draft Structure Plan on deposit in January 2000, part of which contains strategic policies on waste management. The Secretary of State made three objections on waste matters. He was concerned about matters of self- sufficiency at County and Regional levels and the need to take account of the draft national waste strategy and the recent guidance on waste planning in Planning Policy Guidance Note 10, particularly the application of the principal of Best Practicable Environmental Option (BPEO). He also wished for clarification on when it is necessary to demonstrate need in relation to landfill sites. The county council's proposed modifications to its plan are expected shortly. In addition, the county council has a duty under Section 38 (2) of the Planning and Compensation Act 1992 to prepare a Waste Local Plan, which will set out detailed policies for the management of waste.

[147507]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Waste Strategy 2000 and Planning Policy Guidance Note 10 set out the principles on which the Government wish to see waste management decisions based. One of these principles is that waste should generally be disposed of as near as possible to its place of production, because transporting waste itself has an environmental impact.

 Endangered species are protected under the provisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This convention is implemented throughout the European Union under EC regulations and enforced in the UK under the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 and the Control of Trade in Endangered Species (Enforcement) Regulations 1997 (COTES).

 I have been impressed by the achievements of the Metropolitan police in the fight against wildlife crime. They have investigated a number of significant cases, including the recent successful prosecution of a north London taxidermist for illegally trading in large numbers of endangered species. The Metropolitan police have also worked with London's Chinese community in "Operation Charm"--an ongoing initiative to raise awareness of the consequences for conservation of the use of endangered species derivatives in traditional medicines.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w05.html_wqn2"><B> Ms Drown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received on the local government finance settlement for 2001-02; and what conclusions he has reached.  [147872]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w05.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 I have today laid before the House the Local Government Finance Report (England) 2001-02 and the Special Grant Report (No. 72). These reports establish the amounts of revenue support grant (RSG) and non-domestic rates (NDR) to be paid to local authorities 



<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2001 : Column: 19W</I><P>
in 2001-02, and the basis of their distribution; and provide for Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) Reduction Grant and Central Support Protection Grant to be paid to certain authorities for 2001-02. Drafts of these reports were issued for consultation on 27 November 2000, and updated information on grant allocations was published on 15 December. The Department received a total of 315 written representations within the consultation deadlines from the Local Government Association and the Association of London Government, as well as from 224 local authorities, local authority groups and hon. Members.
<P>

<a name="10129w05.html_para0">Having considered the views of the local authority associations and others who have commented on my initial proposals, I have decided to confirm in virtually all respects my original proposals on grant distribution. The final figures published today may be slightly different from those issued on 15 December, generally reflecting more accurate data that have become available since then.
<P>

<a name="10129w05.html_para1">I am therefore confirming my proposal to set a floor of 3.2 per cent., and a ceiling of 6.5 per cent., on general grant increases for authorities with responsibilities for education and social services. This will set limits on what would otherwise be a very wide range of grant increases, which would have made service planning very difficult for authorities. A 6.5 per cent. increase in general grant should be sufficient for most ceiling authorities, even after allowing for the fact that they have growing populations to cater for. And a 3.2 per cent. increase is reasonable for floor authorities, taking into account the fact that most of them face reductions in population. In each case, these increases will be accompanied by substantial increases in ring-fenced grant.
<P>

<a name="10129w05.html_para2">The ceiling will help support the cost of introducing the floor, but cannot cover the whole cost. I therefore also confirm my proposal to scale back marginally the grant increases of authorities who are neither at the ceiling or the floor.
<P>

<a name="10129w05.html_para3">Following careful consideration, I propose to make one exception to the ceiling rule. Quite exceptional circumstances apply to the Isles of Scilly Council. Their annual budget is extremely small, and they cannot avoid substantial capital expenditure to maintain essential waste disposal services. I shall therefore not limit their grant increase this year.
<P>

<a name="10129w05.html_para4">This year's settlement provides an increase of 7.2 per cent. in total Government grant and a 4.9 per cent. increase in general grant. This is on top of substantial increases each year since 1997-98: in the four years since then, Government grant to local government has gone up by 14 per cent. in real terms, compared with a 7 per cent. cut in the previous four years.
<P>

<a name="10129w05.html_para5">Given these good increases in grant, I would therefore expect the majority of local authorities to be setting a lower Council Tax increase this year than last year, when the increase was 6.1 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10129w05.html_para6">Local authorities also made representations on council tax benefit subsidy limitation. I have considered these carefully but decided to make no change to the scheme I proposed on 27 November, as amended on 15 December.
<P>

<a name="10129w05.html_para7">I shall be sending copies of these reports and the Plain English guide to all authorities, together with tables showing each authority's Standard Spending Assessment 



<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2001 : Column: 20W</I><P>
and its entitlement to RSG, NDR and special grant. I have placed copies of the reports in the Journal Office; and copies of the reports, tables, and the guide in the Vote Office and the Library.
<P>

<a name="10129w05.html_para8">However, the local government finance settlement should not be seen in isolation. The Government have identified four specific problem cases, and have responded to these.
<P>

<a name="10129w05.html_para9">We have looked again at the funding position of authorities in areas with the most serious deprivation problems. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced on 24 January a doubling of the provision for the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund in 2001-02, from &#163;100 million to &#163;200 million. These additional resources will help local authorities improve services in the most deprived neighbourhoods and therefore to improve the outcomes that are achieved in these areas.
<P>

<a name="10129w05.html_para10">In some areas where there have been serious floods this year, authorities faced the prospect of an increased levy from the Environment Agency to cover the costs that it had incurred in dealing with this year's floods. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food announced on 26 January that he will provide an additional &#163;11.6 million for the Agency to limit the burden falling on local authorities.
<P>

<a name="10129w05.html_para11">My right hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under- Secretary of State for Social Security is today announcing additional funding of &#163;25 million to help local authorities facing significant increases in the cost of housing homeless households in temporary accommodation.
<P>

<a name="10129w05.html_para12">Finally, my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment is today announcing a new &#163;52 million grant to help some education authorities manage funding changes and deal with particular education spending pressures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w05.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 23 January 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 529-30W, how much the X factor will be tightened to reflect the proposed delay term; who will be responsible for its enforcement; if there will be discretion in the application of such tightening; and what risk assessment of the proposal has been made.  [147770]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 The formula by which the delay factor will be incorporated in the charge cap for National Air Traffic Services (NATS) will be set out in the licence for en route services which will be issued to NATS when the public/private partnership is established. A draft of that licence is in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="10129w05.html_para13">The delay term will reduce the maximum charges which NATS can derive from its UK en route business where the delays attributable to NATS in a preceding period exceed a defined standard. This standard will be based initially on the level of delays in 1999 and be specified to improve by 1 per cent. per annum thereafter. The detailed figures to be inserted in the formula will be calculated in such a way as to limit the penalty for delays to &#163;2.0 million a year in respect of delays arising in 2001 



<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2001 : Column: 21W</I><P>
and 2002 and to &#163;5.7 million a year in respect of delays arising in the remainder of the first five-year regulatory period.
<P>

<a name="10129w05.html_para14">The delay term will be enforced by the Civil Aviation Authority as the economic regulator of NATS. Its enforcement will not be discretionary. The term has been set at a level designed to give NATS an incentive to reduce delays without in any way undermining the primacy of safety as a factor in NATS' operations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions which water companies have informed their customers of their duty to install a free water meter; and what sanctions exist for those that have not.  [147754]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I understand that all companies include details of their free meter options within their Charges Schemes and associated leaflets which are available to customers. As part of its examination of companies' Charges Schemes for the year beginning 1 April 2001, Ofwat wrote to companies which it considered did not contain sufficient information. Most companies also promote the availability of the free meter option either on the bill or in accompanying literature.
<P>

<a name="10129w06.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Oaten: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what targets he has set for the take-up of free water meters.  [147756]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 No targets have been set for the take-up of free water meters. The option is left to the free choice of customers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Most water companies and several consumer groups made representations about various aspects of the free meter option in response to public consultation papers and at other times during our review of water charging in 1997 to 1998, during the passage of the Water Industry Act 1999 and during and since the introduction of regulations and guidance under the Act.

 The Government's Road Safety Strategy, "Tomorrow's Roads--Safer for Everyone", was launched by the Prime Minister on 1 March last year. It sets a new target to reduce the number of people killed and seriously injured on the roads by 40 per cent. by the year 2010, a separate target of 50 per cent. for children, and a 10 per cent. reduction in the slight casualty rate.

 Council Regulation (EC) No. 338/97 sets out the requirements on member states to implement the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The United Kingdom already fully implements these Regulations, under which all commercial trade in critically endangered species is prohibited and trade in less endangered species is strictly regulated. In the United Kingdom the Regulations are enforced by means of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 and the Control of Trade in Endangered Species (Enforcement) Regulations 1997 (S. I.

<a name="10129w06.html_para7">Government policy is to promote competition in the cellular radiocommunications market. The UK has licensed four cellular operators--BT Cellnet, Vodafone, One-2-One and Orange. The operators have coverage obligations in their licences to serve 90 per cent. of the UK population. Competitive pressure between the operators has resulted in coverage levels of 98-99 per cent. The Government have introduced further competition into the market by the award of a 3G licence to a new entrant--Hutchison 3G. This competition drives coverage and capacity improvements which will benefit travellers using the mainline rail network.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w06.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Byers </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 January 2001]:</i> BNFL is authorised by the Environment Agency (EA) to dispose of material at Clifton Marsh which has not more than 0.2 per cent. of the radioactivity of natural uranium by weight. Because small quantities of depleted uranium have been handled at BNFL's Springfields site, waste may also be contaminated with trace quantities of depleted uranium and this is allowed for in the disposal authorisation. EA have made clear that they have no reason to believe that BNFL has operated outside their authorisation regime.

Friend's 'Private Secretary' had told Mr. Hinduja about his passport application. This was incorrectly recorded in the unbound <i>Official Report</i> as 'Parliamentary Private Secretary'. I have asked for the bound volume to be corrected to record what I actually said to the House. The error was unfortunately copied into my answer to my hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w08.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Cox: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what recent survey he has undertaken on the problems of the retention of teachers working in schools in the Greater London area.  [146942]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w08.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Teacher Training Agency contributed to the costs of a study by the University of North London on teacher supply and retention in London. This included surveying those leaving teaching posts in six London boroughs in 1998-99, including those moving into other teaching jobs.
<P>

<a name="10129w08.html_para1">The most commonly cited reasons for leaving were school management, hours worked, pupil behaviour, lack of opportunities for promotion and school resources. The Government are addressing each of these concerns. A new leadership college for headteachers and improved pay for heads have been introduced. We are tackling needless bureaucracy by reducing duplication of data requests and cutting by half the materials sent automatically to schools by the DfEE. The expansion of ICT is assisting in this regard too.
<P>

<a name="10129w08.html_para2">The Government are spending 10 times more than in 1996-97 on tackling poor behaviour and truancy. &#163;174 million in 2001-02 will be used to continue a big expansion in places and standards in pupil referral units and further to improve provision of in-school learning support units. The introduction of performance-related pay will improve opportunities of promotion for tens of thousands of teachers.
<P>

<a name="10129w08.html_para3">Resources that were cut between 1994-97 have been significantly increased since. Schools have more resources for teachers, classroom assistants, computers, books and other priorities than in 1997. Funding per pupil will have increased by over &#163;450 in real terms between 1997-98 and 2001-02. Capital resources this year at &#163;2 billion are three times the level of 1996-97. The Government have made clear that there will be further increases as a result of the 2000 Spending Review in both revenue and capital.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w08.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if the ILAs to be accessed through community action pilots as part of the regeneration strategy announced on 15 January will <i>(a)</i> be subject to the same criteria as other ILAs and <i>(b)</i> be of the same individual value; if the figure announced for take-up of 10,000 is in addition to existing credits; if this figure represents (i) an estimate and (ii) a target; and what arrangements he will put in place for evaluating pilot studies.  [146057]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 January 2001]:</i> Individual Learning Accounts accessed through community action pilots will be subject to the same criteria, and of the same value as, other Individual Learning Accounts. The 10,000 accounts announced will be part of the first one million Individual Learning Account holders to benefit from the &#163;150 incentive. Already 560,000 people have opened Individual Learning Accounts.
<P>

<a name="10129w08.html_para4">We are making support costs available to the Community Groups to test out new ideas on reaching those who have not been engaged in learning rather than asking these groups to achieve set targets. The figure of 10,000 is therefore the estimate from the five participating community groups. Information from this pilot work will inform the full Individual Learning Accounts evaluation to be carried out from May 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what has been the total capital investment in Birmingham's schools in each year since 1992; and what is his forecast for spending in the next three years.  [147059]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w09.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Birmingham local education authority has received some &#163;123.674 million of funding from central Government for capital investment in school buildings since 1996-97, as shown in the following Table A. Information prior to 1996-97 is not readily available. Table B shows the forecast investment over the next three years.
<P>

<a name="10129w09.html_para0">Nationally, investment in school buildings has tripled from &#163;683 million a year in 1996-97 to over &#163;2 billion in 2000-01. It will be &#163;3.2 billion in 2003-04, including grant, credit approvals and Private Finance Initiative credits. There will be central Government investment of &#163;7.8 billion in school buildings in total from 2001-02 to 2003-04.

<sup>(4)</sup> Future years' allocations shown are only those already announced as being attributable to Birmingham Local Education Authority.<P>

<P>





In addition to the amounts shown, schools in Birmingham will also benefit from a share of other programmes where allocations have not yet been made. These include over &#163;1 billion of credit approvals, mainly to provide new pupil places; &#163;440 million of grant to governors of Voluntary Aided schools; &#163;555 million grant through the NDS Modernisation fund and &#163;170 million worth of funding under the Schools Access Initiative.<P>

This funding will be augmented by capital receipts and other contributions from Local Education Authority sources, and the contribution which governors of Voluntary Aided schools make to their building work. In addition, more than &#163;1 billion more is available nationally through Private Finance Initiative Credits for projects which will sign in 2002-03 and 2003-04.<P>

Funding specifically ring fenced for the renewal of school laboratories is ending in 2001-02. Local Authorities will be able to prioritise their other increased funding for this purpose, if they wish. <P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w10.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. George Turner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on education funding in 2001-02.  [148040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 I am today making an extra &#163;52 million available to provide support to help some English local education authorities manage funding changes in 2001-02. I am making this extra funding available to deal with known pressures in advance of the longer term revision of the distribution of local authority finance. This funding is in addition to the resources provided through the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund, and in addition to other Government funding to relieve other specific pressures on authorities.
<P>

<a name="10129w10.html_para6">This funding is on top of the significant increases that have already been announced for 2001-02--increases which mean &#163;150 extra spending per pupil on average in real terms. The increase in funding per pupil is part of a real terms increase of &#163;370 over three years bringing the total to almost &#163;700 per pupil between 1997 and 2004. Total funding per pupil has already increased by over &#163;300 in real terms since 1997. Between 1994-95 and 1997-98 funding per pupil fell by &#163;60 in real terms.
<P>

<a name="10129w10.html_para7">The recent funding increases include: over &#163;1 billion extra in Education Standard Spending Assessments--a 4.8 per cent. increase on 2000-01; a further &#163;250 million in direct grants to schools--a typical primary school will get &#163;20,000, and a typical secondary school &#163;60,000 (up from &#163;9,000 and &#163;40,000 this year for heads to use as they see fit); and an increase of &#163;600 million in the Standards Fund from &#163;1.7 billion to &#163;2.3 billion to support literacy and numeracy in primary and secondary schools, class sizes and tackling truancy.
<P>

<a name="10129w10.html_para8">The distribution of the extra &#163;52 million will take account of authorities' Education Standard Spending Assessment increase, the extra pressure they face from the transfer of Adult Education funding, their allocation from the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund, and their need to spend on teacher recruitment and retention--particularly in London and the South East.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many and what proportion of named day questions tabled during the current Session have received a substantive reply on the named day; and what the mean and medians were for the number of days elapsed between <i>(a)</i> tabling, <i>(b)</i> holding answers and <i>(c)</i> final answers.  [147298]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w13.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 145 questions tabled for answer on a named day received a reply on the day named. This represents 52 per cent. of the total number tabled. The mean and median number of days elapsed between the day named for answer and a substantive reply were three days and two days respectively. Because hon. Members may name days with differing periods of notice, the calculation of the figures between tabling and answer involve the examination of each parliamentary question and therefore could be supplied only at disproportionate cost.

 There has been a phased re-provision of patient services from the St. Leonard's Hospital site since the late 1980s. The last patient services were relocated off the site in January 2000.
<P>

<a name="10129w14.html_para0">A number of unsuccessful planning applications for the site have been made over the last 10 years. The latest planning application for a special care housing development on the site was made in September 1999.

 The information requested is not collected centrally. First responders are invaluable in providing immediate care until an emergency ambulance arrives. What matters is that patients with life-threatening conditions or injuries get an emergency response as quickly as possible. Clinical evidence proves conclusively that early defibrillation and resuscitation saves more lives. Achievement of the eight minute target could save 1,800 lives each year in people under 75 years suffering acute heart attacks.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w14.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Under the agrimonetary system in existence until 1992, monetary compensatory amounts automatically provided equalisation of currency differences when agricultural products crossed intra-Community borders. No application for the amounts was required.

 MAFF and the devolved Administrations are making available &#163;18 million in 2001-02 and &#163;22 million in 2002-03 for the UK fishing industry under the new EU fisheries structural funds programmes. These sums include both the amounts available from the EU under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance and the national back-up funding from MAFF and the devolved Administrations. Since grant rates and funding packages will vary across the UK and across grant-aided measures, it is not possible to say at this stage how much of the amounts will be EU money and how much national back-up.
<P>

<a name="10129w14.html_para7">A limited number of payments will also be made under the 1994-99 structural funds programmes. Actual amounts paid will depend on the eligibility of the claims received.

 The Forestry Commission could have used its statutory powers to impose a restocking notice, but decided that this would not be in the public interest as the area is part of a heathland restoration project. Avon Heath Country Park is in a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Protection Area, and this heathland restoration work is an important part of the Government's Biodiversity Action Plan.

 There is no calculated contribution in respect of the Ministry of Defence's investment in research and development. The commercial exploitation levy (CEL) is a form of royalty for any commercial sales of a design, use of special tooling or the granting of licences where MOD has contributed wholly, or in part, to research and development costs. There are no restrictions on the categories of contracts to which CEL applies, but the vast majority relate to equipment (including software), since MOD research and development funding is largely in support of the development of equipment. Details of the income derived from CEL over the last nine years are set out in the table. Data for 1990-91 could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2001]:</i> The operational and retained task requirement for nurses in the Defence Medical Services and the trained strength as at 1 October 2000 is as shown by speciality. Recruitment into training is highly satisfactory. However, recruitment of trained nurses remains difficult. We are currently working on measures to improve the recruitment and retention of serving nurses.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how much his Department spends on research and development in <i>(a)</i> the United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i> Scotland; and if he will break down the Scottish total into (i) DERA's own research and (ii) research funded in academic and non-DERA sites; and what the names of these non-DERA sites are.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w18.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 January 2001]:</i> The information requested is not held centrally. However, for 1998-99, some &#163;2,096 million defence expenditure was categorised for statistical purposes as "research and development". This would cover work undertaken in MOD (including DERA), industry and universities. I regret that it is not possible to state how much of the total figure represents expenditure in Scotland, as our data do not include a regional breakdown. Nor do available data provide the breakdown of research (or research and development) expenditure between DERA and non-DERA sites in Scotland.

<a name="10129w18.html_para0">Along with other major Defence sites not yet sold, the former HMS Daedalus is being considered within this study. While it is still at an early stage and not likely to report for some time, we are looking to form an early view of the implications for the Daedalus site, if any, to avoid further uncertainty or delay. We hope to do this by the end of March and will keep the local authorities concerned informed of the position.

 It has been assessed that, beyond 2003, our anti-surface ship capability needs can be met through the use of other platforms and weapons systems. These include air and surface launched Harpoon missiles. Under current plans we intend to withdraw the Royal Navy Sub-Harpoon from service 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what representations he has received relating to activities by HM armed forces and their effect on wildlife in South Jason Island.  [147198]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10129w19.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Although there has been some discussion locally on this subject, my right hon. Friend has received no representations relating to activities by HM armed forces on South Jason Island, and their effect on the wildlife there.
<P>

<a name="10129w19.html_para5">On Friday 12 January, an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team from the British armed forces successfully disposed of a number of items of unexploded ordnance on South Jason Island, located on the north west coast of West Falkland, as part of a programme of clearing an aircraft crash site left over from the Falklands conflict. We have a legal obligation under the Ottawa Convention to remove such unexploded ordnance from the Falkland Islands, and these operations are carried out with every caution to personnel and the environment.
<P>

<a name="10129w19.html_para6">Despite precautions that were taken during the operation, a fire broke out on the island. A joint effort by the British armed forces and the Falkland Islands Fire Service extinguished the fire by the evening of Thursday 18 January, despite a strong, northerly, 40 knot wind which hampered fire-fighting efforts and caused the fire to spread quickly.
<P>

<a name="10129w19.html_para7">HQ British Forces Falkland Islands is currently conducting an investigation to establish how the fire started.
<P>

<a name="10129w19.html_para8">Advice from a conservation expert who has since visited the island is that the damage to the wildlife was significantly less than first reported. Only a small number of dead birds were found whose death can be directly linked to the fire. Therefore, although there has been some regrettable loss of wildlife, the conservationist assessed that this could in no way be classified as an environmental disaster.

<P>
<a name="10129w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The primary responsibility for the clearing up in Kosovo is the civilian authority, which is currently the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). The United Nations Mine Action Service (MAS) is responsible for the longer term task of fully clearing Kosovo of unexploded ordnance, and has established a UN Mine Action Co-ordination Centre (MACC) in Pristina to this end.
<P>

<a name="10129w19.html_para9">However, when KFOR deployed to Kosovo in June 1999, there was an immediate requirement to clear ordnance (both from Allies and Milosevic's security forces) that would have posed a hazard to peacekeeping forces. British service personnel were engaged in this activity. KFOR also took on the immediate task of making schools safe for the returning population of Kosovo prior to the UN establishing its own clearance programme. The NATO Secretary General's report "Kosovo One Year On--Achievement and Challenge" published on 21 March 2000, explained that KFOR soldiers and the international community have cleared unexploded ordnance and mines from some 16,000 homes, 1,165 schools and almost 2,000 kilometres of roads.

The report sets out my determination for 2001-02 of the aggregate amount of grants that I propose to pay under section 46(2) of the Police Act 1996, and the amount to be paid to each police authority and to the Greater London Authority for the Metropolitan Police Authority.
<P>

<a name="10129w20.html_para2">Funding allocations for each police authority for 2001-02 are set out in the table. The table also shows allocations approved by Parliament for 2000-01.

 The Government are determined that this country should not be used as a base for supporting terrorism in any way, including terrorism in other countries. Under the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998, it is already an offence to conspire in this country to commit terrorist acts anywhere overseas. In addition, the Terrorism Act 2000, which is due to come into force shortly, includes provisions, applicable throughout the United Kingdom, which make it an offence to provide weapons training for terrorist purposes, and to recruit for such training. This Act also provides powers to proscribe terrorist organisations, under the conditions specified. The investigation of any alleged criminal activity is, of course, a matter for the police.

We are also cross-checking DSS records with information from other Government Departments and have allowed all local councils to have access to electronic data from the Benefits Agency.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what action he is taking to ensure that women born after 1955 are informed of the forthcoming increase in retirement age.  [146348]<P>

<P>
<a name="10129w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Pensions Act 1995 affects all women born after 5 April 1950. Between 2010-20 women's state pension age will rise gradually from 60 to 65. Publicity for this change started under the previous administration.
<P>

<a name="10129w25.html_para0">We have taken action to inform women of the changes through leaflets and in the letters from the Department forecasting State Pension entitlement and displays in local BA offices. We have publicised the changes through advertising features in women's and general interest magazines. A national newspaper and magazine advert on the issue is due to feature in March as part of the wider pensions education marketing campaign. Also there is an interactive table on the Internet at www.pensionguide.gov.uk where a woman can type in her date of birth and learn the date she reaches State Pension age.
<P>

 The Department will shortly be writing to all pensioner households to inform them of the plans we announced to the House on 29 November 2000 for the amount of State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) that widows or widowers can inherit from their spouse.
<P>

<a name="10129w25.html_para2">In the course of consultation last year, a number of organisations including the select committees of the House asked us to explore the possibility of writing directly to the public about this subject.
<P>

<a name="10129w25.html_para3">The plans we announced in November mean that no current pensioner will now be affected by the changes to the inherited SERPS rules originally legislated for in 1986.
<P>

<a name="10129w25.html_para4">The letter is designed to ensure that all pensioners are aware of these new arrangements and that the change will be effected automatically; so there is no need for them to make any special claim or to contact their local Social Security office for this purpose. Of course they are always able to contact the Benefits Agency over any query about their pension entitlement.
<P>

<a name="10129w25.html_para5">For workload reasons the mailing will take place on a phased basis over the next two months.
<P>

<a name="10129w25.html_para6">The cost of the exercise is estimated at &#163;2.5 million. The text of the letter is as follows.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Dear Mr/Mrs/Miss or Mr and Mrs
<P>
<BR>
I am writing to let you know about a recent Government announcement on inheriting SERPS.
<P>
<BR>
As well as your basic state pension, you may also get a State Earnings Related Pension (SERPS) if you, or your husband or wife, paid into the scheme when working. You may also know this as "additional pension". In 1986 the law was changed to reduce the amount of SERPS that people widowed after 5 April 2000 could inherit from their husbands or wives.
<P>
<BR>
However, it became clear that for many years after 1986 some people were given incorrect or misleading information about the change and so the Government recently announced new plans for how much SERPS can be passed on to a widow or widower, when the person who has contributed to the scheme dies.
<P>
<BR>
Under these new plans there will be no change to the current arrangements for the following people.
<P>
<BR>
Those who are already widowed now and are receiving a SERPS pension.
<P>
<BR>
Those who are not widows or widowers now, but whose husbands or wives die between now and 5 October 2002.
<P>
<BR>
Parliament is also being asked to approve plans, which would mean there would also be no change for people who are widowed on or after 6 October 2002 but whose late husband or wife reached state pension age on or before 5 October 2002.
<P>
<BR>
<i>If you fall into one of the groups above, you do not need to do anything now or make any special claim in future.</i>
<P>
<BR>
You can read more about other help and services available to pensioners and how to find them in a new guide for pensioners and from Benefits Agency offices. You will be able to find the local office address and telephone number in the telephone directory. The guide will be available soon, so look out for it in

<P>

 Entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) or Income Support (IS) is dependent on, among other things, a person's pattern of employment and their hours of work.
<P>

<a name="10129w25.html_para8">The current legal position is that those term-time workers with an ongoing contract of employment, who are not entitled to JSA or IS during term-time because of the hours they work, are also not entitled to JSA or IS during the school holidays. This position, which reflects the original intention of the legislation when JSA was introduced in 1996, was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in October 1999 following a series of contradictory decisions by Commissioners. The retrospective effect of the Court of Appeal decision means that there was never any entitlement to JSA during the school holidays for this group of ancillary or term-time workers. Leave to appeal to the House of Lords against the Court of Appeal decision was granted and we understand that the hearing has been listed for 21 March.
<P>

<a name="10129w25.html_para9">We have no accurate data on which to base a reliable estimate of the cost of extending entitlement to JSA or IS to all those employed on term-time only contracts. Term-time workers with low incomes may claim in-work benefits such as Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. Those with children may also be entitled to the Working Families Tax Credit.
