<a name="91124w01.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Starkey: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if he will make a statement regarding the Code for Crown Prosecutors.  [99859]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91124w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Code for Crown Prosecutors is issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions as required by section 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. It is an important public document. It sets out the fundamental principles to be applied by Crown Prosecutors when deciding whether or not an individual should be prosecuted and, if a prosecution is to follow, what charges should be preferred. By applying the Code casework, decisions can be made fairly, consistently and independently. The current edition of the Code was published in June 1994.
<P>

<a name="91124w01.html_para0">Sir Iain Glidewell's review of the Crown Prosecution Service recommended an amendment of the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The current edition of the Code at paragraph 6.2 reads in part:
<P>

<a name="91124w01.html_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In cases of any seriousness, a prosecution will usually take place unless there are public interest factors tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending in favour."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91124w01.html_para2">The Glidewell report concluded that the Code test should be applied in the same way to all cases, whatever their degree of seriousness. The report was concerned that the Code as drafted, if read literally, might incorrectly result in the Code being applied differently to cases which are not so serious. The Glidewell report therefore recommended that the words
<P>

<a name="91124w01.html_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In cases of any seriousness"
be removed from the relevant paragraph.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91124w01.html_para4">That recommendation has been accepted. On 26 August, the Crown Prosecution Service issued to CPS staff a notice putting that recommendation into immediate effect.
<P>

<a name="91124w01.html_para5">The Crown Prosecution Service, with appropriate consultation, is to review the Code for Crown Prosecutors to take account of the Human Rights Act 1998. Formal amendment to the Code, in accordance with the Glidewell recommendation, will be made when the Code is reissued after this review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans he has for the development of children's radio.  [99215]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91124w01.html_spnew1"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 Decisions on programme content are for the broadcasters. However, Government policy is to ensure that both public service and independent broadcasters provide a range of high quality radio services which meet consumer needs. Under its Charter and Agreement, the BBC is committed to provide original programmes for children and young people as well as information, education and entertainment programmes which are of interest across the community. Similarly, it is open to independent radio licensees, regulated by the Radio Authority under the Broadcasting Acts, to offer programme formats which address the specific requirements of children and young people.

<P>
<a name="91124w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 November 1999]:</i> Decisions on admission charges at new branches of national museums are principally a matter for the Trustees of the institution concerned. The Government encourage free entry where that is appropriate and affordable.

 None at present. In the White Paper, "Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation", which was published on 6 July, the Government announced that they had commissioned an up-to-date, expert scientific review of the evidence on the fluoridation of water. The Government expect to receive the review report in March, and will not be considering any legislative changes until it is received. It is not proposed to update the Code of Practice ahead of the review report.

<a name="91124w02.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The traffic figures used in calculating the highway maintenance standard spending assessment are those that are provided by Highway Authorities or contractors on behalf of the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions. Highway Authorities may sub-contract the work. The traffic figures proposed for use in the 2000-01 local government finance settlement are based on data relating to 1998 and earlier years. For Cambridgeshire in 1998 and earlier years, the County Council was contracted by the Department to provide the traffic figures.

 <i>[holding answer 22 November 1999]:</i> My Department has not received representations on low emission zones, as they are not a Government policy proposal.

Copies of the non-confidential responses received will be made available in the libraries of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish Executive and the Department of Environment (Northern Ireland). A list of responses will also be placed in the House Libraries when the final version of the Strategy is published in January next year. A summary of the responses will also be made available in January on the Department's Website. The objectives proposed in the draft Air Quality Strategy have also been discussed at meetings of the Air Quality Forum, at which the AA, SMMT and the Freight Transport Association were present.

<a name="91124w02.html_para2">Road transport is one of the major sources of air pollution, especially in our towns and cities. However, we have made clear within the Strategy and in our guidance to local authorities that the relative contribution of transport, and all other sectors, to the achievement of meeting the new air quality objectives has to be cost effective and proportionate.

 The driving licence treatment of those with diabetes treated by insulin is based on European legislation--the Second Driving Licence Directive (91/439/EEC).

 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate for Class X, Vote 3 (Forestry Commission) the Forestry Commission's Departmental Expenditure Limit for 1999-2000 will be increased by &#163;7,5000,000 from &#163;68,615,000 to &#163;76,115,000.

 The Fisheries Council met in Brussels on 22 November. I led the UK delegation, accompanied by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), Deputy Minister for Rural Affairs in the Scottish Executive.
<P>

<a name="91124w04.html_para6">The Council agreed a regulation for financial aid to fisheries under the reformed EU Structural Funds, which provides for seven year funding programmes and sets conditions for payments. Grants for renewal and modernisation of the fleet may be paid only if the member state has met its overall fleet capacity (MAGP IV) limits. Where the relevant segment of the fleet exceeds

<P><I>24 Nov 1999 : Column: 118W</I><P>
its capacity target, the member state must withdraw 30 per cent. more vessel capacity than is grant aided. While these new controls are not as rigorous as I would have wished, they are a welcome innovation, establishing the important principle that grant aid should contribute towards improving the balance between fish resources and the capacity of members states' fleets. There will be a review in 2001 providing an opportunity to make any changes necessary as a result of decisions at the expiry of MAGP IV.
<P>

<a name="91124w04.html_para7">The Council reached a political agreement on a reform of the fisheries marketing regime subject to the opinion of the European Parliament. The new regulation will provide lower tariffs for imports of fish which are important for our processing industry, while recognising the need to protect the interests of our catching industry in the import terms for sensitive species such as herring and cod and more generally by including provision to deal with serious market disturbance. After a transitional period it will reduce the costs of the regime.

 <i>[holding answer 22 November 1999]:</i> HLCA payments in MAFF's South West Region (Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly) in the current year (1999) will total around &#163;6.27 million, over 14 per cent. of the total for England. These figures include a proportionate share of the extra &#163;60 million (approximately &#163;15.27 million in England), which we have announced will also be available in the year 2000. The proposals for Hill Farm

Allowances which we published on 3 December will help maintain upland rural communities and preserve upland environments through sustainable beef and sheep production.

We have made no estimate of any regional differences in the impact of the proposals.

 Under the transitional provisions of the 1996 Scheme, made under powers conferred by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1995, any 1990 Scheme cases outstanding when the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (CICB) is wound up ('the transfer date') will be transferred to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) for resolution by legally qualified members of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel (CICAP) in accordance with the terms of the 1990 Scheme.

<P>
<a name="91124w08.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Poul Nielson, the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, addressed the Council for the first time. He set out five priorities for future EC development co-operation: increased focus on the poorest countries; improved effectiveness of EC assistance; greater complementarity with the work of other donors and greater coherence with other EC policies; better linkages between emergency aid, rehabilitation and development; and building greater public support for EC assistance.
<P>

<a name="91124w08.html_para0">The Council then discussed forestry, climate change and the integration of environmental issues into EC development policies. The UK stressed the need to focus on the International Development Target for the environment and to engage developing countries in the environmental agenda. The UK stated that the poor, who were dependent on environmental resources, should be placed at the centre of the discussion, and that this would help to build developing country support. The Commission said it would provide more environmental training for its staff. The Council adopted a resolution on forestry, conclusions on climate change and a report on environmental integration. The conclusions include a call on the Commission to prepare a strategy to integrate the environment into development co-operation. The Helsinki European Council in December will make an overall assessment of progress in integrating the environment into EC policies, as requested by the Vienna European Council last year.

<a name="91124w08.html_para1">Next, the Council discussed progress in the ACP-EU negotiations on a successor to the current Lome Convention, which expires on 29 February 2000. Most member states, including the UK, favoured a compromise suggested by the Commission on how to raise the profile of good governance in the new Convention. All member states except Spain supported agreement based on a Presidency non-paper on trade, which would ensure that ACP countries retained, at the very least, their current levels of access to EU markets. This is a key UK concern. The UK stressed the importance of ensuring that the agreement on trade would be granted a WTO waiver. Following a request from the UK, the Commission undertook to bring forward proposals to meet the commitment to improve duty free access for the least developed countries by the end of the next Trade Round. There was a discussion of the ninth European Development Fund (EDF9), which will fund the new Convention. The UK pointed out that evaluations had shown the poor quality of past EDFs, and called for specific proposals for improvement to be brought forward next year. Discussions will continue at a meeting between ACP and EU Ministers on 7-8 December.

<a name="91124w08.html_para2">The Council adopted conclusions on East Timor which invited the Commission to respond in an appropriate and timely manner to the United Nations Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for the East Timor crisis; and to present, as soon as possible, a detailed programme of assistance to support the reconstruction of East Timor.

evaluation of EC aid and the Council conclusions on evaluation of May 1999. The Commission outlined its plan for improving the effectiveness of EC aid, which included improving and simplifying procedures, and introducing a more rigorous monitoring system. An overall EC development policy statement would be presented to the Council and European Parliament in February 2000. The UK emphasised the importance of this statement, and that it must focus on the International Development Targets, have clear and measurable objectives, follow a wide process of consultation, and address coherence issues and aid untying. The Commission agreed to report in detail on the Action Plan and statement at the next Council in May 2000. Procedural conclusions committing the Council to follow up the evaluation of humanitarian aid were adopted without discussion.
<P>

<a name="91124w08.html_para4">The Council discussed operational co-ordination, complementarity and coherence. Most member states had agreed that co-ordination between their overseas offices and EC delegations had improved. Luxembourg called for the Commission to set up a system in co-operation with member states to deter NGOs from illegally seeking double funding. The Commission replied that it was for national authorities to deal with such cases of fraud; a further layer of bureaucracy was not the answer. The Development Council agreed that its decisions on policy coherence were not being implemented by other Councils. The Commission agreed to produce a list of policies which would benefit from greater coherence for other Council formations to consider.
<P>

<a name="91124w08.html_para5">Under Other Business, the Commission agreed to examine a French request to resume broader financial support for Burundi. The UK presented a case for more aid to strengthen statistical capacity in developing countries, and urged member states to send strong delegations to the OECD meeting in Paris on 18-19 November. At lunch Belgium called for support to improve the capacity of developing countries to engage with the WTO. The UK, with support from several other member states, then spoke on the importance of improving the poverty focus of EC development assistance, which was worse than that of all other significant donors. The UK urged the Commission to produce a paper on how it would increase the proportion of spending on low income countries. The Commission said that poverty focus was difficult to achieve, but that it would produce a paper by next Spring. Finally, the Commission called for suggestions for discussion at the EU-Africa summit in April.

<a name="91124w09.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 It is an offence contrary to the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949 to advertise on or sponsor pirate radio stations. If evidence to substantiate such offences can be obtained those involved are prosecuted.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will assess the benefits of <i>(a)</i> paying compensation and <i>(b)</i> giving refunds to community radio stations which are unable to take full advantage of their broadcasting licences because of the actions of pirate radio stations.  [99758]<P>

<P>
<a name="91124w09.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 With respect to the Wireless Telegraphy Act, the Agency endeavours to ensure interference-free spectrum for use by legitimate broadcasters. The Agency deals with this by taking direct action against pirate radio stations (928 raids nationally last year). This action is entirely funded by the revenue generated by the WT Act Licence.
<P>

<a name="91124w09.html_para1">The Agency regularly reviews its policies and has considered the issues of compensation and refunds. However, at present, it is felt that direct action is the best way of combating interference and current Agency policy reflects this.

There are currently two pilots in South Yorkshire, but we cannot at this stage say how many additional people in those areas will be helped as a result of this extension, because there are a number of detailed issues which we need to explore on a pilot by pilot basis.

 Under the Education Act 1996, schools and local education authorities (LEAs) have a duty to identify and make suitable provision for all children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia. The Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of Special Educational Needs, which came into effect on 1 September 1994, gives guidance to schools and LEAs on how to meet this duty. Paragraphs 3.60 to 3.63 provide guidance on specific learning difficulties and have particular reference to dyslexia. The Code is currently being revised to update the guidance and provide examples of good practice, with an increased emphasis on early identification and support.
<P>

<a name="91124w10.html_para2">To assist schools in recognising dyslexia, we have produced simple guidance which provides hints to primary school teachers to help them identify children who may be dyslexic. In addition, the Department has recently provided a grant to help the British Dyslexia Association produce a schools resource pack entitled "Achieving dyslexia friendly schools". Two copies of the pack have been distributed to all local education authorities in England .

 <i>[holding answer 22 November 1999]:</i> In 1999-2000, the Department expects to allocate &#163;454 million in credit approvals out of the &#163;713 million for the main schools capital programme. The remaining &#163;259 million will be given out as grant, including that for Voluntary Aided and Grant Maintained Schools. The main schools capital programme will total &#163;963 million in 2000-01 and &#163;1.3 billion in 2001-02. The proportion of credit approvals for those two years has not yet been finalised. In addition to the main programme, the Department will be providing grant funding of over &#163;200 million in each of the three years for the National Grid for learning, class sizes reduction, Sure Start and specialist schools. The Department will also be providing funding under the New Deal for Schools of &#163;250 million in 1999-2000, &#163;293 million in 2000-01 and &#163;250 million in 2001-02; and PFI credits of &#163;350 million in 1999-2000, &#163;350 million in 2000-01 and &#163;450 million in 2001-02.

 The Government are encouraging all schools to meet the needs of able pupils by adopting strategies such as setting, target-grouping, fast-tracking and accelerated learning. The initial phase of our national strategy to improve the education of gifted and talented children is concentrated mainly in areas targeted by the Excellence in Cities initiative. Some aspects of the gifted and talented strand of Excellence in Cities, notably world class tests and guidance on the literacy and numeracy strategies, have a national focus. We expect all areas to benefit eventually from the innovation and good practice emerging from the target cities. All local education authorities, including Sefton, can use Standards Fund grants to address the needs of able pupils where the definitions of eligible expenditure allow. We will announce further national initiatives shortly.

<a name="91124w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government are advised on all issues relating to animal-to-human transplants by the United Kingdom Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority (UKXIRA). Evidence about the safety of xenotransplantation is kept under constant review by the UKXIRA. Safety remains of paramount importance. Any clinical trial in xenotransplantation involving humans will be allowed to take place only when we are fully satisfied that the risk associated with the particular procedure involved is acceptable.
<P>

<a name="91124w11.html_para2">The precautions to be adopted by applicants for minimising the risk of infectious disease transmission will be a key factor in deciding whether or not to approve clinical trials. In this respect, the UKXIRA has issued two draft documents for widespread consultation. "Guidance notes on Biosecurity considerations in relation to xenotransplantation" sets out best practice for the processes and procedures to be employed in facilities where source animals are raised and kept. The "Report of the Infection Surveillance Steering Group" describes a framework for monitoring the health of xenotransplant recipients and in particular surveilling them for any signs of zoonotic infection that might be the direct result of the xenotransplant. This includes a possible mechanism for responding to suspected infection incidents. The UKXIRA would expect any applicant seeking permission to undertake a clinical trial involving a xenotransplantation procedure to have due regard to the recommendations of these documents.

<a name="91124w12.html_para9">The driving licence treatment of those with diabetes treated by insulin is based primarily on European legislation--the Second Driving Licence Directive (91/439/EEC). This provided for licensing restrictions on those with insulin-treated diabetes, in particular in respect of driving heavier vehicles, based on risks associated with insulin treatment. This can lead to a hypoglycaemic attack which in turn can lead to loss of consciousness without warning. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency

<P><I>24 Nov 1999 : Column: 146W</I><P>
receive information from the police and other sources each month, about, on average, 10 collapses at the wheel attributable to a hypoglycaemic attack. The Advisory Panel on Diabetes and Driving have indicated that the risk of loss of consciousness without warning in any one individual cannot be predicted. They have therefore consistently advised against granting licences to drive the largest vehicles to insulin-treated diabetics. There has been a bar on granting licences to drive large lorries and buses since 1991; this bar was extended to small lorries and minibuses in 1997 on implementation of the Second Driving Licence Directive, as a result of aligning the licensing of such vehicles with the requirements of the Directive.

Mr. Kandeya's appeals against both decisions remain outstanding. We have recently had unconfirmed reports that Mr. Kandeya has left the United Kingdom.

<a name="91124w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 As set out in December 1998 in the Green Paper "A New Contract for Welfare: Partnership in Pensions" (Cm 4179), the Government are prepared to consider how practicable arrangements could be devised for a statutory pension scheme to extend survivor pensions to unmarried partners of scheme members, if the general membership of the scheme sought that change and if scheme members were prepared to meet the costs of it. There is no central policy on whether such a change should be made by any public service scheme. It is a matter for the Department responsible for each public service pension scheme, in the light of the wishes of the membership of each scheme.
