To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will ensure that independent reporters used by the Director General of Water Services in his 1999 Review to challenge the cost and investment estimates of the water companies have no contractual arrangements with the water companies on which they are reporting.

 The arrangements for reporters used by the Director General of Water Services in carrying out his statutory duties are a matter for him.
<P>

<a name="71113w01.html_para0">The Director has consulted widely on the arrangements for reporters, firstly in his open letter ("MD126") issued on 20 March 1997 and more recently in his consultation paper about the business planning process for the 1999 Periodic Review. Both documents are in the Library. He has asked for comments on his proposals by Friday 14 November.

 We have received representations seeking amendments to both the General Permitted Development Order and the Demolition Direction so that a planning application can in future be required to demolish various types of sports facilities. The Government are concerned to prevent the unnecessary loss of sports facilities, particularly where there are no clear proposals for redevelopment, and we will review the need for amendments to the relevant legislation once the courts have reached their decision on Robert Coppen and others <i>v.</i> Edward Ram and another, 20 January 1997.

 From time to time the Government receive representations on the impacts of climate change on a wide range of sectors.
<P>

<a name="71113w01.html_para2">The Government are concerned to understand better the potential impacts of climate change on all sectors. In this regard, they draw on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and their own Climate Change Impacts Review Group. My Department has also established an office at the Environmental Change Unit at the University of Oxford to co-ordinate research on the impacts of climate change in the UK.

 In the current financial year a sum of &#163;4 million has been allocated to the London Cycling Network; &#163;79 million has also been allocated to local authorities outside London in 1997-98 for their integrated transport packages. Virtually all the packages include measures to promote cycling, but it is not possible to say how much local authorities will spend on cycling-related matters from their package allocations.
<P>

<a name="71113w01.html_para4">A total of &#163;800,000 has been allocated to the North Staffordshire package in 1997-98. Staffordshire County Council has received &#163;124,000 of this total and the City of Stoke-on-Trent &#163;676,000.
<P>

<a name="71113w01.html_para5">The Department will continue to support these initiatives in future, as far as resources allow. It is not possible at this stage to predict the levels of funding that will be available in 1998-99 or in later years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71113w02.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 There are already a range of measures in place to reduce emissions of mercury in the UK. Because of these and the fact that wider international action is required to deal with the problem, no specific UK response to the call from the Arctic countries is envisaged. The UK is, however, actively participating in the negotiations to develop a protocol under the UNECE's Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution 



<P>
<P><I>13 Nov 1997 : Column: 607</I><P>
to reduce European emissions of mercury and other heavy metals. Negotiations are at an advanced stage. It is expected that the protocol will be opened for signing at the Fourth Pan-European Conference of Environment Ministers on "Environment for Europe" in Aarhus, Denmark from 23 to 25 June 1998.

 Household growth reflects demographic factors, changes in age structure and deep-seated social trends. There is therefore little scope for the Government to influence the numbers even if they believed it was appropriate to do so.

 Command 2901, the last Administration's Housing White Paper, did not contain household projections.

<a name="71113w02.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 British zoos have a deservedly high reputation for their progressive approach; the way in which their animals are kept and cared for; and the contribution they make to the conservation of endangered species through scientific research and captive breeding programmes. They have also played an important part in increasing public awareness of, and interest in, species conservation issues. It is now more than 10 years since the Zoo Licensing Act 1981 came into operation, and we believe it is time to update the system to reflect the changes in the role management of zoos which have taken place during this time, and to ensure that consistently high standards are maintained in all British zoos.

<a name="71113w02.html_para0">We have therefore undertaken a review of the Act. Having considered the views of a wide range of organisations concerned with zoos, we have concluded 



<P>
<P><I>13 Nov 1997 : Column: 608</I><P>
that the system is fundamentally sound and generally working well. However, we believe that there are some areas in which improvements can be made.
<P>

<a name="71113w02.html_para1">We propose to make a number of changes to modernise the system. The main elements are:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a review of the Secretary of State's standards of modern zoo practice, with a view to encouraging greater efforts by zoos to promote conservation;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>closer monitoring of local authorities' performance and strengthened advice from central government to local councils and zoo operators;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the establishment of a broadly-based Zoos Forum to oversee the zoo licensing system and advise Ministers. We propose that the Forum should comprise representatives of local authorities, voluntary bodies, and independent animal welfare and public safety experts;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>more flexible zoo inspection teams (though we believe that the requirement for teams to include a veterinary expert and one other inspector appointed by the Secretary of State should remain, and there would be no change to the frequency of inspections);
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>tightening the inspection arrangements by encouraging local authorities to use their existing powers to undertake informal, unannounced inspections at least annually,
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>supporting measures to improve the zoo standards throughout the European Community.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="71113w02.html_para2">This is balanced package which will improve the level and consistency of standards throughout British zoos, strengthen their role in wildlife conservation, and reduce unnecessary bureaucracy. They will enable us to make a system which is already good even better, and by promoting greater openness and wider consultation, should help to increase public confidence in the zoo licensing system as a whole.
<P>

<a name="71113w02.html_para3">We now want to seek the views of those directly involved with or interested in zoos before finalising our package of improvements, and we have today issued a consultation paper setting out our proposals in more detail.
<P>

<a name="71113w02.html_para4">I would hope that all those with a concern for standards in our zoos will feel able to contribute, and we will certainly consider carefully all comments and proposals which we receive.
<P>

<a name="71113w02.html_para5">Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the House of Commons and House of Lords libraries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans he has for the rationalisation of the Army's storage estate. [16281]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71113w03.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Work has now been completed on a study, initiated by the previous Administration, on the potential for further rationalisation of the Army Base Storage and Distribution Agency's storage estate. The analysis has show that there are likely to be some increases in aspects of the Army storage task, for example some equipment and stores return from Bosnia, but the overall balance of factors, including the likely impact of the new Government's Strategic Defence Review, indicates that there will be significant reductions in ABSDA's future storage requirement. This reflects the need to drive down the overall size of the Army storage inventory to reflect changes in Defence planning assumptions and to reduce the costs of our storeholdings. Obtaining greater efficiency from Defence spending is a central part of the Strategic Defence Review. All support activities are being rigorously scrutinised against the benchmark of value for money and the need to ensure that we retain only those assets that are essential for Defence needs.
<P>

<a name="71113w03.html_para0">I have, therefore, decided to accept, as the basis for consultation with the Trades Unions and other interested parties, the recommendation that the ABSDA sub-depots at Thatcham in Berkshire, and Old Dalby in Leicestershire, should close. This would realise savings of some &#163;35 million in net present value terms over a ten-year period. I also intend to suspend the ABSDA stores division CFQ study for the time being.

<a name="71113w03.html_para1">Final decisions will be taken in the light of representations made during the consultation period. A copy of the Consultation Document is being placed in the library of the House.

 My predecessor announced on 20 February this year, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>720</i> that the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency was to be launched as a tri-Service organisation on 1 April, and that plans were in hand to appoint a commercial partner to deliver most of the Agency's services on its behalf. AFPAA was launched on the due date, and the necessary evaluation and approval processes for its partnering contract have now been completed.

<P>

<a name="71113w03.html_para2">As part of the modernisation of our Armed Forces for the 21st Century, this public-private partnering contract is the beginning of a comprehensive programme of improvement and redevelopment in the delivery of pay, pensions and personnel administrative services.

The contract will

run for up to 12 years at an estimated cost of over &#163;30 million. The effective date for transfer of responsibility to EDS, including staff and capital assets, is planned for 1 January next year.

Revelant elements of the Intervention Board's on-going tender exercise have been suspended to allow time for reflection on the full range of options presenting themselves. While some MBM is being burnt in a high temperature waste incinerator at Fawley, no decision has yet been taken on any other disposal option, or options, for the stored material, including burning MBM for energy recovery in power stations. In reaching a decision, full weight will be given to the protection of human health and the environment.

 The Government are considering the role of cycling, alongside that of all transport modes, as part of their development of an integrated transport policy to be set out in a White Paper next year. I intend to publish a Welsh Transport Policy Statement at around the same time.
<P>

<a name="71113w05.html_para3">I have already taken one practical step to give local authorities more scope to promote cycling through the changes to the Welsh Transport Grant regime which I announced in June. These will allow support to be given in future to "integrated transport packages" which can, among other things, include measures to promote cycling.

<P>
<a name="71113w06.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Blunt: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer which Departments overspent their allocated budget in financial year 1996-97; by how much each overspent its allocated budget; which Departments have had to reduce their budgets in financial year 1997-98 as a consequence; which Departments were allowed a claim on the reserve for all or part of their overspend; and how much each Department was allowed to claim from the reserve. [14026]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71113w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Darling </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 November 1997]:</i> The Ministry of Defence breached its overall cash limit for 1996-97 by &#163;246 million. It was the only Department to do so. No claim on the Reserve was agreed in respect of the overspend in 1996-97, but the overspend did increase the control total outturn for 1996-97. Following an investigation into the causes of the breach it was decided that the Ministry of Defence should reduce its overall cash limit for 1997-98 by &#163;168 million.
<P>

<a name="71113w06.html_para0">The reduction in 1997-98 is less than the overspend for two reasons. The first is that the Ministry of Defence received &#163;40 million of extra receipts in 1996-97 which could not be appropriated in aid of the Ministry's Votes, because no provision had been made for them in the Estimates presented to Parliament. These receipts had to be surrendered by the Ministry directly to the Consolidated Fund, and so they could not be included in calculating the Ministry's overspend against the cash limit on its votes. Allowance was made for this in determining the size of the reduction in the cash limit in 1997-98. Secondly, allowance was also made for certain technical adjustments made during the course of 1996-97 in connection with the sale of the married quarters estate. These amounted to &#163;38 million.

<a name="71113w07.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Laxton: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade what progress has been made on Rolls-Royce's application for launch aid for the new Trent engine. [16392]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71113w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that the Government have agreed to provide a long-term investment of up to &#163;200 million over the next four years to Rolls-Royce plc. towards the design and development of its important new range of Trent engines. This will extend the Trent family to enable it to power all the world's new large aircraft. For example, the Trent 500 has been selected by Airbus Industrie as the powerplant for the new A340-500/600, in a privileged partnership announced at the Paris Air Show in June 1997.
<P>

<a name="71113w07.html_para4">The Government's support reflects the importance of this project to the UK economy and the clearly established need for public funds to enable it to go ahead. The agreement with Rolls-Royce embodies the Government's commitment to public-private partnerships and is a marked departure from the previous administration's approach to the civil aviation industry.
<P>

<a name="71113w07.html_para5">The investment is genuinely commercial, and reflects the risk that the taxpayer has been asked to share. The Government and Rolls-Royce will share, as partners, in the future rewards from this engine programme. The Government intend that this approach will inform the consideration of any future applications for support from the civil aviation industry.

<P>

<a name="71113w07.html_para6">Rolls-Royce is the 10th largest UK investor in research and development and much of its technology is diffused to other sectors of the Uk economy. The Trent engine has already demonstrated its technical excellence and these new developments will help to ensure that Rolls-Royce remains a world leader in aero-engine technology and continues to provide a centre of excellence in the United Kingdom. Success in this new Trent range will bring wider benefits to the many companies which supply Rolls-Royce, and increase competition for worldwide sales of aero-engines to the advantage of UK airlines and airline passengers.
<P>

<a name="71113w07.html_para7">My Department will be discussing this investment with the European Commission.

<P>
<a name="71113w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 November 1997]:</i> The only animal testing issues for which my Department is responsible arise from regulations governing the supply of cosmetic products. This legislation, the Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations 1996, requires that where claims are made about the animal testing status of cosmetic products they should state clearly whether the tests carried out involved the product itself or its ingredients.
<P>

<a name="71113w08.html_para0">The Cosmetics Directive (76/768/EEC), which the Regulations implement, is unsatisfactory in its treatment of animal testing issues. In particular, the ban on using ingredients which have been tested on animals (currently deferred until 30 June 2000) does not in any case apply to finished products which may have been tested on animals. I intend to press the Commission to bring forward proposals to amend the Directive and would expect other related issues, such as compulsory labelling of animal testing, to be raised by animal welfare groups at the same time. I shall, of course, consult the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection and other interested parties.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what is the timetable for extending the Government's new deal for lone parents to the west midlands. [15478]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71113w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Phase 1 of the New Deal for Lone Parents is already available in parts of the West Midlands, offering a comprehensive package of back-to-work help for lone parents--including advice with jobsearch, training, childcare and benefits. In the West Midlands the New Deal for Lone Parents is available in Atherstone, Bedworth, Halesowen, Dudley, Kenilworth, Kidderminister, Leamington Spa, Nuneaton, Rugby, Stourbridge, Stourport on Severn and Stratford on Avon.
<P>

<a name="71113w09.html_para1">The New Deal for Lone Parents will be extended to all remaining parts of the West Midlands when it is rolled out across the country from October 1998.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71113w09.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what investment is being made to ensure that there are satisfactory levels of child care support under the new deal for lone parents. [15479]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71113w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The Government recognise the importance of good quality affordable child care for all working parents, particularly for lone parents who have to cope with bringing up children alone. That is why, when we launched the New Deal for Lone Parents in July this year, additional funds were made available to meet the child care expenses of lone parents who are undertaking jobsearch activities.
<P>

<a name="71113w09.html_para2">New Deal advisers can offer up to &#163;60 per week to each lone parent to help them pay for child care while they attend job interviews or training. New Deal advisers also have access to information on local child care services so that they can help lone parents find the most suitable child care for their children while they are at work.




<P>
<P><I>13 Nov 1997 : Column: 634</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71113w09.html_para3">The first phase of the Government's New Deal for Lone Parents, operating in eight areas, has allocated &#163;314,000 for child care during jobsearch in the current financial year 1997-98. Half of this sum has been put aside for these items for the remainder of the first phase, from 1 April to 30 September 1998. For the national programme, estimated costs being used for planning purposes are in the region of &#163;2.5 million for child care during jobsearch for 1998-99, with increased sums for following years. In addition a further &#163;50 million during the lifetime of the Parliament will be set aside to extend help with child care costs through the in-work benefits.
<P>

<a name="71113w09.html_para4">Lone parents in phase one of the New Deal for Lone Parents--including in the West Midlands--are already benefiting from this measure.

 We are committed to the goal of nuclear disarmament and continue to hold the International Court of Justice in high regard. We have said that we will press for multilateral negotiations towards mutual, balanced and verifiable reductions in nuclear weapons and, when satisfied with progress, will ensure that British nuclear weapons are included in multilateral negotiations. We will, however, vote against the resolution because of its selective quotation of the International Court of Justice's Advisory Opinion on the threat or use of nuclear weapons, and its unrealistic call for time-bound multilateral negotiations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action he intends to take to prevent frequent lottery draws in pubs and other premises. [16435]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71113w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Government have given careful consideration to the issues raised by frequent lottery draws in premises.
<P>

<a name="71113w10.html_para3">The Gaming Board has expressed serious concern to the Government about plans by a company which runs lotteries on behalf of charities under the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976 to run frequent on-line lotteries in a range of outlets, including pubs and clubs.
<P>

<a name="71113w10.html_para4">The 1976 Act did not contemplate on-line lotteries, and therefore does nothing to prevent them. The use of on-line technology would allow the promotion of successive large scale lottery draws, in a series running through the day, simultaneously in a large number of different outlets.
<P>

<a name="71113w10.html_para5">Such rapid draw lotteries would thus have many of the characteristics of hard gambling. Their unrestricted availability to the public in high streets and neighbourhoods raises serious issues of gambling control.
<P>

<a name="71113w10.html_para6">Such a development in pubs where, of course, alcohol is available, and other public places, would undermine the long-standing policy which this Government fully support, that the harder forms of gambling should be confined to premises specially licensed for gambling, and with appropriate controls.
<P>

<a name="71113w10.html_para7">Under the National Lottery etc. Act 1993, the then Secretary of State for National Heritage used his powers to direct the Director General of the National Lottery not to license games which encourage excessive participation. The Director General himself has made it clear that he does not consider that rapid play lotteries are an appropriate development for the National Lottery.
<P>

<a name="71113w10.html_para8">However, the 1976 Act needs to be strengthened to give sufficient protection in the case of other lotteries.
<P>

<a name="71113w10.html_para9">We therefore propose to introduce legislation to amend the 1976 Act to restrict frequent lottery draws. The measures, which will be introduced in Parliament as soon 



<P>
<P><I>13 Nov 1997 : Column: 640</I><P>
as possible, will not interfere with existing conventional lotteries run for charitable or other purposes. It will only restrict new forms of rapid draw lottery.
<P>

<a name="71113w10.html_para10">The Government recognise that these lotteries could raise additional money for charities but, given the social risks, we do not consider that the new type of lottery would be an acceptable development. Since this will be primary legislation, those with an interest will have every opportunity to put their points of view in Parliament on the principle and the detail. I am also proposing to publish the legislation in draft form to allow interested parties a few weeks in which to make any representations.
<P>

<a name="71113w10.html_para11">I have placed in the Library an explanatory document which sets out the position in more detail.

 On the morning of 14 October 1997, the movement of all traffic and persons into and out of Birmingham prison was suspended for approximately two and a half hours to forestall a suspected escape attempt. This is in line with security procedures. As a result, 15 adult visitors to prisoners were required to remain in the prison until normal operational procedures could be resumed.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what proposals he has to introduce minimum standards or qualifications for persons offering parenting classes; and if he will make a statement; [15278]
<P>
<UL>(2) what proposals he has to set down minimum requirements for the content and duration of training and guidance sessions for parents as described in the consultation paper "Tackling Youth Crime"; and if he will make a statement. [15279]

<P>
<a name="71113w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Reform of the youth justice system is one of the Government's key priorities. At the heart of our approach to youth crime are a determination to reassert the importance of personal and social responsibility with more emphasis placed on making young offenders and their parents take more responsibility for their actions. Up to now, insufficient help or attention has been given to parents to change offending behaviour by their children. Action will include the introduction of a new parenting order which will help parents to accept their responsibilities for the behaviour of their children.
<P>

<a name="71113w12.html_para0">The parenting order will contain two elements. There will be an element which allows the court to direct that parents exercise control over their children and an element which allows the court to impose a requirement on parents to attend training and guidance sessions. This latter element of the order can last up to three months and require the parent to attend for no more than one session in any one week. The order will be supervised by a responsible officer who will, in the short term, probably be a member of the Social Services Department. In the longer term, it is envisaged that following the 



<P>
<P><I>13 Nov 1997 : Column: 644</I><P>
establishment of Youth Offender Teams it will be a member from those teams. We intend to include proposals for the parenting order and the establishment of Youth Offender Teams in the forthcoming Crime and Disorder Bill.
<P>

<a name="71113w12.html_para1">It is envisaged that a Responsible Officer will arrange for the provision of guidance sessions for parents. The introduction of Parenting Orders will be piloted. No decision has yet been made on how we will conduct the pilot exercise. The pilots will allow us to consider appropriate guidance on the best use of the Parenting Order and on standards to be met.

 District and London Borough Councils are statutorily required to designate as polling places, so far as is reasonable and practicable, only places which are accessible to the disabled. Acting returning officers may apply to the Home Office and Scottish Office for grants towards the cost of providing temporary ramps and specially adapted polling screens to make polling stations accessible for those disabled voters who wish to vote in person. There is no limit on the number of applications which they may make for grant assistance. The Government are also considering the report "Polls Apart 2" published by SCOPE to see what further advice might be provided to acting returning officers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what capital assets his Department will acquire under signed Private Finance Initiative contracts; what is the value of those assets; if, in each case, his auditors have provided an opinion that the asset will be recognised by the private sector contractor for accounting purposes; and if he will make a statement.

 My Department will obtain services, not assets, under the duration of signed Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contracts. Design, Construct, Manage and Finance prisons (Altcourse, Parc and Lowdham Grange) and the Secure Training Centre for young offenders (Cookham Wood) will automatically become the Department's assets at no capital cost at the end of the PFI contracts in 25 and 15 years respectively. The Home Office has an option to acquire assets of the Immigration Caseworking project, and of the United Kingdom Passport Agency's passport processing contracts, at the end of the initial contract, on terms specified in the contracts. Any decision by the Home Office on whether to take up the options will depend on circumstances at the time.

 The purpose of the Government telephone preference scheme (GTPS) is to provide assured access for essential users in an emergency, when there may be a heavy load placed on the public telephone network, or the network itself may have been damaged. It was established in the late 1950s when there was a threat of massive nuclear war destroying significant parts of the national infrastructure.

 Level of grant and other assistance to individual community councils is a matter for local authorities' discretion under Section 55 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. While the Government recognise the value of effective, adequately resourced community councils, they also recognise that local authorities have many competing calls on their available resources and are accountable to their local electorate for their decisions on spending. My right hon. Friend therefore has no plans to intervene in local authorities' consideration of spending priorities involving community councils.
<P>

<a name="71113w15.html_para0">At a national level, the Scottish Office first awarded grant to the Association of Scottish Community Councils in 1996-97, to the sum of &#163;36,000. Grant proposed for 1997-98 is &#163;37,000. The purpose of the grant is to help the Association develop staff support, run a national office base, and produce a quarterly newsletter. Grant was initially envisaged for three years; grant each year depends on the association meeting relevant targets agreed with the Scottish Office. I understand that 470 community councils are members of the association, although its newsletter is sent to member and non-member community councils alike.

<a name="71113w15.html_para1">I understand that training is one of the services that the association aims to facilitate.

 We have not commissioned any research into paracetamol. Paracetamol taken at the recommended dosage is safe. However, paracetamol is available in combination with the antidote methionine where there is a danger of overdose. Data on the safety of products containing paracetamol and products containing paracetamol with methionine have been evaluated by the Licensing Authority and its expert advisory bodies when considering applications for marketing authorisations submitted to the Medicines Control Agency (MCA). Following grant of a marketing authorisation, the MCA continues to monitor safety for all authorised medicinal products, including those containing paracetamol and paracetamol with methionine.

 Myodil has been in use since the 1940s and was granted a Product Licence of Right (PLR), when the Medicines Act 1968 came into force. PLRs were reviewed by the Committee on Review of Medicines, which issued advice to the Licensing Authority. Applications for reviewed PLRs were assessed on the basis of the safety, quality and efficacy of the product. A reviewed product licence for Myodil was granted in 1987. However, Myodil was taken off the market by Glaxo for commercial reasons later in 1987. The safety of all licensed medicines is kept under continuous review by the Committee on Safety of Medicines and Medicines Control Agency. Safety data from all sources, including overseas, are included in this process.

 All the Department's press releases, other than operational notes solely for the attention of the media, are placed on the Central Office of Information's (COI) government press release Internet site at approximately 10.30 am one working day after their issue to the media. COI will shortly be improving their Internet site, as a consequence of which press releases will be available to the public on the same day that they are issued to the media. At present, all Government press releases are updated on the Internet the next working day, in large batches manually. The individual tasked with this then has other duties to perform at COI. If press releases were placed on the Internet immediately at the time of issue, one dedicated person would have to be deployed for this task. COI have commissioned software specifically designed for them to enable Press Releases to be updated and placed on the Internet at regular intervals during the day. This will achieve the same day service.

 Over the past 20 years or more there has been progressive improvement in the care of people with cystic fibrosis, reflected in the increasing numbers who survive into adulthood. A follow up study by the Clinical Standards Advisory Group of access to, and availability of, specialist services, completed in 1996, found that access to such services for patients with cystic fibrosis had been improved in most regions since the original study three years earlier. The follow-up report was sent to health authorities and trusts in December 1996 with a request that they consider carefully the suggestions for action, and in particular the need for continuing innovation in contracting. We shall continue to work with health professionals and all those with an interest to improve the care of people with cystic fibrosis and their quality of life.

 The "Guidelines for the prevention of malaria in travellers from the United Kingdom", which were published in September this year, give full details of the issues considered and references used by the group of experts who compiled them. The guidelines are comprehensive and cover periods of travel of varying lengths, including advice for travel more than two weeks but less than six months. The guidelines advise that the prophylactic regimen of choice will depend on a variety of factors such as the level of risk from malaria which exists in the country to be visited, the length of stay, the activities the traveller will be engaging in, the traveller's medical history, the effectiveness of each prophylactic regimen and the potential adverse effects of the regimen. The guidelines do recommend mefloquine for trips shorter than two weeks if the risk of highly chloroquine resistant malaria is high.

 Our White Paper "Excellence in Schools" makes it clear that school governors have a special role as partners in the education service. They provide a vital link between the school and the community, and we propose to strengthen that link by increasing the number of parent governors. We are most grateful to the 300,000 school governors in England who give their time so generously. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has personally written twice to every governing body emphasising the vital role we hope they will play in improving school performance. We are also making available specific training support to help governing bodies in their main task of raising standards in our schools.
