The NCTT liaises with the community security trust (CST) at the national level on behalf of the police service. Forces with significant Jewish communities liaise closely at the local level. The Home Office's assessment of community relations also draws upon advice from Government Offices who in turn are informed by a wide range of community sources.</p>

This project arises from a visit made to Brazil by the UK Government's Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir David King, as part of the preparations for the UK G8 Summit in Gleneagles in July 2005. The final report on the study will be available for discussion at the Brazil- UK science days at the Royal Society on 22 and23 May. The aim of the project is to try and address two difficult global problems, climate change and African development, through a tri-partite partnership.

The responses to the company law reform White Paper of March 2005 showed strong support for this initiative, but it is also clear that more information is needed on the costs and benefits of a paper free approach. The Government do not wish to rule out any option at this stage, and have therefore decided to extend the existing power relating to transfer of securities under section 207 of the Companies Act 1989 so that it could be used to require, as well as to permit, the paper free holding and transfer of company shares. In doing so, we wish to ensure that the new arrangements for paperless holding and transfer of securities do not deprive individual shareholders of existing rights which may be important to them.</p>

We do not have estimates for &#147;firstness&#148; at a regional level, due to insufficient sample sizes in the research into prior qualifications in FE.  3. The research suggests that, nationally, there is no difference in the proportion receiving fee remission between first and non-first full level 3 learners.

It means that the LSC will spend less time on transactional processes and more time developing relationships with key partners and stakeholders. This requires fewer staff with a different set of skills. The calculation of savings of up to &#163;40 million, which could be released for the benefit of learners, was based on these priorities and a structure that will require some 1,100 fewer posts. The savings include staffing, property and related costs. Due to the complexities involved in the restructuring the level of savings may change.</p>

The LIFT programme has contributed to this progress and has proven to be a tremendous success. Already some &#163;812 million in private sector and &#163;210 million in public sector funding has been injected into GP premises and community facilities across the country. There are 42 NHS LIFT schemes established with another eight in procurement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="60512w0009.htm_para16"><a name="06051268002668">This has, to date, delivered 68 new buildings open to patients with, on average, a building a week opening during 2006. In addition, we are injecting a further &#163;1 billion national health service capital this year specifically for new buildings and equipment. This money will further improve convenient access to health and social care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="60512w0009.htm_para17"><a name="06051268002669">A subjective assessment by PCTs of the proportion of premises meeting the minimum standards as at 31 March 2005 has been placed in the Library. This 2005 snapshot by PCTs shows that collectively they have judged some GP premises across the country as being below minimum standards. This needs to be set in context. Judgments for some of those standards are subjective which by their very nature may lead to some PCTs reporting higher levels of premises that do not meet minimum standards than other PCTs with similar premises. Being below minimum standards does not mean the buildings are in a dangerous state of repair. Rather, that the premises may not have for example, adequate access to and within premises and WC facilities for disabled patients and staff. Failure to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act requirements is a common reason for PCTs judging buildings as not meeting minimum requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="60512w0009.htm_para18"><a name="06051268002670">This is not because of a lack of intent by GPs' practices and their PCTs to provide these facilities but because for example, the building is too small to incorporate them; with a general lack of suitable, alternative locations to develop. These are historic problems for inner city PCTs that predate this Government and arose from difficulty of investing in smaller buildings.</p>
