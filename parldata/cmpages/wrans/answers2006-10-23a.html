most appropriate specialist environment, with associated equipment and
trained personnel who have the necessary skill sets. Furthermore, the

authorities to determine when the cost of processing a request will
exceed the appropriate limit, which for central Government is set at
&#163;600 and for the wider public sector &#163;450. In this
instance the public authority may decide to either approach the
applicant to help them refine their request and where possible to bring
it under the appropriate limit. Alternatively, public authorities may
charge the applicant the cost of processing the request. There is,
however, no obligation for departments to provide information if the
cost of processing the request exceeds the appropriate limit. The total
sum of monies received by the Northern Ireland Office in the first year
of Freedom of Information, for a request that was over the fees limit,
was
&#163;650.</p><p><a name="06102332000085">Public

recommendations for non-legislative activity will be taken forward. The

between badgers and cattle is undisputedi.e. both are capable
of being the source of infection for the other, and both are capable of
maintaining the infection in their respective groups in the absence of
the other. Transmission of infection can be either through direct
(animal to animal) contact or indirect contact from the environment.
Wild deer may in certain situations act as a reservoir of infection
although a recent quantitative risk assessment has shown that the
relative risk to cattle from wild deer is lower than that from
badgers.</p><p><a name="06102347000100">Research
demonstrates that due to the combination of the differences in the
pathology of the disease and the active surveillance, testing and
culling policy pursued in cattle, a higher proportion of badgers are
infected and when infected they are more likely to be
infectious.</p><p><a name="06102347000101">We are
continuing to carry out research to try to clarify the relative
importance of the different routes of transmission. For example, recent
research using data from the Randomised Badger Culling Trial has shown

testing and badger culling was suspended, the prevalence in badgers
increased and attributed to an increase in cattle

report includes an assessment of the performance characteristics of the
tuberculins manufactured by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA)
and by Lelystad in Holland in the context of GB&#146;s TB in cattle
testing programme. It suggests that, although the two tuberculins
perform slightly differently in the field, and that this could be a
small contributory factor to the reduction in the number of new TB
incidents, the difference is not significant enough to account for the
whole fall.</p><p><a name="06102347000109">Both
tuberculins are produced and assayed to the same standard, as part of
European Union licensing procedures. However, as tuberculin is a
biological product, there has always been variability between
batches&#151;even from the same supplier. Our reviews do not call
into question the efficacy of either tuberculin
supply.</p><p><a name="06102347000110">DEFRA has
established arrangements to purchase further supplies of tuberculin
from Lelystad as required to minimise the risk of disruption to the TB
testing programme. Either Lelystad or VLA tuberculin will be released
for field use as stocks become
available.</p><p><a name="06102347000111">We will

Howells:</b> We are seriously concerned about the
deterioration of human rights in Sri Lanka in recent months. Any abuse
of human rights is to be deplored, and it is essential that all parties
to the conflict refrain from actions that may result in violations of
human rights. We have raised our concerns with the Sri Lankan
Government at the highest levels, and our high commissioner in Colombo
presses Sri Lankan Ministers regularly on these issues.</p><p><a name="06102347000592">We note reports that at least
sixty adolescents have died following bombing by the Sri Lanka Airforce
of the Sencholai compound in Mullaitivu. It is tragic that so many
lives, particularly of young people, have been lost in such
circumstances. The full facts and circumstances of the bombing are not
yet clear, it is vital to establish the truth of this and other recent
allegations not least for the relatives of those killed and injured.
The frequent inability to establish the full circumstances and truth of
such incidents is a clear and recurrent source of frustration to those
directly affected and serves to increase the concern of the
international community who are monitoring the situation closely. For
this reason, we welcome President Rajapakse's initiative for a national
commission to inquire into recent killings, disappearances and
abductions in Sri Lanka and a panel of international observers to
oversee the process. We agree with the views expressed in September by
the UN rapporteur on extra-judicial killing, that such a process must
be independent, credible and empowered to make a difference.</p><a name="qn_"><a name="06102347000051"><a name="61023w0019.htm_wqn39"><a name="06102347000051"><h3 align="center">Sudan</h3><p><a name="06102347000593"><b><a name="61023w0019.htm_spnew40"><a name="06102347000778">Mr.

living in the area in each time period rather than mortality among
those born in each area. It is not therefore the number of years a baby

is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an

average to be within the range 180 to
220.<br><i> Key</i>:<br>CV

replaces the mean as the headline statistic. The weighted mean is the
sum of the weighted values divided by the sum of the weights. The
median is the value below which 50 per cent. of employees fall. It is
preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less by
extreme values and because of the skewed distribution of earnings
data.<br><i> Note</i>:<br>Constant

relatively low paid staff earning below the tax

median replaces the mean as the headline statistic. The weighted mean
is the sum of the weighted values divided by the sum of the weights.
The median is the value below which 50 per cent of employees fall. It
is preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less
by extreme values and because of the skewed distribution of
earnings<br><sup>(a)</sup> Employees on
adult rates whose pay for the survey pay-period was not affected by
absence.<br><sup>(b)</sup> In 2004
additional supplementary surveys were introduced to improve the
coverage of the annual survey of hours and earnings. Figures are
presented both excluding and including the additional surveys for
comparison purposes.<br><sup>(c)</sup>

quality:<br>The Coefficient of Variation
(CV) indicates the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the
higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice

Period life expectancy at birth is an estimate of the average number of
years a newborn baby would survive if he or she experienced the area's
age-specific mortality rates for that time period throughout his or her
life. The figure reflects mortality among those living in the area in
each time period, rather than mortality among those born in each area.
It is not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area in each
time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates
of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of
those born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of
their lives. <sup>(2)</sup> Using local authority boundaries as
of 2005 for all the years shown. <sup>(3)</sup> Three year
rolling averages, based on deaths registered in each year and mid-year
population estimates. <sup>(4)</sup> Confidence intervals are a
measure of the statistical precision of an estimate and show the range
of uncertainty around the estimated figure. Calculations based on small
numbers of events are often subject to random fluctuations. As a
general rule, if the confidence interval around one figure overlaps
with the interval around another, we cannot say with certainty that
there is more than a chance difference between the two
figures.<br></td></tr></table><br><p><a name="0610241001077"><b><a name="61023w0025.htm_spnew4"><a name="0610241001449">Mr.

Period life expectancy at birth is an estimate of the average number of
years a newborn baby would survive if he or she experienced the
area&#146;s age-specific mortality rates for that time period
throughout his or her life. The figure reflects mortality among those
living in the area in each time period, rather than mortality among
those born in each area. It is not therefore the number of years a baby
born in the area in each time period could actually expect to live,
both because the death rates of the area are likely to change in the
future and because many of those born in the area will live elsewhere
for at least some part of their
lives.<br><sup>(2)</sup>
Using local authority boundaries as of 2005 for all the years
shown.<br><sup>(3)</sup>
Three year rolling averages, based on deaths registered in each year
and mid-year population
estimates.<br><sup>(4)</sup>
Confidence intervals are a measure of the statistical precision of an
estimate and show the range of uncertainty around the estimated figure.
Calculations based on small numbers of events are often subject to
random fluctuations. As a general rule, if the confidence interval
around one figure overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot
say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between
the two
figures.<br></td></tr></table><br><a name="qn_"><a name="0610241000039"><a name="61023w0025.htm_wqn8"><a name="0610241000039"><h3 align="center">North

an inquest when it is reported to him that the body of a deceased

applied (in respect of the legislation then extant and which remains
unchanged) even in cases where both the death and its cause occurred
outside England and Wales and was not discretionary. Under section 14
of the 1988 Act the coroner who has the body may request another
coroner to hold the inquest if it is expedient to do
so.</p><p><a name="0610241001215">In 1983 the Home

all coroners drawing their attention to the Smith judgment and advising

the coroner local to where the funeral is to be held should normally
deal with the inquest. It is for the coroner for the district where the
body first arrived from abroad to make the decision whether to ask the
local coroner to take the case in accordance with section 14 of the
1988 Act. The circular also advised that, where more than one death
occurred abroad in the same incident, the coroner for the district

project proposals, whether housing, commercial or open space, and
assessed current delivery mechanisms to bring projects forward. A total
of eight projects are now being taken forward by English Partnerships

The following changes were made from 1 April 1998: the change to the
Home Office Counting Rules for recorded crime had the effect of
increasing the number of crimes counted. Numbers of offences for years
before and after this date are therefore not directly comparable.
&#147;Other wounding&#148; (8) split into &#147;Other
wounding&#148; (8A); &#147;Possession of weapons&#148; (8B) and
&#147;Harassment&#148; (8C) &#147;Other frauds&#148; (53A)
split into &#147;Cheque and credit card fraud&#148; (53A) and
&#147;Other fraud&#148; (53B) &#147;Cruelty or neglect of
children&#148; (11) became notifiable &#147;Assault on a
constable&#148; (104) became notifiable &#147;Common
assault&#148; (105) became notifiable &#147;Possession of
controlled drugs&#148; (92B) and &#147;other drug offences&#148;
became notifiable A number of other offences, classification numbers
26, 55, 75, 78, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 89, 90, 91, 94, 126,139,
802 and 814 became notifiable Other changes Racially aggravated
offences became notifiable from 30 September 1998, but were only
separately recorded from 1 April 1999 &#147;Abuse of position of
trust&#148; (73) became notifiable from 1 January
2001 <sup>(2)</sup> Not comparable due to changes in counting
rules. <sup>(3)</sup> Introduction of the National Crime
Recording Standard (NCRS) across England and Wales on 1 April 2002.
Some forces adopted the Standard prior to this date. Broadly, the NCRS
had the effect of increasing the number of crimes recorded by the
police. Therefore, following the introduction of the Standard, numbers
of recorded crimes are not comparable with previous years. The change
in definition relating to resultant injury in common assaults and less
serious woundings, which applies from 1 April 2002, is described in the
&#145;Common Assault&#146; text box in Chapter 5 of HOSB 07/03.
&#147;Religiously Aggravated&#148; offences were included with
&#147;Racially Aggravated&#148; offences from 1 April 2002.
&#147;Disclosure, Obstruction, False or Misleading Statements
etc.&#148; was added to the series from 1 April
2002. <sup>(4)</sup> Not comparable due to changes introduced
under the National Crime Recording Standard. <sup>(5)</sup>
Includes the British Transport police from 2002-03
onwards. <sup>(6)</sup> The introduction of the Sexual Offences
Act 2003 in May 2004 resulted in substantial changes to the sexual
offences. This means that figures for 2004-05 are not comparable with
those for previous
years.<br></td></tr></table><br><a name="qn_"><a name="06102417000062"><a name="61023w0032.htm_wqn7"><a name="06102417000062"><h3 align="center">Foreign

Hodge:</b> The Government are looking at the issue of net
neutrality in the context of the EU review of the regulatory framework
for electronic communications. Our current view is that in a
competitive market customers can benefit from a choice of prices and
access speeds set by the access provider. This will work as long as
customers understand what they are paying for and can change service
provider if they wish to quickly, easily and cheaply. On this basis, we
believe that competition law should suffice in dealing with any issues
arising. While this is not currently an issue in Europe or the UK we
are keeping the situation under
review.</p><p><a name="06102417000984">Details about

company would be required to report on its relationship with suppliers
overseas within the Business Review in order to comply with subsection
(4) of Clause 399 if it purchases products from them indirectly via an
importer.

Hodge:</b> All public companies must produce a Business
Review, as required under what is now clause 423 of the Companies Bill.
Subsection (4) requires the Business Review to be a balanced and
comprehensive analysis of the company's business, consistent with the
size and complexity of the company's business. It is for the directors
to judge whether information on suppliers overseas is relevant in this
context. In the case of quoted companies, the Government believe it
right that information on contractual and other relationships essential
to the business should be included in their directors' Business Review
to the extent necessary for an understanding of the development,
performance or position of the company's business. I have tabled an
amendment to the Bill to this
effect.</p><a name="qn_"><a name="06102417000098"><a name="61023w0035.htm_wqn9"><a name="06102417000098"><h3 align="center">Radioactive

and it was a commitment we also made in the &#147;Our Health, our
care, our say&#148; White Paper. The need to increase access to
psychological therapies was also highlighted by Professor Louis
Appleby, the national director for mental health, in his 2004 report on
the progress made in implementing the national service framework for
mental health.</p><p><a name="06102417001423">IAPT
will provide a more effective and timely access to psychological
therapies for people with mild to moderate mental health problems such
as anxiety and depression, and by increasing the choice of treatments
available to mental health service
users.</p><p><a name="06102417001424">IAPT consists
of two national demonstration sites in Newham and Doncaster and a
national programme of local projects in each of the National Institute
for Mental Health in England's eight regional development centres. The
sites will test the theory that improved access to talking therapies
can help tackle suffering, promote the well-being of the general
population and have a significant economic impact by returning to work
more people with depression or anxiety or help them stay in
employment.</p><p><a name="06102417001425">IAPT forms
a key part of the Government's &#147;Health, Work and
Well-Being&#151;Caring for Our Future&#148; strategy. IAPT,
together with initiatives from the Department for Work and Pensions and
the Health and Safety Commission, will define the best way to achieve
these improvements over the next five to ten years. We expect IAPT to
provide robust evidence in favour of increasing psychological therapy
capacity and this will help to clarify the numbers of staff, the skills
set and the training requirements needed to do this.</p><p><a name="06102417001426"><b><a name="61023w0037.htm_spnew17"><a name="06102417002176">Mr.

Rosie Winterton:</b> In April 2001, ahead of a full review of
the law in this area, the Government set up the Retained Organs
Commission (ROC), a special health authority, to deal with issues
arising from organ retention cases in England and Wales. The primary
purpose of ROC was to manage the process by which national health
service trusts provided information to relatives about retained organs
and tissue and to ensure that organs and tissue were returned to those
who requested them. In addition, ROC provided information and advocacy
for relatives and families throughout this
period.</p><p><a name="06102417001675">As part of its
package of guidance, ROC made specific mention of the need to
facilitate access to medical records wherever appropriate. ROC
completed its work in March 2004. Thereafter, the Department funded a
helpline provided by the National Bereavement Partnership, which
ensures an on-going source of information and help for
families.</p><p><a name="06102417001676">More
recently, the Human Tissue Authority (HTA) was set up under the Human
Tissue Act 2004, which applies to England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Separate legislation was introduced in Scotland under the Human Tissue
(Scotland) Act 2006. The 2004 Act followed the fundamental review of
the law. The HTA has now issued its own guidance in its code of
practice on the &#147;Removal, storage and disposal of human organs
and tissue&#148;, which builds on and supersedes the previous
guidance. The code sets out how NHS trusts should ensure full and
sensitive communication around all aspects of requests for information,
and to consider locally whether there is a need for any further
publicity. In cases following a coronial post mortem, family members
can request a copy of the report via the coroner's office.</p><br>

allowing pressure to one part of a baby's skull over a period of time,

commonly remedied by enabling babies to experience a range of positions
