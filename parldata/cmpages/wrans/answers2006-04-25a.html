<i>[holding answer 18 April 2006]:</i> The Animals Act 1971 currently has the effect of placing strict liability on the owner of animals that cause harm whatever the circumstances. This appears to be inconsistent with current liability law in other areas which allows for a general defence of reasonable care. The Government have acknowledged that there may be a case for an amendment to the Animals Act and expects to launch a consultation shortly on this matter.

 Local authorities have a duty under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess the current, and likely future, air quality in their areas. Where local authorities consider that one or more of the nationally prescribed air quality objectives for each of the seven pollutants is unlikely to be met by the relevant deadline, they must declare an air quality management area (AQMA), covering the area where the problem is expected. These local authorities must then take action, along with other agencies and organisations, to work towards meeting the air quality objectives.

In light of the conclusions of the Detailed Assessment, Kingston declared an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) in respect of nitrogen dioxide, in August 2005. Kingston is currently developing their air quality action plan, which will set out measures to work towards meeting the air quality objective. They have included measures within Hull city council&#039;s local transport plan, which should improve the capacity to deliver cleaner air within the AQMA.

 H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed in a sample from the partially decomposed body of a Whooper swan found on the causeway at Cellardyke, Fife, Scotland. The swan is the first case of H5N1 detected in a wild bird in the UK and our current hypothesis is that it originated outside Great Britain. Ongoing intensified surveillance across the UK has not identified any other positive live or dead wild bird. There is also no evidence that the virus is present in domestic poultry.

<a name="stpa_2">Poultry keepers within a 2,500 sq km wild bird risk area around the area where the swan was found have been required to house their birds.

 Most recent data from the Environment Agency (2002&#150;03) indicate that 44 per cent. of waste produced by business in England and Wales was recycled. This level of recycling exceeds what is being achieved for household waste, and is up from 37.5 per cent. in 1998&#150;89.

The Government have identified a need for further action on recycling by businesses and producer responsibility makes an important contribution to increasing recycling. The policy is aimed at ensuring that businesses take responsibility for the environmental impact of products that they place on the market, particularly once they become waste. Recent waste legislation, such as that implementing EC directives on packaging and end-of-life vehicles, places various requirements on producers, including recovery and recycling targets.

<i>[holding answer 24 April 2006]:</i> Good progress continues to be made in assembling the land for the Olympic Park. More than 80 per cent. of the land needed is already in public authority control. The London Development Agency (LDA) is responsible for the process of land assembly and its preferred option for acquiring land continues to be through reaching private agreements with landowners. Given the size and complexity of the site, the LDA has decided that it is necessary to exercise its powers of compulsory acquisition so as to be sure of securing possession of the land when required. A Public Inquiry for this Compulsory Purchase Order will begin on 9 May 2006.

 For 2005&#150;06, the Schools Formula Spending Share (FSS) system was used to distribute resources for nursery education between local authorities. The formula for under 5s used pupil numbers, weighted for deprivation, area costs and sparsity to divide up the overall total of resources for under 5s. That resulted in a unit of funding for under 5s of &#163;2,980 for Nottinghamshire. For 2006&#150;07, the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) replaced Schools FSS, and &#163;82 million was added to the total of DSG to fund the increased entitlement for nursery education from 33 weeks to 38 weeks per year. DSG has a single unit of funding for all pupils from 3 to 15: the baseline figure for Nottinghamshire for 2005&#150;06 was &#163;3,246 per pupil; and the figure for 2006&#150;07 is &#163;3,457 per pupil, which takes account of the additional funding for the increased entitlement for nursery education.

<sup>(5)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by local authority schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure. The pupil data are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(6)</sup> Combined local authority and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in local authority maintained establishments and pupils educated by the authority other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). Certain elements of central local authority expenditure cannot be attributed to a particular phase of education and consequently a sector breakdown is not available. Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under 5s funded by the authority and being educated in private settings (only available from 1999&#150;00), pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and any other local authority maintained pupils. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

Notes:<br>

2004&#150;05 figures are as reported by local authorities in their section 52 outturn statements as at 20 April 2006 and are subject to change. All figures are shown in cash terms and rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>

The main benefits have been improved intra-Government co-ordination, better understanding of the legal environment and improved technical abilities, such as communications. These factors have all contributed to improved UK maritime security. The exercise also enabled governments from 15 nations to co-ordinate their efforts to address potential future weapons of mass destruction proliferation threats. Effective joint international action helps to address maritime security for UK shipping outside UK territorial waters.

 Our Embassy in Tel Aviv has repeatedly expressed our concerns about the closure of the Karni crossing. The Embassy last raised it with the Head of Israel Defence Force Strategic Planning and Foreign Relations on 4 April, The Karni crossing was reopened on 12 April. It is important that access and movement is improved and we call on both parties to implement the 15 November Agreement on Movement and Access. The Israeli government has assured us that they will continue to support the transfer of humanitarian assistance by opening other crossing points to the Gaza Strip to avert a potential crisis due to lack of food and money.

 The UK has taken a number of steps to comply with the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). We have formally committed to and publicly endorsed the PSI and its Statement of Interdiction Principles and indicated willingness to take all steps available to support PSI efforts. We have actively participated in and hosted PSI interdiction training exercises. We have undertaken a review and provided information on current national legal authorities to undertake interdictions at sea, in the air or on land. We have indicated willingness to strengthen authorities where appropriate. We have provided points of contact for PSI interdiction requests and other operational activities. We have established appropriate internal Government processes to co-ordinate PSI response efforts. We have reviewed our legal authorities and are working on adoption of the 2005 Suppression of Unlawful Acts protocols to strengthen the legal environment for interdiction. This will make it an internationally recognised offence to transport weapons of mass destruction (WMD), their delivery systems and related materials on commercial vessels.
