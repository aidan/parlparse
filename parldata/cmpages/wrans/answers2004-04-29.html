</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w01.html_para5">
At the meetings, the UK stressed the importance of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in helping to provide a robust exit from unsustainable debt for the world&#039;s poorest countries. As part of this, the UK called for full topping up to be provided when countries face exogenous shocks, in order to bring their debt ratios back to the agreed HIPC thresholds. The UK also supported consideration of extension of the Initiative so that countries yet to enter the Initiative are able to benefit from HIPC debt relief. A number of countries&#151;many of which are in the process of trying to exit conflict&#151;have yet to reach Decision Point and benefit from HIPC relief. This could deliver an extra $30&nbsp;billion in debt relief. Iraq is not eligible for the HIPC Initiative, and so will have relief for its external debt considered under the auspices of the Paris Club&#039;s Evian Approach. However, the Government&#039;s view is that Iraq&#039;s debt position is unsustainable and that a substantial reduction will be needed to restore them to sustainability. That is likely to require writing off the vast majority of Iraq&#039;s debts.

[165069]</p>








<p><a name="40429w05.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 1&nbsp;April 2004]:</i> The work of volunteers is crucial to gathering data on the current state of our biodiversity. Volunteers have collected around 70&nbsp;per cent. of all the data about species. This includes existing survey and monitoring schemes, including the Biological Records Centre:

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">breeding and wintering birds;</p>

<ul>

<p class "tabletext">threatened plants.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w05.html_para3">
An organisation called the National Biodiversity Network Trust is currently co-ordinating actions by a range of interested parties to bring together the efforts of volunteers. The work of the NBN Trust is supported by the Government agencies responsible for biodiversity and the Government support this work through the grant-in-aid to these agencies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w05.html_para4">
DEFRA has provided a direct contribution of &#163;0.25&nbsp;million per year to support technical elements of this work that were not being funded. Part of this work has been an exploration of how improved access to biodiversity data can improve the cost-effectiveness of delivering our agri-environmental schemes. This has demonstrated the huge importance of securing access to current information as a way of saving costs overall, and improving the outcomes. DEFRA is currently considering how to secure these benefits through increased support for the NBN process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w05.html_para5">
The work of volunteers is often focused on their local area and the NBN encourages local storage and quality assurance of these data. However, there are many national societies with networks of volunteers throughout the United Kingdom.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w05.html_para6">
In some circumstances it is more effective to bring this information together in national data centres. The NBN provides a mechanism for both local and national data centres to provide access to their data. In May the latest version of this web-based mechanism, called the NBN Gateway, will be launched. Also, English Nature, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>29 Apr 2004 : Column 1188W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
supported by Treasury Capital Modernisation Funds, has created a public website that links with the NBN gateway to provide information to the public.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w05.html_para7">
In addition to the work on the NBN, the Government will be considering this year how best to improve the co-ordination of the current monitoring and surveillance activities. This will ensure that the UK&#039;s state of nature is sufficiently monitored and that we make the best use of the voluntary sector and ensure that the sector receives the full support it needs to be fully effective.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w05.html_para8">
While DEFRA is supporting the NBN process, and considering where further assistance may be needed, a major block to progress is the patchy support for local centres by local authorities. Information is critical to better development planning decisions through both local and regional processes.

 DEFRA assessments are based, principally, on surveys of badger activity carried out before and sometime after culling. Analyses of data from the first three triplets to go live indicate that badger activity levels in trial areas have changed consistent with the treatments applied; levels appearing approximately unchanged in survey only areas, somewhat reduced in reactive cull areas and substantially reduced in proactive cull areas. Such data on field signs, however, give only an approximate index of badger numbers, and Defra is funding two projects looking at ways to enable the estimation of badger populations with greater accuracy.

 There is no sure way to estimate badger populations accurately. Post cull surveys provide a subjective indication of the level of badger activity and abundance based on field signs and are carried out by ecologists from the Central Science Laboratory. Evidence from post cull surveys suggests that trapping efficiency can vary between 30&nbsp;per cent. and 80&nbsp;per cent., dependent on conditions, season and taking into account a proportion of trap shy animals. Comparisons of initial and two-year surveys show changes in badger activity consistent with the treatments applied.

<a name="40429w06.html_para3">
<i>(a)</i>&nbsp;The boundary of the Breckland Farmland Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) was drawn up by English Nature on the basis of the nest records collected under the Stone Curlew Recovery Project, financed jointly by the RSPB and English Nature, for the years 1995 to 1999 inclusive. Areas regularly containing two or more nest sites over this period were included, conservatively using a foraging range of up to 2 km from each nest site. Other features were also taken into account, in particular the need to have boundaries corresponding to physical features such as roads, drains, ditches, field edges or the boundaries of land holdings.

<a name="40429w06.html_para4">
<i>(b)</i>&nbsp;All or parts of 28 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) have been recommended as Breckland potential Special Protection Area (pSPA) because together they support breeding bird populations of three species of European importance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w06.html_para5">
Breckland SPA qualifies under the EC Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds (79/409/EEC) as it is used regularly by 1&nbsp;per cent. or more of the Great Britain population of three species of birds listed in Annex 1 of the Directive. They are stone curlew, nightjar and woodlark.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent assessment she has made of the likely effects of climate change on the UK&#039;s biodiversity in respect of insects, including butterflies; and what measures she proposes to take to counter such effects.  [165308]</p>








<p><a name="40429w09.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Department, along with the Devolved Administrations, statutory nature conservation agencies and non-governmental organisations, is contributing to an on-going research programme on the impacts of climate change on biodiversity in the UK. Results suggest that as climate changes, the distribution of species and the composition of habitats will change. With warmer temperatures, some northern species are likely to retreat, while southern species may be able to expand their ranges. At the same time, coastal habitats will be affected by rising sea levels. On land, movement of some species may be impeded by our fragmented landscapes, possibly leading to local extinctions. However, there is already evidence that some butterfly species have expanded their ranges northward in recent years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w09.html_para5">
The Government&#039;s existing policies for nature conservation provide the basis to mitigate the effects of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;climate change on biodiversity, by protecting and restoring wildlife habitats and concerted action to reverse the decline of threatened species. New evidence from research and monitoring is taken into account in developing these policies and management strategies. However, there remains considerable scientific uncertainty about the implications for individual species.

The Government are fully committed to the Kyoto Protocol and to reducing the UK&#039;s greenhouse gas emissions. Through the Climate Change Programme we have put in place a strong programme of policies and measures to ensure that the UK meets its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and moves towards its domestic goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20&nbsp;per cent. on 1990 levels by 2010. Longer term, the UK aims to strengthen its action further by putting itself on a path to a 60&nbsp;per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.

<p><a name="40429w09.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 An organisation called the National Biodiversity Network Trust is currently co-ordinating actions by a range of interested parties to bring together the biological recording efforts of volunteers and agencies. The work of the NBN Trust is supported by 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>29 Apr 2004 : Column 1202W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40429w09.html_para7">
In addition, DEFRA has provided financial support for specific surveys such as the Millennium Butterfly Atlas and monitoring work on butterflies on land subject to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agri-environment schemes. Species of particular concern are subject to individual specific action under the Biodiversity Action Plan and Government support this process through their conservation agencies in England, Wales and Scotland and the Environment and Heritage Service in Northern Ireland. Volunteers, through their relevant national schemes or societies, carry out much of the survey and monitoring work on priority species.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w09.html_para8">
The vast majority of information on the distribution, status and trends of species comes from the activities of volunteers. These are individuals with a special interest in insects who give freely of their spare time. A key part of the work of the NBN Trust is about supporting these people and encouraging the next generation of biological recorders. Replacing the effort of volunteers with contracted survey would be extremely costly and need continued funding. The Government support the work of the NBN Trust as the primary mechanism to secure the continued supply of information from volunteers through capacity building of support networks at national and local scale.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w09.html_para9">
We believe that the short life spans and diverse needs of insects make some of them good indicators of environmental change. Information on the status and trends in insects, and other plants and animals, would be extremely helpful in both detecting adverse change and identifying sustainable practices. We recognise that some groups of insects do not have the resources necessary to provide a comprehensive baseline of information and more resources are needed. DEFRA is currently exploring options for improving surveillance and monitoring of species, including insects, and will consider future funding in the light of discussions with the conservation agencies and representatives of voluntary conservation organisations.

<p><a name="40429w10.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The need to maintain, and improve where necessary, the health and vitality of trees is integral to the government&#039;s approach to sustainable forest management. We have set this out in the UK Forestry Standard and its supporting literature, which contain many specific measures for protecting woodland and improving tree health. All woodland management by the Forestry Commission is consistent with this standard and we expect private woodland owners that receive grant aid from the Forestry Commission to also meet the standard. The government has encouraged the development of the voluntary UK Woodland Assurance Standard that provides an independent verification of compliance with good practice and measures to ensure the continuing good health of woodland. We shall continue to ensure compliance with the UK Forest Standard in those woods managed by the Forestry Commission and encourage it in the private sector. We will improve, through research, our knowledge of factors affecting

This overall renewables percentage includes both biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes and large scale hydro. The amount of electricity produced using hydro sources varies from year to year depending on the rainfall. Low precipitation during the winters of 2000&#150;01 and 2002&#150;03 resulted in low hydro output during 2001 and 2003 hence the fall in generation from renewables in those years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w13.html_para8">
Source eligible for the Renewables Obligation are biofuels (including the co-firing of biomass with fossil fuel), onshore and offshore wind, all new hydro, refurbished hydro up to 20 MW (commissioned before 1990), solar photovoltaics and wave and tidal technologies. As more and more onshore and offshore wind projects are commissioned, we can expect to see substantial growth in the amount of renewables electricity output over the coming years.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what energy assumptions have influenced her Department&#039;s policy on the appropriate carbon dioxide reduction target relative to 1990 levels within the National Allocation Plan to implement the EU Emissions Trading Directive.  [167755]</p>








<p><a name="40429w14.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The draft National Allocation Plan (NAP) indicated that the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) would be responsible for delivering the remaining savings of 1.5&nbsp;million tonnes of Carbon (MtC) (equivalent to 5.5&nbsp;million tonnes of carbon dioxide) from 1990 levels by 2010 envisaged under the UK Climate Change Programme from emissions trading for which there are no policies currently in place. With the exception of the power generation sector, allowances to installations have been allocated on the basis of their projected emissions for the first phase of the scheme, which runs from 2005&#150;07. These projections take account of updated estimates of the impacts and policy measures set out in the Climate Change Programme which have already been implemented or for which there are firm plans. Allowances to the power generation sector have been allocated on the basis that this sector will be responsible for the emissions trading savings of 1.5 MtC to be delivered by the EU ETS. This reflects the fact that the power generation sector faces limited international competition and has relatively good low-cost abatement opportunities.

<p><a name="40429w14.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The UK Climate Change Programme envisaged that emissions trading would deliver carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2</sub> ) reductions of 2&nbsp;million tonnes of Carbon (MtC) (equivalent to 7.3&nbsp;million tonnes of CO <sub>2</sub> ) by 2010. As the UK Emissions Trading Scheme is expected to lead to CO <sub>2</sub> reductions of about 0.5 MtC (1.8 MtCO <sub>2</sub> ), the draft National Allocation Plan (NAP) indicated that the Government had decided that the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) would be used to achieve the remaining savings of 1.5 MtC (5.5 MtCO <sub>2</sub> ) by 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w14.html_para3">
The draft NAP confirmed that the UK is firmly committed to its domestic goal set out in the 2000 Climate Change Programme of moving towards a 20&nbsp;per cent. reduction in CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions below 1990 levels by 2010. Subject to a review of the effectiveness of the EU ETS as a vehicle for delivering cost effective emissions reductions, it is intended that the total quantity of allowances to be issued for the second phase of the Scheme running from 2008 to 2012 will be set to ensure that installations covered by the Scheme make an appropriate contribution to that goal. This will be taken into account in the review of the Climate Change Programme which will take place later this year.

<p><a name="40429w14.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 In practice, the impact of this Directive is likely to vary according to the installation considered and there is a good deal of uncertainty about how the Directive will impact in overall terms. In general, the DTI energy model does not make projections for installations to this level of detail. In modelling the power station sector, a modest improvement in energy efficiency has been assumed to take place at existing coal fired power stations.

<p><a name="40429w18.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Robathan: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how much the Standards Board for England has spent on investigations with regard to parish councils; and how much money was involved in the complaints and issues that led to such investigations.  [168664]</p>









<p><a name="40429w18.html_spnew1"><b> Phil Hope: </b>

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether his Department directs the Standards Board for England to consider the benefit to the public interest when <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;determining whether to pursue investigations against parish councillors and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;pursuing those investigations.  [168720]</p>








<p><a name="40429w18.html_spnew2"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 When considering allegations of misconduct, the Standards Board for England operates within the statutory framework of the Local Government Act 2000 and related Regulations. In considering whether to refer an allegation for investigation, the Board considers whether the allegation is serious enough to justify a referral for investigation, and if a national or local investigation would be justified. The purpose of an investigation, carried out by an ethical standards officer, appointed by the Standards Board, is to make a finding as to whether or not the code of conduct for members has been breached and what further action if any needs to be taken. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not have powers to intervene in particular cases and does not do so.

Since April 2003, disabled people in work have been receiving financial support through the working tax credit. This is available if a person is working an average of at least 16 hours per week (self-employed or for an employer); and have a disability which puts them at a disadvantage in getting a job. 70,000 families (including over 32,000 adults without children) are benefiting from the disability element within the working tax credit, compared to 38,000 who benefited from the old disabled person&#039;s tax credit.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;Figures are for Great Britain in 2004&#150;05 price terms using the GDP deflator index rounded to the nearest &#163;100&nbsp;million.<br>

2.&nbsp;Gross costs are estimated by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department and are consistent with Budget 2004 assumptions and use 2002 based population projections. Gross costs refer to the additional costs after allowing for National Insurance Fund benefits and non-means tested vote benefits.<br>

3.&nbsp;The net cost includes all savings except for additional income tax revenue, see note 4.<br>

4.&nbsp;Additional income tax revenue is estimated by the Inland Revenue using 2006 tax rates. We are unable to publish any income tax forecast estimates for years beyond that which is published in the Financial Statement and Budget Report (currently 2006&#150;07). The income tax estimate for 2006&#150;07 is based on the 2001&#150;02 Survey of Personal Incomes and is projected in line 



with March 2004 Budget assumptions. The income tax revenue in 2006&#150;07 is &#163;5.4 billion, resulting in a total net cost of &#163;9.4 billion. For illustrative purposes, Inland Revenue assumed income tax revenue to be a fixed percentage of the gross cost for this option in 2007&#150;08 and 2008&#150;09. Therefore, the total net cost in 2007&#150;08 is &#163;10 billion and in 2008&#150;09 is &#163;10.5 billion. Estimates for later years would be subject to a greater degree of uncertainty.<br>

5.&nbsp;The savings from abolishing future accruals to the state second pension are also calculated by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department, they include state pension, additional pension and widows benefit additional pension and are consistent with the long term Public Expenditure Survey forecasts. As earnings in the year of reaching state pension age do not count towards an individual&#039;s S2P, the first savings occur in 2007&#150;08. No allowance has been made for changes to contracting out rules.<br>

6.&nbsp;The savings credit is assumed to be abolished from April 2006 with no payments to existing pensioners and no new recipients after 2006. Figures are based on the illustrative long-term projections of benefit expenditure underlying Annex A of the Budget report.<br>

7.&nbsp;The savings from other income related benefits (housing benefit and council tax benefit) are calculated using the Department&#039;s policy simulation model and April 2004 benefit rates. Consistent with previous answers the offset for the first year is held constant for subsequent years. In addition the increase in housing benefit and council tax benefit personal allowance for people aged 65 and over by the maximum savings credit amount, introduced alongside savings credit and included in forecast expenditure, has been accounted for, with the costing including the effect of removing this increase.<br>

It is estimated that around four in 10 (42&nbsp;per cent.) of applications for asylum in the UK in 2002 resulted in the granting at initial decision of asylum (10&nbsp;per cent.) or of exceptional leave to remain (23&nbsp;per cent.), or in appeals which were allowed by the IAA adjudicators (a further 10&nbsp;per cent.).

 Data on the number asylum cases that went onto appeal are given in the following tables.

IAA Appeal determinations may relate to initial decisions made in previous years; IAT appeal determinations may relate to IAA determinations in earlier years. Outcomes of appeals relate to whether an asylum appeal is allowed, dismissed or withdrawn. Allowed appeals do not necessarily result in grants of leave to remain. Some appeals to the IAT are brought by the Secretary of State.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the countries to which the Home Office does not currently return failed asylum seekers.  [165828]</p>








<p><a name="40429w30.html_spnew20"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 We seek to remove all failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants wherever possible. All asylum and human rights claims are considered on their individual merits in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Should a claim be refused and any appeal before the independent Immigration Appellate Authority be unsuccessful, it means that for that individual it is safe to return.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w30.html_para30">
The only country to which, as a matter of policy, we do not at present generally enforce the return of failed asylum seekers is Zimbabwe. This policy is based not on asylum or human rights reasons but on our view that in the wider context of the Government&#039;s position on Zimbabwe, it would be inappropriate forcibly to return failed asylum seekers applicable at this time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w30.html_para31">
However, it is open to Zimbabwean failed asylum seekers to return voluntarily. Zimbabweans may apply for the Voluntary Assisted Return and Reintegration Programme (VAARP) operated by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) on behalf of the Home Office.

Following a recommendation made by the Home Affairs Select Committee in April 2003 that measures be put in place to record and publicise such cases, IND is currently looking into the feasibility of setting up a central database to record all mistaken removals. We do not have any present plans to publicise such information but no final decision will be made on this without prior consultation with the Immigration Research and Statistical Service (IRSS).

<p><a name="40429w30.html_spnew22"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 In assessing suitability for dispersal the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Asylum Support Service (NASS) takes account of all known facts. Some health needs are identified when the application for NASS support is being completed. In addition, those asylum seekers who go through Induction Centres are given the opportunity to have a health assessment. This does not automatically include screening for HIV/AIDS but an asylum seeker who believes he may be at risk may opt to have tests conducted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w30.html_para33">
Asylum seekers known to be HIV positive are dispersed to areas where relevant treatment is available. In line with standard practice for all MASS dispersals, MASS informs the relevant Primary Care Trust of the asylum seeker&#039;s arrival in their area. MASS outreach staff visit asylum seekers shortly after their arrival to ensure that they have access to all services, including health services. Accommodation providers and voluntary sector &quot;one-stop&quot; services can also assist newly dispersed asylum seekers to access services including registering with a GP. Asylum seekers who have undergone a health assessment prior to dispersal are in possession of hand held medical records which they can pass to their GP.

These policies and practices are being considered as part of a short external review which is expected to report to Ministers in the Summer.

 The latest published statistics show that the speed of processing asylum applications continues to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improve. 80&nbsp;per cent. of applications (excluding withdrawals and third country cases <sup>1</sup> ) received in the period April to September 2003 had initial decisions reached and served within two months. 74&nbsp;per cent. of applications received in 2002&#150;03, and 61&nbsp;per cent. of applications received in 2001&#150;02, had initial decisions reached and served within two months.

The average time between application and initial decision was 10 months for initial decisions made in 2003, compared with 20 months for April 1997. This has been calculated using all cases for which data are available, including older cases decided as part of the reduction of the number of outstanding cases, as well as new cases decided as part of normal work in progress. The number of cases awaiting initial decision fell to 24,500 at the end of December 2003, the lowest level for more than a decade (and 41&nbsp;per cent. lower than a year earlier), and continues to fall.

The work required is challenging because, by definition, illegal migrants fall outside of official statistics and are therefore difficult to measure. People illegally present in the UK are also motivated to ensure they remain hidden, which is a challenge to conducting research.

Prior to May 2001, DNA samples obtained from persons who were charged or prosecuted and who were subsequently acquitted or against whom charges were dropped had to be destroyed.

 There is no automatic requirement to produce an ID card for particular services in the draft Bill published by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on 26&nbsp;April.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w33.html_para2">
Recording the National Insurance number on the Register would link the more secure identity established when the ID card is issued with the National Insurance number which is a less securely issued number.

As set out in &quot;Legislation on Identity Cards: a consultation (CM 6178)&quot; there will be no new power for the police to stop someone and demand to see their card. Existing police powers to require drivers to produce their driving licence (which could be designated as an ID card) on demand or within seven days at a police station will remain. Added to this, if someone has been arrested for a recordable offence, existing powers will allow the&nbsp;police to take reasonable steps to identify them. This&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;currently includes powers to check biometric information. There are also classes of criminal offences which are non-arrestable and are enforced by sending a summons. In these situations, the police have to be certain of a person&#039;s name and address. If a person refuses to identify themselves in these circumstances or the police are not satisfied with the information given, they have a power of arrest after which biometric checks can be made. If it were not possible to identify an arrested person otherwise, for example checking police records, a check could then be made on the person&#039;s biometric against the National Identity Register.

Our ability to effect removals to the country of origin is crucial in tackling illegal immigration, and we expect the co-operation of source countries in this regard. The Chinese Government have very strict conditions for re-documenting their citizens and will only accept their return once they have verified their exact identity. This causes problems for many countries that wish to repatriate Chinese illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers, as those who do not wish to return are careful to conceal their true identity. Chinese officials seconded to the Immigration Service have recently provided assistance in identifying Chinese nationals to enable their return. We are now working on an arrangement to make this assistance permanent.

<p><a name="40429w33.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The current principal control on employers to prevent the use of illegal labour is section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. Section 8 makes it an offence to employ someone over the age of 16 who is subject to immigration control unless that person has current and valid permission to be in the United Kingdom and that permission does not prevent him or her from taking the job in question; or that person comes into a category where such employment is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise allowed. At present, an employer can be fined up to &#163;5,000 per illegal employee on summary conviction for an offence under section 8.

On 16&nbsp;March we announced changes, via secondary legislation, to strengthen the security of the document checks employers must carry out on prospective employees under section 8 to establish a statutory defence from prosecution.

<p>
<a name="40429w33.html_para8">
The changes will make it easier for compliant employers to ensure that their work force can work in the UK, and for the Immigration Service to identify and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prosecute the small minority of non-compliant employers who knowingly or negligently employ illegal workers.

The Government recognises the widespread concern, especially in the wake of the recent Morecambe Bay tragedy, about the use of illegal labour and is also supporting the Private Members Bill introduced by my hon. friend, the member for Renfrewshire West (Jim Sheridan) on the licensing of gangmasters. More generally, we are increasing illegal working enforcement activity.
</p>

Between April and June 2003 the Immigration Service reported carrying out 79 illegal working operations of which 27 were aimed at detecting five or more illegal workers. Between October and November last year the number of reported operations increased by over 75&nbsp;per cent. on the second quarter to 141, while the operations aimed at detecting five or more illegal workers rose by over 175&nbsp;per cent. to 75.

In the four month period from the beginning of November 2003 to the end of February 2004 UKIS reported carrying out 18 enforcement operations at farms and packhouses where labour providers were involved. These operations led to the removal of over a hundred immigration offenders. A further 11 operations involving labour providers are also scheduled or being planned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40429w33.html_para12">
Earlier this month, two major investigations involving the police supported by UKIS resulted in the conviction of gangmasters for very serious criminal offences. In March, six labour providers with the company Ultimate Source were convicted at Kings Lynn Crown Court of various offences in connection with the supply of illegal workers.

<p><a name="40429w35.html_spnew0"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Prison Service does not routinely collect the information requested. However, it is estimated that naltrexone, an abstinence-based treatment, is currently available in around 50 establishments for men and one for women. Methadone maintenance is available in the majority of establishments for women but is not yet widely used in men&#039;s prisons.

Subutex (buprenorphine) is included in the treatment protocols developed in conjunction with NHS services at eight establishments for men. Every establishment for women has the capacity to prescribe subutex but few do so at present because methadone is considered to meet most prisoners&#039; needs. Subutex would, however, be made available to any woman already being prescribed it when received into custody.
