<i> [holding answer 19 June 2006]:</i> The Government are committed to maintaining a diverse and vibrant child care market where providers from the private, voluntary, independent and maintained sectors work together in support of children and families. The new duties in the Childcare Bill will require local authorities to assess child care needs within their area, find out what parents want, and try to meet their needs. This will deliver choice and maintain diversity, responding to the needs of parents who&#151;perhaps because they work atypical hours&#151;are looking for flexible child care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="60620w0001.htm_para0"><a name="06062036000031">All three and four-year-olds are currently entitled to 12 and a half hours of free early learning and child care, and by 2010 this will have increased to 15 hours. Parents will be able to use the free entitlement flexibly enabling them to balance work and family life more effectively. From later this year pathfinders will test delivery mechanisms to ensure that parental demand for increased flexibility can be met without driving smaller settings out of business. The findings from the pathfinders will inform the roll out of the extension in hours and flexibility by 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="60620w0001.htm_para1"><a name="06062036000032">The duty in the Childcare Bill to secure sufficient child care which is eligible under the child care element of the working tax credit will help to improve the affordability of child care by providing greater access for families to the financial support available through the tax credits system. During 2005-06, the level of investment in the child care element of the working tax credit was more than &#163;2.4 million a day, benefiting around 356,000 families. This year the maximum proportion of costs that can be claimed through tax credits increased from 70 per cent. to 80 per cent. We are also tackling high child care costs in London through a pilot programme being run jointly with the London Development Agency and the Greater London Authority which will deliver an additional 10,000 child care places for families on lower incomes.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 June 2006]:</i> I understand that Hertfordshire county council is still developing its children&#146;s centres implementation plan. Each local authority has strategic responsibility for developing children&#146;s centre services in its own area. We have issued guidance to help local authorities do this, including examples of good practice. However, detailed plans will be based on an individual authority&#146;s own assessment of the needs of children under five and their families in the area, including the levels of disadvantage they face.</p>

We experienced a similar dip in applications in 1998 when tuition fees were introduced, but numbers returned to their usual levels the following year and continued upwards thereafter.

 Questions 61a and 63a were removed from the survey because they were not providing an accurate measure of the levels of discrimination and bullying in the Army, or of the Army&#146;s commitment to issues of equality. They asked whether individuals believed that bullying and discrimination exists rather than whether they had direct experience of such incidents. Responses were therefore likely to be influenced by factors such as anecdotal evidence, media coverage and popular opinion as opposed to personal knowledge.

 I have received no representations. The Law Commission published a consultation paper on  31 May entitled &#147;Cohabitation: the Financial Consequences of Relationship Breakdown&#148;. The consultation period will run until 30 September. The Law Commission has not proposed giving cohabiting couples the same rights on separation as married couples on divorce. An overview document of the consultation paper is available on the Law Commission's website at www.lawcom.gov.uk/cohabitation.htm.

 The Government do not intend to introduce a new clause to define desirable activity. The provision in Clause 1 of the Bill gives the court the flexibility to consider all the relevant circumstances of the case to reach a fair and just decision.

 The situation in Sierra Leone is stable and the country has made considerable progress since the end of the civil war in 2002. This was confirmed by the withdrawal of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, UNAMSIL in December 2005. However, considerable challenges remain and the state is fragile. Current threats to continued stability include frustration resulting from large-scale unemployment, particularly among young men, and the weak capacity of government to deliver basic services. Poverty is high, with 70 per cent. estimated to be living below the poverty line. The run-up to the 2007 elections is likely to be a period of increased tension within the country and insecurity in other countries in the region may also present challenges to continued stability.</p>

DFID has supported the care and maintenance of Liberian refugees in camps across the region for some years, and more recently has financed their repatriation from Sierra Leone and other countries. In 2005, &#163;1.1 million was committed for these objectives, and this year, a further &#163;700,000 has been allocated. In addition, DFID has spent over &#163;3.5 million per year for the last three years to help rebuild Liberia and thereby encourage refugees from Sierra Leone and other countries to return home.</p>

 The only significant disease outbreak currently affecting Darfur is that of the 75 cases of acute watery diarrhoea in South Darfur. The outbreak has so far claimed four lives in the state, with cases concentrated in Nyala, Kass and EI-Daein towns. The first report of the outbreak was on 24 May 2006 and all four deaths to date occurred on 24-25 May 2006. This reflects the effective planning and response by the Government and humanitarian agencies. Although, the vast majority of cases have been amongst town residents rather than in the internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, the unconfirmed reports of a case in Gereida, where 100,000 IDPs have sought shelter, is of concern.</p>

The immediate response has also included the mapping of cases, identifying high risk areas for chlorination of water supplies and testing. In preparation for an outbreak, the WHO stockpiled cholera treatment kits across Darfur. These have proved invaluable in enabling the immediate response. In addition, a Cholera Treatment Centre has been set up in Nyala with the capacity to handle 50 patients a day.</p>

focused its discussion on two World Bank documents: (i) The Global Monitoring Report (GMR) 2006: Strengthening Mutual Accountability&#151;Aid, Trade and Governance and (ii) Clean Energy and Development: Towards an Investment Framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_469"><a name="60620w0014.htm_para5"><a name="0606216000163">The GMR sets out clearly the progress that has been made on tackling poverty, and the challenges that remain. We noted that almost all developing countries are off-track to meet at least some of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and the lack of progress in Africa is especially worrying. More aid is clearly essential, and it must be delivered more effectively. We called on the World Bank, other bilateral and multilateral agencies to take action, and ensure that we live up to the commitments made in Paris on aid effectiveness last year, including a country-based approach. The Results and Resources Frameworks, first suggested in the Bank's Africa Action Plan, are a good vehicle for improving mutual accountability and we urged the Bank to develop and implement them quickly. We also called on donors to give more emphasis to assisting the poorest countries, including fragile states and make commitments to increased and long-term resources for education so that developing countries can fully finance their education plans over the long-term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_470"><a name="60620w0014.htm_para6"><a name="0606216000164">The Development Committee agreed that donors should fully implement the commitments they have made for substantial increases in aid volumes, and that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have a key role in helping countries ensure that increases in aid volumes can be absorbed effectively, consistent with macro-economic stability and growth objectives. Rapid progress was required to implement the framework agreed in the Paris Declaration for enhancing aid effectiveness through a stronger focus on results. Donors need to improve the quality of aid, modalities of aid delivery to reduce volatility, achieve greater predictability, and provide stronger alignment with national poverty reduction strategies. They were encouraged where possible to move towards multi-year plans and commitments, and be ready to finance recurrent costs where sector policies are sound and fiduciary conditions are adequate. The Committee agreed that the World Bank and other partners should improve their coordination at the country level, particularly in strengthening health services and improving access to good quality education, to reduce transaction costs and help increase absorptive capacity. Donors should fill the Education Fast Track Initiative current financing gap and a progress report on Education for All should be submitted to the Annual Meeting in Singapore. The Committee urged the Bank to implement the annual Results and Resources Frameworks.</p>

At the Committee, I underlined that governance was critical for development and achieving the MDGs, and an essential element of the compact between developing countries, developed countries and international institutions. Only countries themselves can make the decisive changes that are needed. However, donors can help the process of creating more effective states and it is vital that we assist.

framework for monitoring provided a practical and useful starting point, and should be developed further to include aspects such as the extent to which the state responds to the wishes of the people, particularly the poor. We strongly supported the message in the report that corruption is an outcome of poor governance, and caused by a number of failures of national and global systems. It should not be tolerated; but we made clear that our work on tackling corruption needs to get better at addressing the failures, and connect better with the people who have the power and motivation to do something about it. The international community must work collaboratively and take a firm line on the need to tackle and prevent corruption. It must not equate to doing nothing in poor countries where corruption is an issue. Instead, we must find more effective ways of engaging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_472"><a name="60620w0014.htm_para8"><a name="0606216000166">I called on the World Bank to develop a framework for assisting developing countries with their long-term efforts to improve governance, and tackle corruption where it needs addressing. The framework will need to include how we can best ensure that aid is used for the purpose for which it was intended. This will include strong, independent units to detect and investigate fraud; strengthening national financial and accountability systems more effectively; and how to address the corruption that comes from beyond national borders, including developing global initiatives, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. We urged the World Bank to consult widely in taking forward this work, recognising that addressing governance failures will require action from all parts of the international community, not only from developing countries. It is essential that the framework commands broad support.</p>

Responsibility for mitigating climate change requires urgent action on the part of richer countries, while some fast-growing middle-income countries must shift to cleaner, more efficient energy production to avoid exacerbating the problem. Meanwhile, developing countries need access to affordable, reliable and clean energy to grow their economies and to lift people out of poverty. We urged the international community to act now to support countries to do this in a sustainable way and so achieve a double-dividend of poverty reduction and environmental protection. Helping member countries meet these challenges should be a key objective of the World Bank and other multilateral development banks over the coming years.</p>

African governments and institutions know that creating the right environment in which people and firms feel comfortable investing their money is crucial for Africa's prosperity. If Africa is to achieve the growth necessary to meet the MDGs, the business environment must improve significantly. Boosting African growth and poverty reduction is, ultimately, what the ICF is all about. I urged donors to co-fund the ICF and cooperate operationally so that it can add value and truly be complementary to existing work. African participants welcomed the formation of the ICF with its strong African ownership. Donors (including the International Finance Corporation and the European Commission) and companies have also responded positively and the ICF was launched in Africa on 1 June.</p>

 In 2004, the World Bank abolished its practice of "prescriptive conditionally", which meant countries were urged to adopt specific economic policies to receive budgetary support. The UK pressed for a review of the World Bank's use of conditionality, and this concluded in September 2005. The World Bank undertook analysis of previous practice and recent thinking, and sought contributions and views from many sources, including developing countries. I made a written submission, setting out the Government's stance, and particularly emphasising the importance of country ownership in setting the development agenda. The review report has been published and is available on the World Bank website at www.worldbank.org<i> .</i> It showed that the use of conditionality in sensitive areas, such as trade liberalisation and privatisation, had declined in recent years.

A review of IMF conditionality last year demonstrated a sharper focus on core areas of the Fund's remit in macroeconomic management and a reduction in conditions on privatisation and liberalisation. A separate review of the Fund's trade policy and conditions showed a sharp reduction in overall conditions on trade policy since the adoption of the guidelines. In addition, it demonstrated a shift towards conditions on trade governance, such as reforming customs administration, and away from trade policy such as tariffs.

Under the Care Standards Act 2000, BPAS is required to supply each patient with a written copy of its complaints procedure, fully investigate each complaint and maintain a detailed, written record of each complaint. BPAS is also required to send the Healthcare Commission a statement every year with a summary of the complaints received. In addition, the Healthcare Commission look at these records as part of a clinic inspection.</p>

 The tariff applies to midwife-led maternity units, to the extent that they are providing services within scope of payment by results.

The MHRA is aware of deaths that have been reported in association with the use of mifepristone both in the United States (US) and in the United Kingdom.

 Last year the Government launched the Courtauld Commitment, a voluntary agreement between 13 major retailers and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to reduce packaging waste. There are three broad objectives to meet, which are:</p>
<a name="60620w0024.htm_brev0"><a name="06062126002057"><ul><p class="tabletext">i. to design out packaging waste growth by 2008;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_605"><a name="60620w0024.htm_para4"><a name="06062126000105">There are also two sets of regulations which cover packaging in the UK both of which encourage producers (including retailers) to minimise packaging. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) are intended to increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. The amount of packaging waste producers have to recover and recycle is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle. Therefore, businesses can save money if they reduce the amount of packaging they handle. The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended) place a number of requirements on all packaging placed on the market in the UK, including a requirement that packaging should be manufactured so that the volume and weight are limited to the minimum adequate amount to maintain the necessary level of safety, hygiene and acceptance for the packed product and for the consumer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_606"><a name="60620w0024.htm_para5"><a name="06062126000106">Both regulations have led to decreases in packaging used around products. However, more still needs to be done to reduce the amount of packaging that is produced. We have asked the Advisory Committee on Packaging to work with industry to find solutions to this problem and to let me have recommendations for ways of encouraging businesses to further reduce the amount of packaging they use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_607"><a name="60620w0024.htm_para6"><a name="06062126000107">Although legislation is one way of reducing packaging, consumers also have a part to play. If consumers make a point of choosing goods that are not heavily packaged, buy &#147;loose&#148; food rather than pre-packaged food and use their reusable shopping bags, manufacturers would be more inclined to think about the type and the quantity of packaging around their products.</p>

 Since the introduction of the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) in April 2003, over 45,000 drug misusing offenders have entered treatment through DIP. The programme continues to have a positive impact in communities not only through the interventions that it offers but also by delivering a more integrated approach by local agencies to the problems of offenders. Acquisitive recorded crime&#151;to which drug related crime (including theft) makes a substantial contribution&#151;fell by 12 per cent. in the year to April 2005 compared with the previous 12 months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_624"><a name="60620w0026.htm_para0"><a name="06062126000522">The programme is highly regarded by operational staff and the many offenders whose lives it has helped to change. Its success has been achieved through a combination of additional resources, new legislation, revised working practices and a stronger focus on partnership working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_625"><a name="60620w0026.htm_para1"><a name="06062126000523">We are on track to achieve the overall target of 1,000 offenders a week (4,300 a month) into treatment by 2008. In April 2006 over 2,800 offenders engaged in treatment through DIP. The programme continues to be developed and strengthened. For example, from 31 March 2006 testing on arrest has been rolled out to 98 areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_626"><a name="60620w0026.htm_para2"><a name="06062126000524">Those testing positive are required to attend an assessment with a drugs worker. Testing on arrest is a way of identifying drug misusers at an early stage in the criminal justice process. Restriction on bail is now available across all local justice areas in England.</p>

 Together with the Muslim communities, we are taking forward projects designed to reduce the risk of radicalisation of vulnerable young people. Examples of these projects are; The National Roadshow of Influential Populist Scholars, work with the UK Youth Parliament seeking new and effective tools for engagement and youth workshops to challenge the radicalisation of Muslim youth. The Prison Service have commissioned a three year project on how prison service policies on preparing prisoners for release meets the needs of Muslim prisoners. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office have a full programme of media intensive visits by British Muslim delegations to a number of countries in the Muslim world. And as a Government we are committed to prioritising policies that tackle the real and perceived socio-economic inequalities confronting Muslim communities today. As well as focusing on tackling the issue of young Muslims being influenced and exploited by extremists, the Home Office has funded a number of initiatives in Burnley, Oldham and Bradford which are involved in engaging young people at risk of joining far right extremist organisations. The Home Office also works closely with Rewind a project aimed at tackling issues of racism among young people. We are also supporting an initiative in Blackburn with Darwen which will bring together young girls across faith groups to discuss issues of racism and extremism.</p>

<i> [holding answer 8 May 2006]:</i> Compensation under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme is paid on the basis of a tariff (scale) of awards for injuries of comparable severity. The tariff awards for the loss of limbs are as under: loss of one leg below knee &#163;33,000, loss of one leg above knee &#163;44,000, loss of one hand or arm &#163;44,000, loss of both hands or arms &#163;110,000, loss of both legs &#163;110,000.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his estimate is of the number of people trafficked into the UK for <i> (a)</i> sexual slavery and <i> (b)</i> forced labour in each year since 1997, broken down by country of origin. [74856]</p>

<p><a name="st_459"><a name="06062126000810"><a name="60620w0027.htm_spnew8"><a name="06062126002168"><b>Mr. Coaker:</b>
 It is difficult to make an accurate assessment of the number of people trafficked into the UK for sexual or labour exploitation and particularly by reference to the year and country of origin. An indicator of the number of victims involved in this type of trafficking is the number of referrals to the Poppy project. Since the scheme's inception in 2003 a total of 184 women who met the criteria for the project have been referred to it (out of a total of 451 referrals between March 2003 and the end of March 2006). However, the scheme operates mainly in London and has tightly focused criteria, so the number of victims nationwide is likely to be higher. A breakdown of the country of origin for women who met the criteria for the Poppy project follows. Operation Pentameter, a police-led, multi-agency initiative aimed at tackling the trafficking of human beings for sexual exploitation has resulted in the rescue of 75 women since its launch on the 21 February. These cases are subject to on-going investigation and as such it would not be appropriate to disclose the country of origin of the potential trafficking victims. The Home Office has commissioned CEOP, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre, to conduct an intelligence gathering exercise to scope the problem of child trafficking in the UK; initial findings are expected in the autumn.</p>

Statistical returns are provided on a monthly basis by local enforcement offices, showing the breakdown by nationality of those encountered during illegal working operations. There is currently no facility available to record whether those encountered have been trafficked for the purpose of labour exploitation. However, following are statistics available for illegal working operations for each financial year since 2002 with the top five nationalities identified (figures are not available prior to 2002). 2002-03&#151;A total of 301 operations were reported; a total of 1,099 offenders were encountered. Poland, Lithuania, Brazil, Ukraine and Pakistan were the top five nationalities identified in descending order. 2003-04&#151;A total of 697 operations were reported in 2003-04; a total of 2,304 offenders were encountered. Brazil, Poland, Lithuania, Bangladesh and Ukraine were the top five nationalities identified in descending order. 2004-05&#151;A total of 3,314 operations were reported in 2004-05; a total of 9,227 offenders were encountered.

This funding will not only provide for the existing crisis provision service for up to 25 women, it will also meet the costs of 10 additional &#147;step-down&#148; places which will help the women to live semi-independently with less intensive support, and the development of a resource pack for victims, service providers and law enforcement agency staff. It will also introduce the first ever specialist national outreach service in the UK for victims trafficked into sexual exploitation. Whilst the project remains London based it will continue to take referrals from across the country and provide a national service. We are currently looking at how best to utilise other existing local service providers to support victims and will continue to consider the feasibility of further extending the Poppy model of support to other areas in the future.</p>

 The Government have taken a number of steps to deter child trafficking into the UK. They have, for example, strengthened the legislative framework by including the offence of trafficking children in the Sexual Offences Act, 2003 and the Asylum and Immigration Act, 2004. Additionally, the Sexual Offences Act introduced new offences of &#147;abuse of children through prostitution and pornography&#148; which aim to protect children under the age of 18. The law enforcement response to human trafficking is co-ordinated by Reflex, the multi agency task force on organised immigration crime, established in 2000. Reflex has been working closely with police forces in the regions to increase awareness of human trafficking and build capacity to tackle it. A key thrust of its activity is to develop our intelligence base, thereby improving our knowledge and understanding of the extent and nature of child trafficking within the UK. The establishment of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) on 1 April 2006 brings a renewed focus on improving intelligence and targeting those organised crime groups causing the most harm. The previous Home Secretary (Mr. Clarke) made clear in his letter to all chief constables, in June 2005, that police forces should increase their efforts against organised immigration crime, focusing particularly on human trafficking. A national action plan is being developed this year incorporating the responses from the UK consultation on tackling human trafficking. The action plan will include measures to deter child trafficking. Responses to the plan from stakeholders are currently being collated with a view to publishing a summary report of these on 21 June 2006. The Government are increasing their engagement with developing countries in helping to eradicate the root causes of trafficking such as poverty, social exclusion, discrimination against women, girls and inequality. The Government are working with several overseas countries to prevent human trafficking by helping to tackle poverty and removing the conditions that lead to forced migration. The Government are also seeking to build the capacity of these countries to combat trafficking by improving ways of stemming the problem. Through our embassies and consulates we are working to raise awareness in source countries on the dangers of trafficking among potential victims.</p>

 Children who have been identified as having been trafficked and who are considered to be at risk are looked after by local authorities under section 20 of the 1989 Children Act.

safe arrangements for lone asylum-seeking children who have been assessed as being at risk from traffickers can be incorporated in those for other unaccompanied foreign national minors in need of support. This work will be carried out in partnership with the most knowledgeable and experienced local authorities. Her Majesty&#146;s Government are aware that children returned to certain countries could be put at risk of further harm, with the likelihood of being re-trafficked. As a general principle, therefore, children will only be returned, where it is considered both possible and safe to do so and only after a full assessment of each case has been thoroughly carried out. Before considering the return of a child, full consideration is given to the Government&#146;s obligations under the immigration laws and the European Convention on Human Rights and the unique circumstances of each case including an assessment of the country of origin.</p>

 While no assessment has been made of the effect of the creation of larger police forces on response times, we believe that strategic forces will have greater capability and capacity to deliver effective protective services, response policing and neighbourhood policing for all their communities.

This will preserve and embed neighbourhood policing and protect people better against serious crime and terrorism. Both Lancashire and Cumbria police authorities voted in favour of amalgamation.</p>

 Four meetings of the multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) strategic management boards were held in the last 12 months and a representative of the Area Manager attended all these meetings. The Prison Service is part of the MAPPA &#147;Responsible Authority&#148; with the Police and Probation and a protocol exists between the agencies which has been signed by the Area Manager. This requires the Area Manager to ensure consistent representation at strategic management board. The main responsibilities of the Prison Service and the Area Manager are to ensure that operational functions work consistently in prisons.

BTP adopted this standard on 1 April 2002. The impact of the new recording standard saw an increase in recorded crime, equating to an average 22 per cent. increase recorded by all police forces across England and Wales. The basic principle of NCRS is that if on the balance of probability a crime has been committed it is recorded as a crime. As a result 2001-02 data cannot be meaningfully compared with subsequent years. The standard has made crime recording more victim focused.</p>

 The SIA do not calculate the average processing times for applications. Some, such as those involving overseas criminal records checks, unavoidably take a considerable time. The SIA have a published target of processing 80 per cent. of all applications within six weeks, measured from the date that a properly completed application enters the processing system to the date that a licence is issued. From April 2004 until August 2005 the SIA processed 62 per cent. within six weeks and 88 per cent. within nine weeks. Since September 2005, there has been a backlog of applications that have been waiting to enter the system. These have added an additional time of between two and four weeks to the process, so it is now taking up to 10 weeks to process most applications.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 June 2006]:</i> Local authorities can place restrictions on public drinking in areas with a history of alcohol-related crime, disorder or nuisance by making a Designated Public Place Order (DPPO), sometimes referred to as an &#145;alcohol control zone&#146;. The power, given under section 13 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, is not available to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, and can only be exercised by local government. Current figures reveal that around 170 authorities now have adopted this measure, with around 360 Orders published in England and Wales.</p>

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="7"><sup>(1)</sup> Rate per 100,000 population standardised to the European Standard Population. <sup>(2)</sup> Deaths from all circulatory diseases selected using the International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision (ICD-8) codes 390-444.1, 444.4-458.9 and 782 for the years 1970 to 1978, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 390-459 for the years 1979 to 2000, and Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes 100-199 for 2001 onwards. <sup>(3)</sup> Deaths from malignant neoplasms selected using the International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision (ICD-8) codes 140-207 for the years 1976 to 1978, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 140-208 for the years 1979 to 2000, and Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes C00-C97for 2001 onwards. <sup>(4)</sup> Deaths of babies aged under 28 days are excluded from 1986 onwards. <sup>(5)</sup> Figures are for registrations of death in each calendar year from 1970 to 1992 and for occurrences of death in each calendar year from 1993 onwards. <i> Note</i>: Between 1984 and 1992 a different interpretation of ICD-9 selection Rule 3 was used to code underlying cause of death in England and Wales to that used internationally. This change means that comparisons between this period and years before and after, should be interpreted with caution. The impact of the change on mortality statistics was analysed and reported in annual mortality publications in 1984 and 1994. *The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 also means that figures are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. Comparisons between the data before and after 2001 should therefore also be interpreted with caution.
