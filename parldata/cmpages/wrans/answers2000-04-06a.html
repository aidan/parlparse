<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Willetts: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what checks are applied to confirm the identities of new employees in his Department and its agencies. [117705]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 This Department undertakes rigorous recruitment checks on all staff prior to employment. The checks undertaken confirm not only identity, but character, nationality, right to work and employment suitability. Work is currently ongoing to identify, as part of the recruitment checking process, any possible conflicts of interest with new recruits.
<P>

<a name="00406w01.html_para0">To confirm identify, the checks follow the Cabinet Office guidance. The documentation required to do this vary according to nationality.
<P>

<a name="00406w01.html_para1">British Nationals require a full 10 year passport, or combination of two other identification documents.
<P>

<a name="00406w01.html_para2">EC nationals require either a full EC passport or an identity card issued by the EC country.
<P>

<a name="00406w01.html_para3">Commonwealth citizens require either a full passport issued by the country concerned or a document issued by the Home Office establishing the individual's immigration status in the UK.
<P>

<a name="00406w01.html_para4">Steps are taken to examine the documentation to verify its authenticity.
<P>

<a name="00406w01.html_para5">Assurance mechanisms for pre-appointment checks are built into our recruitment process. These include management checks to ensure they are being carried out and our internal audit team regularly carry out their own checks.

<a name="00406w01.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>Stakeholder Pensions</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if, he intends under the draft stakeholder pension regulations, the separate arrangement to charge for individual detached advice to be regarded as a pension contract; and if he will make a statement.  [117600]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 No. It is important that everyone considering a stakeholder pension understands and is confident that the only charge to be taken out of their pension fund will be within the 1 per cent. annual management charge. Schemes may offer financial advice within the 1 per cent. charge if they wish. The draft stakeholder pension regulations are designed to ensure that any contract for the provision of financial advice (and any other services apart from the management of the scheme and its funds) above the 1 per cent. limit must be optional and separate from the pension contract.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many single mothers with dependent children are making pension contributions through <i>(a)</i> National Insurance, <i>(b)</i> SERPS and <i>(c)</i> private pension schemes; how many are making no such contributions; and if he will estimate his Department's unfunded liability, assuming present levels of pension payments, in (i) 2020, (ii) 2040 and (iii) 2060.  [117530]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 There are 2.2 million single mothers with dependent children making pension contributions through National Insurance. Of these 1.3 million (60 per cent. of those paying National Insurance) have private pension cover, while 0.9 million (the remaining 40 per cent. of those paying National Insurance) are contributing to SERPS. Around three million single mothers were making no pension contributions.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. All amounts are rounded to the nearest 10,000, although estimates are not necessarily accurate to that degree.<P>





2. The Below &#163;3,000 and Below &#163;6,000 categories include pensioners who have no savings.<P>

3. Questions on assets are a sensitive part of the FRS questionnaire and have relatively low levels of response, and hence higher levels of imputation, compared to other parts of the survey. Responses are imputed in around 1 in 10 cases. Evidence also suggests some under reporting of capital by respondents.<P>

4. Pensioner Units are defined as either a single pensioner or a couple where the head of the couple is over the State Pension Age. A couple can be either a married or a co-habiting partnership.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 A new model for forecasting caseload and expenditure on Industrial Injuries Benefits has been developed. A comparison of encashment data with new expenditure forecasts for 1998-99 has identified an undercounting of around 6 per cent. in the number of assessments.
<P>

<a name="00406w01.html_para6">Future assessment forecasts have assumed that this 6 per cent. undercounting is constant over the forecast period.

<P>
<a name="00406w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 We have taken action over a wide front to help all of today's pensioners. Initiatives include Winter Fuel Payments, free eye tests to the over 60s and free TV licences for the over 75s from autumn next year. Also from April 2001, capital limits in the Minimum Income Guarantee for those over 60 will be increased from &#163;6,000 to &#163;12,000. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has also announced a review

<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 As part of the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) take-up campaign we will be writing to around two million pensioners whom our records suggest are most likely to have underlying entitlement. This targeted group will be pensioners who our pension records suggest have incomes below the MIG level. However, we do not know how many of these pensioners will have capital or other income that could affect their entitlement to benefit.

 I have instructed the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) to make cover available to Mivan Ltd. and Kier International who have won a contract to construct low cost housing and provide water services to villages in Romania. The export credit guarantees will amount to $120 million. In addition, a further $47 million is being provided in support of the project by commercial banks not covered by ECGD. This project will bring benefits to many ordinary Romanians and provide an important export order for Northern Ireland where Mivan is based.
<P>

<a name="00406w02.html_para0">ECGD has now exhausted cover capacity under its exposure ceiling for Romania. They will review cover policy in the light of the progress Romania makes in negotiating and implementing its IMF backed economic programme and its external debt servicing capability.

 The UK Government are committed to dealing with the remaining liabilities at Dounreay safely, securely and in a way that represents value for money to the taxpayer. In order to achieve the long-term restoration of the site, a solution needs to be found to deal with the remaining fuels, including PFR fuels.
<P>

<a name="00406w02.html_para1">Following a comprehensive review of options for managing Dounreay PFR fuels, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) has identified three options:

There is no mandatory requirement to conduct such a consultation exercise, however in the spirit of openness, and given the high level of local interest and the impact it may have on activities at the site, all those with an interest are being consulted. As part of this consultation I will also be seeking the views of the relevant Government advisory bodies. A copy of the consultation package will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The consultation will close on 2 June and I would hope to announce a decision a few weeks later. The results of this consultation will be made available to the public, as will the information supporting the decision. The decision will be taken on safety, environmental and economic grounds.

 <i>[holding answer 16 March 2000]:</i> At their 1996 meeting, Commonwealth Ministers of Women's Affairs recommended that member countries achieve a target of no less than 30 per cent. of women in the political, public and private sectors by 2005 and those countries already close to achieving this target should aim for gender parity.

<a name="00406w02.html_para12">It is up to individual countries to use ways most appropriate to their national circumstances to achieve these targets and there are no figures available regarding the public and private sector.

<a name="00406w02.html_para13">The Commonwealth Secretariat undertook a number of initiatives to assist governments in their efforts to increase women's participation in political decision-making, including:

 None. The Standards Fund enables the targeting of funds on specific programmes, areas or schools, to support the Government's drive to raise standards. Local education authorities are required to devolve around 75 per cent. of the Standards Fund to schools. In addition, all maintained schools will receive a share of the additional funding through the &#163;50 million School Standards Grant and the &#163;290 million School Budget Support Grant. Both of these special grants are fully funded by the Government and are only for schools.

This research suggests that over 3,500 young people have taken part on New Deal Options including over 900 on the Employer Option. In addition there is evidence to show that local council are employing people under the New Deals for the Disabled, for Lone Parents and for 50+. We continue to work closely with Local Authority Associations and the New Deal Task Force to encourage local council take up of New Deal. The Local Authority Associations themselves are actively promoting the take up of New Deal among their members.

However, London boroughs receive funding for the cost of providing education for the children of asylum seekers in the same way as for all other children on the school roll.

 This Government recognised the importance of staging major international sporting events in this country in our manifesto for the 1997 general election.

This is now providing a coherent framework of support and experience for organisations bidding for and staging events throughout the UK. One of the recent fruits of this coherent approach has been UK Athletics' successful bids for the 2003 World Indoor Championships and the 2005 World Athletics Championships.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the consultation exercises so far undertaken to evaluate the environmental impact of the proposed MOX Plant (SMP) at BNFL Sellafield. [114796]<P>

<P>
<a name="00406w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In November 1996 BNFL sought approval from the Environment Agency to bring the Sellafield MOX plant into operation. The Environment Agency consulted on issues associated with the justification of the MOX plant, including its environmental impact, between February and April 1997.
<P>

<a name="00406w04.html_para3">Respondents to this consultation raised a number of environmental issues and, in addition, some expressed concern about the lack of information provided by BNFL 



<P>

on the economic case. Consequently, the Agency engaged a firm of financial consultants, PA Consulting Group, to carry out an independent assessment of BNFL's economic case for the plant.
<P>

<a name="00406w04.html_para4">The Environment Agency then carried out a second round of consultation between January and March 1998, based on a public domain version of the PA report--which excluded certain material on the grounds of commercial confidentiality.
<P>

<a name="00406w04.html_para6">In looking at the advice from the Environment Agency and the representations they had received, Ministers decided that the amount of information excluded on the grounds of commercial confidentiality from the public domain version of the PA report was more than strictly necessary, and that there had been developments in the potential market for MOX fuel which led them to consider that there should be further public scrutiny of BNFL's business case. Ministers therefore consulted again between May and June 1999 on the basis of a significantly greater disclosure of information on the economic case and were considering the responses to this consultation when data falsification at the Sellafield MOX Demonstration Facility first came to light.

 London Underground are currently spending &#163;136 million on re-conditioning the Piccadilly line rolling stock. They estimate that this will extend the effective working life of the rolling stock to 2014.

 The guidance on full local transport plans (LTPs), published on 27 March, advises local authorities that their LTPs must include a set of indicators and targets for measuring performance against objectives. The guidance describes the indicators for road safety. These will be used for monitoring progress towards the local casualty reduction target. Authorities are required to submit their LTPs for 2001-02 to 2005-06 by 31 July. In subsequent years, authorities will be required to submit annual progress reports. The first progress reports will be submitted in July 2001. Authorities will report on the indicators contained in the plan and progress towards achieving the targets set.

 At present, most applications for listed building consent for all grades of listed building within Greater London must be made to the relevant London borough who must in turn notify English Heritage. Also, certain cases are referred by English Heritage to the Secretary of State. However, since the Greater London Council was abolished, English Heritage has been working with the London boroughs to build up their expertise in relation to such applications. We are satisfied that the London boroughs are now in a position to take on full responsibility for determining the majority of listed building consent applications on a similar basis to the arrangements outside London. We therefore issued proposals for consultation last year for changes that would lead to a significant reduction in the number of listed building cases that would need to be notified to English Heritage and the Secretary of State and thus enable decisions on applications to be made more quickly. Copies of the consultation paper 'London Heritage Notifications' were placed in the Libraries of both Houses at the time. English Heritage would, however, continue to be consulted on applications for works to Grade I and

<i>Specific energy efficiency programmes</i>
<BR>

<BR>
The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES) provides energy efficiency improvements to the homes of eligible households. The scheme was devolved to the Scottish Executive on 1 July 1999 and to the Welsh Executive from 1 April 2000. The scheme in England is due to be radically overhauled from 1 June, with New HEES providing packages of heating and insulation improvements to households and focusing on the private sector where nearly 70 per cent. of the fuel poor in England are found. The total gross budget for HEES, after allowing for moneys to the devolved administrations, is as shown.

<i>Main housing programmes</i>
<BR>

<BR>
The Government have also substantially increased the resources available to local authorities over the lifetime of this Parliament, reversing the reductions planned by previous government. The extra resources in the first three years, 1997-98 to 1999-2000, were allocated through the Capital Receipts Initiative (CRI). Information collected to monitor the impact of the CRI found that around a quarter to a third of the work on local authorities' own stock financed from this initiative lead either directly or indirectly to improvements in energy efficiency. If this were replicated across all local authority housing capital expenditure on its own stock this would equate to around &#163;400-500 million per annum. The total housing capital allocations to local authorities through the Housing Investment Programme (HIP) and Capital Receipts Initiative, are as shown.

 The Defence Vetting Agency carries out some 200,000 personnel security vetting checks and investigations each year. Since it was launched in 1997, the Agency has embarked on an ambitious modernisation programme aimed at creating a highly responsive, efficient and integrated organisation, exploiting the capabilities of modern information technology to the benefit of its customers. FY2000-2001 will be a period of particular upheaval as the Agency begins to collocate its four separate vetting units to York. Collocation involves much more than the move on to a single site. New accommodation, processes, IT systems, and a substantially new workforce will be introduced, as the existing vetting units close. Consequently, while the quality of its outputs should be unaffected, it is expected that there will be a notable reduction in the Agencies

 The estimated flight times to East Timor and Mozambique for the two types of aircraft would be similar, since both cruise at roughly the same airspeed. En-route, both aircraft would require refuelling stops of about two hours and one crew change. However, the C-17 is capable of being refuelled in the air and, therefore, apart from having to land for a crew change, it could avoid the intermediate refuelling stops.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 All organisations, including those offering support to victims of violence, which received funding from the European Union are subject to the financial controls stipulated in the European Commission's regulations and enforced by each member state. These include verification visits by the promoters through which the funds are channelled; independent audit checks by consultants acting on behalf of the promoters; and checks/visits carried out by Departmental Internal Auditors, the Northern Ireland Audit Office and the European Court of Auditors.
<P>

<a name="00406w11.html_para1">The total value of European Union funds allocated to Northern Ireland since December 1993 is approximately &#163;1.5 billion comprising NI Single Programme &#163;980 million, Community Initiatives &#163;92 million and the European Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation &#163;385 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what measures he has taken to integrate the statutory equality duty into the new Targeting Social Need initiative.  [117362]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2000]:</i> The statutory obligation on equality of opportunity under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and New Targeting Social Need (New TSN) are separate but complementary elements of the Government's equality agenda. The statutory obligation requires Public Authorities, including NI Departments and the NIO, to have due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity in terms of nine social categories. New TSN is a policy running through spending programmes in NI Government Departments and the NIO which requires efforts and available resources to be targeted towards people, groups and areas objectively defined as being in greatest social need.




<P>
<P><I>6 Apr 2000 : Column: 570W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00406w11.html_para3">The Government have made it clear that there is no incompatibility between the principles of equality of opportunity and targeting on the basis of objective social need; addressing disadvantage may often contribute to reducing socio-economic inequalities within the Section 75 categories. The OFMDFM will include the New TSN policy within its Equality Impact Assessment in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will accept the recommendation of the Northern Ireland Commission on Fair Employment to conduct the next analysis of unemployment differentials before the 2011 Census.  [117359]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2000]:</i> Government continually monitor community differentials in unemployment through annual Labour Force Surveys. The analysis will be greatly assisted by the results of the 2001 Census, which will provide more accurate data. In the White Paper "Partnership for Equality" (Cm 3890 March 1998) the Government gave a commitment to a further review of employment equality in Northern Ireland, including unemployment differentials, to be launched by 2005. They also predicted that the proposals in the White Paper, together with social and economic change, would lead to a substantial reduction in unemployment differentials which should be evidenced in the 2011 Census.

<a name="00406w12.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2000]:</i> Under the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 the Equality Commission, with the approval of the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, may issue Codes of Practice on fair employment issues. A Code of Practice has been in circulation for several years. My hon. Friend may be referring to the Equality Commission's equality scheme guidelines, "Guide to the Statutory duties: A guide to the implementation of the statutory duties on public authorities arising from Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998". Those guidelines were launched by the Equality Commission on 31 March 2000. Distribution of the guidelines is a matter for the Commission.

 <i>[holding answer 29 March 2000]:</i> The World Education Forum in Dakar later this month will assess progress achieved in the decade since the World Conference on Education for All in Jomtien. This is an important opportunity for the international community to reaffirm its commitment to providing education for the world's children, and to put in place a Framework for Action. At the G8 Summit in Okinawa in July Heads of Government will consider the outcome of the Dakar Forum and look at what more can be done to ensure that the target of universal primary education by 2015 is achieved.

 <i>[holding answer 29</i> <i>March 2000]:</i> The Government are committed to the target of achieving universal primary education by 2015. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development and Department for International Development officials are in frequent contact with their EU and UN counterparts about the achievement of universal primary education. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF)--together with the World bank--are the convenors of the World Education Forum to be held in Dakar later this month.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w13.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The National Health Service Executive in England has held a series of seminars for local winter planning groups (which include NHS trusts) in each region to consider the main issues emerging from the winter period.
<P>

<a name="00406w13.html_para0">The main concerns reported by NHS trusts were peaks in emergency admissions from patients suffering from influenza and respiratory illness, staff shortages and the cancellation of operations because of pressure on critical care beds.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the Government's submission to the negotiations on the Working Time Directive on reducing working hours for junior doctors. [116883]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are firmly committed to reducing junior doctors' working hours. We have already agreed a new contract with junior doctors' negotiators which will, if accepted in their referendum, place an 56 hour limit on average weekly hours by February 2004.
<P>

<a name="00406w13.html_para1">An agreement was reached between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament on 3 April as part of the Conciliation to extend the European Working Time Directive to the excluded sectors. If approved by the European Parliament, this will provide a sound footing for reducing junior doctors' working hours. Over the next decade, we will have to make sure we can meet the needs of patients and deliver improvements in patient care while at the same time reducing doctors' hours. That is why we and our European partners have argued for a realistic transitional period in order to implement fully the terms of the Directive as they apply to doctors in training. We are pleased that the Conciliation has achieved recognition of the need for flexibility during the transitional period.

Friend the Secretary of State on 27 March. This brings overall increases for health authorities to 6.2 per cent. in real terms (8.9 per cent. cash).

 During 1998-99, &#163;1.25 billion (4.8 per cent. of total National Health Service spending on the provision of health services) was spent on services commissioned outside the NHS (from the private healthcare industry and charitable and voluntary organisations). Over half was spent on residential care, mainly for learning disability and mental illness patients.

[117962]<P>

<P>
<a name="00406w14.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Provisions for new feed additives agreed at the 6-7 December meeting of the Standing Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs have been published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i> on 29 March as Commission Regulation (EC) 654/2000. This Regulation has now come into force in all European Union member states.

<P>

<a name="00406w14.html_para2">On 28 February the European Commission produced a comprehensive list of additives authorised for use in animal feed. The list has no legal basis in itself and is expected to be next revised in early 2001.

<a name="00406w14.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 New authorisations for feed additives, such as those agreed at the December meeting of the European Union Standing Committee for Animal Feedingstuffs, are granted under Council Directive 70/524/EEC for generic, rather than product-specific approval. I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that one new authorisation agreed in December was on a dossier provided by a British company. The corresponding provision contained in Commission Regulation 654/2000 is for the use of a micro-organism product for use in feed for calves containing certain strains of <i>Lactobacillus casei</i> and <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to the answer of 13 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 61-62W, on fruit and vegetables, if he will list the methods used by his Department, in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to inform the public of the advice on peeling and washing fruit and vegetables in relation to pesticide residues; what was the expenditure on such advice in the last financial year; and if the Food Standards Agency will continue to give such advice.  [118016]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w14.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Advice to wash and prepare fruit and vegetables before eating has been included in press releases and the Ministry of Agriculture/Department of Health Food Safety Information Bulletin when results from surveys of pesticide residues in food are published. It is also used by Government Departments in responding to inquiries about pesticide residues in food. Reporting the results of surveys is routine work and no separate information on related expenditure is available. The Food

Transport strategies will include reducing car parking spaces by encouraging the use of alternative modes of transport whenever possible or practicable.

 I refer my hon.

However, civilian mine clearance organisations have regular contact with many types of unexploded ordnance. KFOR provided the United Nations Mines Action and Co-Ordination Centre (UNMACC) with an information pack about DU which UNMACC distributed to each mine clearance organisation.
<P>

<a name="00406w14.html_para5">The Government have not felt it necessary to provide further advice to general aid workers on this issue. My Department's view is that mines and unexploded ordnance pose a greater risk to assistance workers; all personnel are given mines awareness training before deployment to Kosovo.

 As a result of personal tax and benefit measures introduced by this Government, the tax burden on a typical single earner couple on average earnings with two children will fall from 21.5 in 1996-97 to 18.8 by 2001, the lowest level since 1972.
<P>

<a name="00406w15.html_para1">Estimating the impact of indirect taxes is imprecise as spending patterns vary widely between households with the same composition and income, with the consumption of the majority of goods and services far from universal. For example, only around one third of adults are smokers, just over half the adult population are in households paying vehicle excise duty and around 10 per cent. of households pay air passenger duty. This can be contrasted with direct taxes and benefits where at specified earnings and for particular household types there is a known benefit entitlement or tax liability.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department in what circumstances immigration officers will be requesting passenger information from carriers under paragraph 27B of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971, as inserted by section 18 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999; and if he will make a statement.

<a name="00406w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The types of information which may be requested are set out in the Schedule to the Immigration (Passenger Information) Order 2000. The information specified in Part I of the Schedule to the Order is contained in the machine-readable zone of passports and visas. Provision of this information is essential if we are

to be able to grant or refuse entry to passengers in advance of their arrival in the United Kingdom. We have set out what we propose by way of such flexibilities in the draft Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order laid before Parliament on 30 March 2000. We would expect to come to a mutual agreement with carriers as to the routes for which we might start to require Part I information and as to when the requirement would start. Beyond this, we would seek Part I information only on specific occasions for intelligence purposes. We would endeavour to keep such requests to a minimum. The information specified in Part II of the Schedule will be requested only where the carrier is in possession of it. However, we think it might take some time for carriers to put systems in place to allow them to provide us with any significant volume of information, so we will implement the new power gradually over the coming months. We will continue in this spirit of co-operation, but ultimately we reserve the right to insist upon the provision of passenger information under the new powers wherever we have good reason in the context of the immigration control.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department in each of the last two years for which figures are available, what was the total amount of funding for asylum seekers' support <i>(a)</i> in total, <i>(b)</i> per head of population, <i>(c)</i> per income tax payer, <i>(d)</i> per household and <i>(e)</i> as a percentage of total Government expenditure; what are the estimated figures for 2000-01; and if he will make a statement.  [117982]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00406w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 In 1998-99, support for asylum seekers was the responsibility of the Department of Health and the Department of Social Security. The Department of Health states that the total payments for supporting asylum seekers were &#163;190 million in 1998-99. The Department of Social Security estimate that, subject to audit, the total benefits paid to asylum seekers will be &#163;285 million.
<P>

<a name="00406w17.html_para4">Since 1 April 1999, the Home Office has been responsible for a single budget for reimbursing local authorities for the costs of supporting adult asylum seekers and families. Reimbursement of local authority costs relating to unaccompanied children remained the responsibility of the Department of Health. Total payments to local authorities and reimbursement for the Department of Social Security costs for 1999-2000 are estimated to be &#163;597 million subject to audit.
<P>

<a name="00406w17.html_para5">The information available is that the estimated population is 58.8 million, the estimated number of tax payers is 27.9 million and the estimated number of households is 24.2 million. The total managed public expenditure in 1998-99 is &#163;331 billion, and in 1999-2000 it is &#163;345.2 billion. On that basis, the breakdown of costs for 1998-99 and 1999-2000 requested is given in the table.

 A person who claims asylum on arrival in the United Kingdom and is subsequently granted leave to enter will, by definition, have entered the United Kingdom lawfully. A person who obtains leave to enter without disclosing an intention to claim asylum may, depending on the circumstances, be guilty of an offence of seeking leave to enter by deception. In either case, the actions of the asylum seeker do not of themselves cause any other person to commit an offence, but depending on the circumstances an offence may arise if the asylum seeker's entry was facilitated by another person.

<a name="00406w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I have laid an Order (The Gaming Clubs (Hours and Charges) Regulations 2000), in the House to simplify the current system of bingo charging.




<P>
<P><I>6 Apr 2000 : Column: 594W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00406w18.html_para0">The current system of charges is set out in section 3 of the Gaming Clubs (Hours and Charges) Regulations 1984. It prescribes the amount bingo operators may charge by way of admission and participation fees for games during any period of play of up to two hours (currently &#163;10 exclusive of Value Added Tax). It also sets out how the charges should be displayed. The arrangements for the charging notices are, however, complex and in practice most players will not know in advance of deciding to play what charge is being made for an individual game.
<P>

<a name="00406w18.html_para1">The Home Office, therefore, proposes to make regulations that will establish a statutorily based notification system that will specify the form in which participation and any other charges must be notified so that they are transparent and easily understood. Notices will be displayed at the main point where payment for the charges is to be made.
<P>

<a name="00406w18.html_para2">The regulations will also allow a charge to be made for admission to a bingo club not exceeding &#163;10 per day which will be displayed at, or near, the principal entrance to the premises and a charge to be made for participation in a game of bingo not exceeding &#163;5 for each chance in playing the game. These are upper limits; in practice operators will set far lower charges than this.
<P>

<a name="00406w18.html_para3">The measure will extend to Scotland.

 The funding of &#163;34 million is being allocated to police forces across England and Wales to enable them to double the number of submissions to the National DNA Database over the next two years. By April 2002, the database should hold approximately 1.5 million DNA offender profiles.

 The cost of operating the dedicated immigration detention centres is estimated to be in the region of &#163;11.4 million in the current financial year. Previous years' figures are not available as the costs had not been recorded separately. The Prison Service Statistics (England and Wales) show the number of detainees held in prisons under the 1971 Immigration Act as at 30 June of each year. Figures for the last three years are: 30 June 1997--476; 30 June 1998--477; and 30 June 1999--490. The average total cost per prison place in each of these years was: 1997-98: &#163;23,940; 1998-99: &#163;25,096; 1999-2000: &#163;25,567.

 Provisional data indicate that 610 deportation orders were signed and 510 were enforced during 1999. It should be noted that a deportation order enforced in one year may have been signed in an earlier year. Deportation orders may not be immediately enforceable for legal reasons or because of other barriers to removal such as inadequate documentation. There are also cases where a deportation order has been signed but it is later decided that deportation is no longer appropriate.

<a name="00406w19.html_para6">Sex offenders subject to the 1997 Act may be released on Home Detention Curfew only in exceptional circumstances and in all such cases only with the consent of the Director General. In this case, the requirement was not followed by the prison establishment concerned and the eligibility date was calculated wrongly; the prisoner was released after 35 days instead of the 46 days that should have been served.
<P>

<a name="00406w19.html_para7">I have asked the Director General for a report. He has advised me that, wholly contrary to the procedure put in place by Ministers, his approval was not sought in this case. Furthermore, the period of the sentence to be served was reduced by 11 days as a result of an administrative error. The administrative procedures have now been strengthened and the Director General has written to all establishments reminding them of the particular considerations that apply to sex offenders subject to the provisions of the 1997 Act and the requirement at all times to seek his consent.

 There are no plans to establish a training college for Europol.

Proposed objectives for the network include strengthening knowledge of existing European Union instruments in the area of law enforcement, improving co-operation and co-ordination between European Union law enforcement training institutes with regard to European and cross-border co-operation and providing training for law enforcement agencies of Accession states.

 The main provisions of the confidentiality agreement stipulated that the material it covered should not be disclosed to anyone other than Home Office Ministers and officials without the prior written approval of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV). I am advised that these provisions would have been unenforceable in law should any attempt have been made to use the agreement to suppress evidence of criminal offences or prevent its disclosure to the police authorities or Crown Prosecution Service.

<a name="00406w20.html_para0">The confidentiality agreement was entered into in July 1999 in order to obtain information to enable a full Home Office investigation of the allegations made by the BUAV against HarlandUK.
