<i>[holding answer 15 June 2005]:</i> The Ministry of Defence&#039;s contracting strategy for the Defence Training Review rationalisation programme, which has been developed with the MOD Private Finance Unit and the Treasury, has confirmed the suitability and probity of PFI/PPP as the procurement route.

<a name="stpa_2">This strategy includes a public sector comparator which has been developed on the basis of how the Department would proceed if the PFI/PPP was not available. While it has the associated detail of an in-house bid, the capital investment required means that it is unlikely to be practical or affordable as a delivery option, particularly as it would not provide the flexibility, performance discipline and risk transfer envisaged by the partnering option.

MOD policy also complies with Part III of the DDA where it considered itself to be a service provider, and reasonable adjustments have been made where it was considered necessary in relation to the physical features of MOD occupied premises to overcome physical barriers to access by members of the public.

There is no in-house expertise in key areas including the provision of trained and experienced personnel to implement mandated safe systems of work; tendering and letting works contracts; and the management and control of directly employed labour to carry out maintenance tasks. An in-house option could neither achieve the economies of scale that could be offered by industry, nor the transfer of large elements of risk (both financial and health and safety) from the Department.

 UK design and assessment loading standards for highway structures were last made to cover the effects of 40-tonne EU vehicles prior to them being permitted on UK roads from 1 January 1999. Extensive research has shown that road pavement damage is strongly influenced by axle loadings, which have not increased since that time; for an individual axle mass of 10.5 tonne, there is approximately 40 per cent. less road wear than for an axle mass of 11.5 tonnes. Thus 44 tonnes gross weight vehicles as are now permitted to operate on UK roads and mainly fitted with six axles, each with a limit of 10.5 tonnes, cause less road wear than 40 tonne vehicles operating with five axles each with an 11.5 tonne limit.

 The Government continues to seek a successful World Trade Organisation ministerial in Hong Kong in December 2005. Multilateral liberalisation that reduces tariff barriers among all countries will lead to the greatest gains for poor developing countries, including within Africa.

<a name="stpa_55">DFID supports several trade policy capacity building projects, including in Kenya, Malawi, Zambia, Ghana, and Nigeria. These assist Governments to develop trade policy, link this to poverty reduction and identify and negotiate their strategic interests in international trade negotiations. Any reduction in trade barriers within Africa must build on African countries&#039; own regional integration efforts and development objectives and promote the development of supply side capacity to take advantage of market access opportunities. DFID also provides &#163;11 million for a regional trade facilitation programme in Southern Africa, which supports enhanced trade within the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) <sup>1</sup>  and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) <sup>2</sup> .

In order to ensure that the Government of Angola take the necessary steps towards a successful conference, Donors have made clear to the Government of Angola, their view that the Government should have in place both an agreed programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and an effective poverty reduction strategy. There have been a number of discussions between the Government of Angola and the IMF on the framework for a staff monitored programme, focusing largely on issues of financial transparency and public accountability. I understand that an Angolan mission will be visiting Washington soon for further discussions on this, which we hope will achieve agreement. On the issue of the poverty reduction strategy, DFID has offered support to the Government to improve the present draft, working with civil society and other donors.

In line with the Government&#039;s target of a reduction of civil service and administrative posts by 2008, DFID is firmly committed to reducing its home civil service staff numbers by 10 per cent., from 1,780 in April 2004 to 1,610 by 2008.

 As in all the tsunami-affected countries, in Sri Lanka, the unprecedented scale of the disaster put considerable pressure on logistics and co-ordination mechanisms. DFID gave direct support to overcome these challenges, including the secondment of an air operations co-ordinator, two shelter advisers, an adviser to the United Nations Humanitarian Information Centre and a member of the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Co-ordination team.

The United Nations has commented that the relief effort in Tamil areas has been impressive.

<a name="stpa_64">The Sri Lankan Government&#039;s response to the relief needs have been effective and spread evenly throughout the country. However due to the geography of many affected areas government officials have struggled to identify and acquire sufficient and appropriate land to relocate houses, schools, hospitals from the Government imposed exclusion zone. To tackle this issue the Sri Lankan Government are reconsidering the decision to exclude reconstruction in a 100 to 200 m buffer zone and attempting to fast track the acquisition of land. However more needs to be done to allow the numerous donors to start reconstruction. The sheer amount of work required to obtain land has delayed the implementation of reconstruction.

<a name="stpa_68">During my recent visit to Sudan, I pressed the parties urgently to implement the agreement, and will continue to do so. Implementation is a huge task, and our assessment is that delays are due in large part to a lack of capacity of the parties to implement the agreement. This underlines the need for international support, which DFID is are already providing, and have made clear our willingness to do more. Through the embassy in Khartoum and the (expanded) joint DFID/FCO Sudan unit in London, we will continue to monitor implementation of the CPA and work to support the parties in achieving this. We are also urging others to do more.

 Malnutrition rates vary across Darfur. The latest UN &#039;Nutrition in Crisis Situations&#039; report published in May 2005, showed average to precarious malnutrition levels in a number of locations: in South Darfur, 15.6 per cent. of the assessed population of the Gereida Internally Displaced People camp were found to be suffering from global acute malnutrition (GAM) with 4 per cent. suffering severe acute malnutrition (SAM); in Kalma IDP camp, South Darfur, the GAM rate was 9.9 per cent. and the SAM rate was 2.6 per cent.; in West Darfur across three camps in the Jebel Mara area, the GAM rate was 16.2 per cent. and the SAM rate 1.5 per cent. GAM rates of 20 per cent. or above or SAM rates of 5 per cent. or above would denote a very serious situation.

<a name="stpa_71">In its latest update on the health situation in Darfur, the World Health Organisation said that between 28 May and 3 June there were 66,617 reported cases of illness among the 1.56 million people under its surveillance in Darfur.

For South and North Darfur&#151;where the impact of the rains on access is generally less severe than in West Darfur&#151;the WFP will continue its delivery of food throughout the rainy season. Supplies are mainly brought in via Port Sudan, though the WFP have also recently begun flying food in from Libya.

 The main focus of our programme in Tanzania is to support the Government of Tanzania&#039;s own National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty. This places great importance on economic growth, which has averaged 5.4 per cent. (2.7 per cent. per capita) since 2000, as a means of reducing poverty. Last year DFID allocated &#163;65 million directly to Government budgets to support the National Strategy and also to directly support a Tax Modernisation Programme (TMP) and Business Environment Strengthening Programme (BEST), both of which aim to improve the environment for stronger private sector-led growth. In addition, DFID is funding The Financial Sector Deepening programme which improves the access of small and micro-businesses to financial services.

 The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) human poverty index (HPI) is an internationally recognised measure of poverty.

<p><a name="st_117"><a name="50620w11.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 The experience of the last five years of the HIPC Initiative has shown that debt relief can be an extremely effective tool in support of poverty-alleviation. The debt burden of the world&#039;s poorest countries is being reduced by some US$70 billion dollars overtime, allowing the savings from debt relief to fund country-owned strategies aimed at reducing poverty. Poverty reducing expenditures in HIPCs have on average increased from 6.4 per cent. of GDP in 1999 to 7.9 per cent. of GDP in 2003, a level about three times that spent on debt service. These increases in expenditure are increasingly being reflected in improved outcomes in HIPCs themselves.

Notes:<br>

1.Figures are presented for Great Britain and the United Kingdom as figures for the UK are only available from 2002&#150;03 onwards.<br>

2.International comparisons are important because the Government aspire to be among the very best performers in Europe on child poverty&#151;competing with the record of countries such as Sweden and Denmark. A focus on income before housing costs, as adopted in our spending review 2004 target, supports this as these are used across other European Union countries.<br>

3.Measuring child poverty&quot;, published in December 2003, compares findings with our European Union counterparts. It showed that the UK had the highest child poverty rate in Europe in 1999 (29 per cent.), but according to latest data for 2003, we are now closer to the EU average of (23 per cent.). European comparisons are made using data from the European Household Panel Study, and are not comparable with figures using the Family Resources Survey.<br>

4.By 2020, we want to be comparable to the very best countries in the world. Where the UK had a child poverty rate on the UNICEF measure of 15.4 per cent. in 2004, Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) had rates of less than 5 per cent.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.Sure Start Maternity Grants were introduced on 27 March 2000. The change from Maternity Payments was phased in gradually, with Sure Start Maternity Grants being available to claimants whose babies were expected, born, adopted or the subject of a parental order on or after 11 June 2000.<br>

2.Data by Government office region (GOR) are not available for 2002&#150;03 or 2003&#150;04. Prior to 2002&#150;03 a different district structure was in use.<br>

3.Sure Start Maternity Grant awards are recorded in the GOR where they are administered. In 2004&#150;05, a small area of the East Midlands GOR was administered for social fund purposes from a district within the North West GOR.<br>

4.For a multiple birth, only one Sure Start Maternity Grant is awarded (with a payment being made for each baby). In the general population, the number of maternities resulting in twins is about 15 per 1,000 maternities (and triplets and higher order multiple births can be ignored). The number of babies for whom a Sure Start Maternity Grant was paid was estimated using this figure.<br>

5.A claim for a Sure Start Maternity Grant can be made from the 29th week of pregnancy and up to three months after the baby is born. A grant paid in one year can therefore be for a birth in a different year.<br>

6.The approximate percentage of births in a year for which a grant was paid is calculated as 100 x (the number of babies for whom a grant was paid in that year)/(the number of births in that year).<br>

7.Numbers of awards are rounded to the nearest 100, expenditure to the nearest &#163;0.1 million and the approximate percentage of births for which a grant was paid to the nearest whole number.<br>

8.For 2004&#150;05, the sum of the number of awards by GOR differs slightly from that for Great Britain due to rounding.<br>

<a name="stpa_133">Evidence from Phase 1 of the evaluation suggests that On Track has been effective in tackling a range of known individual, family and school based risk factors for children and young people linked to later involvement in crime. The programme has had a positive impact on both children and adults especially in improving their confidence and self-esteem. Children are more resilient, and more likely to be in positive peer groups; families exhibit greater stability and more affectionate relationships. This has led to reductions in school absences, temporary exclusions and nuisance behaviour among the children and young people involved in the On Track programme.

 It will be for individual local authorities and schools to decide what partners they need to commission to support the development of extended services in schools. We have not put in place any restrictions. We envisage a strong role for the voluntary and private sectors in delivering extended services in partnership with schools, particularly for services such as child care. The services developed in schools will complement and join up with other services and providers where they are already in place. Written agreements will underpin any commissions awarded to providers to ensure that issues such as health and safety are addressed.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment she has made of the reasons for the change in performance in GCSE examinations in inner London local education authorities over the last five years; and if she will make a statement.  [5142]</p>








<p><a name="st_194"><a name="50620w19.html_spnew1"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 For the first time in history, the 2004 GCSE results for state schools in London overtook the national average. We know that the single most important factor in the control of the education service in changing how well children do is the quality of the teaching that they experience. The quality of school leadership is the most important factor in determining how well a school is able to promote effective teaching. And the quality of local support for school improvement is the biggest external influence on the effective leadership and management of schools.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50620w19.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_134">A range of factors are therefore significant. First, the focused attention of teachers, heads and LEAs on improving the quality of teaching and learning has been critical. Second, Ofsted identifies this generation of teachers as the best ever and strong improvements in teacher supply have been disproportionately beneficial in London, since times of shortage affect London most. There are now 63,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) teachers in London, compared to 58,300 in 2001. Third, the quality of leadership in London&#039;s schools is now identified by Ofsted as being better than the national average. Fourth, local education authorities play a crucial role in supporting school improvement, and we have seen their capacity to do so improve over the past five years. In 2004 20 London authorities were rated &#039;excellent&#039; or &#039;good&#039; in the comprehensive performance assessment (compared to 13 in 2002) and no authorities were rated &#039;poor&#039; (compared to 4 in 2002).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50620w19.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_135">National programmes have contributed to supporting this improvement. Excellence in Cities has provided focused support and very significant resources in London, as in other urban areas across the country. Intervention in those local education authorities which 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Jun 2005 : Column 732W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
were failing has contributed to bringing in to those authorities the people and resources which have enabled them to be effective.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50620w19.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_136">The London Challenge, which began in 2002, has sought to focus national programmes and get behind the efforts of all those who seek to raise standards in London. Through both targeted and pan-London work, it has sought to support teachers, leaders and local authorities in their work for raising the achievement of young people and creating a world-class education system.

 Our ambassador, accredited to Kyrgyzstan, visited the country from the 6&#150;8 June.

He also spoke to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) representatives in Kyrgyzstan about the refugee situation. The Acting President of Kyrgyzstan reassured the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe on 30 May that Kyrgyzstan would make all efforts necessary to ensure the safety and welfare of refugees and to comply with relevant international commitments. The handing over of four refugees to the Andizhan prosecutor on 9 June appears to be a clear, and deeply regrettable, breach of those commitments.

This message was reinforced again by an EU statement at the OSCE on 16 June. Our EU partners and we will continue to monitor the situation closely.

 Our embassy in Bogota reports regularly on internally displaced people (IDPs) in Colombia, and discusses the situation with the Colombian authorities, the UN and NGOs. Given the nature of the issue, it is very difficult to put a completely accurate figure on the number of IDPs. Statistics provided by the Government of Columbia and unofficial statistics differ slightly, but the figures are in the region of 3 million people internally displaced. This humanitarian crisis has arisen as a direct result of the internal armed conflict in Colombia. Recent years have shown a marked decline in numbers of newly displaced people, although the overall figure of internally displaced people as a whole continues to rise, as the security forces made some headway against the illegally armed groups. Government of Colombia figures for 2003 and 2004 for new displacements are 219,469 and 137,315 respectively. But the situation is still critical and more needs to be done to address the issue. South-West Colombia, where the security forces are making a concerted push against the illegal armed groups, is particularly affected.

The conclusion that no genocidal policy had been pursued by the Government in no way detracted from the gravity of the crimes committed including crimes against humanity and/or war crimes. Following this, the UK played a leading role in sponsoring UN Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005) of 31 March, in which the Security Council referred the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court (ICC)&#151;as recommended by the ICI.

 Information on staff vacancies against operational staffing requirement at 31 December 2002, 2003 and 2004 for each public sector prison establishment is contained in the table. Operational posts are highlighted separately within the table. The figures represent a snapshot of the staffing position in establishments. Details about levels of vacancies within privately managed establishments are not routinely collected and are therefore not included in the table.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50620w31.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_233">The Service has had considerable success in filling posts over the past three years and shortfalls among operational staff over the past three years have fallen steadily. To cover vacancies in the short-term certain establishments are allowing officers to work additional hours as part of the &#039;Contracted Supplementary Hours Scheme&#039;. This scheme contributed the equivalent of 463 full-time officers at 31 December 2004. At that time the total operational staff availability was 25,383 compared with an operational staffing requirement of 25,704, resulting in a Service-wide shortfall of just 1.2 per cent., well within an acceptable operating margin.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50620w31.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_234">Staffing levels in non-operational roles are more fluid and vacancy figures reflect a number of reviews taking place across the Prison Service and work to introduce greater efficiencies. This led to decisions to leave posts unfilled.

 The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 places a general duty on Government Departments to have regard to the need to <i>(a)</i> eliminate unlawful racial discrimination; and <i>(b)</i> promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups.

The Home Secretary has also made Orders under the Act to place the specific duties&quot; on named public authorities. The list of bodies subject to the general and specific duties is updated periodically in consultation with the Commission for Racial Equality and other Government Departments. One of these specific duties is to produce a Race Equality Scheme that sets out their arrangements for complying with the Act.

<a name="stpa_235">The Home Office published its revised race equality scheme on 26 May 2005. In addition to the legislative requirements the scheme also sets out key challenges, objectives and targets on race equality. The Home Office race equality scheme encompasses a number of associate schemes such as the Prison Service, United Kingdom Passport Service and National Probation Directorate and includes the associate race equality scheme for Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of constabulary. The Home Office will continue to ensure that other public bodies comply with the Race Relations (Amendment) Act.

 Asylum and human rights claims by Zimbabwean nationals are considered on their individual merits in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the European convention on human rights (ECHR). As with any other nationality, Zimbabweans who meet the definition of a refugee in the 1951 Convention are granted asylum. If they do not qualify for asylum, but there are other circumstances that make them particularly vulnerable and engage our obligations under the ECHR, they are granted humanitarian protection or discretionary leave. If their application is refused, they have a right of appeal to the independent Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. In this way we ensure that we provide protection to those Zimbabweans who need it.

Where it is clear that there are Zimbabweans in need of international protection and the asylum system will continue to provide that, but if an asylum and human rights claim is refused, and any appeal to the independent Asylum and Immigration Tribunal is unsuccessful, that means that it would be safe for that particular individual to return to Zimbabwe.

The Health and Social Care Information Centre liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

3.The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

4.As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002&#150;03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>

5.All Diagnoses count of episodes&quot; figures represent a count of all FCE&#039;s where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in a HES record.<br>

6.Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, that is the data is ungrossed.<br>

If the Government were to disclose the information requested, it would prejudice the negotiating process between the UK and the Commission and so prejudice UK interests. We believe that the UK <i>has</i> properly implemented the Data Protection Directive via the Data Protection Act 1998 and other relevant provisions of UK law.

 The rate used to calculate business rate bills is set nationally. For 2004&#150;05, the rate was 0.456. Bills for that year were calculated by multiplying this rate by the rateable value of the particular business hereditament and applying any reliefs.

 The Government have not carried out any studies into the impact of &#039;buy-to-let&#039;. It is not easily assessed, although the mortgage lenders have produced some detailed statistics. &#039;Buy to let&#039; mortgages as a proportion of all mortgages has risen nationally from 2 per cent. in 1999 to 9 per cent. in the second half of 2004. However, their impact on the London housing market has been generally declining (from almost 7 per cent. early 2001 when data was first collected), and in 2004&#150;05 accounted for 3.9 per cent. of mortgages.

<a name="stpa_315">So far &#039;buy to let&#039; has not led to a significant growth in the size of the private rented sector.

<sup>(47)</sup>The combined LEA and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LEA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LEA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LEA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). A sector breakdown for combined LEA and school based expenditure is not available in 2002&#150;03 and consequently this table shows the total LEA recurrent expenditure (except youth and community) per pupil by LEA since 1994&#150;95.<br>

<sup>(48)</sup>1999&#150;2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DfES. 2002&#150;03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown in italic. In 2002&#150;03 the combined LEA and school based expenditure is calculated by Section 52 Outturn Table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE) plus line 60 NCE (with adjustments to income to take account of School Standards Grant and Standards Fund scored here) plus lines 61 to 74 NCE. For 2001&#150;02 and earlier years the expenditure is calculated as line 27 NCE after recharges for columns (b) to (f) and (h) plus line 15 from the remaining continuing education column (g, i and j). This is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table 3 for 1999&#150;00 to 2001&#150;02 and from the RO1 form previously.<br>

<sup>(49)</sup>Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under 5s funded by the LEA and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and other LEA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools are taken from the DfES Annual Schools Census. Private voluntary and independent (PVI) under 5 pupil numbers are taken from the Early Years census but are only include for 1999&#150;2000 onwards. For 1995&#150;96 onwards other LEA maintained pupils are included in the pupil count. This includes all pupils attending schools not maintained by the Authority for whom the Authority is paying full tuition fees, or educated otherwise than in schools and pupil referral units under arrangements made by the Authority drawn from the Form 8b submitted to the DfES. Also included as other LEA maintained pupils are all pupils attending pupil referral units who are not registered at a maintained mainstream school drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(50)</sup>Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99. The 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

<sup>(51)</sup>In 2002&#150;03 the combined LEA and school based unit cost for England showed a cash terms increase of 5 per cent. compared with a 10 per cent. increase in 2001&#150;02. This is in part due to known misreporting of funding by some LEAs which had the estimated effect of reducing the 2002&#150;03 England unit cost by around &#163;50 per pupil (in cash terms).<br>

<sup>(52)</sup>2003&#150;04 remains provisional at this time and is subject to change by LEAs.<br>

 The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 makes it an offence to obstruct or interfere with an employee of a Fire and Rescue Authority. In addition there is a hierarchy of offences against the person where injury results. This goes from grievous bodily harm through actual bodily harm to common law offences of assault and battery, depending on the injuries inflicted. It is important that such incidents are reported to the police. During the passage of the Act the question of further provision was considered and we were not persuaded that it would assist.

 National Occupational Standards for home inspectors have been approved by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. An awarding body has been approved for the new qualification in home inspection, and four assessment centres have been approved so far to assess courses offered by educational institutions and other organisations. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is assisting recruitment of home inspectors with awareness initiatives aimed at publicising this new career opportunity. A highly successful national conference and trade fair held on 25 November 2004 was attended by between 800 and 1,000 potential home inspectors. Four regional conferences have been well attended, and further regional events are planned. We expect to see the number of trained inspectors rise quickly in the second half of 2005 and during 2006, ready for introducing home information packs in early 2007 and we will work with the industry to this end.

There would be rigorous and transparent affordability checks to ensure that they can afford to sustain the ongoing obligations the home ownership brings.

 The Government are committed to helping those who wish to live and work in the region where they were born and brought up to do so. That is why it is looking at how it can secure sustainable growth and affordable housing in the wider south-east.

It should be noted that the amounts supplied in this table differ from information provided in response to an earlier parliamentary question on 9 March 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1878, on BRO expenditure. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman as this was due to an administrative oversight which resulted in physical expenditure being excluded. It should also be noted that since 2002&#150;03 and the 2003&#150;04 financial years respectively BRO has no longer had responsibility for EU expenditure or Belfast City Centre. This has been a contributory factor to the decline in expenditure recorded against BRO.

 Digital hearing aids have been provided in Northern Ireland since October 2003. A target of 5,000 digital hearing aids to issue each year was determined at that time. However, that expectation has been exceeded with over 15,000 digital hearing aids issued to date. The latest statistical information has indicated that the majority of those seeking digital hearing aids are seen within three months and that 85 per cent. are seen within six months. The Department is considering how it might extend partnerships with the private sector to further increase the provision of digital hearing aids.

Notes:<br>

1.The figures above are based on the principal offence rule so only the most serious offence for which a person is proceeded against is included.<br>

2.From 2000, prosecutions data are drawn from the PSNI Integrated Crime Information System, which only records the District Command Unit to which an offender&#039;s address relates. Figures are not therefore available for proceedings stemming from crimes reported to North Belfast after 1999.<br>

3.Information is not yet available for prosecutions and convictions made after 2003.<br>

<p><a name="qn_517"><a name="50620w56.html_wqn4"><b> Lady Hermon: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will subject the roads and water services, along with private developers and utility companies, to an independent regulator to ensure full compliance with the terms of roads and street works legislation in Northern Ireland.  [3604]</p>








<p><a name="st_513"><a name="50620w56.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 The Street Works (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 is the Northern Ireland equivalent of GB legislation, designed to regulate the opening and reinstatement of public roads by utilities. Also, any private developer placing or retaining apparatus in the street must have a street works licence and comply with the requirements of the Street Works Order. This regime is regulated and enforced by Roads Service. I believe this regulation is effective, and there is no need for an additional regulator. Water Service aims to comply fully with the terms of the order; however, as it is an agency of the Crown it cannot currently be prosecuted as other utilities. This will change when Water Service becomes a Government owned company. In the interim, any offences by Water Service, which would be prosecutable under the legislation, will be recorded in a register along with the remedial actions agreed with Roads Service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50620w56.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_395">Works for roads purposes, on the other hand, is specifically excluded from the Street Works Order. This is the same as the position in the rest of the UK, where in no instance is the work of highway authorities covered by the street works legislation, nor is it subject to independent regulation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50620w56.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_396">The safety of the work operations themselves is subject to the Health and Safety legislation, which is enforced by the Health and Safety Executive. This would apply to promote safe working practices, such as avoiding underground pipes or cables being damaged. All of the parties you mention are treated equally under this legislation.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment his Department has made of whether there will be an effect on child safety of the recent decision of the south eastern education and library board to cut school crossing patrol services within its catchment area.

<p><a name="st_514"><a name="50620w57.html_spnew0"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 Education and library boards apply nationally agreed guidelines to assess the level of risk before reaching decisions on the future provision of specific school crossing patrols. The assessed risk is based on factors such as sight-lines, volume and type of traffic, width of road, availability of footpaths, central refuges/pedestrian crossings/traffic signals, etc. Boards decisions are, therefore, based on ensuring that the safety of pupils is not jeopardised.

 The revenue generated by speed cameras in each police district command unit area is as detailed in the following table. All such fine revenue is paid into the UK consolidated fund. The unique nature of how the PSNI is funded means that the PSNI currently only recovers costs associated with the operation and maintenance of the N.I. Safety Camera scheme. As such, none of the revenue generated by the scheme is returned to PSNI for the express purpose of funding road safety initiatives at present.
