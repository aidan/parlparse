 The great majority of airports in the UK are operated on a commercial basis, but the Air Transport White Paper makes clear there may be a case for limited public funding to support small airports operated by local authorities and those in objective 1 and 2 areas.

 The balanced strategy set out in The Future of Air Transport White Paper required that we did more to reduce and mitigate the environmental impacts of air transport. It included a range of measures at national and international level to address noise, local air quality and climate change issues.

<a name="stpa_24">The Renewables Obligation is the Government&#039;s key mechanism for encouraging renewable generation. It is market based and does not prescribe the level of contribution from different renewable technologies. However, it is expected that wind will make the major contribution towards the Government&#039;s 2010 target of 10 per cent. renewables with a smaller contribution from other technologies.

The digital strategy is multi-faceted, involving coordination of activities across Government to gain concerted action to deliver the benefits of a digitally enabled UK. Success will require effective partnership between private, public, community and voluntary interests utilising a range of delivery mechanisms, including the internet, mobile and broadcasting technologies.

We do this through several mechanisms at Whitehall and country level. For example, the global and Africa conflict prevention pools bring together the FCO, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and DFID to improve the UK&#039;s response to countries affected by conflict. We post development experts into embassies, and in the case of Sudan, have set up a joint FCO-DFID unit.

 The Government support the use of woodfuel for the generation of heat, combined heat and power (CHP), and electricity.

Householders and community organisations can apply for funding under DTI&#039;s &#163;12.5 million Clear Skies Initiative to install renewable energy schemes, including wood-fuelled boiler systems. Defra&#039;s &#163;60 million Community Energy programme provides capital grants to install new and refurbish old community heating networks, including renewable energy systems. DTI and the Big Lottery Fund&#039;s Bio-energy Capital Grants Scheme has allocated &#163;66 million of funding to develop end-use markets for biomass, including woodfuel, in the heat, CHP and electricity generation sectors. Grants are also available from the regional development agencies. Co-firing of woodfuel with fossil fuels in conventional power stations is a developing end-use. Support to help develop the supply chain for woodfuel has been made available under the &#163;3.5 million Bio-energy Infrastructure Scheme. The Community Renewables Initiative&#039;s local support teams are working to develop local woodfuel projects in their areas.

<a name="stpa_67">We recognise that there are issues that make it difficult to encourage the confidence needed for the development of woodfuel markets. The Biomass Task Force, led by Sir Ben Gill, was set up a year ago to identify the barriers to developing biomass energy, including woodfuel, and to recommend ways to overcome the problems. Their report was published on 25 October. The Government has committed itself to publishing a full response to the report within the next six months.

 For analysis purposes, the public sector is usually treated as part of the wider commercial and public services sector. Estimates from experts vary, depending on assumptions made. In broad terms, it might be possible to achieve savings of around 30 per cent. if all technical measures were implemented, regardless of cost, across the sector as a whole. However, the potential for cost-effective measures by 2010 is around 10 per cent.. The same figures are assumed to apply to the public sector share.

<p><a name="st_129"><a name="51108w12.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The approach adopted by successive governments has been that no compensation is generally payable to those affected by flooding.

 The recent European Court of Justice ruling turned down an application by Austria for a derogation from Directive 2001/18/EC to declare the region of Upper Austria a GM-free zone.

<a name="stpa_69">Under current EU law, as agreed by EU member states, the only legitimate grounds for narrowing the geographical scope of an approval to prevent cultivation in a defined zone are the production of clear evidence that the GM crop involved poses a particular risk to the specific area in question.

<sup>(2)</sup> Estimated values based on industry derived or estimated market values and tonnage data.<br>

<sup>(3)</sup> Declared tonnages by first processor in Defra payment schemes.<br>

<sup>(4)</sup> Estimated tonnages based on average yield&#151;note that as oilseed rape and linseed are grown on both set-aside and main regime land, part of the tonnage is declared and part estimated. Much of the SRC and miscanthus would not have reached first harvest by 2004 and will therefore not have delivered the tonnage and value estimated.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The data represents information collated through various Defra payment schemes. However, some crops for non-food use (eg essential oil crops) may be grown outside such schemes and out-with any arable support scheme, in addition some food crops may be diverted to non-food uses (eg wheat for starch). Accurate information on such crops and crop movements is not centrally collated. The data therefore represents an underestimate of the true non-food crop area and production statistics.<br>

2. Data presented for Short Rotation Coppice and Miscanthus areas represents information collated under the Energy Crops Scheme on planting grant applications and applications under the Woodland Grant Scheme.<br>

3. Data for non-food crops grown on set-aside and crops for energy grown on non-set-aside land in receipt of payments under the new Energy Aid Payment Scheme was derived from data collated by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA). 32,927 ha of rape were grown on main regime land in 2004 for biodiesel production&#151;this is included in the figures for oilseed rape in the table.<br>

4. Data for Linseed is derived from Defra Statistics for main regime land and the RPA for production on set-aside (999 ha).<br>

5. Data for flax and hemp areas and production is derived from declarations under the UK Flax and Hemp Fibre Regime.<br>

<p><a name="st_137"><a name="51108w14.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Operational responsibility for managing the risk from coastal erosion in England rests with maritime district councils who, in partnership with the Environment Agency and other bodies with coastal defence responsibilities, take an integrated and long-term view of managing coastlines through Shoreline Management Plans. These plans, in line with Government policy, consider the implications of coastal processes, including erosion. More detailed coastal strategies are then developed, taking into account economic, social and environmental matters. These detailed strategies consider the specific needs of key coastal installations, such as nuclear power stations, Sellafield and the Low-level Waste Repository (LLWR) at Drigg.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w14.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_71">The safety of nuclear installations in the UK is regulated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) which requires operators to produce safety cases which address a range of internal and external hazards, including flooding. Safety cases are periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changing conditions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w14.html_para1">
HSE, the Environment Agency, maritime district councils and operators ensure, through consultation on the development of Shoreline Management Plans, that the plans do not compromise the needs of nuclear sites.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w14.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_72">The impact of coastal erosion on the LLWR has also been considered as part of a Post-Closure Safety Case for the site, submitted to the Environment Agency by British Nuclear Group Sellafield Limited (BNGSL) in September 2002. BNGSL&#039;s assessment predicts that the LLWR could be destroyed by coastal erosion in 500 to 5,000 years if no action were taken to maintain the coastline.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w14.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_73">The Environment Agency will shortly issue its decision on future regulation of the LLWR, and is proposing to require BNGSL to consider a number of options to reduce predicted impacts.

 In December 2004, the Government issued a consultation paper on the Waste Management (England and Wales) Regulations, which will apply waste management controls to agricultural waste. Included in this consultation paper was a chapter proposing that a Producer Responsibility scheme should be introduced, under which the producers of non-packaging farm plastics, such as silage wrap and crop covers, would be obligated to pay for their collection and recovery or disposal. The main question posed was whether such a system should be voluntary or mandatory.

<p><a name="st_167"><a name="51108w16.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The European Commission has recently launched a comprehensive evaluation process to cover all aspects of the Dublin arrangements, including the operation of the secure electronic communications network for Dublin II requests (DubliNet&quot;) and the supporting Eurodac fingerprint database. The resulting report, expected in 2006, will analyse the impact of the Dublin arrangements to draw conclusions on the added value of Dublin II and the Eurodac Regulation EC No. 2725/2000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w16.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_92">The second Annual Report to the Council and the European Parliament on the activities of the Eurodac Central Unit concluded that Eurodac represents an extremely important tool for a faster and more efficient application of the Dublin arrangements. The report also notes that Eurodac data provide a sound indicator of the phenomenon of asylum shopping&quot; in member states. Copies of the report can be found in the Libraries. The Home Office&#039;s assessment of the report is set out in Explanatory Memorandum 10464/05 sent to the Parliamentary Scrutiny Committees on 14 September 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w16.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_93">Our own assessment of the new Dublin arrangements, supported by Eurodac is favourable. Dublin II and Eurodac enabled us to return 1,982 applicants in 2004 to other European countries without considering their claims ourselves. This is far more effective than the gentleman&#039;s agreement which applied until 1997, under which fewer people were removed in a year than the Dublin arrangements have enabled us to remove in a month. While it is not possible to prove to what extent asylum shopping that would otherwise have happened is not happening as a result of the new arrangements, asylum intake across the EU15 has fallen by 21 per cent. between 2003 and 2004 (source IRSS).
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w16.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_94">On the question of refugees in orbit, the Dublin II Regulation is based on a mechanism to identify the member state responsible for determining an asylum claim and provides guarantees that identified state will take charge of or take back an asylum seeker within prescribed time limits. In addition, unlike the old Dublin Convention, the regulation reflects the agreement that member states fully accept to take responsibility for an asylum applicant where a procedural time limit is breached. This ensures that asylum applicants do not face prolonged periods of uncertainty.

Notes:<br>

1. All figures are for Great Britain.<br>

2. Beneficiaries are rounded to the nearest five thousand and costs are rounded to the nearest &#163;5 million.<br>

3. Each beneficiary represents a benefit unit, which can be a single claimant or a couple.<br>

4. The impact is estimated using the Department&#039;s Policy Simulation Model for 2005&#150;06, using data from the 2003&#150;04 Family Resources Survey up-rated to 2005&#150;06 prices, benefit rates and earnings levels, and is calibrated to latest published forecasts and policies.<br>

5. Results are subject to sampling and reporting errors and estimation assumptions, and are therefore indicative only. No behavioural changes are assumed.<br>

 Moving into employment from incapacity benefits is a major transition for many people. Over half of those claiming incapacity benefits have been claiming for more than eight years and have a range of barriers to overcome in addition to their health condition. We recognise the challenge that the transition to work represents but we want to support and encourage people to make this transition to transform their life-chances. For example, we have already extended the linking rules so that people who take the risk of leaving incapacity benefits can return to previous benefit levels.

 The National Health Service Cancer Plan, published in 2000, stated that we would extend invitations for breast screening to women aged 65 to 70 and introduce two-view mammography at all screening rounds. Over 98 per cent. of local screening programmes have now implemented these changes. However, the changes together represent a 40 per cent. increase in the workload of the programme. We are aware that this has had an impact on some services maintaining the three-year interval for screening and we are taking steps to bring all screening intervals back to three years.

 The newly introduced category M of generic medicines has two objectives: to reduce the cost of annual reimbursement to community pharmacy in England by &#163;300 million and to set reimbursement prices of individual medicines in a manner which reflects the underlying market prices.

<p><a name="st_332"><a name="51108w31.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The vast majority of individuals with macular hole have their condition diagnosed by an optometrist during a routine sight test. Sight tests are free under the national health service to people aged 60 and over, children, individuals at particular risk of eye disease and those on a low income. Individuals who are identified as requiring further investigation can now be referred directly to hospital following an NHS funded sight test.

<a name="stpa_242">The Department has put a number of measures in place aimed at reducing waiting times in the NHS. By the end of 2005, no patient will have to wait more than 13 weeks for an out-patient appointment or more than six months for surgery, and most waits will be much shorter than this.

<a name="stpa_243">In many cases, surgery can stop the visual disturbances getting worse and can help sight to recover to a high standard. The final visual outcome, however, will depend on the size of the hole that has been treated. For those individuals whose sight is still affected after surgery, low vision aids may be of help. The NHS hospital eye service provides optical devices and loans low vision aids, such as high-powered reading lenses, hand-held and stand magnifiers and telescopes, to people with visual impairment. In addition, some primary care trusts have local arrangements for the provision of low vision aids through community based opticians.

1. Sickness absence rate is defined as the amount of time lost through absences as a percentage of staff time available.<br>

2. This does not cover maternity leave, carers&#039; leave or any periods of absence agreed under family friendly/flexible working policies.<br>

3. General practitioners and their staff are not included in the above figures. The overall England figures are estimates, as some organisations in the NHS did not provide figures for sickness absence.<br>

It is the responsibility of SHAs to deliver both overall financial balance for their local health communities and to ensure each and every body achieves financial balance. However, there is a degree of flexibility in how this is managed at a local level. In circumstances where a surplus cannot be generated in the following year, SHAs can agree a recovery plan which phases the recovery of deficits over a number of years. This would require other NHS organisations within the health economy to underspend over the same period. Any such arrangements would have to be subject to the agreement of local providers, commissioners and the managing SHA.

 The Department of the Environment&#039;s Environment and Heritage Service took over responsibility for the regulation of illegal waste activity, including incidents of illegal dumping of material originating in the Republic of Ireland, in October 2002. Between that date and the end of 2004, some 250,000 tonnes of biodegradable ROI waste was detected in Northern Ireland. It is not possible to determine the year in which the waste was disposed of, so the figure cannot be broken down into annual tonnages. An updated amount to reflect the period up to end 2005 is being calculated and will be available early in 2006.

<a name="stpa_281">The scheme, which was completed in 2004, included the provision of a new widened and realigned carriageway; right turn pockets at Lagan College and Glencregagh Road; improved sightlines at the Manse Road/Glencregagh Road junction; and the construction of approximately 1.3 km of new footway to provide continuous pedestrian access on Manse Road between Four Winds Roundabout and Lagan College.

<a name="stpa_282">Colleagues in the Department of Education (DE) have also confirmed that road improvement works were carried out at the site of the new Millennium Primary School in 2003 as a condition of the school&#039;s planning approval. These works, which were necessary to ensure satisfactory means of access in the interests of road safety and the convenience of road users, cost approximately &#163;330,000 and were funded by DE.

<a name="stpa_283">Subsequent to the school opening, it became apparent that drivers were not observing the signs and road markings and that safety was being threatened by illegal overtaking manoeuvres in the vicinity of the school.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_83">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding the locations of traffic calming schemes that Road Service expects to introduce in the Province within the next 12 months.</p>
</ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_85">In relation to the provision of traffic calming measures, I am sure you will appreciate that, although the funding allocated to traffic calming has been increased significantly year on year, demand far outstrips our capacity to meet all such requests and priorities have to be established. We do this by taking account of a number of factors: the accident history of the site, with additional weighting being applied to collisions involving vulnerable road users; the speed, volume and type of traffic; and the characteristics of the general area. Of these we give the highest priority to safety because we believe it is only right to treat sites with an accident history before those with a reasonably good safety record. Implicitly, this assessment process takes cognisance of the overall cost of road traffic collisions to society in general. This approach has led to a substantial reduction in collisions and personal injuries at those sites, over a number of years.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_86">Table A attached lists the locations of traffic calming schemes Roads Service has programmed for completion this financial year. Our programme of traffic calming works for 2006/2007 has not yet been finalised and Table B attached is a preliminary list of schemes under consideration at this stage. Naturally, implementation of these schemes will be subject to the successful completion of the statutory processes including local consultation and the resolution of any objections.</p>

<p><a name="st_409"><a name="51108w41.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 There is no evidence to suggest that there is any difficulty accessing radiotherapy services in Northern Ireland. A national audit of radiotherapy waiting times has recently been carried out by the Royal College of Radiologists. Data were collected for all patients who commenced treatment in Northern Ireland during the week beginning 26 September 2005. Preliminary local analysis indicates that no emergency patient waited more than 24 hours and that waiting times for other patients were in line with national guidelines. The Department has no plans to record waiting times for radiotherapy on an ongoing basis.

Notes:<br>

1. Framework changes occurred in January 2000 and September 2003. Changes in the way groupings in lessons were recorded may mean that data are not directly comparable from periods of one framework to another.<br>

2. From January 2000 to July 2003, the inspection arrangements included full and short inspections. The majority of lessons observed will have been in full inspections. The most effective schools had short inspections.<br>

<p><a name="st_431"><a name="51108w43.html_spnew7"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 It will be for each local authority, in discussion with all schools in their area, to take a strategic approach to developing access to extended services through schools. As part of that strategy, local 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Nov 2005 : Column 447W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
authorities and schools will need to take into account a number of factors such as what services are already available in the local community, levels of deprivation and how the proposed extended services will be delivered. Funding will be released to schools in accordance with that strategy. The aim is to avoid schools &#039;bidding&#039; for funding but ensure that funding is released against the priorities identified. A key priority will be to fill gaps in services, such as child care. We anticipate that there will be gaps in services in many deprived communities and hence these areas will be prioritised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w43.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_316">The Government&#039;s aim is that half of all primary schools and a third of all secondary schools will be offering access to a core set of extended services by 2008. We anticipate that many of then will be located in areas of high deprivation (in allocating the funding we have factored in deprivation levels into the distribution formula). We are providing &#163;840 million to support the development of extended services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w43.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_317">For some of these services, such as child care, we expect them to become sustainable longer term by charging. Parents on low income may be eligible to apply for the child care element of the working tax credit to support the cost of school based child care. Local authorities are well placed to provide schools and parents with advice on accessing the tax credits available and can work with schools to encourage greater take up of tax credits in deprived communities. We will expect children from unwaged families to access a good range of study support activities free of charge through schools. In addition to the resources that schools already have within their existing budgets for study support programmes, the Government is investing a further &#163;335 million by 2007&#150;08 for secondary schools to develop a more personalised programme of study support. For those schools with the highest number of pupils who have fallen behind in their learning, the Government will provide a further &#163;60 million shared between the primary and secondary sectors in each of 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08. Every school should therefore be well placed to ensure that every child in their school has access, free of charge, to the study support that they need. For other services such as health and social care and adult learning opportunities, local authorities, using children&#039;s trust arrangements, will be able to provide resources to support services in deprived areas where that is appropriate.

 My department has made available &#163;680 million over the next two years for schools and local authorities to deliver extended services. This is in addition to the &#163;160 million that we have already spent. This funding can be used flexibly by local authorities and schools to overcome any barriers to the development of extended services. We anticipate that some of this funding will be used to ensure that staff working in extended services get the training and support they need in their roles, including on important issues such as health and safety requirements. We have made it clear from the outset that there is no expectation that teachers will deliver these services. Schools will

need to work with existing providers from both the private and voluntary sectors and other children&#039;s services and make good use of their expertise and skills. It may also be the case that, following consultation, some existing school support staff may be interested in taking up some of these roles. We have also appointed the National Remodelling Team, within the Training and Development Agency, to work with schools to ensure that they have the right skills in place for developing extended services.

 The LSC&#039;s core administration costs have fallen steadily from 4.6 per cent. of total funding in 2001&#150;02, to 2.5 per cent. of its planned total budget in 2005&#150;06. The LSC&#039;s Administration Budget for 2005&#150;06 is almost &#163;255 million. The Administration Budget for future years was set out in the Secretary of State&#039;s Grant Letter issued on 31 October 2005. This Grant Letter provides the LSC with just over &#163;252 million (2.4 per cent. of planned total budget) for 2006&#150;07 and just under &#163;240 million (2.2 per cent. of planned total budget) for 2007&#150;08 to cover its administration costs including the cost of capital and depreciation. This reflects efficiency savings already agreed. It is too early to say what further savings will arise. The overall Administration Budget will be reassessed when the results of the consultation on the LSC&#039;s Agenda for Change&quot;, particularly its restructuring, are finalised. Further savings could then be released to the sector.
