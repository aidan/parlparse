<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w01.html_spnew9"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The Department has issued guidance on simple, low-cost ways in which abattoirs can adapt to the new requirements, and believe that most abattoirs should be able to comply with the Regulation. However, we recognise there will be some cases where there may be genuine difficulties with compliance in the required timescale. We have asked the Meat Hygiene Service, who are the enforcement authority, to look at each such case on its merits provided there is a clear plan of work in place for complying with the new requirements.

 Officials of Government Departments are working closely with the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit on their study to produce a national strategy for reducing the harm associated with alcohol misuse.

<P>

<a name="30512w01.html_para5">As indicated in the reply given on 29 March 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 457W, we remain concerned about the high level of injuries that occur when glasses and bottles are used as weapons in drink-related situations in and outside licensed premises and other drinking establishments, and we intend to see that this problem is effectively tackled. The Licensing Bill Guidance that has been published in draft by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport will include a range of conditions that a licensing authority could impose on a premises to address violence of this form.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many landfill sites are no longer allowed to accept waste for disposal as a result of their failure to submit a conditioning plan; and what estimate she has made of the volume of waste that has thereby been diverted to <i>(a)</i> other landfill sites and <i>(b)</i> other means of disposal.

 Under the Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations 2002, operators of landfills that wished to continue to accept waste after 16 July 2002 had to submit a conditioning plan to the Environment Agency. Those that did not wish to continue to accept waste had no need to submit a plan, so it is not possible to know exactly how many fell into this latter category. However, the Agency had expected around 1,100 plans to be submitted, and in the event just under 1,000 actually were. What this constitutes in terms of diversion of waste is impossible to say, but all waste generated has to be either re-used, recycled, recovered or disposed of regardless of the number of landfill sites available.

<a name="30512w03.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Illsley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the objective of the review by the Environment Agency of regulations governing emissions from power stations is to ensure that the most efficient power stations and those fitted with flue gas desulphurisation plant are used to the maximum.  [107983]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Environment Agency has carried out a review of Integrated Pollution Control authorisations for power stations not fitted with flue gas desulphurisation plant. If such installations were unable to present a good 'Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost' justification for not using the abatement plant then they were authorised to operate at no more than a 40 per cent. load factor in 2001 and 2002. The next principal review of these authorisations is likely to be carried out in 2003&#150;04. The objective of this review will be to secure a further reduction in the emissions of sulphur dioxide from coal fired power stations in 2004&#150;05. One way to achieve this is to ensure the fullest use of Flue Gas Desulphurisation-equipped power stations. In addition, the review will consider how to avoid commercially disadvantaging power stations that are fitted with flue gas desulphurisation plant, and benefiting those without.

<a name="30512w03.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Illsley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the amount by which sulphur dioxide emissions could be reduced if coal fired power stations fitted with flue gas desulphurisation plant were used to the maximum load factor with consequential lower load factors at unabated plant.  [107984]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 As part of the Government's plans to implement the revised Large Combustion Plant Directive, assessments are being carried out of a range of pollution control measures (including flue gas desulphurisation plant) and their impacts upon the environment and will be consulted upon in the near future.
<P>

<a name="30512w03.html_para1">The actual emissions of sulphur dioxide are varied between power stations because of the different sulphur contents in the fuels burnt and the different load factors at which individual power stations operate. No estimate has therefore been made of the amount by which sulphur dioxide emissions could be reduced if coal fired power stations fitted with flue gas desulphurisation plant were used to the maximum load factor with consequential lower load factors at unabated plant. The following table compares recent figures for the amount of sulphur dioxide that is discharged from power stations in the UK, with and without flue gas desulphurisation equipment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the appeals procedure is for a landowner whose property has been entered in error as common land on the draft Right to Roam map.  [111089]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w03.html_spnew6"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 It is necessary to separate out two issues in responding to this question. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (the CROW Act) sets out how maps of open country and registered common land are to be prepared for the purposes of the statutory right of access. This work is being carried out in England by the Countryside Agency. The law dealing with the registration and other aspects of common land pre-dates the CROW Act and is generally very complex.
<P>

<a name="30512w03.html_para2">As far as the CROW Act is concerned, there is a statutory right of appeal against the showing of common land on the Countryside Agency's maps of open country and registered common land on the ground that the land is not registered common land. However, there is no appeal against the showing of such land on the ground that it has been wrongly registered as common land.
<P>

<a name="30512w03.html_para3">As far as the law on common land more generally is concerned, I announced proposals for future legislation on common land last July that would include provision for wrongly registered land to be removed from local authority registers. Although we hope to bring forward measures as soon as parliamentary time permits, I can give no guarantee at this stage, either about the timing of legislation, or its scope.

Within the Government's objectives for sustainable development, the overall aim is to make the planning system more responsive to the needs of all rural businesses, taking account of all relevant economic, social and environmental issues. The Government has provided a significant injection of extra resources into local authority planning services to help with delivering the step change represented by the overall package of reforms.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much has been distributed by <i>(a)</i> Government offices and <i>(b)</i> regional development agencies in EU Structural Funds to UK organisations in each of the last five years, broken down by region.  [111805]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w04.html_spnew8"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Structural Funds are multi-annual and often multi-regional programmes. In England, the Regional Government Offices are responsible for the implementation of the funds. They provide the secretariats, which distribute the funds to all final beneficiaries, which include the Regional Development Agencies.
<P>

<a name="30512w04.html_para5">Responsibility for the Structural Funds lies with the Welsh European Funding Office (WEFO) in Wales, the Scottish Executive in Scotland and the Department for Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30512w04.html_para6">The relevant Structural Funds programmes cover the periods 1994&#150;99 and 2000&#150;06. The annual allocations were provided in my answer to the hon. Member's question no. 111804, which I have answered today.
<P>

<a name="30512w04.html_para7">The distribution of funds allocated in the 1994&#150;99 period continued in 2000 and 2001. The distribution of funds allocated for the 2000&#150;06 period is still at an early stage. For these current programmes there is a requirement that each annual allocation is spent by the end of the second year following the year of allocation (the N+2 rule). This rule was tested for the first time for Objective 1 regions at the end of 2002, when all but a very small part of the 2000 allocations was fully spent. For the Objective 2 regions, 2003 will be the first year in which the rule applies and it is too early to say what levels of expenditure will be achieved.
<P>

<a name="30512w04.html_para8">More detailed information about the distribution of funds in individual years could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<P>

 Covenants and conditions are regularly included in ECGD loan agreements and usually relate to financial or legal undertakings.

 Since the introduction of ECGD's Business Principles in December 2000, Underwriting Committee has considered nine high potential impact cases. For most of these cases either ECGD's assessment is still on-going or the case did not proceed (e.g. because the UK company did not win the contract).

<a name="30512w05.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will refer the funeral director industry to the Office of Fair Trading to investigate charging policy.  [109737]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w05.html_spnew10"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Under UK competition law, it is the responsibility of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to investigate allegations of anti-competitive behaviour or possible abuses of a dominant position. The OFT published its latest report on the funeral industry on 27 July 2001 and recommended that consumers be given better information about prices and choices. The OFT has also named the industry as one of its priority sectors under its Consumer Codes Approval Scheme. The OFT is currently holding discussions regarding this scheme with a number of industry bodies. Under the Competition Act 1998, the OFT can act if pricing levels appear to be the result of anti-competitive practices. Anyone with evidence of such behaviour should forward that information to the OFT.
<P>

<a name="30512w05.html_para7">The funeral services industry has a system of self regulation. The National Association of Funeral Directors, the Funeral Standards Council and the National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors all have codes of practice that require funeral directors to provide a professional service and not to exploit consumers. The codes require members to make a basic funeral available with its price clearly indicated. Funeral directors have a duty to treat consumers fairly at what is a time of considerable emotional stress. Adherence to the Code is monitored by each of the respective trade associations.

<P>
<a name="30512w05.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 We expect UK companies to make a significant contribution to the redevelopment of Iraq's essential infrastructure. At my request British Trade International have set up a working group of companies representing the main industrial sectors, chaired by a senior businessman, to advise on this. It is clearly important that there is a level playing field for all companies who are interested in contracts in Iraq. I have discussed this with the US authorities and have received positive feedback. When conditions allow, the working group will hope to visit Iraq.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w07.html_spnew2"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Within the enhanced HIPC initiative it is essential to have clear and transparent rules for the provision of debt relief, and the debt to export ratio is a useful indicator of debt sustainability. However, looking forward, after the provision of debt relief, such a broad measure may not always be appropriate in assessing country plans to finance their Poverty Reduction Strategies, and the associated level of borrowing. In particular the UK is concerned that enforcing the debt to export ratio could constrain the ability of some developing countries to access their allocation of concessional finance. The UK is working closely with the IMF and the World Bank to develop a more integrated approach to debt sustainability for financing poverty reduction. The Government acknowledges that debt relief is not a panacea for broader economic development challenges problems; even the provision of 100 per cent. debt relief to all low-income countries would still fall short of the resources needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals. That is why the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for International Development have proposed an International Finance Facility (IFF) that would seek to double the amount of development aid from just over $50 billion a year today to $100 billion per year in the years to 2015.

 At the 2002 summit in Kananaskis the UK helped secure agreement from the G7 to fund the shortfall in the enhanced HIPC initiative, recognising that it could be up to US $1 billion. Ahead of the Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank in September 2002, the UK pledged its share of the $1 billion shortfall, $120million, to encourage other donors to make firm pledges. Donors have now made pledges totalling some $850m, and the 2003 Spring Meetings urged donors to translate these into concrete contributions in the coming months.

 All personnel returning from Operation TELIC, whether Regulars or Reservists, will be provided with appropriate support measures acknowledging that each individual's experience of the conflict will be different. The procedures will vary slightly between each Service according to need, but are essentially similar and delivered in three stages: recovery, normalisation and after care. Each stage has support services ranging from medical screening and de-briefings to post-operational tour leave. For example, building on lessons from earlier conflicts, personnel from 3 Commando Brigade will have a period of two weeks in their barracks, with night leave, to allow additional time to 'decompress' and normalise while fulfilling equipment maintenance tasks.

<P>
<UL>(2) who is responsible within his Department for the planning and execution of army exercises; and what procedures are in place to assess their performance and that of their subordinates.  [110552]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="30512w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There is a robust system in place to ensure that appropriate training is undertaken by the Army, and that relevant lessons are learned from exercises. Ultimately the responsibility for the planning and execution of Army exercises lies with Headquarters Land Command. The exercise programme is disseminated through the Land Command Collective Training Programme, which is designed to ensure that the right number of troops achieve the right level of readiness, in line with the Formation Readiness Cycle.
<P>

<a name="30512w10.html_para3">Individual exercises are planned against the 'Mission Essential Tasks List' (METL) that each unit is asked to undertake. The specific manner in which these METLs are met is a decision for the Chain of Command to take, at the appropriate level dependent on the size of the exercise. Headquarters Land Command undertakes the formulation of the METL, through a consultation process with the relevant Chain of Command. The procedure for assessing the individual performances of the personnel involved in the planning and execution of exercises, and that of their subordinates, is through the annual appraisal system, which is informed by an "After Action Review" conducted immediately at the end of each exercise.
<P>

<a name="30512w10.html_para4">Following soon after the completion of each exercise a Post Exercise Report is produced examining the success of the exercise against its aims. This not only enables the Chain of Command to assess the Collective Performance of the units/formations involved, but also provides an avenue for feedback, which allows the Army to learn appropriate lessons. The Land Warfare Centre's Mission Support Group, which is part of Land Command, is responsible for the effective collation and dissemination of lessons learned from past Army exercises.
<P>

<a name="30512w10.html_para5">Throughout the year, all collective training establishments systematically analyse the performance of all unit, battlegroup and brigade level exercises. These observations are then used to inform Land Command's lines of development, such as concepts and doctrine, sustainability, structures, training development, equipment and technology and people.
<P>

<a name="30512w10.html_para6">In addition, the Mission Support Group issues 'Observations from Training' (OFT), a collation of the lessons learnt from the exercises undertaken in the preceding year. The OFT seek to identify trends and general observations from training. It is the responsibility of the Chain of Command to ensure that the OFT receives widespread distribution, and that the lessons learned inform future training and operations.

These safety instructions make clear that the risks from DU are far lower than those from other hazards arising from military operations and that combat and life-saving activities should never be delayed on account of concern over DU. The emphasis is on avoiding situations where DU dust may be encountered and on wearing appropriate respiratory protective equipment and protective clothing when it is necessary to enter potentially contaminated areas.

As many defeated tanks as possible within the British area of operations are being cordoned off and kept undisturbed, until it is possible to send scientists to examine them.

 Operational Capability of individual ships, air squadrons and Commando Force Elements is assessed monthly. Currently, a number of ships are undermanned because of the Royal Navy's commitments to fire-fighting duties, although operational capability is being substantially maintained. The operational capability of air squadrons and Commando forces is not significantly affected.
<P>

<a name="30512w11.html_para1">Firefighting commitments have affected the employment stability and personal plans of many of those involved, with inevitable consequences for morale in the short term.

<a name="30512w11.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the progress of the procurement of the <i>(a)</i> aircraft carriers, <i>(b)</i> type 45 destroyer, <i>(c)</i> amphibious assault vessels and <i>(d)</i> heavy sealift ships; whether they are on schedule; and whether changes have been made to their capabilities.  [110023]<P>

<P>
<a name="30512w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The information requested is as follows:
<P>

<a name="30512w11.html_para2"><i>Future Aircraft Carrier CVF</i>
<P>

<a name="30512w11.html_para3">Design activity on the Future Aircraft Carrier programme is continuing in parallel with our discussions with BAE Systems and Thales to determine the structure of the alliance for the programme. We expect to be in a position to formally commence the next phase of the assessment work shortly. Subject to the normal internal approvals we remain on course to award the main design and build contract for the carriers in spring 2004.
<P>

<a name="30512w11.html_para4">The capability required for the carriers will not be formally approved until the award of the design and build contract. Up to that point the CVF user requirements are performance targets to focus the assessment phase work of the contractors.
<P>

<a name="30512w11.html_para5"><i>Type 45</i>
<P>

<a name="30512w11.html_para6">The Type 45 Destroyer programme remains on track to meet the approved in service date of November 2007.
<P>

<a name="30512w11.html_para7">The baseline capability of the Type 45 has not changed since the main investment decision was made in July 2000. However, work continues on an Incremental Acquisition Plan (IAP) which will increase class capability as funding becomes available, technology develops and the requirement emerges. The first example of the successful implementation of the IAP is the inclusion of the Ultra MFS 7000 Sonar in the First of Class onward. At the time of the original approval it was envisaged that sonar would be fitted at build to Batch 2 (Hull 04 onwards) and that this capability would be retrofitted in the earlier vessels.
<P>

<a name="30512w11.html_para8"><i>Amphibious assault vessels</i>
<P>

<a name="30512w11.html_para9">Landing Ships Dock (Auxiliary)&#151;construction of the first of the Bay Class Landing Ships Dock (Auxiliary), RFA Largs Bay is progressing satisfactorily, with the vessel programmed to complete in March 2004 although the shipyard have expectations to deliver earlier. She will then undergo a series of sea trials prior to acceptance into service in autumn 2004. Construction of the remaining three vessels is planned to complete during 2004 and 2005, followed by sea trials and acceptance into service. All four vessels are expected to meet their planned in service dates and there have been no changes to their planned capabilities.
<P>

<a name="30512w11.html_para10">Landing Platform Dock (Replacement) programme&#151;the Landing Platform Dock (Replacement) programme will provide two vessels for the Royal Navy, HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark. HMS Albion is nearing completion and is expected to achieve her currently planned in service date (ISD) of My 2003. Discussions continue with the prime contractor, BAE Systems, on agreeing a revised programme for HMS Bulwark. The ISDs originally planned were March 2002 for HMS Albion and March 2003 for HMS Bulwark. There have been no changes to their capability.

<i>Heavy Sealift ships</i>
<P>

<a name="30512w11.html_para11">With the delivery of the sixth ship to AWSR Shipping Ltd. on 17 April 2003, the full Roll-On Roll-Off Strategic Sealift Service, being provided under Private Finance Initiative arrangements, became available. This is 20 months earlier than the target date set by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Dr. Moonie) at the start of the competition and meets the date given by my on 6 March 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 326W. There has been no change to the capability.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w11.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Lazarowicz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what progress the Meteorological Office has made with its programme of upgrades to radar sites. [110386]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w11.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie:  </B> 
The Met Office has carried out all the upgrades that were announced in its Scientific and Technical review 2001&#150;02. These have been implemented throughout the United Kingdom radar network sites and are already delivering the expected benefits in terms of operational reliability and efficiency.
<P>

<a name="30512w11.html_para12">In addition, the Met Office now has plans for some further improvements to follow on from the upgrades mentioned above. These include improving the data retrieval techniques and improved data handling. This will result in increased accuracy and reduction in false alarms. Multiple beam operations will be introduced, which will allow the Met Office to more reliably detect weather systems, despite the interruption caused by, for example, mountains blocking the path of the radar beam.
<P>

<a name="30512w11.html_para13">The Met Office are also working closely with the Environment Agency to determine the technology that might be employed for the next generation of weather

radars. There are opportunities to employ new techniques that can potentially identify both the quantity and the type of precipitation, which will lead to further improvements in accuracy in forecasting potential floods and other consequences of severe weather.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w11.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Lazarowicz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, whether the Meteorological Office intends to establish a new weather radar station to serve the south-east of Scotland and north-west of Scotland areas. [110385]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w11.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Current weather radar coverage in Scotland is provided by three radars, one situated just south of Glasgow, one near Aberdeen and one on the Isle of Lewis.
<P>

<a name="30512w11.html_para14">The Met Office is in discussion with the Scottish Executive and a windfarm developer over plans to site a windfarm around the Glasgow radar. Were the windfarm to go ahead it would unacceptably compromise the performance of the radar and negate its contribution to the severe weather service for Scotland. A potential solution being considered includes removal of the current Glasgow radar installation and the construction of two new radar sites to maintain coverage of the south-east of Scotland area.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many individuals have <i>(a)</i> died and <i>(b)</i> been injured as a result of collusion with loyalist paramilitary groups, as identified in the report of Sir John Stevens.  [112275]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Sir John Stevens' overview and recommendations published on 17 April 2003 made clear that his enquiries and specific criminal investigations are continuing and that his recommendations cover the operations of all security forces in Northern Ireland. Thus it would be improper for the Ministry of Defence to comment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills by when he expects all schools in England to have broadband internet access; and what steps he is taking to bring this about.  [112850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Prime Minister has set a target for all schools to be connected to broadband by 2006. DfES is working with the Regional Broadband Consortia, LEAs and schools to ensure this target is achieved. Typically DfES would expect primary schools to be connected at a minimum of 2 Megabits per second (2Mbps) and secondary schools at 8 Mbps.
<P>

<a name="30512w13.html_para3">Broadband connectivity is being rolled out through the 10 Regional Broadband Consortia for England, in conjunction with member LEAs. The Department is also working with a range of partners including telecoms companies and other Government Departments to identify other cost effective ways of providing broadband for schools.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Teacher Training Agency's standards for initial teacher training and induction require all new teachers to be equipped with a range of strategies to support and improve pupil behaviour. It is for individual teachers, acting within law and in line with the school behaviour policy, to determine which methods to use in particular circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30512w13.html_para4">We provided guidance to schools on drawing up and implementing effective behaviour policies in "Social Inclusion: Pupil Support", published in 1999. We are investing nearly &#163;470 million over the next three years in the national behaviour and attendance strategy, which will among other things, provide further advice and training to support the development and consistent implementation of whole school behaviour policies by all secondary school staff, including newly-qualified teachers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on the performance of behaviour improvement programme experts in addressing disruptive students.  [111649]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w13.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Behaviour Improvement Programme (BIP) currently runs in 61 LEA areas, and involves extra funding for measures to tackle behaviour and attendance issues in schools where they present a significant threat to standards. Participating schools and authorities have used the funding to provide a range of additional staff including professionals working as 



<P>
<P><I>12 May 2003 : Column 52W</I><P>
part of school-based multi-agency teams, and dedicated staff to mentor and support pupils with problems. Additional funding has also been used to enable a member of the senior management team to focus on whole school behaviour and attendance issues.
<P>

<a name="30512w13.html_para5">Early findings from the two-year independent evaluation of BIP show classroom disruption, as measured by exclusions, decreasing. Further results will allow us to judge which staff and which models of intervention had the most impact on the target group.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many schools have applied to the Department for power to innovate as a result of the Education Act 2002; and if he will list the areas of innovation applied for by each school.  [112854]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 There have been two formal applications to use the power to innovate, both of which have been approved. Both schools that applied were reorganising their school day and applied for exemption from the Changing of School Session Times (England) Regulations 1999 in order to change the timing and length of their school days mid-way through the year.
<P>

<a name="30512w13.html_para6">As well as these two formal applications, the Innovation Unit has provided advice to schools and LEAs on a whole range of inquiries about using the power to innovate and making use of the existing freedoms and flexibilities that are available to schools. (In a number of cases, schools that have contacted the Unit did not realise the extent of the freedoms and flexibilities that are already available and that they did not need the power to innovate to achieve their aims).
<P>

<a name="30512w13.html_para7">The Unit does not keep a detailed list of all the inquiries that it receives, as many are informal discussions that members of the Unit have with schools and LEAs.

<a name="30512w13.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B>

 Teachers in maintained schools are subject to national school teachers' pay and conditions. Further Education (FE) colleges are run by independent corporations established under the Further Education and Higher Education Act 1992 and there is no national pay structure in place.

This funding provides the framework to allow FE colleges to make real progress on pay and pay structures and to narrow substantially the pay gap between general FE colleges and schools.

 As we have made clear in "Widening Participation in Higher Education", we believe that all applicants to higher education should be treated fairly and on the basis of their merit and potential. We are not aware of any evidence which suggests that women are generally treated inequitably in the admissions process. Women are well represented in higher education. The participation rate for women aged under 21 in 2000 was 37 per cent., compared with 30 per cent. for men aged under 21. Although the bottom three social groups are under-represented in higher education, women of all age groups account for 53 per cent. of acceptances into higher education from these groups.

<P>
<a name="30512w17.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 A model was developed by the Home Office Research Development and Statistics Directorate as part of the review of sentencing policy conducted by John Halliday ("Making Punishments Work", published in July 2001). This model was then adapted for use in assessing the impact of the Criminal Justice Bill, focussing on those aspects of the review's proposals that have been taken forward in the Bill, as well as additional proposals that have been developed following the publication of the review. The model considers the cost-benefits of the proposals, as well as the impacts on prison and probation workload. It uses published prison and probation statistics, and research evidence on the effectiveness of programmes in reducing re-offending. It is based on sentencing behaviour in 2000. The assumptions within the model were agreed with the relevant stakeholders such as the Prison Service, Probation Service and others. The projected net effect of implementation of the sentencing provisions in the Bill, of a small increase of about 1,000 in the prison population by 2009, was arrived at using the model. The impact is estimated to be about 500 once all the changes have been implemented and sufficient time has passed for their full effects to be seen.

NCRS adjustments made to the total recorded crime figure have been calculated using exactly the same methodology as the adjustments for the other offence groups in Table 2. The data used to calculate the adjusted total recorded crime figure are therefore not a sum of all the figures for the offence groups, it is a separate calculation.

 Measures in the Criminal Justice Bill and the Anti-social Behaviour Bill will increase demand for parenting classes. Youth Offending Teams receive grants from the Youth Justice Board and prioritise in response to local demands. Parenting classes are delivered in response to parenting orders and on a voluntary basis. All Youth Offending Teams are expected to offer parenting classes or have plans for implementing a parenting service by April 2004. The Youth Justice Board is reviewing the provision of parenting programmes and this review will also extend to the Secure Estate where some parenting classes are already being delivered. The Home Office Family Support Grant provides &#163;5.8 million a year to a range of voluntary organisations for parenting support, including parenting classes. Since 1999&#150;2000 it has funded 108 organisations to deliver 182 different projects across England plus grants to the National Family and Parenting Institute, Parentline Plus, Home Start UK and the Parenting Education and Support Forum (which provides a range of services and support to other organisations that deliver parenting classes).

<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w18.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Special Priority Payment (SPP) Scheme was not introduced under the Police Reform Act 2002 but by agreement with all the main police organisations in the Police Negotiating Board (PNB). The Scheme was one of a number of ground-breaking reforms to police pay and conditions of service included in the PNB Agreement of 9 May 2002.
<P>

<a name="30512w18.html_para8">Under the Agreement, PNB expected that no more than 30 per cent. of force strength should qualify for a SPP save in exceptional circumstances.

 The Government are working on a number of measures to reduce the numbers of spontaneous arrivals of people seeking asylum in Europe and to address the problem of secondary movements of asylum seekers within the EU.
<P>

<a name="30512w19.html_para1">Domestically, the measures in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 will deter and prevent people who do not need international protection but lodge asylum applications in order to circumvent immigration controls, from entering the UK.
<P>

<a name="30512w19.html_para2">Together with our European partners, the Government is active in numerous joint projects and operations to strengthen the EU's external borders. Stronger EU borders will have a significant impact on the numbers of illegal immigrants arriving in the UK. The first round of operations is currently being evaluated in order to set priorities for future action.
<P>

<a name="30512w19.html_para3">The Government has also worked to secure a more effective mechanism to replace the Dublin Convention, determining which Member State is responsible for considering an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States of the EU. The Dublin II Regulation will enter into force in September this year. The Eurodac fingerprint database is now operational, and will provide much better evidence to support the determination of responsibility. Together, the Dublin II regulation and the Eurodac system will enable the UK to effect the return of a greater number of asylum seekers to the Member State most responsible for their presence on EU territory.
<P>

<a name="30512w19.html_para4">The UK has been active in negotiations to put in place minimum standards for reception conditions for asylum seekers, for asylum procedures and for qualification as a refugee across the EU. The proposed Qualification Directive, for example, will result in a more consistent interpretation of the definition of a refugee and ensure that each Member State accords refugees comparable rights and benefits. This should discourage those in genuine need of international protection from "asylum shopping". The reduction of both the real and the perceived advantages of applying in certain Member States over others should deter secondary movements of asylum applicants within the EU.

These 'zones' are designed to improve the quality and availability of protection for refugees who need it, while ensuring we strengthen the management of our borders and can have proper control of who comes into the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the policy of the Metropolitan police is on charging <i>(a)</i> victims and their families of road death or serious injury and <i>(b)</i> dependants for police reports, witness statements and collision investigation reports on such incidents in respect of incidents occurring (i) within the Metropolitan police area and (ii) partly within the Metropolitan police area and partly in neighbouring police authority areas.  [111197]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 In each of the areas listed, the Metropolitan police follow the charging policy adopted by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). The ACPO standard requires the recovery of administration and reproduction costs applicable to all police records, including copies of road collision investigation reports.
<P>

<a name="30512w19.html_para6">In cases involving serious road traffic incidents, local senior police officers have discretion to waive charges where, for example, payment would bring hardship or cause distress. The decision can also depend on the timing of the request and whether it comes from a third party. In some cases, the full circumstances of an incident may lead to a charge being levied.
<P>

<a name="30512w19.html_para7">Disclosure of relevant police records to victims and dependants is clearly a sensitive issue. We will examine it carefully as part of pilot projects, due to commence later this year, on how best to meet the support needs of serious road crash victims.

 Prior to 2001 lost property numbers, rather than crime numbers, were issued by the police to members of the public who perceived themselves to be victims of theft but where there was insufficient evidence to show that a crime had been committed. The lost property numbers were issued primarily for insurance purposes.
<P>

<a name="30512w19.html_para8">Since 2001 everyone who reports a theft to the police, whether real or perceived, should be issued with a crime number not a lost property number. This change occurred following a report from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in July 2000 that set out the extent and causes of variations in police recording practices. One of the conclusions reached was that there was a need for all forces to have in place an accurate and ethical crime recording system.
<P>

The UK will continue to devote effort and resources to tackling the drugs problem at home and internationally, particularly in Afghanistan, where the creation of alternative economic activities is vital to the success of the fight against the international drug problem and to the stability of the region.

 The second session of the Preparatory Committee (PrepCom) to the 2005 Review Conference on the implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is currently meeting in Geneva (28 April to 9 May). The UK remains fully committed to all aspects of the NPT, including global and verifiable nuclear disarmament. The Head of the UK Delegation publicly reaffirmed this commitment to states party to the NPT on 29 April. We have also reaffirmed our commitment to the Decisions and Resolution of the 1995 Review Conference and the Final Document agreed at the 2000 Review Conference. The UK has also made clear that full compliance by all States Party is central to the object and purposes of the Treaty.
<P>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). A consistent series is available from 1994&#150;95. 2001&#150;02 is the latest year for which data is available.<P>

2. Dependent on benefits has been defined as in receipt of Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance/Unemployment Benefit, Incapacity Benefit/Invalidity Benefit or Severe Disablement Allowance.<P>

3. From October 1996 Jobseeker's Allowance replaced Unemployment Benefit and Income Support for unemployed people. Recipients of those benefits were automatically transferred to JSA.<P>

4. From April 1995 Incapacity Benefit replaced Sickness Benefit and Invalidity Benefit. Recipients of those benefits were automatically transferred to IB.<P>

5. Working age households contain at least one adult below pensionable age.<P>

6. Workless households contain no-one in work.<P>

7. Benefit receipt is based on self-assessment and therefore may be subject to misreporting.<P>

8. The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors that control for tenure type, Council Tax Band and a number of demographic variables. Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining response bias.<P>

 Poverty and social exclusion are complex and multi-dimensional issues, affecting many aspects of peoples' lives&#151;including their living standards, health, housing, the quality of their environment and not just low income.

 The Government is committed to reducing the death rate from coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke and related diseases in people under 75 by at least 40 per cent., to 83.8 deaths per 100,000 population, by 2010. Prevention of CHD in the population and in high-risk patients by promoting physical activity, promoting healthy eating, reducing overweight and obesity and reducing smoking can make a significant contribution to this target.
<P>

<a name="30512w27.html_para0">In order to inform and lead action on exercise across the National Health Service, the Department of Health, Sport England and the Countryside Agency are funding a &#163;2.5 million programme of local exercise action pilots (LEAPs).

<a name="30512w27.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Roger Williams: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his answer of 27 March 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 397W, on food labelling, for what reasons the number of informal samples of foodstuffs declined in the last 10 years; and what measures he is taking to reverse the trend.  [111215]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w27.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 May 2003]:</i> The responsibility for the enforcement of food labelling Regulations and associated food sampling under the Food Safety Act 1990 rests with local authorities. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has raised its concerns about the decline in local authority food sampling activity and is taking forward a number of initiatives with local authorities to reverse the trend.
<P>

<a name="30512w27.html_para5">There appears to be no single cause for the fall in sampling. The FSA has carried out a focussed audit programme to examine local authority sampling and make recommendations. A report will be published later this year.
<P>

<a name="30512w27.html_para6">The FSA is already taking action to help to ensure that effective food sampling arrangements are in place in all local authorities. The FSA is working with local authorities co-ordinators of regulatory services (LACORS) to develop better co-ordination and targeting of food and feed standards sampling throughout the United Kingdom. Local authorities and public analysts are also being involved more closely in the FSA's own food surveillance activities.
<P>

<a name="30512w27.html_para7">The FSA is also working with LACORS and with the association of public analysts to develop a UK samples database, which will help local authorities to target their sampling programmes more effectively.




<P>
<P><I>12 May 2003 : Column 105W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30512w27.html_para8">More emphasis has also been placed on sampling in the revised statutory code of practice, which is currently out for consultation. Under the code, local authorities are required to prepare and publish a food sampling policy and programme and make these available to food businesses and consumers. The FSA will also be providing more practical guidance on sampling for local authority enforcement officers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w28.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has funded five projects over the past two years on Basmati rice.

The &#163;250,000 campaign is aimed primarily at 18&#150;24 year old pregnant women in low income groups, their partners and families.

<P>
<a name="30512w28.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Getting children and young people to be more active through increased participation in physical activity and sport, together with a healthy, balanced diet is key for the prevention of obesity. Increasing levels of physical activity across the whole population is a top priority across government. The Cadbury initiative, "Get Active", is not a Government initiative and the Department of Health was not, therefore, consulted.
<P>

<a name="30512w28.html_para8">To prevent and manage obesity, consumption of food high in fat and/or added sugar, such as chocolate, should be kept to a minimum, accompanied by increased levels of physical activity. Food consumption by children is assessed by the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS). The NDNS published in 2000 showed that the average consumption of chocolate confectionery in males aged four to 18 years was 138 grams per week and in females aged four to 18 years 115 grams per week.

<P>
<a name="30512w31.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 I have not had discussions with Ordnance Survey on this specific issue, however it is Ordnance Survey policy to depict all designated rights of way on the OS Explorer and OS Landranger Series when supported by confirming information from the footpath authorities.

<P>

<a name="30512w31.html_para4">Footpaths and bridleways to be registered as rights of way under the historic paths requirement of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 will be added to OS Explorer and OS Landranger maps following the receipt of confirming details from the footpath authorities.

 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has reviewed the European Parliament's proposed Flight Time Limitations (FTL) requirements. They advise me that, while the requirements are not totally acceptable, with suitable amendment they could form a baseline European FTL requirement which could be supplemented by additional requirements in each member state. We recognise the need for FTL requirements to be harmonised at a European level and should the proposal come before the Council we will work constructively with other member states to ensure that it is appropriately amended. We will not endorse the proposal if any of the limits are significantly different to those set by the CAA in CAP 371, which are in line with scientific advice that the CAA has received over the years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to his answer of 6 May, ref 111284, if he will propose an amendment to the law to allow parish and community councils to make representations about applications for a Goods Vehicles Operators licence regardless of whether they own or occupy land or buildings in the proposed operating centre; and if he will make a statement on the basis for restricting such representation to owners and occupiers of land and buildings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w32.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The most effective way for parish councils to comment on applications for a heavy goods vehicle operator's licence is to work with local authorities who have a statutory right to object. The Government launched The 'QUALITY' Town and Parish Council Initiative, a framework for partnership working equipping local councils to take on a stronger role for the benefit of the local community, on 18 March.

<P>

<a name="30512w33.html_para0"><i>Letter from Tim Matthews to Mr. Jonathan Shaw, dated 7 May 2003:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Transport Minister, David Jamieson, has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question regarding the amount of compensation that has been given, and on what dates, by the Highways Agency to Buckmore Park Scout Centre as a consequence of the M2 widening.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You will know from your previous involvement with the M2 Widening scheme that the Buckmore Park Scout Centre was accepted as a Rule 5 Case under the Land Compensation Act. This provides for compensation to meet the costs of reasonable equivalent reinstatement. Exceptionally, to enable work to be undertaken to organise the replacement facilities and get them built ahead of the M2 widening construction, it was agreed that compensation would be released in stages ahead of the normal "land entry" requirement. The payment of compensation was therefore spread over a period of time commencing in October 1995.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I set out in the attached annex the full schedule of payments made and dates of release. All these payments included the payment of VAT. You will note that the last entry is for statutory interest, providing for the interest on the difference between the sum released at the time of entry and the latest estimate of compensation.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You raise the issue of outstanding claims. At the end of 2001, the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), the independent valuer acting for the Highways Agency, had discussed with the scouts' valuer, all the heads of claim and had reached a point where a full and final offer could be made. However, because there was some question as to whether the VAT element could be recovered by the scouts, and therefore not form part of the "cost" of reinstatement, the full and final offer made was presented "without prejudice" to the outcome of the VAT enquiry.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The full and final offer, in the sum of &#163;10,100,000 (including VAT) was made on 4 December 2001 and apparently accepted by the valuer for the scouts but his recommendation to accept was rejected by his client.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The dispute over the VAT element eventually led to the scouts making a reference to the Lands Tribunal on 15 April 2002. At that time the solicitor for the scouts raised a claim for compensation on a number of additional items. These were not specified in any way and to date the scouts have not responded to our request for this to be done.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what recent discussions he has had with <i>(a)</i> his counterparts in Europe, <i>(b)</i> his counterparts in other maritime nations and <i>(c)</i> the International Maritime Organisation regarding the creation of internationally recognised marine environment high risk areas.  [111426]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w33.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 I have had no discussions of the sort described concerning marine environmental high risk areas (MEHRAs). MEHRAs are a domestic UK initiative. However, there is an international designation entitled 'Particularly Sensitive Sea Area' (PSSA), which represents the very highest level of environmental protection available through the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). A proposal for a PSSA in western European waters was discussed at the Transport Council in March, and my Department has played an active role in developing that proposal in co-operation with French, 



<P>
<P><I>12 May 2003 : Column 127W</I><P>
Spanish, Irish, Portuguese and Belgian colleagues. The six countries' joint proposal for a PSSA stretching from the Shetland Islands in the north to the coast of Portugal in the south, and including the English Channel, was submitted to the IMO last month and will be considered by the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee in July.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what targets he has set for the creation of marine environment high risk areas in waters within UK jurisdiction.  [111427]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w33.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In his report "Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas", which first recommended the identification of marine environmental high risk areas (MEHRAs), Lord Donaldson proposed that not more than about a tenth of the UK coastline should qualify. That is the target I have set.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w33.html_wqn7"><B> Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to his answer of 16 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 580W, to the hon. Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths), what progress his Department is making towards the publishing of the consultation document on marine environment high risk areas.  [111560]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w33.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government remain strongly committed to marine environmental high risk areas (MEHRAs). An interdepartmental group, including representatives of Defra, DTI and my own Department (including its Maritime and Coastguard Agency), together with the devolved Administrations, the country agencies for nature conservation and the UK Hydrographic Office, has been working to produce a report, which will announce the areas which have been identified as MEHRAs and which will consult on the protective measures proposed to protect these locations.
<P>

<a name="30512w33.html_para1">We have completed traffic surveys of a number of the identified locations on the east and west coasts of the UK, and we are developing proposals on ship routeing measures to take to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). An outline of the results of the traffic surveys and the proposed routeing measures will be included in the report.
<P>

<a name="30512w33.html_para2">However, this is a substantial task and an appreciable amount of work has still to be done in developing the proposed protective measures. In the circumstances, I now expect the report to be issued this autumn.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the estimated cost is in 2003&#150;04 to his Department, agencies and the non-departmental public bodies for which he is responsible of the increase in the national minimum wage from &#163;4.20 per hour to &#163;4.50 per hour.  [110444]<P>

 No additional costs for staff will be incurred by my Department, agencies and the non-departmental public bodies for which I am responsible as a result of the increase in the national minimum wage with the exception of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency where the estimated cost is &#163;120,000, related to voluntary auxilliary coastguards.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what plans his Department has to stop train companies adding minutes to their summer timetables in order to reduce the fines paid for late trains;  [111406]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the announcement by Thameslink that it will increase the journey times on its routes in order to reduce the fines it pays for late services.  [111405]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w34.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Passenger Service Requirement (PSR) in franchise agreements prescribes permitted journey times on core routes. Operators cannot exceed the prescribed journey times without the approval of the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA). No extensions of permitted journey times have been approved for Thameslink. For services which are not part of the PSR operators agree both train paths and journey times with the infrastructure manager (Network Rail). However, journey times for similar services are usually close because of the way the timetable is constructed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w34.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The letter of engagement referred to is a commercially confidential agreement between the Department and Schroder Salomon Smith Barney (SSSB) and so would not be appropriate to place in the Library.

 Departmental officials met First Group representatives on 3 April. Departmental officials and Ministers regularly meet the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) to discuss rail issues, including issues relating to franchises. The decision on those selected to bid for the Greater Anglia franchise is a matter for the SRA. The decision followed a detailed qualification process, which is confidential in respect of the commercial propositions put forward. Arriva Trains Ltd., GB Railways plc and National Express Group plc were confirmed as bidders on 1 April 2003, with Invitations To Tender issued on 15 April. Detailed proposals are to be submitted to the SRA by 1 September.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many <i>(a)</i> lorry drivers and <i>(b)</i> haulage firms were convicted in each of the last three years for which figures are available for offences involving the (i) tampering with and (ii) removal of tachographs.  [111498]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w34.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The number of lorry drivers and haulage firms (operators) convicted by the Vehicle Inspectorate (now the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency) in each of the last three years for offences involving (i) tampering with or (ii) removal of tachographs is set out in the table below. In such cases operators are convicted for causing or permitting these offences, unless they are owner/drivers. The figures for convictions for tampering with tachographs also include offences of tampering with the tachograph chart.
<P>

<a name="30512w34.html_para3">The agency also has powers to prohibit vehicles if the calibration of a tachograph has been tampered with. The prohibition can only be cleared at an approved tachograph calibration centre.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will bring forward measures to monitor and enforce the legislation relating to the misuse of tachographs; if he will undertake more frequent spot-checks in respect of <i>(a)</i> hours of working by lorry drivers, <i>(b)</i> the roadworthiness of vehicles and <i>(c)</i> the legal weight and safety of the cargo; and if he will make a statement.  [111499]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w34.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The specification and use of tachographs is laid down in European legislation, principally Regulation (EEC) 3821/85. This regulation has been amended to require the fitting and use of digital tachographs in vehicles put into service after August 2004. This new instrument will address the common misuses associated with the current analogue tachograph. The working time of drivers is not currently subject to limits except to the extent that drivers subject to the drivers' hours rules must meet minimum requirements for daily and weekly rest&#151;in addition to limits on driving time. A minimum level for checks on compliance with the EU drivers' hours rules is set in an EU Directive.
<P>

<a name="30512w34.html_para4">We have already taken steps to increase the levels of enforcement for HGV traffic and roadworthiness regulations. In 2001&#150;02, we introduced an additional HGV enforcement package, funded by the Road Haulage Modernisation Fund. The package includes projects to increase the number of examiners available for roadside checks, provide equipment to increase the scope and mobility of roadside inspections, augment advice and education initiatives to prevent offending, enhance data collection and analysis for targeting purposes, and improve roadside inspection facilities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w34.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The number of lorry drivers convicted by the Vehicle Inspectorate (now the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency) in each of the last three years for breaching drivers' hours regulations is set out in the table below. The agency also has powers to impose a prohibition in such cases to prevent the driver from continuing his journey until the road safety risk has been eliminated.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the reasons for proposing the closure of the driving test centre in Shrewsbury.  [111917]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30512w35.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In March, the Driving Standards Agency issued a letter of consultation to interested parties about options for the future provision of practical car driving and motorcycleriding tests in the Shropshire area in order to ensure that the existing test centres continued to meet the needs of the Agency and its customers. The four driving test centres involved were at Telford, Shrewsbury, Whitchurch and Oswestry. The preferred option would have involved co-locating the Shrewsbury and Telford test centres at Telford and closing the Shrewsbury centre. However, as a result of an upsurge in demand for practical tests, the review has now been shelved indefinitely and the consultation exercise suspended. On 28 April, the Agency wrote to all the interested parties explaining there were no longer plans to close test centres in the area for the foreseeable future.

 The Secretary of State has not received any formal representations from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) nor the RAC Foundation with regard to the proposed Active Traffic Management pilot.
<P>

<a name="30512w35.html_para0">The Highways Agency have ongoing consultations with ACPO, which has provided appropriate advice to the Highways Agency as part of the development of the pilot. Discussions have also taken place with the various motoring organisations, and these discussions are on-going.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport on what basis, and for what reasons, a re-assessment of the traffic statistics for 2000 began in 2002.  [110812]<P>

<P>
<a name="30512w35.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Starting in 2000&#150;01, a number of steps have been taken to improve the quality of the published traffic estimates. These include an improvement in the database used to represent the road network, using a Geographic Information System and use of new data from the Highways Agency. Preliminary revisions to estimated traffic levels in 1999, 2000 and 2001, along with a note explaining the revisions, were published in the Transport Statistics Bulletin "Road Traffic Statistics: 2001", issued in August 2002, a copy of which is in the Library. A full revised series back to 1993 will be published in the forthcoming quarterly bulletin "Traffic in Great Britain: Q1 2003", on 8 May.

 Rail and road schemes are funded in ways that reflect the nature of the investment and of the delivery agents involved. Compatible methods are used for assessing the costs and benefits of rail and road schemes.
