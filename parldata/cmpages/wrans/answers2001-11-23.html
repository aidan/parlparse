<a name="11123w01.html_sbhd0"><H4><center>Bona Vacantia</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General what plans she has to reform the application of bona vacantia.  [14669]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 As a result of my hon. Friend's question, I am looking at how bona vacantia is operated and will report back to him on any changes that may arise.

<a name="11123w01.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>Bribery</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_wqn1"><B> Hugh Bayley: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General how many United Kingdom citizens have been prosecuted in the United Kingdom in the last five years for offences of bribery committed abroad.  [14670]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 No United Kingdom citizens have been prosecuted for offences in the UK of bribery committed abroad because current legislation does not allow it. It will, though, be possible to prosecute if the offences under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill become law.

<a name="11123w01.html_sbhd2"><H4><center>Domestic Violence</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_wqn2"><B> Fiona Mactaggart: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if she will report on recent progress with prosecuting perpetrators of domestic violence.  [14672]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_spmin2"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 There is considerable and encouraging progress in prosecuting crimes of domestic violence. For the first time, next week the CPS will be issuing guidance to Crown prosecutors on domestic violence. That guidance will be published, and that will be the first time that any CPS guidance has been published. To support our prosecutors to do their work as well as possible, there will be a national network of domestic violence prosecutors. A new ministerial committee on domestic violence will co-ordinate work across Government.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Gillan: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if she will make a statement on the operation of the Crown Prosecution Service; and how it is affected by the location of magistrates courts.  [14674]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_spmin3"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service prosecutes cases which have been investigated by the police. The CPS is affected by the location of magistrates courts by the need to be located where the witnesses and victims can get to them, and they need to be accessible for the crown prosecutors and caseworkers who prosecute in them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General how many successful prosecutions there were in the last 12 months of people accused of rape who used GHB.  [14675]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_spmin4"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service holds no central records showing case outcomes broken down to particular offences or types, nor is the information held centrally by the Home Office. I will ask my officials to keep me informed on any cases that involve this drug.

<a name="11123w01.html_sbhd5"><H4><center>Child Sexual Abuse</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_wqn5"><B> Julie Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General what the policy of the Crown Prosecution Service is in connection with allegations of child sexual abuse.  [14668]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_spmin5"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The CPS applies the evidential and public interest tests set out in the code for Crown prosecutors in all cases referred to it by the police so that it can make fair and consistent prosecution decisions.
<P>

<a name="11123w01.html_para0">Children form a class of victims and witnesses to whom special care should be given. CPS policy in relation to child abuse cases has three key principles: expedition, sensitivity and fairness. Delay should be avoided in all cases involving a child victim or witness. Child witnesses should be afforded as much protection as necessary to enable them to give their evidence in a way that both maintains the quality of that evidence and minimises the trauma suffered by them. CPS policy emphasises that the best interests of the child should be the first, but not the final, consideration when assessing the public interest.
<P>

<a name="11123w01.html_para1">The CPS works together with other statutory agencies in accordance with the inter-agency guidance "Working Together to Safeguard Children".

To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission, what the words were of the advertisement for the post of Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards on each of the occasions on which applications have been sought.  [15732]<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Kirkwood </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 November 2001]:</i> Over the past three years, complaints requiring assessment have averaged 120 a year. The commissioner completed an average of 14 full investigations a year, each resulting in a report to the Standards and Privileges Committee.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_wqn14"><B> David Winnick: </B>

To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission, for what reason <i>(a)</i> the hours required from and <i>(b)</i> the salary paid to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards are being reduced.  [15535]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Kirkwood </B> 
 <i>[holding answers 15 and 19 November 2001]:</i> The Commission believes that three days per week should be adequate to conduct the duties of the post. This is the level of time commitment that was established for the first commissioner. The figure of three days is not set in stone, and will be discussed with the successful candidate for the post. Salary is commensurate with hours worked.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_wqn16"><B> Peter Bottomley: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission, when it was decided <i>(a)</i> to drop and <i>(b)</i> to reinstate the option of reappointment of the holder of the post of Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards by mutual agreement.  [15280]

To ask the hon.

[15536]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Kirkwood </B> 
 <i>[holding answers 15 and 19 November 2001]:</i> There has been no such decision. As to the position of the present commissioner, I refer the hon. Member to my answer today to the hon. Member for Walsall, North (David Winnick), column 483W.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what discussions she has had with the European Union about its contribution to humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan; and what was the outcome.  [16066]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w02.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I had informal meetings with European Union Development Ministers on 10 October and 8 November. We agreed upon the importance of continued, substantial, assistance from the European Union for humanitarian programmes in Afghanistan. We also agreed on the importance of effective international co-ordination.
<P>

<a name="11123w02.html_para0">The EC's Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) has recently announced the provision of a further 15 million euro of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. This brings the amount of EU humanitarian aid committed for the Afghan people so far in 2001 to nearly 44 million euro. The UK contributes 19 per cent. of this.

<a name="11123w02.html_wqn2"><B> Tony Worthington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> recent developments in the supply of humanitarian resources in Afghanistan and <i>(b)</i> her priorities in the supply of humanitarian needs in Afghanistan over the next three months.  [16065]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w02.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 There has been good progress by humanitarian agencies in opening up routes to get food and other emergency supplies into Afghanistan. From 13 November until 19 November, World Food Programme (WFP) operations were suspended (due to local hauliers' concern about the security situation in southern Afghanistan). The WFP resumed operations from Peshawar on 19 November. Operations from Quetta are still suspended, although the WFP continues to deliver food via the northern routes from Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. International staff from humanitarian agencies are beginning to return to Afghanistan, where possible, in order to accelerate deliveries so that winter stockpiles can be strengthened.
<P>

<a name="11123w02.html_para1">Our immediate priorities are to help meet lifesaving needs within Afghanistan, to support refugee needs in neighbouring countries and to strengthen the work of international humanitarian agencies. At the same time, we will also support the people of Afghanistan in building a better future. We continue to work with the international community on plans for rehabilitation and recovery. The principles and priorities guiding our approach are outlined

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what discussions she has had with <i>(a)</i> her counterparts in other Governments and <i>(b)</i> the United Nations High Commission for Refugees on the aid programme for Afghan refugees (i) within the borders of Afghanistan and (ii) in neighbouring countries.

 My Department is in regular contact with other Governments through the Afghanistan support group of major donors, including USA, Japan and European countries. We are also in daily contact with key agencies, including UNHCR, regarding the humanitarian situation in the region.
<P>

<a name="11123w02.html_para2">In its inter-agency donor alert, the UN system identified $664 million of priority needs for Afghanistan. Over $700 million has been pledged against the appeal&#151;sufficient to meet immediate requirements&#151;of which over $280 million have actually been contributed (over 40 per cent. of the requirement). This is good by historic standards.
<P>

<a name="11123w02.html_para3">The UK was the first donor to pledge assistance, even prior to the UN inter-agency donor alert. We have so far allocated &#163;40 million to support the work of UN agencies, the Red Cross movement and NGOs for immediate humanitarian assistance to Aghans, both in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries. Of this, &#163;3 million has been disbursed to UNHCR, and includes financial, technical and in-kind assistance in support of its regional programme. At UNHCR's request, my Department has provided three relief flights to Iran and Pakistan transporting tents, shelter material and communications equipment. We have also provided a specialist site planner to UNHCR to Pakistan to assist with the setting up of new refugee camp sites.
<P>

<a name="11123w02.html_para4">In addition, we have allocated a further &#163;11 million to support refugee-hosting communities in Pakistan. This will support the delivery of public health services, the supply of drugs and health equipment, and water and sanitation services. It will focus particularly on North- West Frontier Province and Baluchistan, where most of the Afghan refugees have settled.

<P>
<a name="11123w02.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department is in regular contact with UNHCR at both field and headquarters level so that resources are used effectively for the provision of assistance to refugees and the protection of their rights.
<P>

<a name="11123w02.html_para5">So far we have committed &#163;3 million to UNHCR's operations for refugees in response to the current crisis. At the request of UNHCR, my Department has provided three relief flights to Iran and Pakistan transporting tents, shelter material and communications equipment. We have also provided a specialist site planner to UNHCR in Pakistan to assist with the setting up of new refugee camp sites.

<P>

<a name="11123w02.html_para6">Our assessment is that while the situation in some camps may remain difficult, the general level of assistance to refugees has improved. In addition, there is sufficient reserve capacity in Pakistan to address the needs of a further 300,000 refugees.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w02.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), as the New African Initiative is now known, is an Africa-wide initiative, that does not focus on specific countries. Ethiopia is one of the 17 members of the NEPAD implementation committee, and therefore takes a full part in NEPAD activities. NEPAD has set up teams to work on five areas, which are capacity-building peace and security, economic and corporate governance, infrastructure, central bank and standards, and agriculture and market access. Work on these areas should bring benefits to Ethiopia, as it will to other countries in Africa that are part of NEPAD.

 We are currently exploring how to engage most effectively in a development partnership with Ethiopia, where the overall objective of our assistance will be to support the Government of Ethiopia's poverty reduction strategy.

 The Housing Act 1996 requires local housing authorities to secure that suitable accommodation is available immediately for a housing applicant, pending completion of their inquiries, if they have reason to believe that he or she may be homeless, eligible for assistance and have a priority need for accommodation. That duty continues until the authority decides whether a substantive duty is owed. The Homelessness Bill will amend the 1996 Act so that, in all cases where the authority decides that the applicant is eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and falls within a priority need group, they must secure that suitable accommodation is available until a settled housing solution can be found.

 The Transport Act 2000 requires local authorities and PTEs in England and Wales to provide half-price fares on local buses to pensioners and disabled people, with no charge for the pass. In addition, the Transport Act 1985 gives local authorities discretion to provide a more generous scheme (eg less than half-fare or free travel; discounted travel on trains, metros, trams, ferries; or cross-boundary travel). In London, the Freedom Pass scheme is covered by the Greater London Authority Act 1999. Broadly 5.5 million pensioners and 1.5 million disabled people are eligible for these concessions.

 My Department regularly receives representations from organisations calling for the greater use of domestic sprinklers.

<a name="11123w07.html_para1">The Government recognise that domestic sprinklers have a role to play in promoting life safety, particularly for the most vulnerable. The Fire Safety Advisory Board will continue to assess their value in the light of emerging standards and improvements in sprinkler technology. We have, therefore, recently commissioned research into the benefits of sprinklers in residential properties, including the preparation of a regulatory impact assessment. The results and conclusions from this work should be available in a little over two years from now.
<P>

<a name="11123w07.html_para2">Additionally, the housing health and safety rating system, which we propose should replace the housing fitness standard, includes guidance in respect of hazards from fire.

 I am today publishing proposals to give local authorities discretion to reduce or end the council tax discounts which owners of second and long- term empty homes currently receive.
<P>

<a name="11123w07.html_para5">The Government's proposals are set out in "Council Tax: a consultation paper on proposed changes for second homes and long-term empty homes". It fulfils the Government's commitment, made in the rural White Paper last year, to consult on this issue.
<P>

<a name="11123w07.html_para6">The Government are also seeking views on how the extra revenue raised should be used: whether it should be retained locally and whether it should be used for specific purposes such as housing. We are also proposing that councils should have the discretion to give council tax discounts for local reasons such as where homes are hit by flooding or in cases of individual hardship.
<P>

<a name="11123w07.html_para7">Our proposals would give local authorities the flexibility to choose the best option for their communities.
<P>

<a name="11123w07.html_para8">In some areas, second-home owners bring a much-needed boost to the local economy but, in other areas, a high demand for second homes is pricing local people out of the property market and undermining the viability of local services. Equally, homes left empty for long periods can blight local communities and encourage crime and antisocial behaviour. The proposals we are announcing today could be used to help encourage owners of empty homes to bring them back into use.
<P>

<a name="11123w07.html_para9">More than half a million properties which are no one's main residence currently receive a 50 per cent. council tax discount. Over half of these are long-term empty properties. Potentially, up to &#163;200 million could be raised in England by ending the council tax discounts on second and long-term empty homes.

 I believe my right hon. Friend may be referring to two Challenger 2 tank gun barrels used for test firing depleted uranium (DU) ammunition at the Kirkcudbright training area, but stored at the QinetiQ Eskmeals range. These were transferred on 6 November to the firing range at Shoeburyness, for test firing of non-DU ammunition, to support a Challenger 2 tank safety trial to determine acceptable limits of gun barrel erosion. The transfer was carried out by QinetiQ. A risk assessment by the radiation protection adviser showed that the levels of DU in the two barrels were so low and the DU so inaccessible that the material is not a radioactive substance within the meaning of the Ionising Radiation Regulations. These are the regulations that protect workers and members of the public who maybe exposed to ionising radiation and radioactive material from work activities.

<P>
<a name="11123w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2001]:</i> The farm scale evaluation (FSE) trials of GM crops are separated from neighbouring compatible crops to protect them from the effects of wind-blown pollen. The separation distances depend on the type of crop and should ensure that, at the closest separation, cross- pollination does not exceed a maximum of 1 per cent. In practice, it will generally be below that level. The separation distances are greater in relation to organic crops than they are for ordinary, conventional crops. I am not aware of any instance where an FSE trial has affected the status of an organic crop. We want to maintain that position for the remainder of the FSE programme and are therefore keeping the separation distances under review. The general issue of the terms on which GM and non-GM crops might co-exist is one that the Government want to resolve before there is any question of commercial GM planting. This is not just a scientific issue, but one of public acceptability.

meeting of the conference of the parties (COP6) to the convention on biological diversity, to be held in April 2002 in The Hague.
<P>

<a name="11123w09.html_para3">Most attention was focused on forest biological diversity, where SBSTTA proposed a comprehensive programme of further work.

It will include the impact of the unsustainable harvesting of non-timber forest resources, such as bushmeat.
<P>

<a name="11123w09.html_para4">Other recommendations included proposals for a global strategy for plant conservation and an international initiative for the conservation and sustainable use of pollinators. Technical advice was prepared on the use of incentive measures to secure the objectives of the convention; incorporating biodiversity considerations into environmental impact assessment; and designing monitoring programmes and indicators to measure the state of biodiversity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 A report produced for the Department earlier this year estimated that current UK emissions from abandoned coal mines are likely to be in the range of 20 to 300 kilo tonnes. The upper end of this range is equivalent to around 11 per cent. of the UK's total current methane emissions, or about 1 per cent. of UK greenhouse gas emissions as a whole. The emissions estimate is highly uncertain and we plan to carry out further work to gain a better understanding of the estimate, including the amount of gas that is in practice emitted and the potential for reducing these emissions by, for example, using the methane for electricity generation. I am aware that this Department, the Department for Trade and Industry and HM Treasury have been in discussion with the Association of Coal Mine Methane Operators about how the Government could help projects that use coal mine methane to generate electricity.

 In England, the Environment Agency's general quality assessment (GQA) scheme classifies water quality in rivers and canals. Chemical quality, the most widely used measure, is assessed on the basis of biochemical oxygen demand and concentrations of dissolved oxygen and ammonia. Stretches of rivers and canals are assigned as good, fair, poor or bad based on different degrees of chemical quality. Results from 1996 until 2000, the latest year for which figures are available, are as follows:

 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2001]:</i> The estimates of the number of fuel poor in England are based on data from the English house condition survey. Due to the nature of the survey, it is not possible to estimate the number of fuel poor within individual areas such as the Isle of Wight. The latest available information suggests that for the whole south-east Government office region, there were an estimated 270,000 households in fuel poverty in 1998.

 <i>[holding answer 20 November 2001]:</i> We usually consider a "pollution incident" as an event in which high or very high air pollution has been monitored. The Department of Health's Committee on the effects of air pollution (COMEAP) has defined levels of high air pollution. They advise that during such episodes significant effects may be noticed by sensitive individuals and action to avoid or reduce these effects may be needed (e.g. reducing exposure by spending less time in polluted areas outdoors). During episodes of very high pollution the effects on sensitive individuals described for high levels of pollution may worsen. The pollution thresholds adopted by COMEAP are shown as follows.

 The Government maintain close links with the insurance industry to help ensure continued availability of affordable flood cover. There is an agreement among Association of British Insurers (ABI) member companies that they will continue to provide flood cover, except in exceptional circumstances, for domestic properties and small businesses which they currently insure, during 2001 and 2002. Cases where there is an alleged breach of this agreement have been referred by DEFRA to the ABI for investigation. However, it must be recognised that insurance companies need to take a commercial decision as to what risk they will cover and on what terms. Also, the insurance industry is a competitive one and customers may need to shop around to obtain the best deal.
<P>

<a name="11123w10.html_para8">My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and I met the ABI on 5 September to discuss our mutual aim of ensuring that affordable flood insurance cover continues to be generally available after December 2002.

<a name="11123w10.html_para9">Together with the flood defence operating authorities, we are reducing the risk of flooding and are communicating this to the insurance industry.

Flood defences are being repaired, renewed, maintained and improved. Flood warning arrangements are continually being improved. The Government have issued strengthened guidance to local planning authorities on control of development in flood risk areas, and are reviewing the financial and institutional arrangements under which the flood defence service is delivered.

 The UK supported United Nations Security Council resolution 1359, which was passed unanimously on 29 June 2001. This reiterated full support for the on-going efforts of MINURSO to implement the settlement plan and the agreements by the parties to hold a free, fair and impartial referendum for the self- determination of the people of western Sahara.

The personal envoy of the Secretary-General is currently engaged in an attempt to resolve the dispute. The special envoy is discussing with the parties the draft framework agreement (as set out in the United Nations Secretary- General's report of June 2001) which may offer a mutually agreed political solution to the dispute. He has also discussed with the Polisario their proposals to overcome the obstacles faced in the settlement plan.

<P>
<a name="11123w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The oil for food programme is the UN's largest humanitarian programme ever, worth some $12.5 billion last year alone. In his most recent report (September 2001), the UN Secretary-General concludes that the oil for food programme has made a considerable difference to the lives of ordinary Iraqis and, in spreading beyond the food and medicine sectors, to the rehabilitation of Iraq's civilian infrastructure.
<P>

<a name="11123w12.html_para2">These achievements have been made despite the continuing efforts of the Iraqi regime to hamper the oil for food programme. For example, around $2 billion of funds lie unspent by Iraq in UN accounts and the Iraqi Central Bank consistently holds up the delivery of around $1 billion-worth of goods. Iraq continues to refuse to allow UN officials to enter Iraq to discuss a cash component for sectors identified by the UN Secretary- General as being critical, such as health, education and water and sanitation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We regularly receive parliamentary and public correspondence on all aspects of sanctions on Iraq, including the water and sanitation sector.
<P>

<a name="11123w12.html_para3">Since 1990, the UK has donated over &#163;100 million of humanitarian aid to Iraq (including &#163;5.5 million this year) for projects which include the rehabilitation of water and sanitation infrastructure. In addition, earlier this year the EU agreed a 13 million euro aid package for projects which include the provision of clean drinking water.
<P>

<a name="11123w12.html_para4">By contrast, the Iraqi regime continues to hamper all aspects of the oil for food programme. At a time when around $2 billion lies unspent by Iraq in the UN escrow account, Iraq has, for example, cut spending in this sector by 18 per cent. in 2001 compared to last year. Iraq continues to refuse to allow UN officials to enter Iraq to discuss a cash component for sectors identified by the UN Secretary-General as being critical, one of which is water and sanitation.

 The Government are committed to the development of sport and increasing opportunities for participation throughout the country. The strategy for sport&#151;"A Sporting Future for All"&#151;and the Government's plan for sport set out an action plan on how we intend to achieve those objectives. Responsibility for developing grassroots sport at the regional level rests with a number of organisations including Sport England, local authorities, local education authorities, schools, sports governing bodies, sports clubs, volunteers, and in order to ensure the best use of resources it is essential that all these interests work in partnership.
<P>

<a name="11123w13.html_para0">In the east midlands, the regional sports board is providing leadership and direction to this work and in close co-operation with Sport England has engaged the main partners in developing the Region's sporting infrastructure and planning for the future.

 The new opportunities fund will, by 2006, commit &#163;50 million to projects that are designed to develop renewable electricity generation by building generating capacity for electricity from energy crops, build offshore wind electricity generation projects and develop small-scale biomass heat/combined heat and power projects. Of this &#163;50 million, at least &#163;33 million should be committed to developing renewable electricity generation by building generating capacity for electricity from energy crops, at least &#163;10 million should be committed to building offshore wind electricity generation projects and at least &#163;3 million to small-scale biomass heat/combined heat and power projects.

 Grant applications for the New Opportunities for PE and sport programme will be assessed in two stages. At stage one, Sport England will provide support and advice to local organisations to help the development of strategies and portfolios of projects. These applications will then be assessed by the new opportunities for PE and sport committee for England, two of whose members are full board members of Sport England. The fund and Sport England are currently discussing how best Sport England can provide support at the second stage of the application process.

 My Department's funding for competitive sport is provided through the lottery-funded world class programme, administered by the Sports Councils: UK Sport and Sport England.
<P>

<a name="11123w14.html_para0">The Sports Councils expect to provide funding of over &#163;50 million in 2001&#150;02 to this programme and over &#163;40 million has already been committed for the year 2002&#150;03 with further awards anticipated. There was no lottery expenditure for the world class programme in 1996&#150;97.

<a name="11123w14.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 On 21 February 2000, the Government announced their conclusions on the recommendations of the independent review panel on the future funding of the BBC. In addition to a range of measures designed to improve BBC efficiency and accountability, the Government introduced a new funding formula providing for changes in the licence fee of RPI plus 1.5 per cent. for each year from 2000&#150;01 to 2006&#150;07. This formula will enable the BBC to provide a strong and distinctive schedule of high quality programmes and remain at the forefront of broadcasting technology.
<P>

<a name="11123w14.html_para1">Application of the RPI figure of 1.7 per cent. for the year to September 2001, plus 1.5 per cent., to the current unrounded licence fees produces new rounded totals of &#163;112.00 for a colour licence and &#163;37.50 for a black and white licence. The necessary regulations to bring these fees into force will be laid before the House in due course.

 The figures for all years from 1992 are set out in the table. The figures show that there has been sustained growth in contributions to non-state pensions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, pursuant to his answer of 19 July 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 418W, on the Benefits Agency Medical Services, what contract targets have been laid down; and what his assessment is of the performance of SchlumbergerSema measured against these targets.

<a name="11123w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The contract with SchlumbergerSema contains numerous targets relating to the volume, timeliness, and quality of medical reports; to customer service standards; and to training of doctors. The Government set four targets, relating to quality, training, and customer service, in their response [Cm 4780] to the Social Security Select Committee's report on medical services.

<P>

<a name="11123w15.html_para4">In June 2000, in order to promote improved benefit administration in local authorities, the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate produced a good practice guide, a copy of which was issued to each local authority. This is based on tried and tested practice in better-performing authorities. The guide includes a section on overpayment recovery, covering the prevention and identification of overpayments as well as options for recovery.
<P>

<a name="11123w15.html_para5">In June 2001 we introduced streamlined procedures for local authorities to recover housing benefit overpayments from prescribed social security benefits administered by the Benefits Agency. These procedures apply in cases where housing benefit is no longer in payment. Local authorities have been given guidance about the types of cases they should refer and new simplified referral forms have been introduced.
<P>

<a name="11123w15.html_para6">The new procedures ensure that both the Benefits Agency and local authorities are operating standard referral and recovery procedures. They also provide tighter control of the recovery process and are being actively monitored to ensure their effectiveness.

 The Prison Service race relations policy highlights the importance of prisons being aware of the needs of non-English speaking prisoners. To assist in meeting those needs, all prisons were issued with copies of the prisoner information books (Male Prisoners and Young Offenders, Women Prisoners and Female Young Offenders, Visiting and Keeping in Touch and Life Sentenced Prisoners "Lifers"). The books were issued in partnership with the Prison Reform Trust and are available in 21 languages (including English). Updated versions are currently being considered.
<P>

<a name="11123w17.html_para0">The appropriate translation services required for necessary communication with non-English-speaking prisoners is the responsibility of individual establishments. Each establishment has differing demands and needs for such services and establishments are advised to draw up and maintain details of local arrangements. The services are paid for locally.
<P>

<a name="11123w17.html_para1">Following negotiations with the Immigration Service, all prison establishments have access to the register of interpreters. Several of these interpreters also provide translation services. The Immigration Service also has a contract with K International which the Prison Service may approach for written translations. There is a National Register of Public Service Interpreters, which maintains a consistent and adequate standard.
<P>

<a name="11123w17.html_para2">Public documents produced by the National Probation Service (NPS) are translated into Welsh, and other languages as considered necessary. Some core materials (such as leaflets for offenders) are translated into the six languages where demand is greatest (Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Punjabi, Spanish and Welsh). Design, print and translation services for the NPS headquarters are provided via the Home Office Communication Directorate (under contract with K International). Translation services for the operational needs of the Staffordshire area of the NPS come from established local suppliers and are paid for locally.

 Grendon and Springhill prisons are co-located and Home Office reconviction rates for the two establishments are not recorded separately.
<P>

<a name="11123w17.html_para5">The latest two-year reconviction rates for prisoners discharged from custody cover the calendar year 1997. The two-year reconviction rate for prisoners discharged from Grendon and Springhill prisons was 29 per cent. This compares with a predicted reconviction rate, based on factors which take account of the previous criminal history, age distribution, and offence of the prisoners discharged, of 32 per cent. For all prisoners, the two-year reconviction rate was 58 per cent.
<P>

<a name="11123w17.html_para6">The findings from a seven-year reconviction study of prisoners who went to Grendon prison for therapy in the years 1984 to 1989 revealed that prisoners treated there had lower reconviction rates than had been expected had they not gone to Grendon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w17.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 In May 1999, the trustees of the Christian organisation, Kainos, sought the Prison Service's agreement to its continuing the operation of Kainos communities in the wings of four prisons. This followed financial and other difficulties with a predecessor organisation, Kairos-Apac. The Prison Service management board agreed in September 1999 that these communities should be permitted to continue, without any commitment of public funds and for a limited period, while they were evaluated for their impact, and in particular their claim to contribute to reducing reoffending. The evaluation was to be done by independent researchers and paid for by Kainos. The board would reach a decision on the future of the programme in the light of the evaluation.
<P>

<a name="11123w17.html_para7">The independent evaluation was completed in September 2001. The Kainos trustees provided the board with a copy of the evaluation report and asked the board to take an early decision on the future of the programme because Kainos' own funding for the programme ceased at the end of 2001.




<P>
<P><I>23 Nov 2001 : Column: 545W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11123w17.html_para8">Among other matters, the evaluation examined the one year reconviction rates of prisoners who had been through the Kainos programme and a comparison group of nearly 14,000 prisoners with similar sentence lengths and from similar prisons. The evaluation report found that there was no basis for concluding that Kainos community prisoners have reconviction rates that are significantly lower than would be expected for similar released prisoners as a whole. This contrasts with other Prison Service programmes designed to reduce reoffending which typically show reductions of 10 per cent. in future reoffending against expected rates.
<P>

<a name="11123w17.html_para9">In the light of this finding, the board decided that the Kainos community should no longer continue to operate in prisons when its present programmes came to an end. The board also had concerns about exposing prisoners to intensive religiously based interventions in prison by any faith group. The board has made it clear that it respects the commitment of the Kainos trustees, and of the staff and volunteers who gave their time to the programmes, but it is determined that effort and scarce resources in prisons are devoted only to offender treatment programmes which can demonstrate their effectiveness, and which contribute to the Government's crime reduction agenda.

<a name="11123w18.html_para0">Cycling on the pavement was made a fixed-penalty offence from 1 August 1999. This gives the police a direct and simple way of dealing with cyclists who use the pavement without proper consideration for others.

 I have no such plans. The current maximum penalty for dangerous cycling is a fine not exceeding &#163;2,500. The maximum penalty for careless and inconsiderate cycling, and for cycling when unfit through drink or drugs, is a fine not exceeding &#163;1,000. Unauthorised or irregular cycle racing or trials of speed on public ways is also an offence and carries a maximum penalty of &#163;200. We believe that these penalties are sufficient and reflect the seriousness of the offences.

These are not formal pilots as they must operate within the current legislation and therefore are not able completely to replicate the provision proposed for the new system. The evaluation reports of each will be produced at different times but initial feedback is expected next spring.

<P>
<a name="11123w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The kiosk in Telford, Shropshire&#151;which provides information about the Court Service&#151;is a partnership venture between the courts, the local council, the library and the university of Wolverhampton. The equipment is provided by the council's IT supplier and the content supplied by the Court Service's in-house web publishing team. There is therefore no additional cost to the Court Service.

<P>
<a name="11123w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The cost of the Preston e-mail application service in 2001&#150;02 is nominal as the initial outlay for equipment and installation was met in 2000&#150;01. In 2000&#150;01 the costs were &#163;72,495, of which &#163;65,243 were the costs of the computers and the e-mail connection; the balance related to various project related costs.

<a name="11123w19.html_para0">The on-going running costs of this project include line charges for the e-mail modem, and staff and project management costs which are included in the court's overall running costs. The e-mail service allows the court to process applications by solicitors more efficiently than the paper based service, and therefore is delivering some efficiency savings, although these have yet to be quantified.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) in 1998 required the Lord Chancellor to set a target by 31 March 1999 for an increase in the proportion of service delivery transactions provided to the public electronically. We published our initial e-business strategy in November 2000 and set an annual target that was the equivalent to the government-wide target for electronic service delivery at that time. The CSR target was that 25 per cent. of service delivery transactions should be capable of being delivered electronically by 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what progress has been made in implementing the principles behind the European Charter for Small Enterprises in the United Kingdom.  [13682]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w21.html_spnew0"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The UK is firmly committed to a full implementation of the European Charter for Small Enterprises. We believe that since its adoption in June 2000 useful progress has been made in the United Kingdom under all 10 lines for action contained in the charter. Recent examples include proposals for the revision of company law, proposals for the reform of competition rules and insolvency law, continuing action under the UK online for business initiative, and the opening of the 'smallbusinesseurope' office in Brussels. Details of these and many other relevant UK actions can be found in a recent report provided to the European Commission, entitled "The European Charter for Small Enterprises&#151;A Review of relevant actions and measures in force in the United Kingdom". Copies of this report have been placed in the Library of the House. At a wider European level, the UK co-organised with the European Commission a conference on top-class business support services in Cardiff in October.
<P>

<a name="11123w21.html_para0">While we believe that real progress has been made in some areas, we recognise that more needs to be done if we are to meet our own and the EU's goals for creating 



<P>

the best possible environment for small firms. We will continue therefore to take action which will help us and encourage our European partners to achieve these goals.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w21.html_wqn1"><B> Brian Cotter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the principle embodied in the European Charter for Small Enterprises relating to the exemption of small enterprises from certain regulatory obligations.  [13683]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w21.html_spnew1"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The Government agree with the principle embodied in the European Charter for Small Enterprises that legislative simplification can help reduce the burden of compliance for small business. In the UK the approach has been to adopt "Think Small First" principles&#151;all those considering regulation must first consider alternatives to regulation as well as whether exemptions for small firms are appropriate, the case for exemptions for small firms from regulatory obligations is then made on a case by case basis.
<P>

<a name="11123w21.html_para1">Exemptions for small enterprises from certain regulatory obligations can be a useful way of reducing burdens on business e.g. on audit thresholds, the requirement to consult on redundancies, the need to have works councils and most recently the draft Information and Consultation Directive. There are a range of regulations, such as those relating to food safety, the national minimum wage, environmental protection and health and safety where this is less likely to be appropriate (because of the need to safeguard the rights of employees and protect consumers) and may in fact create a barrier to growth for small firms.

 Interim payments are made in a wide range of circumstances and vary widely in value. Claimants who are in receipt of the Industrial Injuries Benefit, PD D12, automatically receive an interim payment of &#163;2,000. Further interims are offered where an expedited offer is made to a claimant, who subsequently rejects the offer and elects to undergo the full Medical Assessment Process or MAP.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps are taken to ensure that beef imported from other countries, from which spinal cord tissue has not been removed, is safe.  [16284]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 20 November 2001]:</i> Where consignments of imported carcase beef are found with spinal cord still attached, and the age of the animals at slaughter or the countries of origin of the consignment means that such spinal cord is defined as specified risk material, the whole of the carcase or part carcase containing the spinal cord is detained and destroyed and is not permitted to enter the human food or animal food chains.

<a name="11123w26.html_para2">To date, 29 per cent. of acute hospitals and 23 per cent. of mental health hospitals have begun to introduce the service (although not necessarily across all wards). Because there are local variations in how services are organised, we do not have data on the number of housekeepers in post. However, the latest figures provided by trusts to National Health Service Estates indicate that of the 9,000 wards within England, 2,266 have a housekeeping service.

 <i>[holding answer 22 November 2001]:</i> The primary objective of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) is to safeguard public health by ensuring that all medicines on the UK market meet appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy. A marketing authorisation is granted when the balance of risks and benefits is considered to be favourable in the proposed indication.
<P>

<a name="11123w27.html_para0">The MCA continually monitors the safety of all medicines using a number of data sources with expert advice from the independent scientific advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines. If there is evidence that the balance of risks and benefits is no longer favourable, regulatory action may be taken to minimise risk. This may include strengthening warnings, restricting the terms of the marketing authorisation, or in appropriate circumstances its revocation. Such regulatory action is pursued with the Medicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisations Etc.) Regulation, SI 1994 No. 3144 and relevant European Community obligations.
<P>

<a name="11123w27.html_para1">Spontaneous reporting data, which are collated by the MCA/CSM through the yellow card scheme, can be used to compare the safety profiles of medicines within a drug class. However, these comparisons must be evaluated with care, as levels of reporting of adverse reactions for particular drugs are dependent on a number of factors including the usage of the drug and the length of time it has been on the market.

 <i>[holding answer 22 November 2001]:</i> Clauses 1 to 4 of the Bill prepare for the structural changes to the national health service. The 95 health authorities will be replaced by about 28 strategic health authorities; the eight regional offices of the Department will be abolished; and primary care trusts will be the key organisations undertaking an increased range of functions. &#163;100 million is to be saved resulting from these changes: a combination not just of savings in management, but from a reduction in infrastructure and increases in shared services.

 <i>[holding</i> <i>answer 22 November 2001]:</i> People are the most important resource and we will be working to ensure that we make the best use of time offered by lay volunteers in the health service. Patients forums will, of course, require support in terms of human and financial resources for their work, which will be provided by the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health through its local networks. Funding is therefore tied into the overall resource requirements for the commission and the new arrangements collectively, which we are discussing with Her Majesty's Treasury as part of the spending review process.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what steps he has taken to reduce the levels of irrecoverable VAT incurred by the British Tourist Authority in the current financial year; and if he will make a statement.  [18434]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w27.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The BTA was awarded &#163;14.2 million of additional funding this year to take forward its recovery plan to boost inbound tourism in the wake of the foot and mouth outbreak. Concern was raised in July that this would lead to the BTA incurring irrecoverable VAT on purchases relating to this programme.
<P>

<a name="11123w27.html_para7">The BTA estimated the irrecoverable VAT would be around &#163;600,000. However, HM Customs and Excise has now reached an agreement with the BTA to allow an increase in VAT recovery to achieve a fair and reasonable result within the existing rules. The agreement addresses the impact of foot and mouth disease upon all of BTA's work, not just the elements funded by extra grant in aid. As a result of this agreement, the BTA estimates that the level of irrecoverable VAT incurred on goods and services purchased as part of its tourism recovery programme has now been reduced by between &#163;300,000 and &#163;500,000.
<P>

<a name="11123w27.html_para8">This agreement ensures that as much as possible of the BTA's grant-in-aid and extra funding will go directly towards helping inbound tourism to recover from a particularly difficult year, while complying with the tax laws which apply to all organisations buying goods and services.

 The UK co-operates with the other member states in several European forums to discuss tax matters, and it does so with our national commitment to sustainable development very much to the fore.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11123w28.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 All imports of aggregate will be subject to the aggregates levy. Exports of aggregate from the UK will not be subject to the levy. This will protect the international competitiveness of the UK's quarrying industry.
<P>

<a name="11123w28.html_para2">There is not expected to be significant impact on the concrete products sector generally because international trade in these products is limited by weight and transport costs.
