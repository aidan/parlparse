<a name="91111w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Chaytor: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what is the total number of vehicles used by his Department and its agencies fuelled by <i>(a)</i> petrol, <i>(b)</i> diesel and <i>(c)</i> liquid petroleum gas; and what plans he has to increase the rate of conversion of those vehicles to liquid petroleum gas.  [98204]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 In total, The Lord Chancellor's Department uses 40 petrol fuelled vehicles (including four from the Government Car Service) and 594 diesel fuelled vehicles. The Department does not use any liquid petroleum gas vehicles.
<P>

<a name="91111w01.htm_para0">We continue to keep abreast of developments in the use of liquid petroleum gas but the availability of this fuel is currently still prohibitive.
<P>

<a name="91111w01.htm_para1">Decisions on fuel conversion will be made in light of the best environmental advice available and in accordance with our Green Transport Plan.

<P>
<a name="91111w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Chaytor: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans he has to set targets for the recycling of waste <i>(a)</i> paper, <i>(b)</i> cardboard, <i>(c)</i> glass, <i>(d)</i> metal, <i>(e)</i> plastic and <i>(f)</i> other products created by his Department and its agencies; and if he will make a statement.  [98227]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 My Department's approach to waste management is based on recovery, reduce and re-use as the preferred options for minimising waste sent to landfill. This should help us to achieve the Green Ministers' target for Government Departments of recovering a minimum of 40 per cent. of total office waste, with at least 25 per cent. of that recovery coming from recycling or composting, in 2000-01. Our own corporate target is to establish a baseline figure for the amount of waste produced by the end of March 2000. We have no set individual targets for paper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastic or other materials. Our associate bodies have been encouraged to adopt the target I have set as Green Minister.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans he has for a comprehensive review of the Criminal Justice System; and if he will make a statement.  [98102]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor is considering the desirability of a major review of the criminal courts and will make an announcement in due course.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what his Department's procedure is for appointing General Commissioners of Taxation; and for what period his committee on appointments of General Commissioners of Taxation has been without a chairman.  [98101]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The procedure for the appointment of General Commissioners of Income Tax is set out in the Lord Chancellor's Directions for Advisory Committees on General Commissioners of Income Tax, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House. Mr. Hugh Wyatt, the Lord-Lieutenant of West Sussex, became the Chairman of the local Advisory Committee on 1 September 1999 in succession to Mr. Nigel Ventham who retired on that day.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w01.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Garnier: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what the cost was of the reorganisation of London's magistrates courts, pursuant to the Access to Justice Act 1999; and how many permanent jobs will be <i>(a)</i> lost or <i>(b)</i> created within the court service by virtue of the reorganisation.  [98139]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The reorganisation of the Magistrates Courts Committees in London is still at an early stage of implementation. It is therefore not possible to provide a costing at this stage. Issues such as redundancy or the creation of new posts will be for the new Greater London Magistrates Courts Authority to determine.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w01.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many legal aid franchises for the provision of advice in immigration and nationality cases have been created in the North East Region; and how many cases it is estimated these franchises will take up.  [97968]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 There are currently 26 solicitors' offices within the North East Region covered by the Legal Aid Board's Newcastle and Leeds area offices that either hold a legal aid franchise for immigration or are in the process of obtaining one. These solicitors' offices submitted bills for 1,150 immigration advice and assistance cases in the 12 month period 1 June 1998 to 31 May 1999. Additionally, there is a Not-for-Profit advice agency that holds an immigration franchise in the Leeds area, and is contracted to provide 1,100 hours case work per annum. The proposed contract awards for next year have not yet been agreed, but will be sent to contractors shortly.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will identify, for each of the last three years, <i>(a)</i> the 10 sets of chambers with the highest number of judicial appointments, <i>(b)</i> the number of appointments from those chambers broken down by reference to judicial rank and <i>(c)</i> the total number of judicial appointments in each year, broken down by judicial rank.

 The following details have been obtained about appointments to the Circuit Bench and above. Details of appointments below Circuit Bench level would require extensive searching through individual records and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="91111w01.htm_para2">In 1996-97 there were two appointments from the chambers of Mr. Anthony Boswood QC at Fountain Court, London (one High Court Judge and One Circuit Judge) and two each from the chambers of Mr. Guy Boney QC at 3 Pump Court, London, the chambers of Mr. Keith Armitage QC at 8 King Street, Manchester and the chambers of Mr. James Stewart QC and Mr. Robert Smith QC at Park Court Chambers Leeds (all to the Circuit Bench).

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You recently asked the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions which road schemes satisfied the initial sift criteria announced on 22 March and for clarification of the criteria for undertaking the study in greater depth to determine whether practicable and cost-effective mitigation can be provided for road schemes that meet the initial sift criteria and the timescale for these studies.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The criteria for undertaking detailed studies are as announced to Parliament on 22 March. The majority of studies are expected to be completed by the end of this year. In cases where a road surface has recently been or is about to be replaced in order to meet an operational need, we use a quieter surface wherever possible, which normally provides substantial relief of the problem. In these cases, detailed studies have been deferred for three years in order to better target the available resources.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The attached list shows the locations where previous concerns about noise had been expressed which were found to satisfy the criteria announced on 22 March. Locations where studies have been deferred because of the use of quiet surfacing have been marked with an asterisk.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I trust that this information is helpful, although I must point out that the order of appearance of a location on the list does not in any way indicate its priority nor imply that mitigation measures will be provided in every case following the detailed studies.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 November 1999]:</i> It would be unwise to make an estimate from a single year. However, in view of the increases in maintenance funding that the Government have provided, I would expect that over the next few years the deteriorating trend in the published indices will start to be reversed.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when the Highways Agency will achieve a position of steady state maintenance on the bridges and other structures on the motorway and trunk road network in England; and what he expects will be the annual expenditure requirement to maintain that position once it is achieved.  [97068]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 November 1999]:</i> The Highways Agency has an ongoing programme of works to ensure all structures are safe and serviceable. The underlying maintenance regime already reflects a steady state position for the Highways Agency's bridges and other structures. In addition, there are programmes of targeted works from time to time to address safety and other issues. Currently there is still a small backlog of maintenance being tackled for rehabilitation of some of the older structures that do not fully meet modern standards.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what quantities of plutonium contaminated waste have been created to date in the production of MOX fuel for export at Sellafield; and what arrangements exist for the storage or disposal of plutonium contaminated radioactive wastes from MOX production.  [97453]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w03.htm_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="91111w03.htm_para0">Details of total plutonium contaminated waste arisings at Sellafield to date are provided in the 1998 UK Radioactive Waste Inventory which was published in July 1999. I understand from BNFL that, to date, around 80 200-litre drums of plutonium contaminated material can be attributed to the operation of the MOX Demonstration Facility at Sellafield. It is not possible to identify how much of this total amount is attributable to the production of MOX for export.
<P>

<a name="91111w03.htm_para1">I understand that plutonium contaminated material at Sellafield will be compacted, and then encapsulated, prior to storage and ultimate disposal in an intermediate level waste facility. The latter will be subject to a consultation which my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment announced on 25 October.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the proportion of car owners who use motorways less than once a month; and what proportion never use motorways.  [97907]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w03.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The main source of information on travel patterns of car drivers, and others, is the National Travel Survey which does not identify use by road type. For the general population, the 1997 Road User Satisfaction Study, commissioned by the Highways Agency, showed that 22 per cent. of respondents had not used a motorway in the previous year and a further 34 per cent. had used a motorway less than once a month.
<P>

<a name="91111w03.htm_para2">In terms of total car traffic, measured in vehicle miles, around 17 per cent. was on motorways in 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his press release of 5 November, concerning GM crops, if he will list the plantings of farm-scale trials of GM crops subject to the voluntary agreement which he expects to agree between now and 2002, indicating the crops to be planted, when they are to be planted, what acreage is required for each, what separation distances will be used for each and how long after harvest he estimates the environmental effects of each crop will be completely evaluated.  [98109]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w03.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 GM fodder maize and spring and winter oil seed rape, all modified for herbicide tolerance, are the three crops currently in the farm-scale evaluations. Subject to the advice of the independent Scientific Steering Committee, a fourth crop, herbicide tolerant beet (sugar/fodder), may be included in the farm-scale evaluations from next year. Plantings for the farm-scale evaluations are limited to 20-25 fields per crop per year, each field being 5-10 ha in size (approx. 13-25 acres), subject to the advice and requirements of the Scientific Steering Committee. Plantings covered by this agreement will take place during the three years 2000, 2001 and 2002. Separation distances are defined by the terms of the individual consents and the SCIMAC guidelines, and are currently 50 m for oil seed rape and maize, and 200 m for registered organic crops. The Government will ask the Scientific Steering Committee to review data from the farm-scale evaluations and provide recommendations/ advice by end-October 2002. For winter oil seed rape, for which the third year harvest will be summer 2003, the Government will ask the Scientific Steering Committee to complete analysis and reporting of results in time for Autumn 2003 plantings to take place should the null hypothesis be confirmed.

<a name="91111w04.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 November 1999]:</i> Safety is, and must remain, at the heart of London Underground Ltd.'s (LUL) operations. LUL continuously monitors safety performance, including signals passed at danger (SPADs) and reports such incidents to HMRI.
<P>

<a name="91111w04.htm_para0">The hon. Member will wish to be aware that all LUL trains have a form of Automatic Train Protection (ATP) which has been in operation for many years. Although SPADs do occur on the Underground, trains are brought to a safe halt because of the ATP system.
<P>

<a name="91111w04.htm_para1">I will arrange for LUL to place in the Commons Library a monthly report on SPADs on the Underground.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w04.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 There is international research which has found that the distraction may impact on safety. We therefore strongly discourage the use of mobile phones while driving. However, on the basis of current UK data it is not possible to estimate the number of deaths and injuries attributable solely to the use of mobile phones while driving.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w04.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In measuring waiting times for a driving test, the Driving Standards Agency does not differentiate between those who are presenting themselves for their first test or for a further attempt. Driving tests can now be obtained nationally in around 6 weeks. This compares with an annual national average waiting time of 6.6 weeks for the year 1994-95.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w04.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 This Department does not currently operate specific programmes for the installation of smoke alarms. However the New Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES) will include the provision of a smoke alarm in the homes of low-income over-60s households where a central heating system is installed. The installations will begin in June 2000 and it is expected that about 55,000 central heating systems will be installed by 2002.

<P>

<a name="91111w04.htm_para2">Part I of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 also allows for local authorities to provide grants towards the cost of fire precaution works. Home repair assistance may be available to people who are elderly, disabled, infirm or in receipt of income related benefit for works of up to &#163;2,000.
<P>

<a name="91111w04.htm_para3">Since 1992, Building Regulations have required all new dwellings in England and Wales to have a smoke alarm installed. This move, together with the Government's wider publicity and educational efforts, has helped to raise smoke alarm ownership to the current level of 82 per cent. of all households.

 <i>[holding answer 10 November 1999]:</i> It is not possible to give a precise estimate on the extent of unlicensed driving. In order to get more comprehensive and reliable information on this subject, the DETR has just let a 2&#189; year contract to study this area and to examine the implications.

 Photocard driving licences have been issued by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency since July 1998.

 <i>[holding answer 10 November 1999]:</i> The DETR has recently carried out its latest large scale survey of Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) evasion across the UK for all vehicle tax classes, the results of which will be published early next year. The last major survey in 1994 estimated that around 1.5 million vehicles in Great Britain did not have an up to date tax disc.
<P>

<a name="91111w05.htm_para1">We are committed to tackling the problem of VED evasion and have introduced a number of measures to end this, including a national scheme to wheel-clamp and impound unlicensed vehicles seen on a public road.
<P>

<a name="91111w05.htm_para2">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) holds details of the registered keeper of vehicles within its vehicle record database. At the end of June 1999, there were 327,640 cases out of some 28 million where the DVLA did not have the details of the registered keeper of a licensed vehicle. It is not possible to tell the number of cases for which this has been so for more than one month without running a prohibitively expensive scan of the database.
<P>

 The Department has received many letters, from Members of Parliament and others, about cable activities. However, since the last General Election only one representation has been received from a local authority.
<P>

<a name="91111w05.htm_para4">In residential areas and elsewhere, cable-laying in the street is subject to the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991. Undertakers must give advance notice of works and co-operate with the local highway authority. Failure to do so can attract penalties. There is a duty to avoid unnecessary delay or obstruction of the street, and the street authority can direct the timing of street works in order to avoid or reduce traffic disruption, and restrict street works activity for a period of twelve months following the completion of highway works.

 My Department's approach to waste management is based on the three "R"s: with "Recovery" (i.e. recycling, composting and energy recovery) following "Reduce" and "Re-use" as the preferred options for reducing waste sent to landfill. This should help us to achieve: the Green Ministers' target for Government Departments of recovering a minimum of 40 per cent. of total office waste, with at least 25 per cent. of that recovery coming from recycling or composting, in 2000-01; and our own corporate target which is to increase the amount recovered and recycled by 10 per cent. each year to achieve 70 per cent. recovery or recycling in 2003-04. The Department has not set individual targets for paper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastic and other materials although work is underway on setting a target for paper.

 The UK's series of 340 candidate Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) was considered with those of seven other member states at a scientific seminar in Kilkee on 6-8 September 1999. The meeting indicated that a number of habitat features, including four sand dune types, were insufficiently represented in the UK and other member state's SAC series. Duneland habitats are already afforded protection through their status as designated nationally or internationally important sites (SSSIs, candidate SACs, Ramsar sites and Special Protection Areas etc.). Furthermore, as part of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, a priority habitat action plan for coastal sand dunes was published on 25 October.

Use of the bus lane varies from day to day and week to week. The highest measured flows were in the week commencing 18 October when Paddington Station was closed and averaged approximately 5000 vehicles per day. Measured peak hour flows were 60 buses and coaches, 10 minibuses and 370 taxis. The previous highest flow during a week was 4,300 vehicles per day. During the week commencing 25 October (the half term week for many schools) the average daily flow was approximately 4,000 vehicles, of which 500 were buses or coaches, 90 were minibuses and 3,400 were taxis. In this week the typical peak hour flow included 35 buses or coaches, 8 minibuses and 220 taxis.
<BR>
Comprehensive traffic count data by vehicle type is not available for the period prior to the bus lane. Estimates based on sample counts before the bus lane was installed indicate hourly flows at peak times of up to 50 buses, coaches and minibuses and up to 350 taxis.
<BR>
Surveys carried out by the Transport Research Laboratory show that the average occupancy of buses and coaches to be 15, taxis to be 2.5 and other vehicles to be 1.2, all including the driver.
<BR>
The surveys have found no evidence that drivers have changed their journey routes to avoid the M4 since the bus lane was opened. The surveys have revealed that the observed maximum traffic flows on the elevated section of the M4 has increased by 10 per cent. since the opening of the Bus Lane.
<BR>
We are continuing to evaluate this pilot project but there are no plans at present to introduce variable speed limits or allow high-occupancy vehicles to use the bus lane.

 The Vehicle Inspectorate is confident from the negotiations which have taken place over the last 18 months that the contract for the computerised MOT service is robust and deliverable. The contract contains a number of safeguards building on the experience gained from other major projects. The project was awarded "significant" status in March 1998 by HM Treasury and there has been input throughout the procurement process from the Treasury Private Finance Initiative Taskforce. An independent review of the contract will be undertaken during the preferred bidding stage to provide a further level of assurance. The Vehicle Inspectorate will ensure that, should the service be unavailable for any reason on the expected service commencement date, MOT testing will be able to continue.

<a name="91111w08.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 BRE have today published a revised version of BR 211 "Radon: Guidance on Protective Measures for New Dwellings", which updates previously published guidance, details measures that must be incorporated in new buildings and defines the geographical areas where radon protection is necessary. The Approved Document to Part C of the Building Regulations 1991 refers to the BRE document as a source of advice on where radon protection may be needed and what new measures are appropriate.
<P>

<a name="91111w08.htm_para0">In addition to Cornwall and Devon and parts of Somerset, Northamptonshire and Derbyshire--which were covered in previous guidance--the new guidance identifies new areas where radon protection will be needed. These are parts of the Yorkshire Dales; parts of Wales and the Welsh Border; South Oxfordshire; parts of the Midlands adjacent to the currently delineated areas in Derbyshire; Northamptonshire; parts of Gloucestershire, the Lake District and Northumberland. There are also a few scattered areas in south-east England where these measures need to be applied.
<P>

<a name="91111w08.htm_para1">As well as the maps based on NRPB data, BR 211 contains a second set of maps based on the assessment of geological radon potential which has been prepared by the British Geological Survey. These maps show grid squares that are underlain, completely or in part, by geological units that potentially exceed the action level for either basic or full protection. The guidance explains how the two sets of maps should be used to determine the level of protection needed.

 I intend to take forward a statutory instrument so that from 8.00 pm on 31 December 1999 until 6.00 am on 1 January 2000 London taxi fares, including any extra charges to the standard tariff, should be double the total amount shown on the meter, up to a total metered fare of &#163;25. For total metered fares of over &#163;25, there should be added a flat rate supplement of &#163;25 to the total metered fare. The normal supplement of &#163;3 for New Year's Eve will not apply. Details of all these arrangements must be displayed in the vehicle.
<P>

<a name="91111w08.htm_para3">In reaching this decision I have taken account of representations from the London taxi trade, and the interests of the travelling public, both in having taxis available to them, and in having fares which are not unreasonable on this unique occasion. I believe these rates represent a sensible balance between making it worthwhile for drivers to work that night and protecting consumers from exorbitant charges.

Poster campaigns in July of 1998 and through 1999 were directed at all business communities. A "Last Chance Guide" was mailed to all UK businesses with 1-249 staff in September 1999 and a London regional campaign provided opportunities for Asian businesses to exchange experiences with others.

<a name="91111w08.htm_spnew8"><B> Sir Sydney Chapman </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 November 1999]:</i> As an extension to the facilities provided in the Palace of Westminster, Portcullis House provides much more than office space. Of the six main floors, four are to be used for offices with the actual office space taking up less than a third of the total floor area. Based on the current forecast, the estimated capital cost of the building, including the office space, is &#163;6,200 per square metre (excluding VAT).

 We have received a number of representations from organisations and members of the public about our nuclear deterrent, including its alert status. The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) announced that submarines on patrol are at a reduced day-to-day alert state reflecting improved strategic conditions. We maintain only one submarine on patrol at a time, its missiles are not targeted and are at several days "notice to fire". We also considered other more radical de-alerting measures in the SDR, such as taking submarines off deterrent patrol and removing warheads from their missiles and storing them separately ashore. We concluded that neither, in current circumstances, is compatible with maintaining a credible minimum deterrent with a submarine-based nuclear system.

<a name="91111w10.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 Since May 1997, there have been no representations opposing overall the work of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency's (DERA) Chemical and Biological Defence Sector at Porton Down (CBD). Letters from members of the public, Members of Parliament and other organisations have focused only on specific programmes and on some areas of work at CBD's predecessor establishments.
<P>

<a name="91111w10.htm_para2">As made clear by the previous Secretary of State in the Ministry of Defence paper 'Defending Against the Threat from Biological and Chemical Weapons' announced on 21 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>534-35</i>, CBD Porton Down will continue to play a vital part in the Government's response to the proliferation of these weapons.

[97644]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w10.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Since May 1997, staff at the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency have responded to some 15 written requests from Mr. Rob Evans for lists of titles, copies of technical papers and other information about work at the Chemical and Biological Defence Sector (CBD) of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) or its predecessor establishments.
<P>

<a name="91111w10.htm_para4">Mr. Evans has spoken to DERA Press Office staff on several occasions during 1998 and once this year to date. I am advised that he may have attended a DERA exhibition in Dorset in September 1997 and may have visited the Porton site as part of a group visit.
<P>

<a name="91111w10.htm_para5">Mr. Evans has also written on a number of occasions to officials in other branches of the MOD about matters that are linked to CBD Porton Down.

 Royal Hospital Haslar has six orthopaedic surgeons in post, of whom four are service men and two are civilian locums.
<P>

<a name="91111w10.htm_para7">There is not a separate waiting list for civilian patients and for patients of HM forces. Equally, both may be seen by service or NHS consultants. Waiting times for first routine orthopaedic outpatient appointments are five weeks for the Fracture Clinic and seven to ten months for the General Clinic. The number of service personnel on the waiting list for their initial outpatient attendance is 271. The number on the pending list is 351. The number of civilians on the waiting list for their initial outpatient attendance is 143. The number on the pending list is 287. A system is in place, based on operational readiness state, that enables service personnel to receive their first outpatient appointment more quickly.

Our discussions covered a range of issues of common interest. Officials in my Department and at the Department of Health are working closely together on the implications for the NHS of deploying substantial numbers of medical Reservists on military operations and possible requirements for the NHS to treat significant numbers of casualties returned to the UK in the event of a major overseas conflict. Current Defence planning does not include the call up of civilians other than members of the Volunteer Reserves Forces or former Regular personnel with a Reserve liability.

 The Territorial Army (TA) medical services provide excellent medical care.

<a name="91111w12.htm_para5">No specific guidance has been given, as the disposal of leaded petrol stocks by 31 December 1999 is a matter for oil companies to manage under existing controls. Stocks have, however, already been depleted substantially by the changeover to lead replacement petrol (LRP), encouraged by the lower duty rate of LRP relative to leaded petrol that came into effect from 1 October 1999. An ongoing amount of leaded petrol, up to a limit of 0.5 per cent. of total annual petrol sales, may also to be sold after 31 December 1999 under the terms of directive 98/70/EC.

They are based on the best estimate of jobs created/safeguarded by an investment in its initial three years. There is no requirement on companies to notify their decision to invest and therefore these figures are not comprehensive nor do they take account of subsequent developments.

You tabled a Parliamentary Question on 3 November to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry about expenditure on external consultants and advisors in each of the last four financial years. I have been asked to reply in respect of the Employment Tribunals Service (ETS) which is an executive agency of the DTI.
<BR>
The Service spent &#163;3k on consultants in 1997-98 and &#163;117k in 1998-99. Expenditure in years before 1997-98, when the Service was established as an agency, will be included in the figures given by the DTI. The increase in expenditure last year was largely a result of our use of IT consultants in developing a longer term IT strategy for the Service.

 No such assessment has been made. Compared with the combustion of oil, the combustion of natural gas to meet a particular energy demand usually produces lower emissions of carbon dioxide, due to its lower carbon content.

 The Parental Leave Directive is based on a Social Chapter agreement which was concluded by the Social Partners.

The UK Government were not therefore able to influence the discussions and negotiations which led to the conclusion of this Directive.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what measures the Government propose to take to enhance the competitive environment in the UK for divisions of multinational companies to stimulate them to continue to make major investments in the UK, with particular reference to those operating in the ice-cream industry.  [97752]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w15.htm_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 This Government aim to ensure that the UK is an economy where both indigenous and overseas-owned companies can thrive and compete effectively in world markets. This can only be achieved by maintaining macro-economic stability, and fair and open markets which promote competition. In addition, as detailed in our Competitiveness White Paper launched in December last year, we are actively pursuing a wide range of measures designed to promote the UK as a leading knowledge driven economy.
<P>

<a name="91111w15.htm_para1">The UK's strong position as an environment for business continues to be demonstrated by our record levels of inward investment success. We are the market leader for inward investment in Europe, with over 30 per cent. of the total, and second only to the US in terms of inward investment stock.

<a name="91111w15.htm_spnew10"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 There are currently seven centres in operation, including a centre in Barnsley which opened this week, and we expect a total of twelve centres to be up and running during January 2000. The locations for this initial tranche of centres were determined by balancing the geographic distribution of claimants against the availability of the medical resource needed to undertake the testing. We are assessing the options for opening further centres early next year. I recognise the very strong claims for a centre to serve the North Staffordshire miners, and would certainly hope that we will be able to open a centre in the North Staffordshire area early next year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent assessment he has made of the impact of telecommunication costs on the development of e-commerce; and if he will make a statement.  [98394]<P>

 The Cabinet Office's report e-commerce@its.best.co.uk (http://www.cabinet-office. gov.uk/innovations) provides a useful analysis of the issue of access costs. It confirms that the structure and level of tariffs affects on-line behaviour and that some UK tariffs are disadvantageous, but concludes that action is being taken. It recommends that telecoms operators be encouraged to offer a wider range of tariff options.
<P>

<a name="91111w15.htm_para2">The Government are committed to ensuring the wide availability of fast and affordable Internet access and believe that competition is the best way to deliver this. The Government want to see operators responding to competitive pressures by offering a broader range of Internet tariff options to allow heavy e-commerce users and light users to choose the optimum package for their usage profile.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what reports he has received of variations in the costs of maintaining and operating the telecommunication infrastructure in different parts of the United Kingdom; and what assessment he has made of the economic impact of such variations.  [98395]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w15.htm_spnew12"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 OFTEL, the UK's independent telecommunications regulator, carried out a thorough study of the cost of providing a universal telecommunications service throughout the United Kingdom in 1997. This included consideration of the costs of serving areas of the country which would be uneconomic on a normal commercial basis. OFTEL issued a further consultation on universal service in July this year which considered whether the conclusions of the 1997 study were still valid. The consultation period on this document closed on 29 October. OFTEL intend to publish their conclusions early next year.

<P>
<a name="91111w15.htm_spnew13"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Telecommunication charges are crucial to the development of e-commerce in the UK. I discussed this issue when I met with the Director General of Telecommunications on 28 October. However, OFTEL is an independent regulator and it would not be appropriate for me to give him guidance on such issues.

<a name="91111w16.htm_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Government have asked John Bridge, Chairman of the North East Regional Development Agency, to take the lead in establishing a small Study Team to look at the wider implications of the closure announcement for South East Northumberland.
<P>

<a name="91111w16.htm_para0">Working against the framework of the Regional Economic Strategy, which was recently published by the development agency, this team will undertake a rapid analysis of the situation and develop a comprehensive plan for South East Northumberland.

<a name="91111w16.htm_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 I represented the UK at the EU Industry Council held on 9 November.
<P>

<a name="91111w16.htm_para3">The Council agreed its report to the Helsinki European Council on the integration of industry and sustainable development policy. There was also a discussion of Kyoto targets, where there was general agreement that more effective co-ordination was needed on how to take account of industry's concerns in the implementation of Kyoto targets.
<P>

<a name="91111w16.htm_para4">The Council had a debate on competitiveness, which focused on the need for structural change and adaptability in European industry, the importance of SMEs and the role of information and communication technologies in growth and competitiveness.
<P>

<a name="91111w16.htm_para5">The Commission presented its first market monitoring report on the world shipbuilding market which highlighted both the serious situation in the market and further clear evidence of unfair pricing by Korea. The Council with strong support from the UK emphasised its serious concern at the situation and unfair pricing from Korea and in its conclusions made clear its determination to tackle such unfair trade practices and agreed further action to this end. The Council called on the Commission and the Presidency to re-engage Korea in bilateral consultations with a view to halting the unfair competition and in parallel urged Industry, member states and the Commission to seek more detailed evidence in order to take appropriate action under the WTO. The Council also emphasised the need to continue to ensure that the 



<P>
<P><I>11 Nov 1999 : Column: 730</I><P>
conditions of the IMF rescue package were fully respected. The Council ended its conclusions by welcoming the Commission's determination to continue to pursue its obligations under the EU shipbuilding regime and to report on developments as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="91111w16.htm_para6">The new Commission's enterprise policy was set out and focused on promoting entrepreneurship and innovation in Europe, stimulating the growth of SMEs, tackling red tape, addressing failures in the provision of risk capital and promoting an inclusive and cohesive Information Society. The Commission stated that it wanted to see a new innovation policy process which would involve assessing the existing situation in Europe, identifying specific priorities and actions and reporting on measures taken by member states.
<P>

<a name="91111w16.htm_para7">A number of delegations stressed the importance of investment in intangibles, particularly the knowledge base, training and life-long learning; the increased use of information technology; and the consolidation of Councils. On the latter, there was support from a number of member states for a more focused approach to competitiveness issues and for merger of the Industry Internal Market Councils as a first step. The Presidency was encouraged to settle issues at the Helsinki European Council.
<P>

<a name="91111w16.htm_para8">The Commission also presented its: Communication on the competitiveness of the forest based and related industries; Communication on the competitiveness of the steel industry; Report on the monitoring of aid for steel; Action Plan on the competitiveness of the construction industry; and gave a progress report on the public consultation on it's competition policy modernisation proposals. The Danish delegation introduced a paper on state aid policy which highlighted the damage state aid caused to the Single Market.
<P>

<a name="91111w16.htm_para9">The Council also adopted conclusions on the competitiveness of the forest-based and related industries.

The vehicle was recovered a number of days later in the York road area of Belfast. It had been purchased with cash from a car dealer in Bangor some two days before the incident by persons using false names.

The area was checked at 2339 hours with no sign of damage. At 0019 hours a mobile support unit extensively checked the area without result. At 0145 hours they again checked the area and spoke with a person who, while allegedly knowing the names of witnesses, refused to give details other than that a device had been thrown from a red Peugeot car. A further search was undertaken at first light but found nothing to support the allegation. A local resident suggested that the noise had come from the park itself and may have been a firework. In the absence of any witnesses, injury, damage, physical or forensic evidence the conclusion reached was that the explosion may have been a firework. Further investigation is therefore held pending additional information being received.

<a name="91111w19.htm_para1">Major progress has already been made. Since the Good Friday Agreement, routine military patrolling has been reduced by two thirds. Three battalions have been returned to Great Britain. There are now under 15,000 service personnel on operational duties in Northern Ireland, fewer than at any time since 1970. In large parts of the Province the police patrol without any military assistance. Since April 1998 11 military bases have been demolished and a further seven installations have been closed.

 In July 1997 the Chancellor announced an additional &#163;1.3 billion for schools in the UK (&#163;1.1 billion for England) over the life of the Parliament, financed by the Windfall Tax, to start tackling the backlog of repairs to school buildings. At the same time, he announced that in 1998-99 an extra &#163;1 billion would be available UK-wide for local authority current spending on schools (&#163;835 million in England). In March 1998, he announced a further &#163;200 million for education in England in 1998-99, of which &#163;10 million was for Education Action Zones; &#163;90 million for capital spending in schools to reduce infant class sizes, eliminate outside toilets and improve heating systems; &#163;90 million to improve skills and &#163;10 million for the University for Industry.

 The March 1999 Budget provided &#163;400 million for England from the Capital Modernisation Fund for a network of learning centres aimed at improving standards and access to IT; &#163;230 million across the UK from the National Lottery's New Opportunities Fund to help teachers purchase IT equipment for use at home (England's share of this was &#163;180 million, 80 per cent.) and &#163;49 million for schools in England to spend on books.

 Plans for the standards fund and capital allocations for 2000-01 and 2001-02 have not been finalised, so it is not possible to give a full answer to the question. In 1999-2000, English local authorities matched funding contributions to the Standards Fund were &#163;120m higher than in 1998-99; Education Standard Spending Assessments in 1999-2000 rose by &#163;1,100m. Credit approvals for education capital expenditure in England increased by &#163;77m in the same period. The costs of this additional borrowing are supported through the capital financing standard spending assessment (CFSSA); the increases in CFSSA do not form part of the &#163;19 billion.

<a name="91111w23.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 My Department's approach to waste management is based on the three "R"s, with "Recovery" (i.e. recycling, composting and energy recovery) following "Reduce" and "Re-use" as the preferred options for reducing waste sent to landfill. This should help us to achieve the Green Ministers' target for Government Departments of recovering a minimum of 40 per cent. of total office waste, with at least 25 per cent. of that recovery coming from recycling or composting, in 2000-01, as published in "Greening Government: First Annual Report of the Green Ministers Committee 1998-99".
<P>

<a name="91111w23.htm_para1">My Department has a staff of 34 and a correspondingly small production of waste.

<a name="91111w23.htm_para3">The figures do not take account of the cost of services provided on a national basis nor is it possible to differentiate between expenditure on a Health Board's own resident population and expenditure on some services provided to other Health Boards' residents. Health Board areas' weighted population figures have been used in the above calculations. The figures for 1999-2000 are not directly comparable with the earlier years because some services, such as ambulances, which were included in Health Boards' allocations in 1997-98 and 1998-99 are being met centrally in 1999-2000. Similarly the 1999-2000 figures do not take account of allocations, such as end year flexibility, which have still to be notified to Health Boards. The above figures are on a cash basis and therefore the year on year comparisons may also be distorted by capital expenditure. Responsibility for the National Health Service in Scotland is now a matter for the Scottish Executive.

 A Treasury paper "the New Monetary Policy Framework", published on 19 October, concluded that the Monetary Policy Committee's record so far in meeting the Government's inflation target was a good one. Inflation has stayed close to the Government's target and is expected to remain so; interest rates peaked at half the level recorded in the previous cycle; and despite global instability last year, the UK avoided a repeat of the boom and bust seen so often in the past. The success of the new framework has also been recognised by international bodies such as the IMF and OECD.

 The Government believe that all sectors of the economy must play their part in helping tackle the problem of climate change. So there will not be complete exemptions from the climate change levy for particular firms or sectors. In line with Lord Marshall's recommendation, the Government propose to retain an incentive for all firms to save energy at the margin. But the Government do recognise the special position of energy intensive industries and intends to offer an 80 per cent. discount to those energy intensive sectors that sign energy efficiency agreements which meet the Government's criteria.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w25.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government believe that all sectors of the economy must play their part in tackling climate change. The climate change levy is designed to be revenue neutral for the private sector as a whole, with all the revenues raised being fully recycled back to business through a cut in employers' National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and additional support for energy efficiency measures.
<P>

<a name="91111w25.htm_para3">It is not possible to say what the exact impact of the levy on the horticultural sector will be. That will depend on a number of factors including, for example, their future energy consumption, what use they make of electricity generated from "new" renewable sources of energy and in "good quality" combined heat and power plants, and whether they take advantage of the proposed introduction of a system of enhanced capital allowances for energy saving investments. The horticulture sector will also benefit from the lower overall rates of the climate change levy announced by the Chancellor in his Pre-Budget Report statement.

<P>
<a name="91111w26.htm_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Government's strategy is two-fold. Firstly, it is to ensure economic stability, including low and stable inflation. High and variable inflation, such as the UK experienced in the past, discourages saving. The Government has reformed the macroeconomic framework to build a sound and credible platform of stability: inflation is close to target and expected to remain so. This will encourage savings and investment.
<P>

<a name="91111w26.htm_para0">Supporting this is the introduction of a variety of measures. These include tax free individual savings accounts (ISAs) for short term at-need savings; pensions, especially stakeholder pensions, for planning for retirement; improved transparency and value of savings products, such as CAT standards for ISAs and pooled pensions investments (ppis); better regulation of the financial services industry through the Financial Services and Markets Bill; and raising consumer awareness, such as the Financial Services Authority's plans for comparative information on savings and investment products.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many independent financial advisers have applied to the pass scheme for professional indemnity insurance and have not obtained such insurance.  [98078]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w27.htm_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Pension Advisers Support System (PASS) was set up by those life offices which use independent financial advisers (IFAs) to provide help to small IFAs in the conduct of the pensions review. It is a voluntary scheme designed to improve speed of delivery of the regulatory requirements to review cases of potential pensions mis-selling.
<P>

<a name="91111w27.htm_para0">PASS now has 2,910 members who benefit from a range of services. PASS itself does not provide professional indemnity (PI) insurance but offers members access to a panel of brokers able to assist in securing cover, and a panel of solicitors able to provide confidential advice on legal PI issues.
<P>

<a name="91111w27.htm_para1">The PIA requires its member firms to maintain PI cover of a specified standard. While the price of that insurance has risen for some firms in the recent past, it continues to be widely available. While PIA are aware that some IFAs have had problems in finding compliant PI cover, IFAs who follow PIA's standards and guidance should be able to obtain it.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w27.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many independent financial advisers have been prevented by the regulators from offering financial advice to the public, and for what reasons, since the start of phase 1 of the Pensions Mis-selling Review. [98077]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w27.htm_spnew1"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Since 1 April 1995, when the Personal Investment Authority (PIA) issued guidelines to the industry on Phase 1 of the review, 261 Independent Financial Adviser (IFA) firms regulated by the PIA have had their authorisation revoked, and were therefore prevented from offering investment advice to the public. The PIA can revoke firms' authorisation for a wide variety of reasons. No detailed analysis is readily available of the grounds for revocation in the case of these firms.

Donations in 1998-99 were up 11 per cent. on the previous year. Research undertaken by the Inland Revenue for the Government's review of charity taxation suggests that there is considerable potential to increase take-up further.

<a name="91111w30.htm_para0">Special arrangements have been made for the Millennium holidays.

For operational staff the numbers of staff on duty will be determined throughout the period by local managers again according to perceptions of risk and other needs. Managers will make these judgments taking into account the plans of shipping/airline companies to ensure that staffing levels are kept to the minimum necessary to meet the risk.

To ask the Prime Minister, pursuant to his letter of 8 November to the hon. Member for Linlithgow <i>(a)</i> what he has made of the number of refugees made homeless in (i) Kosovo before the ceasefire and (ii) Krajina, <i>(b)</i> what is his latest estimate of the number of mass murders in Kosovo, <i>(c)</i> what he has made of the effectiveness of sanctions in achieving democratic reform in the former Republic of Yugoslavia, <i>(d)</i> what support he has had from the International Committee of the Red Cross for sanctions against Serbia, <i>(e)</i> what requests he has received through international humanitarian organisations for exemptions from sanctions against Serbia and <i>(f)</i> if he will identify the western structures to which he is referring.  [98273]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w30.htm_spmin4"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Although reliable figures are hard to establish, reports received from agencies on the ground, such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), indicate that approximately 860,000 Kosovar Albanians were made homeless before the ceasefire. Reports also indicate that 330,000 Serb refugees left Krajina, 300,000 of whom are in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and 30,000 are in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
<P>

<a name="91111w30.htm_para10">Our estimate for the number of murders in Kosovo before KFOR entering remains at 10,000.
<P>

<a name="91111w30.htm_para11">Sanctions are a recognised international tool for applying pressure to governments who are operating outside internationally accepted norms. This is one element of the economic and diplomatic pressure against the Milosevic regime which we hope will lead to democratic reform in Serbia. We and the European Union are working to ensure that the sanctions are properly aimed at the Milosevic regime, and not the ordinary people of Serbia. The EU visa ban and assets freeze against key members and supporters of the Milosevic regime are examples of this approach. At the same time we are working with the Serbian democratic opposition, for example on the "Energy for Democracy" Initiative.
<P>

<a name="91111w30.htm_para12">The recent 27th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent called on the Security Council to take into account the needs of the civilian population and apply humanitarian exemptions as appropriate when applying sanctions. We and our EU partners are acting in full accordance with this approach, allowing exceptions to sanctions on humanitarian grounds.
<P>

<a name="91111w30.htm_para13">Requests for humanitarian exemptions to the EU oil embargo have been made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and were approved. Exceptions have also been made for various Non-Governmental Organisations involved in de-mining, 



<P>
<P><I>11 Nov 1999 : Column: 786</I><P>
to allow their military equipment needed for de-mining to enter Kosovo, which remains part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and so is subject to the arms embargo.
<P>

<a name="91111w30.htm_para14">"Integration into western structures" refers in particular to the promotion of increasingly closer relations with the EU and NATO.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on his plans in respect of hunting with dogs. [R] [98388]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w31.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I am announcing today how the Government wish to proceed on this issue.
<P>

<a name="91111w31.htm_para1">The Government's manifesto commitment was for a free vote on whether hunting with hounds should be banned. Such a free vote took place during proceedings in the 1997-98 Session on the Bill to outlaw hunting with dogs sponsored by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester. His Bill received a Second Reading by 411 votes to 151. I well understand the frustration of many hon. Members that no legislative conclusion followed.
<P>

<a name="91111w31.htm_para2">I am, therefore, pleased to announce that the Government will offer reasonable time, if necessary, and drafting assistance for this issue to be considered by the House of Commons through a Private Member's Bill on a free vote. We shall consult the House authorities, as appropriate, on how this can best be taken forward.
<P>

<a name="91111w31.htm_para3">The Government have decided that there should first be an inquiry. This will be a committee of inquiry not into whether hunting is right or wrong, which is a matter for Parliament to decide. Instead, the inquiry will be put in place better to inform the debate.




<P>
<P><I>11 Nov 1999 : Column: 788</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91111w31.htm_para4">The inquiry will look at the practical issues involved in hunting with dogs, how a ban could be implemented and what the consequences of a ban would be. It will provide an opportunity for the facts about hunting properly to be considered.
<P>

<a name="91111w31.htm_para5">Also, it will enable an examination of the effect on the rural economy, agriculture and pest control, the social and cultural life of particular areas of countryside, the management and conservation of wildlife and animal welfare of hunting and if hunting were to be banned. The inquiry will take evidence from all interested parties.
<P>

<a name="91111w31.htm_para6">The inquiry will be chaired by the noble Lords, Lord Burns. It will be asked to report by late spring next year. The names of the other members of the inquiry will be announced as soon as possible. The report will be put before Parliament.
<P>

<a name="91111w31.htm_para7">Once the inquiry has reported, the Government's offer of time and drafting assistance will take effect.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w31.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Baldry: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the total estimated cost of the Public Safety Radio Communications Project; and how much of this the Government are going to fund.  [96404]
<P><P>
<P>
<a name="91111w31.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Greenway: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what discussions he has had with police authorities and chief constables regarding the allocation of funding for the Public Safety Radio Communications Project; and what estimate he has made of the project's cost in each of the police force areas in England and Wales.  [97233]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w31.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, and I have frequent discussions with police authority representatives and chief constables about police resources, including funding for the Public Safety Radio Communications Project (PSRCP). In addition my officials and I have had discussions with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities about the funding of PSRCP.
<P>

<a name="91111w31.htm_para9">The Public Safety Radio Communications Project (PSRCP) is still in detailed negotiations on price and contract provision. Therefore, figures could change as contract negotiations are finalised, and so there are commercial sensitivities that limit the amount of detailed information I can provide.
<P>

<a name="91111w31.htm_para10">Since 1995 the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) has used an indicative figure of &#163;1.5 billion in estimated costs of this project. This figure was intended to be a guide to be revised after the intense two years' study, which has now concluded, to provide firm estimates of price and service quality.
<P>

<a name="91111w31.htm_para11">The total cost for the service charge for the Public Safety Radio Communications Service (PSRCS) over the life of the service (15 years for each force) is likely, in today's money value, to be between &#163;1.25 and &#163;1.45 billion, excluding inflation and using standard Treasury accounting techniques. This is equivalent to &#163;2.3 billion in cash terms if the Treasury 6 per cent. discount rate is not applied to the annual cash flows.




<P>
<P><I>11 Nov 1999 : Column: 789</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91111w31.htm_para12">Approximately 80 per cent. of this cost goes to the core service which is to be funded centrally by means of a deduction from total police grant provision. The cost of services additional to the core, which all forces will purchase according to their own requirements, accounts for the remaining 20 per cent. These are net present costs (NPC) calculated employing a standard discounted cash flow technique for a base year of 1999 and using the Treasury's 6 per cent. discount rate.
<P>

<a name="91111w31.htm_para13">Separately from the PSRCS charge, forces will need to purchase control room and radio terminal equipment. Based upon our understanding of the police service's overall requirement, we estimate the initial purchase and subsequent replacement costs for terminals to be around &#163;300 million in NPC terms over the PSRCS service contract life. The need to replace terminals is ongoing and expenditure is currently being incurred as forces maintain their existing self-owned systems.
<P>

<a name="91111w31.htm_para14">I announced recently that we are providing an extra &#163;50 million of new money for the PSRCP. PITO the non departmental public body managing the PSRCP, has yet to decide, in consultation with the potential PSRCS service provider, BT, how best to use this money to reduce the cost of the service. The Government's intention is for it to be used in a way which reduces the charge in the third and subsequent years thus providing long-term benefit to all forces. PITO estimate that this money could reduce the service charge NPC given above by around &#163;50 to &#163;70 million over the life of the project.
<P>

<a name="91111w31.htm_para15">These figures compare with the Government plans for police spending to increase by &#163;186 million in 1999-2000 and further increases for 2000-01 and 2001-02 of &#163;199 million and &#163;290 million respectively. It is a matter for each police authority to set its budget and for each chief constable to decide how to deploy the available resources. The Government have also relaxed the rules on capital receipts from the sales of assets giving Police Authorities the freedom to use proceeds from sales for capital investment.
<P>

<a name="91111w31.htm_para16">Since the costs remain to be finalised, for the reasons set out, there are no final figures for the cost of the non-core services to individual police forces. PITO does have estimates but these are subject to negotiation, and are therefore liable to very significant change. Information will shortly be circulated to forces to enable them to calculate their likely potential costs for these non-core services.

 The powers of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary to set police force establishment levels were removed under the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994. It is for individual chief officers to determine the staffing requirements for each force within the overall resources available. Information on police officer strength is collected at the end of March and September. The figures for 31 March 1999 will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="91111w32.htm_para0">Future staffing levels are for chief officers to determine within the overall resources available. However, the Government are making available additional resources, in a new ring-fenced Crime Fighting Fund, to enable the police to recruit 5,000 officers, over and above those that they had otherwise planned to recruit over the next three years.

<P>
<a name="91111w32.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We have issued a consultation letter to interested parties regarding casino opening hours. Copies have been placed in the Library. At present, casinos must close at 4 am. We propose an extension from 4 am to 6 am (except Sundays) for casinos in England and Wales. Comments are requested by 31 January 2000.
<P>

<a name="91111w32.htm_para1">The Gaming Act 1968 imposes restrictions on the hours that gaming establishments may open. Under section 18 of the 1968 Act, casinos must close between 4 am and 2 pm on Sundays. The hours on other days are prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State in respect of casinos in England and Wales. Under the Gaming Clubs (Hours and Charges) Regulations 1984, the opening hours of casinos are currently from 2 pm to 4 am.
<P>

<a name="91111w32.htm_para2">The British Casino Association, which represents all casinos in Great Britain, has asked for a change in the law to allow casinos to open until 6 am on Monday to Saturday mornings.
<P>

<a name="91111w32.htm_para3">Following consultation with the Gaming Board for Great Britain, we have agreed in principle to the proposed change. Casinos are places for late night entertainment and we see no objection to a later closing time. This change would not affect the current permitted hours during which casinos may serve alcohol--3 am in London and 2 am elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="91111w32.htm_para4">Gaming is a reserved subject but some powers to make secondary legislation have been devolved to the Scottish Parliament, including gaming hours. The Scottish Executive is embarking on a similar exercise in respect of casinos in Scotland. We would aim to make regulations simultaneously.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w32.htm_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 We anticipate that discussions with carriers or their representatives will commence in December. The purpose of these talks will be to establish 



<P>
<P><I>11 Nov 1999 : Column: 792</I><P>
the means whereby information on passengers may be provided. We understand that some carriers may have concerns about the implications for them of the new passenger information provisions and we will endeavour to minimise as far as is possible the resource and administrative burden on them.
<P>

<a name="91111w32.htm_para5">I would like to take this opportunity to clarify the scope of the power to require carriers to provide additional information. This will be capable of requiring carriers to provide information over and above what they currently collect. However, it will not be used to require carriers to provide information to which they do not have ready access. We recognise the constraints under which industry must operate and we will work closely with them to ensure that these are properly considered against operational need.
<P>

<a name="91111w32.htm_para6">The passenger information provisions are an important element of the intelligence led approach to the operation of the immigration control. Not only will they enable the Immigration Service to make more efficient use of its resources but they will also benefit carriers, operators and the travelling public.

 My Department is working towards implementing the new Government-wide target to recover a minimum of 40 per cent. of total office waste, with at 



<P>
<P><I>11 Nov 1999 : Column: 793</I><P>
least 25 per cent. of that recovery coming from recycling or composting. My Department's approach to waste management is based on the three "R"'s with "Recovery" (i.e. recycling, composting and energy recovery) following "Reduce" and "Re-use" as the preferred options for reducing waste sent to landfill. We have set no individual targets for paper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastic and other materials, although paper is recycled in most offices and a number of Home Office sites also recycle cardboard and glass.
<P>

<a name="91111w32.htm_para8">My Department is about to undertake pilot waste minimisation schemes in three different types of buildings on the estate with the aim of reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill.
<P>

<a name="91111w32.htm_para9">The Prison Service has a vital role to play in reducing waste. They have recently set up a service wide waste management project. The project will identify areas where wastage can be reduced and will address the efficient and effective disposal of prison waste and the recycling of usable waste. The primary aims are to reduce the amount of prison generated waste that is sent to landfill sites and to reduce the demand and consumption of items of clothing and equipment. Recyclable materials, such as paper, cardboard, metal and plastics will be reprocessed and re-usable clothing and equipment items channelled back into the prison estate.

[98205]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w33.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Home Department currently operates a total of 1,171 vehicles. The majority of these, 759, belong to the Prison Service Agency. There are 272 petrol engine vehicles and 899 diesel engine vehicles. There are no liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) powered vehicles in the fleet as yet as there is a logistical difficulty in opting for LPG powered vehicles in view of the limited number of supply points available for a fleet of vehicles spread throughout England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="91111w33.htm_para0">However, the Prison Service has adopted a policy that up to 70 per cent. of vehicles replaced in the financial year 2000 will be powered by either dual fuel petrol/LPG engines, or the latest high pressure direct injection diesel engines with particulate filters where available. The Home Office is planning to go out to consultation to adopt a similar policy by the end of the current year.

<UL>(2) if he intends to give trial judges the power to extend the registration systems of the Sexual Offences Acts to convicted offenders whose offences contain a strong sexual motivation;  [98131]

<P>
(4) if he intends to require an inter-agency risk assessment prior to release of anyone convicted of indecency with children under Schedule 1 to the Sexual Offences Act.  [98130]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w33.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Protection of the public is a primary duty of the criminal justice agencies. The Government have put in place arrangements to enable risk assessment to be carried out on an inter-agency basis prior to the release of dangerous offenders, including those convicted of indecency with children. There are strong inter-agency liaison arrangements in Northumbria and throughout the country, in which the police play a major part. This work is overseen by a Steering Group on Dangerous Offenders, which includes representatives from all criminal justice agencies at very senior level. There is a support group within the Home Office, including seconded police and probation staff, which supports the Steering Group and helps local agencies with individual cases.
<P>

<a name="91111w33.htm_para1">These Questions all arise out of the case of Dominic McKilligan, currently in custody for the rape and murder of an 11-year-old boy in 1998. A review of the work of all the agencies involved with the care and supervision of Dominic McKilligan is currently being undertaken in line with the Department of Health guidance contained in "Working Together Under the Children Act 1989--A Guide to Arrangements for Inter-Agency Co-operation for the Protection of Children from Abuse". Once it is completed the agencies concerned will consider what lessons can be drawn from this tragedy and what action is required.
<P>

<a name="91111w33.htm_para2">The issue of judicial discretion in relation to the registration requirement in the Sex Offenders Act 1997 is one of a number of areas currently being reviewed by the Home Office. Once the review is completed, we shall then need to consider whether, and if so what, changes are necessary to improve the effectiveness of the Act.

<a name="91111w33.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The police do not have the powers to issue fixed penalty notices for the offence of dangerous cycling. In order to assist the police to deal with inconsiderate cycling on the pavement, we 



<P>
<P><I>11 Nov 1999 : Column: 795</I><P>
introduced from 1 August 1999 a fixed penalty for the offence of cycling on the pavement. The fixed penalty is not an on the spot fine: payment is not required on the spot and the person receiving it can challenge its issue in court.
<P>

<a name="91111w33.htm_para3">Information about how many police forces have issued fixed penalty notices for cycling on the pavement is not yet available. Each police force has been asked to monitor the fixed penalty provisions which came into force on 1 August 1999, but the details are not likely to be available until early in the new year.

<P>
<a name="91111w33.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Earlier this year, the Home Office published "Domestic Violence Matters: an evaluation of a development project". This reported on a pilot domestic violence project in Islington, adapted from a scheme in London, Ontario. The project sought to establish a civilian crisis intervention service working with the police, promote a law enforcement response, and develop inter-agency links to encourage consistent and co-ordinated action. The report discusses current Canadian law enforcement policy in respect of domestic violence.
<P>

<a name="91111w33.htm_para4">The Home Office has also published this year "Arresting Evidence: domestic violence and repeat victimisation" and "Policing Domestic Violence: effective organisational structures".

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when his office received passports from Mr. Farouk Sarraj and his wife Haj Fadel of 5a Camper Road, Southend-on-Sea SS1 2YR with the request that they have printed on them the permanent right of residence granted by his Department in its letter dated 10 September 1973 (reference F95293), and when he intends to respond to the request.

 Mrs. Haj Fadel's passport was received in the Integrated Casework Directorate on 24 July 1999. We have asked for the recorded delivery details of a second package containing Mr. Farouk Sarraj's passport and we are trying to trace the record of receipt.
<P>

<P>
<a name="91111w34.htm_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Yes. Under the terms of the contract between the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) and Siemens Business Services (SBS), the financial risk for the late delivery of elements of the IND Casework Programme is borne by SBS. In September 1998 a package of changes to the contractual payment terms--in part to compensate for expenditure wasted as a result of the delays in delivering the Information Technology application--was negotiated with SBS and all agreed compensation payments have been received when due. Details of this package are commercially confidential and disclosure would place us in breach of contract.

The figures have been further revised to take account of corrections which forces have made in their returns for 1996.

2. Costs are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 million, and are in 1999-2000 prices.<P>

3. Exact figures for net costs are not available. It is estimated that gross costs are likely to incur an offset of around 0-5 per cent. in the years up to and including 2010 and around 5-10 per cent. thereafter.<P>

4. Estimates assume average earnings growth from 1999 onwards of 1.5 per cent. per year above prices. The State Second Pension and Welfare Reform Bill changes are not taken into account in these figures. <P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w35.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The information is not available in the form requested. Such information as is available shows that since October 1998 we have received 1,381 letters from hon. Members on this subject. Since November 1998, 834 letters have been received from organisations and members of the public.

<a name="91111w36.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to his answer of 4 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>310</i>, if in response to his Department continuing to make payments direct to lenders, lenders have undertaken under the 1991 agreement to continue not to take possession; and if the agreement relates only to cases where income support covers 100 per cent. of the mortgage interest.  [98191]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w36.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The payment of mortgage interest direct to lenders clearly reduces significantly the number of people who will fall into arrears or increase arrears that they might have had before they claimed Income Support 



<P>
<P><I>11 Nov 1999 : Column: 807</I><P>
Mortgage Interest. The Code of Mortgage Lending practice produced by the lending industry clearly states that people with arrears will be considered sympathetically and positively.

[98203]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w36.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The Department has a fleet of 2,849 vehicles of which 506 are fuelled with petrol, 2,287 with diesel and 56 with liquid petroleum gas (LPG). There are currently 15 LPG cars on order and it is departmental policy to replace all 'pool cars' primarily operating in urban areas or other Air Quality Management Areas with diesel-fuelled LPG cars when they become due for replacement.

[98229]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w36.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The Department's approach to waste management should help us to achieve the Green Ministers' target for Government Departments of recovering a minimum of 40 per cent. of total office waste, with at least 25 per cent. of that recovery coming from recycling or composting, in 2000-01.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) what was the percentage withdrawal of benefit following all work test referrals and examinations at each Benefits Agency office in Scotland for each month in <i>(a)</i> 1998 and <i>(b)</i> 1999 up to the latest available month; and how many appeals against withdrawal of benefit and what percentage of such appeals were successful;  [98413]

<P>
<UL>(2) what the percentage success rate was for applications for incapacity benefit at each Benefits Agency office in Scotland in each month in <i>(a)</i> 1998 and <i>(b)</i> 1999 up to the latest available month; how many appeals there were against refusals: and what percentage of such appeals was successful.  [98412]<P></UL>

 I will write to my hon. Friend.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w36.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will define the category of individuals classified as credits only in his quarterly incapacity benefit statistics; and if he will make a statement on the reasons for the increased size of this group since 1995. [98278]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w36.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Incapacity Benefit is payable to people who satisfy both the test of incapacity for the purposes of benefit entitlement and the relevant National Insurance contribution conditions. Where a person satisfies the test of incapacity but does not meet the contribution conditions, they are not entitled to Incapacity Benefit but can be awarded National Insurance credits (and may also be eligible for Income Support paid on the grounds of incapacity). Such cases are known as "Credits Only" cases.
<P>

<a name="91111w36.htm_para7">The number of Credits Only cases has been increasing steadily since the contribution conditions were changed in 1988. The continued increase is likely to be the result of a number of social and economic factors, including changes in patterns of working.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many letters his Department has received about his proposals on incapacity benefit; and how many of these were <i>(a)</i> in favour of and <i>(b)</i> against the proposals.  [98148]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w36.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The information is not available in the format requested.
<P>

<a name="91111w36.htm_para8">We have received around 800 letters about the Incapacity Benefit changes. Around 600 of these were from Members of Parliament and around 200 were from members of the public. There is no comprehensive record of the total number received by the Department as a whole on the subject, or of the breakdown between those in favour or those against the changes.
<P>

<a name="91111w36.htm_para9">In addition, the Department received a total of 342 responses as part of the consultation exercise on the proposals for disability reform held earlier this year. A list of those organisations and academics who responded to the Welfare Reform Green Paper, excluding those who requested confidentiality, has been placed in the House Library. The Department has also placed a summary of responses in the Library.

 On 1 April 1999 responsibility for National Insurance (NI) contributions operations and policy passed from DSS to the Inland Revenue. As my hon.

No Contributions Agency staff were retained in the Department to work on NI contributions matters because the Department has no residual responsibility for the collection or recording of contributions.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am writing pursuant to Peter Mathison's letter of 27 July, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>297-298</i>, in response to your Parliamentary Question asking what action would be taken to ensure that vulnerable people will receive their benefits over the New Year, with particular reference to people with disabilities and those receiving direct and manual payments. As Mr. Mathison is currently on leave, I am replying. Mr. Mathison's original letter contained an error, therefore, I enclose the revised text in full.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Each year the Benefit Agency (BA) brings forward the production of order books, Girocheques and Automated Credit Transfers (payment directly to bank accounts) so that people receiving direct and manual payments of benefits can have their money in advance for holiday periods when Banks and Post Offices are closed. These arrangements will again be made for people in receipt of all BA benefits, including disability benefits, for the forthcoming Christmas and New Year period.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Throughout the year, the BA has continuity planning arrangements in place which could involve manual payments being implemented where problems such as postal disruption are anticipated. In the most vulnerable cases, such payments could be issued to the customer in the office the same day. The BA will also consider sending a visiting officer to those who are unable to attend the office.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Over the Christmas and New Year period, BA local offices will not be open on Friday 24 December in England and Wales. Scottish BA offices, however, will be open on 24 December. All BA local offices will be open on 29 and 30 December, and 4 January (except in Scotland, where offices return to normal working hours on 5 January). Working hours will be advertised in the local office.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The BA also provides an out of hours service (OOHS) to help customers who find themselves in particular need outside normal office hours. On weekdays this service operates until at least 20.00 hours. At weekends and on statutory holidays, it will operate for at least six hours daily, normally between 9.00 and 20.00 hours. Contact with the OOHS is normally made through the social services or police who liaise with a central emergency officer through a telephone message service. The officer then considers the individual person's needs in consultation with outside agencies.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition, the BA has been aware for some time of the issues which may arise as a result of the Year 2000 date change. A full programme of work was established in 1996. Most of the major

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Interfaces with external computer systems, including the systems which pay benefits directly to bank accounts, have been rigorously tested, or plans are in place to do so. An intensive testing process is also under way on our major benefit paying systems to provide additional assurances.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much has been recovered from insurers of those responsible for road accidents under the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999; in how many cases recovery has been achieved; and if he will make a statement.  [97802]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w38.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 came into effect on 5 April this year. From that date responsibility for the collection of charges passed from individual hospitals to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health, with the Compensation Recovery Unit, a part of the Benefits Agency, acting on his behalf.
<P>

<a name="91111w38.htm_para0">In the first six months of operation the Compensation Recovery Unit has received notification of 271,251 new claims for compensation following a road traffic accident. One third of these cases have been confirmed as involving treatment at an NHS hospital, one third have no NHS element and one third are currently being checked. This has resulted in the identification of an estimated &#163;40m potential income for NHS trusts in England, Scotland and Wales, to be released as and when the underlying compensation claims are settled.
<P>

<a name="91111w38.htm_para1">The Compensation Recovery Unit took delivery of a new computer system on 5 April 1999, not only to deal with NHS charge recovery but also to replace the elderly system in place for the recovery of state benefits since 1990. Technical problems with the new computer system have delayed the transfer of around two million records of claims for all types of personal injury compensation from the old system to the new. This, in turn, has delayed the collection of NHS charges in many cases where compensation has been paid since the scheme started in April.




<P>
<P><I>11 Nov 1999 : Column: 815</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91111w38.htm_para2">The technical difficulties are now being overcome and the scheme is beginning to deliver significant sums of money to trusts. An initial payment was made at the end of July when 185 trusts shared &#163;230,305. August saw an improvement to 225 trusts sharing &#163;713,162 and, at the end of September, 230 trusts shared &#163;1,727,942. I can now confirm that the Compensation Recovery Unit recovered, and paid to 255 trusts, a further &#163;3.7 million at the end of October, the largest ever monthly payment to the NHS in respect of recovery following road traffic accidents. This payment significantly exceeds the amounts previously collected by trusts in an average month in 1998-99 and shows a clear trend towards the step change in income we believe the new system will deliver.
<P>

<a name="91111w38.htm_para3">I will be making a further report on progress at the end of December and again at the end of the full financial year.

 A large number of representations to Ministers on a variety of issues make reference to long-term care. Some representations specifically focus on the Royal Commission's report: around 250 letters have been received from hon. Members and around 70 letters have been received from organisations since the report was published earlier this year. Around a further 430 letters have been received direct from members of the public. Many of the representations have been broadly in support of the main recommendations in the Royal Commission's majority report; others have criticised the recommendations and some have put forward alternative proposals.

 The product information for prescribers states that benzodiazepines should not be given during pregnancy unless there are compelling medical reasons. There are however some medical conditions in pregnancy where the use of these drugs can be life-saving to mother and child, for example when used to control fits in eclampsia. Patient Information Leaflets produced by the manufacturer and authorised by the licensing authority for benzodiazepines carry warnings that patients should not take the medicine if they are pregnant, might become pregnant or are breast feeding.

<a name="91111w40.htm_spnew8"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 In 1980, the Committee on Review of Medicines recommended the short-term use only of benzodiazepines, and the addition of warnings about withdrawal reactions and advice on gradual reduction in dosage on cessation of therapy. The licences for benzodiazepines were amended to add these recommendations for use at this time and this was reflected in the product information for health professionals.
<P>

<a name="91111w40.htm_para4">Subsequently the Committee on Safety of Medicines has given advice on the use of benzodiazepines. Doctors were informed in the bulletin, "Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance" in 1988.

<i>Note:</i><P>

The increase from 1997-98 to 1998-99 is largely because of new expenditure in the following areas: GCHQ consultancy services (CESG) by Central IT Unit (&#163;1,483,858); combating the Millennium Bug expenditure by Y2K team (&#163;502,956); and the Peoples Panel by Modernising Public Services Group (&#163;451,812). <P>

<P>
<a name="91111w41.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 My Department's approach to waste management is based on the three Rs: with Recovery (ie. recycling, composting and energy recovery) following Reduce and Re-use as the preferred options for reducing waste sent to landfill. This should help us to achieve: the Green Ministers' target for Government 



<P>
<P><I>11 Nov 1999 : Column: 825</I><P>
Departments of recovering a minimum of 40 per cent. of total office waste, with at least 25 per cent. of that recovery coming from recycling or composting in 2000-01, as published in "Greening Government: First Annual Report of the Green Ministers Committee 1998-99". We are developing individual targets for paper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastic and other materials. Our associate bodies are similarly working towards the Green Ministers target.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office how many proposals to impose new regulations on business have been dropped as a result of the application of Regulatory Impact Assessment.  [98049]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w41.htm_spnew1"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 Regulatory Impact Assessment is an iterative process that begins when policy options are first explored. During the development of a proposal, options may be dropped for various reasons, including the potential burden on business. But information is not collected on proposals that are dropped and could be collected only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="91111w41.htm_para0">Proposals that come before Parliament, and which are accompanied by a final, published Regulatory Impact Assessment have been judged to be necessary and to strike the right balance between cost and benefit.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what estimate she has made of the costs <i>(a)</i> reduced and <i>(b)</i> avoided as a result of the use of Regulatory Impact Assessments for the last year for which figures are available.  [98043]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w41.htm_spnew2"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 I have made no such estimates. Regulatory Impact Assessments show the expected costs and benefits of proposals that are brought forward. These individual assessments are placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="91111w41.htm_para1">Where a new proposal has the benefit of replacing an earlier more costly arrangement, that would be shown in the relevant Regulatory Impact Assessment.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if she will make it her policy to encourage <i>(a)</i> utility and <i>(b)</i> other sector regulators to adopt the principles contained in her Department's Regulatory Impact Assessment guidelines in respect of their regulatory decisions.  [98051]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w41.htm_spnew3"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 The requirements of the Better Regulation Guide and Regulatory Impact Assessment apply primarily to Government Departments and agencies who bring regulations before Parliament. It is also appropriate for other agencies such as utility and other sector regulators where they do not already have such guidance built into their statutory requirements.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w41.htm_wqn4"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if she will set <i>(a)</i> departmental and <i>(b)</i> overall targets for reducing the burden of regulation, measured by (i) volume of regulatory requirements and (ii) costs imposed by those requirements.  [98550]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w41.htm_spnew4"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 The volume and cost of regulation is less important than its quality and effectiveness. To focus on the number of regulations or their cost is 



<P>
<P><I>11 Nov 1999 : Column: 826</I><P>
meaningless because it ignores the benefits to business, society and the environment that can result from targeted and proportionate regulation.
<P>

<a name="91111w41.htm_para2">The process of Regulatory Impact Assessment aims to ensure that the costs of regulation are justified by the benefits.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what procedures are in place to ensure that departments comply with the Cabinet Office Regulatory Impact Assessment guidelines.  [98089]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w41.htm_spnew5"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 The Procedure for compliance is in the form of ministerial agreement that regulatory proposals with an impact on businesses, charities or voluntary bodies should have a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) prior to collective agreement being sought. Departments consult the Cabinet Office Regulatory Impact Unit as part of this process.
<P>

<a name="91111w41.htm_para3">Ministers and their Departmental Regulatory Impact Units have responsibility for ensuring that RIAs are published and placed in the Libraries of the House. Copies of all final RIAs must also be sent to Cabinet Office Regulatory Impact Unit.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if she will take steps to require that the requirement set out in Clause 125 of the Financial Services and Markets Bill should apply to all sector regulators in respect of their regulatory decision-making role; and if she will make a statement.  [98088]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w41.htm_spnew6"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 There is no need to extend the specific requirements on consultation and cost benefit analysis, in Clause 125 of the Financial Services and Markets Bill, to all sector regulators. Best practice guidance on consultation and on Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) is already available to sector regulators in the Better Regulation Guide.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91111w41.htm_spnew7"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 The issue of drugs and driving is predominantly a matter for the police, who have powers to deal with drivers who are impaired through the effects of drugs under existing road traffic legislation. Drug Action Team (DAT) membership includes chief officers of agencies--including the police--which have responsibility for tackling all aspects of the drug problem, and as such this issue is already covered by DATs.

Officials from my Department, the Treasury and the Department of Social Security are discussing with BBC officials the detailed implementation of the concession, including funding issues.
<P>

<a name="91111w43.htm_para2">The estimated cost of the concession in the first full year is around &#163;290 million, or approximately 12.5 per cent. of current television licence fee revenue. Costs in subsequent years will depend on the level of the licence fee and on increases in the number of households including a person aged 75 or over. Since the concession will be available to people over the age of 75, regardless of the age of other members of their household, ownership of television sets will not be at issue.

<a name="91111w44.htm_para5">My right hon. Friend the Minister considered carefully the advice given to him by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Donaldson, in his report of 30 July 1999, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House. The Government have made clear they wish to lift the beef on the bone ban but consider that it would be preferable to do so at the same time in all parts of the United Kingdom. Further scientific evidence on this issue is scheduled for later this month. Provided that evidence is favourable, it is the Government's clear and firm intention, and that of the First Minister in Scotland and the First Secretary in Wales, to lift the ban throughout the United Kingdom.

<P>

<a name="91111w44.htm_para7">As far as GM foods, food ingredients or additives derived from oilseed rape are concerned, only one GM variety currently has clearance to be marketed for this purpose. This variety does not however have the necessary authorisation to enable it to be grown commercially in the Community at the present time. It can therefore only be imported for processing.

 I assume that the question relates to the methods permitted for removing the spinal cord from the carcases of sheep which at the time of slaughter had at least one permanent incisor tooth or were aged over twelve months. In France, the spinal cord of such sheep may be removed either by longitudinally splitting the whole vertebral column, as required in the UK, or by a method which involves suction from the unsplit carcase.
<P>

<a name="91111w44.htm_para8">Methods involving suction have been evaluated in the UK but did not prove to be reliable in removing the entire spinal cord in all cases. It is also not possible to verify that no spinal cord remains in an unsplit carcase. We therefore have no current plans to adopt this method.

 My right hon.

This should help us achieve the Green Ministers' target for Government Departments of recovering a minimum of 40 per cent. of total office waste, with at least 25 per cent. of that recovery coming from recycling or composting, in 2000-01, as published in "Greening Government: First Annual Report of the Green Ministers Committee 1998-99".

<a name="91111w47.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 British Trade International assess the overall power situation in Kosovo at present as poor, with frequent power outages. The main reason for this is because the two power stations are old and have been inadequately maintained for many years. There has been no war damage to either power station. A British management team, jointly funded by the EU Task Force and British Trade International, is currently working with the EU Task Force, UNMIK and the Kosovo Electric Company to manage the situation.
<P>

<a name="91111w47.htm_para8">The period between now and the end of November, when we expect one of the power stations to become operational again following essential maintenance, may well prove difficult. There have also been difficulties maintaining a regular supply of consumables, funded by the EU Task Force, required to keep the power stations operating. However, DfID and British Trade International are now both providing funds for the hire of bulldozers until new machines funded by the Dutch Ministry of Development arrive.

International Financial Institutions. The participating countries to the Pact adopted the founding document in Cologne on 10 June 1999. It has been stressed at all Stability Pact meetings that there is a role for the FRY when conditions permit. Meanwhile, Montenegro is fully involved in the Pact's work.

<a name="91111w47.htm_para11">The Office of the Special Co-ordinator for the Pact is in Brussels. The Special Co-ordinator Chairs the Regional Table of the Pact. This acts as a steering board and facilitates co-ordination and information exchange between the Pact's three Working Tables. The three Working Tables deal with Democracy/Human Rights, Economic Reconstruction/Development/Co-operation, and Security Issues and meet every 3-4 months. Between these meetings work is taken forward through subject-specific Task Forces.
