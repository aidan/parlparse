There is good operational co-operation between Venezuela and UK law enforcement agencies and we have supported several initiatives in information sharing, the sharing of best practice and co-operation on seizures and arrests. This has resulted in disruption to organised crime networks and the seizure of cocaine destined for European/UK markets. The recent signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the UK and Venezuela demonstrates the Government's commitment to counter narcotics work in Venezuela.</p>

 Once a police authority has carried out its statutory responsibility of calculating its budget requirement and its basic amount of council tax for a financial year, legislation allows the authority to make substitute calculations provided that it does not increase the level of its budget requirement or basic amount of council tax.

To this end, an initial review was conducted of those areas of expenditure where the link between project activities and poverty reduction in the developing world was least demonstrated, in this context, four projects within the Development Awareness Fund (DAF), and a festivals outreach project were identified for termination.
