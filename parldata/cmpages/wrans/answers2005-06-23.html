 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what work has been carried out <i>(a)</i> by and <i>(b)</i> on behalf of her Department to establish the background levels of fluoxetine in the aquatic environment.  [4448]</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50623w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 During 2002&#150;03 the Environment Agency carried out a desk based ranking exercise on the 500 pharmaceuticals most commonly used in England and Wales in order to prioritise those of environmental significance. This exercise included fluoxetine, more commonly known under the trade name Prozac. A short, targeted monitoring programme was then set up for 12 pharmaceuticals. Fluoxetine was not included because no analytical method suitable for use on environmental samples existed and development of one would be difficult.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50623w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The top ranked antidepressant was lofepramine and this was included in the monitoring survey. Lofepramine was not detected in any of the five sewage works effluents or receiving watercourses monitored. However, it does not necessarily follow that the same would be true for fluoxetine.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50623w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">The Environment Agency have developed a Position Statement on Pharmaceuticals&#151;which can be found on the agency&#039;s website, www.environment-agency.gov.uk (search-pharmaceuticals). This elaborates further on the work done and includes a recommendation to the pharmaceutical industry to do more on the development of analytical methods for environmental monitoring. I am pleased that the Environment Agency is in discussion with the industry on the development of a work programme to cover the recommendations to industry listed in the Position Statement.

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="50623w02.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The objective of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive is to protect the environment from the adverse effects of waste water discharges. The directive does not however set specific standards for the condition of inland and coastal waters into which waste water is discharged. Rather, it includes requirements to put in place sewage collecting systems, and sets standards for the treatment of sewage at sewage treatment works. Treatment standards and deadlines are set according to the size of the population served and the sensitivity of waters receiving the discharges.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50623w02.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_15">The sewage collection system serving London is a combined system which collects both domestic and industrial waste water, and rainwater run-off. The directive acknowledges that it is not possible in practice to construct combined collecting systems and treatment plants to deal with all waste water during situations such as unusually heavy rainfall. Consequently the directive requires the limitation of pollution of receiving waters due to storm water overflows according to best technical knowledge not entailing excessive cost. The system along the tidal Thames has combined sewer overflows which operate to prevent flooding and sewage treatment works from becoming overloaded during wet weather.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50623w02.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_16">The estimated volumes of sewage pumped to the river during some wet weather conditions in the following table are taken from pumping station records from the five largest pumping stations that discharge to the Thames Tideway. These are the only &quot;overflow&quot; points that have records of discharge volumes and are considered to be responsible for approximately 60 per cent. of the overflow discharges to the tideway in wet weather. The remaining 40 per cent. come from other pumping stations and gravity sewers. These percentages will vary considerably depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall across London as well as other factors such as tidal state.

The report of the further findings and options presented, which is expected soon, will be carefully considered by Ministers and a decision will be taken on an appropriate course of action to be taken to meet our obligations to protect the environment in a cost effective way.

<p><a name="st_30"><a name="50623w05.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Buck </b> 
<i>[holding answer 26 May 2005]:</i> The modelling and analysis supporting the White Paper was based on DTI&#039;s May 2004 long-term modelling assumptions for crude oil of $23 a barrel (2003 prices) in 2010 rising to almost $28 a barrel by 2020. This was consistent with assumptions used by the International Energy Agency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50623w05.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_31">A good deal of uncertainty surrounds all transport projections. At present, developments in the oil market are injecting a major element of uncertainty. Sustained higher oil prices would imply lower traffic growth. If crude oil prices were to end up around US$5 a barrel higher in real terms in 2010 than assumed, we expect traffic projections would fall by around 1 per cent.

 It is not easy to distinguish former Taliban and their sympathisers from other groups hostile to the current political process in Afghanistan. We believe that at any given time the number of former Taliban actively involved in insurgency in Afghanistan and Pakistan is in the very low thousands. But the remoteness and geography of the Pakistani border region with Afghanistan, the difficulty of maintaining border controls, and the movement of people across the border, makes it difficult to give an accurate assessment.

 The Skills Strategy clearly set out the need to rebalance the contributions of employers, individuals and the public purse towards the costs of learning. We have been clear about our priorities of a place in school, college or an apprenticeship for all young people, and a focus on adults without a solid foundation of employability skills. Within an overall increased budget, these will be the focus for public funding. We will continue to provide fee concessions arrangements for learners on means tested benefits to access FE but we expect colleges to increase their total fee income, including collecting the income they currently chose to waive at their own discretion. These are not just technical funding changes. They are the first step in a necessary change of culture and expectations, where the value of learning and the benefits it brings to learners and to employers is properly recognised as a worthwhile and necessary investment.

 Both public and private sectors have welcomed our proposals to set up the School Food Trust (SFT). It will give independent support and advice to schools and parents to improve the standard of school meals, working with the food industry, caterers, nutritionists, food interest groups and the public sector. We have already announced financial support of &#163;5 million per year for the SFT for the next three years. My Department will assist the SFT in establishing itself, will agree an annual business plan in relation to the grant it receives from DFES, and work closely with it to ensure that our respective work programmes are complementary.
