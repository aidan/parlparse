 The Compact is an agreement between the Government, and its associated non-departmental public bodies, arm's length bodies and executive agencies, and civil society organisations (CSOs) in England. It aims to ensure that the Government and CSOs work effectively in partnership to achieve common goals and outcomes for the benefit of communities and citizens. The Scottish Government has operational responsibilities for engagement with CSOs in Scotland and has its own arrangements in place. However, where the UK Government have responsibility for funding services provided by CSOs in Scotland, it will honour the commitments made in the Compact in relation to CSOs it funds.</p>

 We have significant numbers of staff engaged on the consultation responses.

This data is then broken down by subject area, with summaries being produced for each question in the consultation, and by thematic area reflecting the chapters in the consultation paper eg alternative sources of funding. Both the logs and summaries are reviewed by policy teams so all suggestions and comments are factored into their thinking when developing proposals.</p>

<sup>(3)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> The number of defendants found guilty in a particular year may exceed the number proceeded against as the proceedings in the magistrates court took place in an earlier year and the defendants were found guilty at the Crown court in the following year; or the defendants were found guilty of a different offence to that for which they were originally proceeded against.<br>

 I have noted that the European Commission's Radio Spectrum Policy Programme, currently under discussion with member states, has raised the possibility of considering the release of spectrum immediately below 790 MHz, known as the second digital dividend, in the longer term. This spectrum is used in the UK, as in other countries in the EU, for digital terrestrial television services.

Iraq) and Turkey has reported over 1,400 outbreaks of FMD in the last 12 months. In January 2011, an incursion in Bulgaria just two kilometres from the Turkish border was reported to the European Commission. This incursion in wild boar and domestic animals has led to special protective measures being put in place by the EC for Bulgaria, in terms of biosecurity, transport and the movement of susceptible animals and POAO.</p>

The Department for Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland (DARDNI) is responsible for these controls in NI.

DEFRA provides UKBA with a bespoke global risk map that categorises countries into Red, Amber and Green risks according to the prevalence of animal diseases that can be transmitted in products. UKBA use this map to inform their risk-based targeting activities. Countries considered endemic for FMD and other diseases, such as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever, are always on the list, but the list of countries is constantly being updated. UKBA also use historical data on type of products seized, high-risk routings and origin, methods of concealment and risk trends; specific intelligence; results of operational checks; and information from other enforcement agencies.</p>

For example, following the recent outbreak of FMD in Bulgaria (part of the EU), we have worked with UKBA to reduce the risk of unregulated products entering the UK from the affected region. This is an exceptional measure as customs powers do not normally apply to intra-EU movements of POAO goods.</p>

Approximately, 160,000 hectares of the public forest estate benefit from access rights on foot through dedication under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. A further 26,000 hectares of access land in the New Forest predate the Act. The Forestry Commission estimates that over 163,000 hectares of the public forest estate have open, permit-free, access for horse riders. Cyclists are welcome on most of the areas where there is foot access and access for horse riders.</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 February 2011]:</i> The European Parliament proposal that meat from animals slaughtered without stunning should be labelled was made during the Parliament's First Reading consideration of the Commission proposal for a Food Information Regulation. In December, the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council met to reach a political agreement on the Food Information Regulations but member states did not discuss the European Parliament's proposed amendment on method of slaughter labelling.

All agree this is a difficult, complex and sensitive issue that cannot easily be resolved in view of the many competing interests involved. We will be looking at this further but, will need to consider the impact of existing EU meat labelling Regulations, before any final decisions are taken.</p>

This will help them make the transition to sustainable private sector-led growth and prosperity. Rural communities and rural voluntary groups can access relevant funding from both national and local government sources open to civil society bodies. In addition, DEFRA and the Department for Communities and Local Government is currently supporting the town and parish council sector through funding to support community empowerment. Local authorities have, of course, recently been notified of their formula grant allocations for the coming financial year, and this funding is intended to enable them to meet the needs of all their residents, rural and urban.</p>

The Government are seeking to remove these barriers, for example through the provisions of the Localism Bill, in order to enable local authorities and empower communities to address their own locally- identified needs. The creation of Local Enterprise Partnerships will help with the drive to sustainable local growth, focusing on local economic priorities.</p>

 The sequential approach set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 3, published in 2000, put a strong emphasis on the allocation and use of brownfield sites before any other land. However, it also recognised that in some circumstances such sites may not be ready for development, and so the policy set out criteria against which other housing sites should be considered. It did not rule out the use of greenfield sites. The current policy, in Planning Policy Statement 3, published in 2006, whilst not retaining the sequential approach, continues to prioritise previously developed land for development.</p>

The approach is based on the principle that a health condition or disability should not automatically be regarded as a barrier to work. We know that people with the same diagnosis can have very different effects in terms of their ability to work; therefore entitlement to ESA is based on the functional effects of an individual's condition rather than the condition itself.</p>

 Unlicensed medicines are used within a professional and medicines legislative framework. Unlike licensed medicines, unlicensed medicines are not required to be assessed for safety, quality and efficacy. Therefore, for public health reasons their supply is limited by law to where there is a special need of an individual patient. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) interprets special need to be the clinical need of the individual patient that cannot be met by an available equivalent licensed product; cost and convenience are not considerations. Current General Medical Council ethical guidance on the use of unlicensed medicines states a doctor should always consider using a licensed medicinal product in the first instance. Such decisions need to be made in discussion with the patient concerned. Most, if not all, national health service trusts have established policies controlling the use of unlicensed medicines as it is considered that prescriber liability is significantly increased in such situations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="110228w0005.htm_para56"><a name="11030111000141">Medicinal products are regulated by a system of licensing defined in European Union legislation. Before approval of a licence, new medicines are required to demonstrate acceptable standards of safety, quality and efficacy such that the benefit/risk consideration for use of the product in the claimed indication is positive. The MHRA acts on behalf of the UK Licensing Authority to approve new national marketing authorisations in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="110228w0005.htm_para57"><a name="11030111000142">Prior to licensing, new medicines undergo clinical trials to determine their efficacy and safety profile. These trials are in a carefully controlled sample of the intended treatment population. Because there is a gap between what is known at the time of licensing from clinical trials and what will happen in the 'real world' once larger numbers of patients in the target population start using the medicine, the safety of all medicines after licensing is monitored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="110228w0005.htm_para58"><a name="11030111000143">It is a legal requirement for pharmaceutical companies to develop risk management plans for all newly licensed medicines. This uses all available data at the time of licensing to identify what is and is not known about the safety of the medicine, to plan what may need to be done to extend safety knowledge and to propose measures to minimise any known risks to patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="110228w0005.htm_para59"><a name="11030111000144">Once a medicine is marketed, the MHRA keeps all medicines authorised in the UK under close and continuous scrutiny using a number of robust procedures and a wide variety of data sources. These include spontaneous adverse drug data received from health care professionals and patients through the UK's Yellow Card Scheme, from clinical trials and epidemiological studies, worldwide published medical literature, data from the manufacturer and information from worldwide regulatory authorities. If a new safety issue is identified action is taken where appropriate to minimise risk to patients, optimise safe use and issue updated prescribing advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"><a name="110228w0005.htm_para61"><a name="11030111000154">In December, we published our response to the consultation in "Liberating the NHS: Legislative framework and next steps" setting out our plans in further detail. This document set out a full analysis of the responses to the consultation and how our proposals were modified in light of the consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_416"><a name="110228w0005.htm_para62"><a name="11030111000155">All of these documents have already been placed in the Library.</p>

 "Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS" described our plans to establish a comprehensive system of general practitioner (GP) consortia to commission most national health service services, supported by and accountable to a new independent NHS Commissioning Board. We believe that effective GP commissioning will require the full range of clinical and professional input alongside that of local people. Hospital doctors, nurses, pharmacists and allied health professionals and others all have a vital role to play and a real opportunity to develop services and improve the health outcomes of their local populations. GP consortia will need to ensure that they have access to and draw upon the necessary expertise of those working in health and social care to ensure that they have the most appropriate specialist input into their commissioning decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_444"><a name="110228w0005.htm_para90"><a name="11030111000360">The Health and Social Care Bill therefore proposes to place a duty on the NHS Commissioning Board and GP consortia to make arrangements to ensure that they have appropriate advice from professionals with expertise in health. We believe, however, that the Board and consortia should have the freedom and flexibility to decide how best they exercise this duty, rather than rely on rigid prescribed structures.</p>

 The following tables show the expected estimated number of defined daily doses at primary care trust (PCT) and strategic health authority (SHA) level for medicines for the treatment for post-menopausal osteoporosis. These estimates have been derived by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) from its costing template for the relevant technology appraisal and have been updated, where possible, to take into account the most up-to-date and robust information available. These figures do not represent NICE'S view of desirable maximum or minimum figures. Furthermore, the estimated use in PCTs is based on national assumptions and scaled down to approximate numbers at PCT level. It does not take account of any local variations, such as varying prevalence of osteoporosis and socioeconomic compositions.</p>

 The UK has not made any specific representations to Israel on the supply of electricity to Gaza as we do not see Israeli restrictions on supplies of electricity or fuel as being the main current cause of electricity shortages in Gaza. Israel continues to provide 120 megawatts (MW) of electricity per day directly to Gaza which meets approximately 43% of Gaza's power needs and is paid for by the Palestinian Authority. Egypt provides a further 17MW and the balance of Gaza's power needs (approximately 140MW) should be met by the Gaza power plant. The Gaza Electricity Distribution Company (GEDCO) is now buying diesel fuel, which is sourced via tunnels between Egypt and Gaza, to operate two turbines in the power station to produce 60MW, and has not requested any industrial fuel from Israel since 5 January 2011. The majority of the population still experience power cuts, but these are now four to six hours a day, down from eight to 12 hours per day since mid-December 2010.</p>

In November, donors and partners will meet at the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Korea to decide on further commitments to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. DFID will continue to be an international leader on implementing approaches that increase the effectiveness of aid, and we expect to play an important role in the run up to the High Level Forum.

The UK's aid is currently focused on health, education, access to justice and Burundi's integration into the East African Community. We have engaged closely with the Government of Burundi and international partners in the context of discussions in the UN Security Council, the UN Peace-Building Commission and ongoing in-country dialogue to ensure that the principal hurdles to building a lasting peace are addressed, including the reintegration of demobilised soldiers and actions to improve the employment prospects of unemployed young people.</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 February 2011]:</i> As announced in the written ministerial statement of 1 February 2011, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) will spend Â£5 million on a human rights and democracy programme in 2011-12. This programme is dedicated specifically to supporting human rights projects. However there are a number of other FCO programmes that contribute to the achievement of our human rights objectives. These include: a new fund of Â£5 million to address the underlying governance and social, economic and political participation issues affecting the Arab world; a Â£7 million programme in the Overseas Territories; Â£3.5 million to support the work of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy; Â£17 million for scholarships; and Â£19 million for bilateral programmes.</p>

The number of applications for new registrations and variations processed and accepted, and the number of registrations cancelled, is published annually in the Traffic Commissioners' Annual Report. However monitoring bus deregistrations would not be a good way of monitoring impacts in service provision, as it does not give any indication of why services have been deregistered.</p>

1. The figures have been rounded to the nearest 10. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>
2. Housing benefit figures exclude any extended payment cases. An extended payment is a payment that may be received for a further four weeks when they start working full time, work more hours or earn more money.<br>
3. SHBE is a monthly electronic scan of claimant level data direct from local authority computer systems. It replaces quarterly aggregate clerical returns. The data are available monthly from November 2008 and November 2010 are the latest available.<br>
4. The age at which women reach state pension age will gradually increase from 60 to 65 between April 2010 and April 2020. This will introduce a small increase to the number of working age benefit recipients and a small reduction to the number of pension age recipients. Figures from May 2010 onwards reflect this change.<br>
5. The data refer to benefit units, which may be a single person or a couple.<br>
6. Age groups are based on the age on the count date (second Thursday in the month), of either:<br>
(a) the recipient if they are single, or<br>
(b) the elder of the recipient or partner if claiming as a couple.<br>
7. State pension age (SPA) is 64 years for men and currently 60 for women under the incremental SPA equalisation.<br>

 As with other businesses, there is no single legal form for social enterprises. While it is therefore difficult to categorise them, figures from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills' Annual Small Business Survey suggest that there are more than 60,000 social enterprises in the UK working across all areas of the economy and enabling communities to take responsibility and solve local problems. Evidence also indicates that social enterprises have fared much the same as SMEs in the recession, and indeed a higher proportion of social enterprises compared to SMEs have managed to increase their turnover in the last 12 months.</p>

 Green Deal finance will help householders to invest in energy efficiency measures; take-up will not depend on, or be determined by, the value of the property. Indicative analysis suggests that the price of a property rarely reflects its level of energy efficiency which would indicate that owners of properties in all price bands will be able to benefit from the Green Deal. The proposed Energy Company Obligation component of Green Deal will focus a major part of its effort on subsidised offerings to vulnerable households on low incomes, which should help to drive take-up across the spectrum of property value, including in less expensive properties.</p>

 The introduction of feed-in tariffs (FITs) in April 2010 is expected to result in increased average retail electricity prices for both domestic and business customers as suppliers are expected to pass through their additional costs to customers. We assume that the impact on retail prices is the same across sectors, as costs are assumed to be spread evenly over total consumption.

 To tackle child sexual exploitation effectively there must be a collaborative approach involving Ministers from a range of Government Departments as well as local authority children's services, Local Safeguarding Children Boards, and organisations such as the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), Barnardo's and others, including voluntary organisations around the country.</p>

<i> [holding answer 3 February 2011]:</i> The Business Plan for the Department for Education was published on 8 November 2010. This contained in draft a set of input and impact indicators and a revised set will be included when the finalised Business Plan is published in April. While the Business Plan did not include any specific impact indicators on child protection, the plan made clear the importance the Department places on improving arrangements for protecting children from harm, and set out a commitment to publish Professor Eileen Munro's child protection review and implement reforms. Ministers asked Professor Munro to undertake this review of child protection in England in June 2010, and specifically to consider whether there are better ways of using performance data to improve social work practice. Professor Munro published her interim report on 1 February 2011. She argued that process-based targets and performance indicators have skewed local priorities to focus on specific aspects of process, rather than the quality of practice. Professor Munro will make final recommendations to Government in April 2011.</p>

<i> [holding answer 7 February 2011]:</i> Following the publication of the Social Work Task Force Report, the Department for Education committed to match Â£2.5 million of funding made available by the Department of Health to support the establishment of an independent, national college of social work. This Department's funds have not yet been allocated and officials are in discussions regarding the appropriate time that further funds will need to be made available to meet the emerging business development plan.

<i> [holding answer 7 February 2011]:</i> For the purposes of the 2010 performance tables the humanities element of the English Baccalaureate measure was either history or geography. We have not included religious education (RE) as fulfilling the humanity requirement of the English Baccalaureate because it is already a compulsory subject. One of the intentions of the English Baccalaureate is to encourage wider take up of geography and history in addition to, rather than instead of, compulsory RE.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_737"><a name="110228w0010.htm_para10"><a name="11030141001467">However we recognise, as many schools do, the benefits that religious education can bring to pupils. This is why the teaching of RE remains compulsory throughout a pupil's schooling. Success in all subjects studied at GCSE will also continue to be recognised by other performance table measures, as it has in the past. We are open to arguments about how we can further improve the measures in the performance tables and will review the precise definition of the English Baccalaureate for the 2011 Tables.</p>

 The Insolvency Service's budget is not structured in such a way that the detailed figures that you have requested are readily available. The Insolvency Service as a whole receives financing from both fees and direct funding from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. These figures are available in the service's annual reports and accounts. From 1 April 2004, the cost of case administration have been met by fees while investigation and enforcement is paid for by an allocation of programme funding from the budget of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills as set out in the following table and notes. These figures relate to the cost of dealing with all aspects of the Insolvency Service's disqualification effort.</p>

 As announced in the House on 9 February 2011, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 310-13, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, my right hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr Osborne), the UK's five major banks have stated a capacity and willingness to lend Â£190 billion of new credit to business in 2011. This includes Â£76 billion of new lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which is a 15% increase on the amount lent in 2010. Should demand from viable businesses exceed this amount, the banks will lend more.</p>
