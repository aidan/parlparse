 In the north-west, around 230,000 people have gained from the national minimum wage; the working families tax credit makes work pay for nearly 180,000 families. The minimum income guarantee ensures single pensioners will receive &#163;100 a week by 2003 and more than 1.4 million pensioners have seen the biggest rise in basic state pension for a generation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20313w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The National Strategy for neighbourhood renewal action plan was published by the Social Exclusion Unit in 2001. Its goal is to ensure that no one is seriously disadvantaged by where they live within 10&#150;20 years and to narrow the gap between the most deprived neighbourhoods and the rest. Many of the most deprived neighbourhoods are in urban areas.
<P>

<a name="20313w02.html_para2">The strategy addresses the wider causes of poverty and social exclusion with targets to improve employment levels, educational attainment, health and housing and to reduce crime in the most deprived neighbourhoods. This is backed up by substantial investment. The Neighbourhood Renewal Unit, based in Department for Transport Local Government and the Regions, is responsible for taking this forward. The Government Offices for the Regions work with the NRU and other Departments to administer specific programmes like the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund.
<P>

<a name="20313w02.html_para3">The SEU continues to work with all Government departments to ensure that social exclusion issues are addressed.

 The figures are in tables and represent the data reported to the Mandate database and supplied in manual returns as at 1 October 2001, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House. Mandate is a central computer based record of information for almost all civil servants in the home civil service. For some Departments and agencies, summary figures are provided in a manual return, which may not always be fully consistent with Mandate information, for example, because of minor differences in timing. Breakdowns by age are purely figures reported to Mandate. Departments and agencies are responsible for their own grading structures, but these have been allocated to broad responsibility levels to give a common basis for tabulation.
<P>

<a name="20313w02.html_para7">Figures are on a head count basis, for the number of permanent staff in each Department. The figures are based on the Departments following the structural changes made as a result of the 2001 election.

 As indicated in our Planning Green Paper, published on 12 December, a third party right of appeal against the grant of planning permission could add to the costs and uncertainties of planning.

<a name="20313w05.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Keeble: </B>

 The Government's priority is that all social housing should be made decent by 2010. Birmingham has a plan to achieve this through a housing transfer.

<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para4">To tackle this we need a new approach. One that concentrates as much on the people as on the places that they live. That is what "More than a roof" proposes. We accept it. There are six key objectives that underpin our new approach.

<a name="20313w08.html_para9">In addition to the help provided to local authorities by the new Homelessness Directorate, a range of measures are being established to help local authorities respond to this new duty.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para10">I have published today "Homelessness Strategies&#151;a good practice handbook", a document which provides a framework for local authorities, and all key local agencies, to work together.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para11">Also, my Department will contribute to a series of seminars to help organisations prepare for the new Homelessness Act. Organised in partnership with the Chartered Institute of Housing, the Local Government Association, Shelter and others, they will focus on practical implementation.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para12">We are determined to ensure that vulnerable people leaving institutions, young people including those coming out of care, and people fleeing domestic, racial and other forms of violence, are helped effectively. Although this may mean that the number of people who local authorities accept as homeless increases, I am more concerned to ensure vulnerable people get the help they need.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para13">Therefore we will be issuing a revised statutory Code of Guidance on Allocations and Homelessness, reflecting changes brought about by the new Homelessness Act and our proposed Priority Needs Order.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para14">I will allocate additional resources in order to help local authorities deliver the new Priority Needs Order. I am also considering making "tackling homelessness" a future Beacon council theme.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para15">But we also need to understand more about the most effective ways to tackle homelessness.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para16">In order to do this, the Homelessness Directorate will investigate the underlying causes and trends of homelessness, collect information more effectively and test new and innovative approaches which can be taken to reduce and prevent homelessness. I have asked for a progress report on this work in the autumn outlining what future action can be taken.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para17">An important part of the Homelessness Directorate's work will be to encourage best practice. Where public resources fund services, it is vital that the taxpayer gets value for money. The use of local targets and protocols, such as reducing the number of tenancy breakdowns or ensuring appropriate numbers of lettings to homeless households, will be important.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para18">There are many people living in very different sorts of hostels across the country, and with the onset of "Supporting People", it will be important to ensure that best practice is established across all publicly funded

hostels. I am keen, therefore, to ensure that hostels are inspected in a structured way by either the voluntary or statutory sector.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para19">Although many former rough sleepers have now moved into shelters, hostels, or their own homes, they still need help to rebuild their lives away from the streets. We must also continue to do everything we can to help those people who sleep rough, while at the same time prevent new people from ending up on the streets.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para20">This is why we will allocate over &#163;30 million during 2002&#150;03&#151;the same level of revenue investment that delivered the two-thirds reduction in rough sleeping.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para21">No one in this country wants their fellow citizens to have to sleep in a cardboard box at night because they have nowhere else to go. In the same way, we should not tolerate children being forced to stay in over-crowded and expensive B&B hotels for weeks, months, and sometimes years, on end.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para22">Today, I am making a commitment that by March 2004 local authorities will ensure that no homeless family with children has to live in a B&B hotel except in an emergency.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para23">There may be exceptional circumstances, where some families have specific needs, or when the local authority is still processing a homelessness application, where B&B hotels of an acceptable standard may be used for a limited period. But I believe this should only happen where no reasonable alternative exists, and should not be for any more than six weeks.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para24">In order to help local authorities achieve this target, we are making a number of changes.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para25">Jointly with Alistair Darling, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, I am announcing changes to housing benefit rules to boost incentives for private sector leasing by local authorities and housing associations.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para26">As these changes will take time to make the impact we want, we are introducing urgent measures to ensure that children are not forced to live in B& B hotels any longer than is absolutely necessary.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para27">Therefore &#163;35 million will be allocated during 2002&#150;03 on a range of alternatives to using B&B hotels.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para28">In order to ensure that local authorities do not use B&B hotels inappropriately in the future, we will revise the statutory guidance on homelessness. We will also ensure that, in the exceptional circumstances where it is used, it is of a reasonable standard.
<P>

<a name="20313w08.html_para29">I am also concerned that children and babies placed in temporary accommodation, including B&B hotels, should not miss out on important health care to give them a proper start in life. My Department is today issuing new advice to housing authorities on the arrangements that I consider should be put in place to ensure that all babies and children placed in temporary accommodation receive their health and developmental checks from health visitors and other primary health care professionals.

 The courts already have robust sentencing powers for offences of assault. The maximum penalty for causing grievous bodily harm or wounding with intent to cause such harm is life imprisonment. The maximum penalty for the offences of causing grievous bodily harm in the absence of intent to do so and the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is five years' imprisonment. Common assault attracts a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment.

 EC Regulation 2037/2000 came into force with effect from 1 October 2000. It covers a wide range of controls in the trading of ozone depleting substances (ODSs), including a ban on the exportation of fridges and freezers containing CFCs in the refrigerant gases and foam insulation. However, following representations from the second-hand fridge export industry for further time to adapt to the change, the Government suspended operation of the ban on exports in November 2000. The ban was reintroduced in respect of fridges containing CFCs in the refrigerant gases and the foam insulation from 1 January 2001 and 1 January 2002 respectively.

<P>

<P>

<a name="20313w12.html_para7">Annex ll of ESA95 explains how to record capital expenditure when the public sector leases from the private sector. Chapter 2 explains how to determine whether a business is in the public or private sector. The legislative bases for the calculations are Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community; and Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community.

The numbers of beneficiaries of the new deal, the working families tax credit, child benefit, state retirement pension, winter fuel payments, free TV licences and minimum income guarantee in the Bristol, East constituency are given in the table.

<a name="20313w14.html_wqn8"><B> Paddy Tipping: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission, what estimate the Commission has made of the average cost of a day's sitting of the House in the last session for which figures are available.  [41498]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20313w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 The overall cost of running the House administration (excluding capital works, etc.) in 2000&#150;01 was some &#163;103 million, giving an average daily cost of the order of &#163;280,000. The difference in cost between a sitting day and a non-sitting day is negligible: the major costs, of accommodation and staffing, are not affected appreciably by sitting times. These figures do not include the cost of paying Members' salaries or allowances, which are not normally regarded as part of the cost of running the House itself.

 The estimate of the annual cost and total value of empty properties owned by the Department and its agencies for the last four years is set out in the table. The figures relate solely to the former ES part of the DWP estate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on progress of the consultations with local authority associations on the recovery of overpaid housing benefit from landlords further to paragraph 38 of the response by the DSS to the Social Security Committee report on housing benefit Cm4869.  [30629]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20313w15.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Following consultation with the local authority associations, we amended housing benefit regulations to change the rule that overpaid benefit was in all cases recoverable from the person to whom it was paid. From 1 October 2001 where the landlord has been responsible for alerting the local authority in writing to the suspected overpayment, there appears to have been a fraud, and there is no evidence of landlord collusion, any resulting overpayment will not be recoverable from the landlord.
<P>

<a name="20313w15.html_para9">Landlords have an important role in preventing fraud. Those receiving direct payments of benefit already had a statutory responsibility to report changes in their tenant's circumstances, which they could have reasonably been expected to know. This measure encourages landlords to be vigilant and report their suspicions of fraud without fear of financial disincentive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20313w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The assessment of disablement for the purposes of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit was introduced in 1948 by the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946 on recommendations made by the Beveridge report. This principle is a fundamental part of the industrial injuries scheme and has been carried through to the current legislation, which is covered at schedule 6 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. Further definition of the principles of assessment and prescribed degrees of disablement are in Schedule 2 of the Social Security (General Benefit) Regulations 1982.
<P>

<a name="20313w15.html_para10">The assessment of disablement is made by comparing the person claiming benefit with a person of the same age and sex whose physical and mental condition is normal. If, as in the case of a spinal injury, the degree of disablement is not prescribed within the regulations, the medical assessor will try to equate the disablement to those covered in the schedule.

 <i>[holding answer 5 and 6 February 2002]:</i> The available information on the breakdown of incidents in the last five years is set out in the table. The figures reflect the improvements that have been made in recent years in gathering statistics on incidents. In recent years a possible under-reporting of incidents concerned both management and trade unions. An improved reporting form was introduced in April 1999, followed by a campaign by the Public and Commercial Services Union on reporting during 2000. The rise in reported incidents in the years from 1999 reflects this. As well as verbal abuse or threatening behaviour, non-physical incidents include cases of customers fighting or arguing with each other, in which no member of staff was involved, and occasions when only equipment or furniture was damaged. Employment Service offices are visited by around 25 million people per year and Benefits Agency offices by around 20 million.

 We will provide extra funding through the housing benefit subsidy system, worth around &#163;10 million in 2002&#150;03, to help local authorities house homeless people in self-contained temporary accommodation rather than in bed and breakfast hotels.
<P>

<P>

<a name="20313w16.html_para6">From April 2002, we will raise the 12.5 per cent. reimbursement rate to 95 per cent. for leased and licensed accommodation, while keeping it unchanged for bed and breakfasts.
<P>

<a name="20313w16.html_para7">Paying full subsidy up to the cap should make private sector leasing an affordable option even in expensive areas, building on the significant increase in thresholds and caps that we introduced last year. It will give councils a major incentive to shift away from using bed and breakfast accommodation, benefiting thousands of homeless families. And we are considering strengthening that incentive further from April 2003, once authorities have had time to respond to the new arrangements: for example, by reducing the 12.5 per cent. subsidy on bed and breakfast rents.

<a name="20313w16.html_para13">Standard 1 of the National Service Framework for Mental Health requires local services to develop and implement coherent strategies to combat discrimination against people with mental health problems and to promote their social inclusion. The Department of Health is working closely with the Department for Work and Pensions to find ways of providing active help and encouragement for them to move into work; taking the obstacles to work out of the benefits system; making sure that work pays; and promoting radical change in the workplace to ensure equality and opportunity.

1. Income-related benefits include income support (IS), jobseeker's allowance (income based), family credit (FC) and disability working allowance (DWA). IS, jobseeker's allowance (JSA) and FC figures are based on 5 per cent. samples and are subject to a degree of sampling variation. DWA figures are from 100 per cent. count.<P>

2. JSA was introduced in October 1996 to replace unemployment benefit and IS for the unemployed.<P>

3. FC and DWA were replaced by tax credits in October 1999 which are the responsibility of the Inland Revenue.<P>

4. Pension age is defined as cases where the recipient and/or partner is aged 60 and over for IS and JSA and the recipient is aged 60 and over for DWA and FC. Working age is defined as cases where both the recipient and partner are under age 60 for IS and JSA and the recipient is aged under 60 for DWA and FC.<P>

<P>
<a name="20313w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 People who claim a state incapacity benefit will at some point have their entitlement reviewed under the personal capability assessment (PCA). A lack of good quality information about a customer's medical condition can in some cases mean that seriously ill people, who should be completely exempted from the PCA procedures, are not identified as early as they could be. We also believe that better quality medical information would enable more customers to be correctly assessed under the PCA without the need for a medical examination.
<P>

<a name="20313w17.html_para2">Currently the customer's own doctor, usually their general practitioner (GP) will be asked to provide the Department's medical officer with a short factual report or a special statement containing clinical details. Working in collaboration with the Department's contractor, SchlumbergerSema Medical Services, we are currently piloting an alternative evidence gathering procedure in the Sheffield and Rotherham areas. With the permission of customers and GPs in the pilot areas, we are testing whether using GP medical records will provide the Department's medical officer with better factual information to advise the decision maker. We will be carefully evaluating this pilot to see whether there are benefits in terms of improved customer service and more robust and accurate decision making. The evaluation will be used to inform any future decisions on the use of GP casenotes in relation to benefit assessments.

<a name="20313w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 This Department fully recognises chronic fatigue syndrome as a potentially very disabling condition. Guidance to Medical Services doctors, who carry out assessments on behalf of the Department, and to decision makers who determine entitlement to benefits, exists in the Disability Handbook. The second edition, published in 1998, contains a section on chronic fatigue syndrome, which was written in discussion with experts in this area, including the ME Association. Guidance also exists in the report of the chief medical adviser's expert group on chronic fatigue, published in 1998.

We hope that a further four will reach their Completion Point in the next six months. Of the remaining 13 countries, Sierra Leone is expected to qualify this month. However, further progress on the remaining 10 eligible countries (Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Comoros, Republic of Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan and Togo) will be difficult, as they either are affected by conflict or have governance problems.

 Afghanistan has long been one of the countries most severely affected by land mines and Unexploded Ordnance (UXO). In the year 2000 an average of about 88 mine and UXO casualties were recorded each month. During 2000 a total of approximately 13,500 antipersonnel mines, 600 anti-tank mines and 300,000 items of UXO were destroyed.

its operations. The Mine Action Programme for Afghanistan (MAPA) is now completing a period of retraining and is resuming operations wherever possible. In many areas mine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) clearance operations have returned close to the level that existed before 11 September. In addition, the process of expanding capacity to address the UXO threat has begun. The priorities for UNMAS in 2002 are the execution of emergency operations throughout the country and a subsequent return to 100 per cent. operational capacity, and to expand mine clearance capacity as resources become available.

<a name="20313w18.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Emergency food provision in Afghanistan is primarily channelled through the UN World Food Programme (WFP). Needs have been met in most areas, but there remain pockets of unmet need in places difficult to access due to poor weather and insecurity. Badghis province is one of the most remote and seriously drought-affected areas in Afghanistan. Parts of Badghis are extremely difficult to access in the winter months.
<P>

<a name="20313w18.html_para5">Since September 2001, WFP has dispatched and distributed more than 56,000 metric tonnes of food in the western provinces of Afghanistan, including Badghis, to assist an average of 1.3 million people per month. Remote areas in the west of Afghanistan have received enough food to last up to the end of March.
<P>

<a name="20313w18.html_para6">In addition, WFP is deploying six helicopter-borne rapid assessment teams for assessment and delivery of emergency aid to remote areas, including parts of Badghis province. The teams are tasked with streamlining food aid operations, assessing health conditions, investigating non-food emergency needs, monitoring food distribution and verifying reports by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on earlier food deliveries. If necessary, the helicopters will also allow WFP to airlift a limited amount of food aid on an emergency basis.

 <i>[holding answer 1 February 2002]:</i> We estimate lifetime earnings profiles for individuals "who have participated in an undergraduate higher education course" (whether they graduated or not) using statistical simulation models and current employment and earnings data. The table shows the estimated distribution of undergraduate participant lifetime earnings, relative to the average of those "who do not hold a higher education qualification". Lifetime earnings are based on earnings between the ages of 18 and 59 years.

The two comparison groups are not mutually exclusive, and both potentially include individuals who may have participated in higher education but did not subsequently obtain a qualification.

 The Joint Infrastructure Fund (JIF), which provided a total of &#163;750 million for research infrastructure in science and technology, had no general requirement for matched funding.

SRIF has a requirement that 25 per cent. of the overall cost of a project is met by external contributions, except where there are partnerships between higher education institutions. HEFCE monitors the financial health of higher education institutions and has no concerns about the financial health of any institution in relation to JIF and SRIF requirements.

 Section 8 of the Civil Service Management Code requires Departments and agencies to ensure that staff use the most efficient and economic means of travel in the circumstances, taking into account any management benefit or the needs of staff with disabilities. In line with that, the Department's policy is that all staff should consider travelling standard class unless they have a special need related to their work.

 The Film Council has undertaken a major initiative to increase the level of film activity in England under its England-wide Strategy. The most significant development within the north-east in response has been the creation of Northern Film and Media (NFM), which has developed a strategy for film in the region for the first time. Whilst NFM is responsible for activity right across the spectrum of film&#151;exhibition and education as well as production&#151;it is already dedicating substantial effort to supporting production companies and film making within the region. NFM also acts as a conduit between film makers in the north-east and Film Council-run film production funds and is expected to increase the take-up of these funds by north-east companies and individuals. In the next financial year NFM will directly invest over &#163;1.1 million in the development of people, companies and projects in the north-east.

<P>
<a name="20313w26.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government take their responsibilities for this country's World Heritage Sites very seriously. This was reflected in the Government's statement, The Historic Environment: A Force for Our Future (AFFOF), published on 13 December 2001, which included a commitment to complete management plans for all of England's current World Heritage Sites by the end of this year. We plan to publish an implementation plan to take forward the AFFOF agenda, including this commitment, shortly.
<P>

<a name="20313w26.html_para0">AFFOF followed on from the publication on 12 December 2001 of a Green Paper on the effectiveness of the existing planning system. This Paper is providing an opportunity for representations to be made on how best to safeguard the future of our World Heritage Sites through that system.
<P>

<a name="20313w26.html_para1">The management teams at our World Heritage Sites are, of course, eligible to apply for English Heritage and heritage lottery fund grants in the usual way.

 The medal is being issued to serving members of the armed forces and Royal Fleet Auxiliary and to the '999' emergency services. Eligibility is restricted to those who completed a minimum of five years' reckonable service on 6 February 2002&#151;the 50th anniversary of the Queen's Accession. The detailed criteria for distribution are being worked out. The Prison Service is not an emergency service and therefore does not come within the criteria for the issue of the medal.

<a name="20313w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Comprehensive information on applications for lottery grants is not centrally held at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). However, research commissioned from Sheffield Hallam University by DCMS and Lottery distributors, which was published in 1999, found that coalfield areas had generated 2.5 fewer applications per 10,000 people than the national average.

 <i>[holding answer 11 March 2002]:</i> The framework for independent radio licensing is contained in the Broadcasting Acts of 1990 and 1996, which set out the broad procedures which the Radio Authority must follow when advertising and awarding licences. The legislation includes general provisions for the authority to do all it can to secure a range and diversity of services, calculated to appeal to a variety of tastes and interests. In awarding individual local licences, the authority also has to consider how far the service would broaden the range of programmes available in the area by way of independent local radio services and, in particular, serve tastes and interests not already provided for.
<P>

<a name="20313w26.html_para2">In respect of the BBC, they must apply to the Secretary of State for any new radio services. The Secretary of State will then assess any proposal against the criteria set out in the public service approvals guidelines. These include distinctiveness (in programming and content) of the proposed BBC service from those provided by other broadcasters.

<P>

<a name="20313w27.html_para8">(iii) All sites where freehold or leasehold title has transferred to QinetiQ are subject to a clawback arrangement contractually agreed with the MOD. This limits QinetiQ's ability to make abnormal profits on disposal. The clawback agreement was based on the valuations conducted by GVA Grimley in 2001, with an allowance for inflation over the 12-year period of the agreement. It provides for MOD to share a proportion of any additional receipts above this value; this proportion starts at 50 per cent. and decreases gradually over the life of the agreement.
<P>

<a name="20313w27.html_para9">This clawback agreement provides an appropriate balance between sharing future benefits from estate sales and incentivising the company to manage its assets efficiently.
<P>

<a name="20313w27.html_para10"><i>(b)</i> Due to the volume involved, it is not possible to list all the Intellectual Property (IP) transferred to QinetiQ (e.g. over 3,000 patents that have been assigned to the company).
<P>

<a name="20313w27.html_para11">The basic principal adopted was that QinetiQ should be put in the same position as any other defence contractor, i.e. where IP had been generated within that part of DERA that was to become QinetiQ then QinetiQ should own the IPR. As with the rest of industry, MOD retains free user rights where public money was used to create the IP.
<P>

<a name="20313w27.html_para12">(i) and (ii) There was no valuation attributed to the IP at vesting as value will be realised within the value of future sales of MOD's shareholdings.
<P>

<a name="20313w27.html_para13">(iii) IP clawback provision has not been provided in this PPP. This mirrors MOD policy, which is not to include any form of levy agreement when letting contracts for research and technology with other parts of industry, the reason for this being that in contrast to equipment it is virtually impossible to trace the research and technology that may have been used to generate future revenue. As a significant shareholder in QinetiQ for the next few years, we believe that the freedom and encouragement to exploit results commercially represents better overall value for money than pursuing a clawback arrangement where the extent of bureaucracy would be great and the potential returns difficult to obtain.

 The Harrier GR7 fleet will undergo two upgrade programmes over the next few years. First, 30 aircraft will be upgraded to GR7a standard by the integration of the Pegasus Mk107 engine.

These aircraft will be designated Harrier GR9 and GR9a. Although the detailed content of the GR9 programme and the associated procurement strategy have yet to be finalised, it is estimated that the total cost will be approximately &#163;330 million, of which 75% relates to routine maintenance and modification work being undertaken concurrently with the upgrade to minimise costs.

The advertising figure for 1998&#150;99 includes &#163;1 million spent on a consular advertising campaign in the run-up to the World Cup 1998 in France. The figures for press and public relations include expenditure on public relations firms as part of FCO information campaigns.

 The Lord Chancellor's Department promulgated the Guidelines during Spring 2001. A survey was carried out in the late autumn 2001 on the use and effectiveness of the guidelines. This has shown that they have been broadly well received and have resulted in a generally heightened focus on domestic violence issues. However, there are indications that awareness of the guidelines is patchy, and that more contact centres are needed. The Department is taking steps to address these issues. Copies of the analysis of the survey, including the action to be taken, have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

 The Public Record Office and QinetiQ carried out independent quality assurance checks on a proportion of the electronic pages (images) on all reels of transcribed data. Each reel of data was subject to two checks. A 10 per cent. sample was checked for functionality and data integrity. If it was below the accuracy rate required it was reworked. A separate 2 per cent. sample of each reel was then checked for accuracy of transcription. If the reel failed this test, then the whole reel was checked. Out of 2,152 reels of data, 85 per cent. were subject to this full check.

 The QinetiQ Ltd team, including Enterprise and Supply Services (ESS), was formed in the initial stages of tendering for the 1901 Census project. The team was formed by QinetiQ from parties considered to be able to offer the best quality and value for money. ESS undertook the transcription of the 1901 Census returns. However to complete the transcription work to the standards and timescales required it became clear that additional resources needed to be employed. A proportion of this work was sub-contracted by ESS, after full competitive tendering, to commercial data input companies based in India, Sri Lanka (Hays Document Management) and in the UK (Atos Origin). All transcription was quality assessed by the Public Record Office and edited where appropriate regardless of where it had been transcribed.
