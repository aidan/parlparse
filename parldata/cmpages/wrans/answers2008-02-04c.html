1. The emissions figures in the table are in the common format of &#145;weight of carbon dioxide&#146;; to convert to &#145;weight of carbon&#146; figures should be multiplied by a factor of 12/44.<br>
2. Domestic aviation includes all departures from UK airports flying to another UK airport. International aviation includes all departures from a UK airport flying to a destination outside of the UK. These will carry both UK and foreign passengers.<br>
3. The aviation CO2 emissions capture only those from the first leg of a flight (e.g. emissions for a passenger flying from London to Australia via Singapore will only reflect London to Singapore).<br>
4. The aviation CO2 emissions are only those from departing aircraft (excluding military aircraft) and therefore the figures in the table do not reflect emissions from surface access nor emissions from airport buildings. Emissions from freighter aircraft have been allocated to passengers in these illustrative figures.<br>
5. The CO2 emissions do not account for non- CO2 climate change effects of aviation emissions.<br>

<i> [holding answer 24 January 2008]:</i> Without accounting for the impact of policy measures, analysis suggests that emissions of carbon dioxide from UK transport would continue to increase to 2020. However, by implementing the policy measures quantified in the 2006 Climate Change programme and the 2007 Energy White Paper, domestic emissions from transport are projected to be up to 20 per cent. lower in 2020 than they would have been in the absence of these measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="80204w0011.htm_para5"><a name="08020423000326">Because of the uncertainty of long-term forecasting, the Government have constructed a number of scenarios to model the costs of achieving long-term emission reductions. In the central scenario from the UK &#147;MARKAL-Macro&#148; model reported in the 2007 Energy White Paper, (under which the UK achieves a 60 per cent. reduction in domestic CO2 emissions by 2050), the transport sector sees emission reductions from 2000 levels of about 5 per cent. by 2020, and of about 45 per cent. by 2050.</p>

We expect that once the new fleet of submarines comes into service the annual in-service costs of the UK&#146;s nuclear deterrent, including the costs of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, will be similar to today (around 5 to 6 per cent. of the defence budget).</p>

 Between September 2005 and July 2006, the Home Office spent approximately &#163;400,000 on staff costs (representing a team of permanent, temporary and seconded staff averaging 10 people during this period), approximately &#163;20,000 on legal costs and approximately &#163;800,000 on consultancy for assessing and refining the police structures business cases. Other Home Office officials and special advisers made contributions to work on police restructuring as part of routine business and those costs could not be identified separately. Information on the full costs incurred by police forces on this work is not available. However, all police authorities were invited to submit claims for the additional costs incurred in the early preparations for police force mergers. On 30 October 2006, I announced in a written statement to Parliament the amounts to be offered towards those costs amounting to &#163;3,997,200 in total. The amounts offered to each police authority are set out in the following table. Payment of these contributions was dependent on confirmation being received from each police authority that their claims had been made in accordance with the terms of the invitation. These payments have been made to all police authorities to whom the offers were made<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 December 200</i><i> 7</i><i> ]:</i><i> </i>The statistics provided in the previous answer related to all racially or religiously aggravated offences recorded by the police. The police data (i.e. offences recorded) are based on the number of crimes recorded in each financial year. Convictions data are based on the number of offender convictions and is published on a calendar year basis. Convictions figures are counts of offenders classified by their principal offence.

The functions that Regional Ministers undertake are mostly clustered around the responsibilities of the Government offices and the RDAs, particularly in relation to economic development, although they do have a more general ambassadorial role.</p>

While Manchester will clearly have an interest in the findings of the review, the response is not specific to alternatives to a regional casino in east Manchester&#151;it applies to deprived areas more broadly.</p>

 Local authority rough sleeping counts are conducted in accordance with methodology agreed with and independently verified by the voluntary sector. We recognise that those counted on a single night do not represent all those who may have experienced sleeping rough over the course of a year, but street counts enable effective measurement of trends in rough sleeping over time and across regions. CHAIN (Combined Homelessness and Information Network) is another valuable source of rough sleeping information which is based on outreach team contact with rough sleepers in London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="80204w0029.htm_para3"><a name="08020429000525">There are a number of initiatives currently under way which have already shown average reductions of 8.5 per cent. in electricity consumption and 23 per cent. in fossil fuel consumption over the past two years. This equates to an overall reduction of 16.9 per cent. in our indirect carbon dioxide emissions in the same period. So far we have concentrated on our larger sites, which represent two-thirds of our overall energy consumption. This programme is ongoing, will be expanded to our smaller sites,, and continues to make a significant impact on emissions.</p>

3. The figures are based on OECD equalisation factors.<br>
4. The preferred measure of low income for pensioners is by using a threshold of 60 per cent. of the contemporary median income after housing costs. This is consistent with indicators that will be monitored as part of PSA Delivery Agreement 17.<br>

2. Estimates are of incorrectness, so include both overpayments and underpayments.<br>
3. Estimates are rounded to the nearest 1,000. An entry of zero indicates an estimate of less than 500.<br>
4. There is some overlap between the fraud and error categories, as it is possible for example for an official to make an error on a case that is already fraudulent. This means that the customer error and official error estimates should not be summed to give an overall error estimate.<br>

<i>  [holding answer 31 January 2008]:</i><i> </i>Caring for children and young people with diabetes is fundamentally different from providing services for adults. It is a complex process that must be focused firmly on the child or young person and their family and/or other carers, supported by the skills and experiences of a wide range of healthcare professionals.</p>

The Department therefore has no plans to implement a screening programme for type 1 diabetes in children. The onset of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes develops quickly, and they usually require immediate medical attention.</p>

 Dental fluorosis is characterised by a flecking, or more rarely a mottling, of teeth, often only visible when teeth are dried. If severe, it may give some people concern about the appearance of their teeth. It does not, however, affect the extra resistance to dental decay provided by exposure to fluoride. It is often caused by very young children swallowing fluoride toothpaste unsupervised. When parents or dentists make inquiries, they are referred to advice contained in &#147;Delivering Better Oral Health: An evidence based toolkit for prevention&#148;, which was issued to all national health service general dental practices in November 2007.

 To date, experience of researching fluorosis shows that there are wide differences in subjective assessments even when they are made by dentists on dried teeth. We are therefore supporting a research project on the use of intra-oral cameras to assess the extent of fluorosis. If, as we expect, the research shows that the measurement of dental fluorosis can be standardised, we will undertake a further study of its prevalence and aesthetic impact.</p>

The deadline for extension of the 31-day standard for radiotherapy is December 2010. This is in recognition of the length of time needed to increase radiotherapy capacity, for example building bunkers and purchasing and installing machinery. At present, we have monitoring systems only to capture achievement against the 31-day standard for first treatments, as this is the current standard. We do not currently have data for second and subsequent treatments but we are developing systems which will allow the capture of information on achievement of the standard for radiotherapy by area before the achievement deadline.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister stated on 19 November 2007 that in order to remove the barriers to the deployment of onshore and offshore wind farms, he has asked my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Defence and the Secretary of State for Transport and myself to step up efforts in cooperation with industry and the regulators to identify and test technical solutions to the potential difficulties that wind farms pose to air traffic and defence radar. The Department is facilitating the resolution of these concerns. We have established groups to improve the understanding of the issues and to initiate programmes of work to identify, develop and implement mitigation solutions to reduce the impacts of wind turbines on radar. It is our aim to establish a range of mitigation solutions that can be considered and, where appropriate, utilised to allow the removal of objections to wind applications in respect to their potential impacts on radar. We are working closely with the various aviation stakeholders and the wind sector to drive these initiatives forward.</p>

 The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) commissioned a five-year independent evaluation of the academies programme by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in 2003. The aim of the evaluation is to assess the overall effectiveness of the programme in terms of its contribution to educational standards, including the impact of academies on neighbouring schools. The first four reports have already been published and the fifth and final report will be published in summer 2008.</p>

 Building Schools for the Future aims to renew all secondary schools in England where there is need, in 15 waves of investment which started in 2005-06, including those in Kent. The first Kent project has been prioritised in wave three, and approximately &#163;240 million has already been allocated to it. This funding will be used to transform 10 schools, improving the learning environments for thousands of young people. Kent is also prioritised in wave four, but the project is not yet sufficiently progressed for funding to be allocated. It will have further projects in later waves, prioritised on social and educational need.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families pursuant to the answer of 12 November 2007, on Pre-School Education: Teachers, what results emerged from the modelling undertaken by his Department to determine the demand for teachers, including those with experience and knowledge of the early years, in the period 2008 to 2011.

<i> [holding answer 29 January 2008]:</i> Our Teacher Supply Model takes account of a range of factors that determine how many teacher training places we need to set for future years. One of the most important is the number of pupils needing to be taught and our projections of these use data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This shows an increase in births and a need for more teachers beyond 2009/10, so we have increased the targets given to the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) for teacher training places in the infant/primary phase. We will be revalidating these assumptions in 2009, based on the latest ONS data available, and will make any adjustments necessary. Another modelling exercise to forecast demand from 2011/12 to 2013/14 will begin in 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"><a name="80204w0043.htm_para0"><a name="0802052000980">The TDA has already allocated 1,760 places to training providers offering courses to those wishing to teach foundation stage and key stage 1 in each of the three years; an increase from 1,610 in 2007/08. It will allocate more places later to provide for the growth in 2009/10 and 2010/11 when there is better indication of regional and key stage demand.</p>

 Information on the family circumstances of pupils has been gathered on a number of occasions when it has been directly relevant to the wider aims of a research study. There is no direct and simple way of establishing which research studies have gathered information on family circumstances and it would involve a disproportionate effort to do so, but as examples of the sort of information gathered, the London Challenge Parents questionnaire asked a sample of parents of 9 to 16-year-olds in London schools about home ownership, income, employment and number of people in the family, and the Youth Cohort study has regularly asked a national sample of 16 to 21-year-olds about their health, whether they looked after any other family members and whether they had any housing or family problems. The published reports of these and other individual studies are available through the Department's Research and Statistics Gateway on its website.</p>

 I agree that it is vital to ensure the safety and well-being of those children and young people who run away from home or care, and to tackle the underlying causes that lead to running away.</p>

These issues were addressed in the Every Child Matters Green Paper and the subsequent Change for Children programme. Last year, we commissioned the Children&#146;s Society to assess how far these changes had in fact improved services for young runaways, and to identify what more needed to be done. We received their report &#147;Stepping Up&#148; in the autumn and, in response, we have established a cross-departmental working group on young runaways, to co-ordinate the Government&#146;s work on young runaways.</p>

The action plan will cover emergency accommodation provision, recognising the need for young runaways to have safe places or &#145;breathing spaces&#146; to go to in a crisis, and the Missing from Home and Care guidance, to support local areas in delivering effective services for young runaways.</p>

A new indicator on young people who run away from home or care has been included in the National Indicator Set, to be measured from 2009. The working group will consider what data collections will best support this indicator, and their conclusions will be represented in the action plan.</p>

The school admissions code allows schools to use a number of ways to allocate places if they are oversubscribed, including random allocation. This is not new&#151;it has long been acceptable to use these criteria.

In addition, changes in the reporting methods used to record franchising arrangements between Higher Education Institutions and Further Education Colleges may have contributed to the changes in numbers. Franchising is a process where students take a course delivered by an institution on behalf of another institution and this often occurs between Higher Education Institutions and Further Education Colleges.</p>

These meetings generally took place in either Government premises or at the offices of the organisation concerned, and commonly lasted for an hour or so.

 We announced in July last year that from academic year 2008/09 we will substantially increase the number of students entitled to non-repayable maintenance grants. The minimum household income for a full maintenance grant of &#163;2,835 a year will be extended from &#163;17,910 in 2007/08 to &#163;25,000 in 2008/09. The maximum household income for a partial maintenance grant has been raised from &#163;38,300 in 2007/08 to &#163;60,005 in 2008/09. By 2011, the number of students receiving some level of grant will increase by 100,000. As part of this change, an extra 50,000 students will receive a full grant. In total, around two thirds of eligible students will be entitled to a full or partial grant each year&#151;compared to around a half now. The new grant arrangements will be available to all eligible 2008/09 entrants, including those who have deferred entry from academic year 2007/08. The aim of these new arrangements is to ensure that everyone with the potential to progress into higher education has the financial support to do so, no matter what their background.</p>

 Student loans have very different features to commercial loans. Graduates with income contingent loans (ICL) only repay once they are in work and only when their annual income reaches &#163;15,000. Interest is charged at the rate of inflation, so students only pay back in real terms the amount they originally borrowed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_458"><a name="80204w0046.htm_para5"><a name="0802052001494">This is achieved by linking the interest rate for student loans to the annual rate of inflation as defined by the retail prices index (RPI). The interest rate is recalculated each year at the beginning of September using the RPI figure from the previous March. This methodology ensures that over time the student loan interest rate will be equivalent to the rate of inflation but with a time lag.</p>

Although the underlying RPI rate has fallen since March, and is now below the 2007/08 student loan interest rate, this works both ways. In other years, the time-lag will benefit borrowers, as it did in 2006/07. Over time, peaks and troughs even out, and borrowers repay no more in real terms than they borrow.</p>

There are several reasons for this increase: nearly all prisoners on licence can now be recalled to prison executively by the Secretary of State. Prior to 1998, prisoners serving less than four years could be recalled only by the courts, a slow and bureaucratic process that was rarely used. The Probation Service has become far more effective in enforcing licence conditions. In 1997 appropriate enforcement action was taken in only a third of cases where the offender breached a sentence being served in the community. This figure was over 90 per cent. in 2007; and there is more robust supervision of high risk  <br>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences are less than complete.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>
