To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received on the future of London Transport travelcards, with particular reference to full-time students; and if he will make a statement. [35522]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Strang: </B> 
 The Government have received a number of representations about the future of the London Transport Travelcard, including some from the University of London Union, which were specifically about discount schemes for full-time students. I understand that a recent trial revealed that, while a discount scheme would be workable, it would only be partly self-funding. In the light of this, London Transport (LT) were not sufficiently persuaded of the benefits to proceed.
<P>

<a name="80402w01.html_para0">Fares and ticketing, including student tickets, are the statutory responsibility of London Transport. On 4 January 1998, LT introduced a new ticket, providing a 30% discount for all 16 and 17 year olds on period LT cards, which can be used on Underground, LT Buses and Docklands Light Railway services.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what safety procedures are required during railway line maintenance; and what measures are taken to ensure that they are enforced.  [35540]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Strang: </B> 
 All those involved in the maintenance of the railway throughout Great Britain must comply with their obligations under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, Railways (Safety Case) Regulations 1994 and the Railways (Safety Critical Work) Regulations 1994. Work on Railtrack's network must comply with the requirements of their Rule Book and the Railway Standards (the provisions of which are mandatory on Railtrack PLC and its contractors by virtue of Railtrack's Railway Safety Case and related contractual arrangements).
<P>

<a name="80402w01.html_para1">Inspectors of the Health and Safety Executive's Railway Inspectorate are responsible for enforcing legal requirements relating to health and safety on the railways, including the detailed requirements of the Railways (Safety Case) Regulations 1994.

<a name="80402w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Forecasts using the Department's strategic multi-modal transport model, known as "LTS", suggest that traffic volumes in the peak periods will be around 15% higher by 2011 within the Greater London area. For the inter-peak period, traffic is estimated to grow by 20%. These forecasts take no account of policies that will follow the Government's forthcoming White Paper on Integrated Transport.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 During the course of the Government's Roads Review consultation, we received over 60 written responses about Hindhead issues. I also responded to an adjournment debate on 19 January 1998 about the A3 at Hindhead and two Parliamentary Questions on the same subject.
<P>

<a name="80402w01.html_para2">The Government's strategic review into highway improvement schemes presently taking place is aimed at determining the role which roads will play in an integrated transport policy, and developing a strategy which will address the problems of congestion and pollution and improve the environment in which we live.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will assess the <i>(a)</i> benefits and <i>(b)</i> disadvantages of giving local planning authorities the power to determine planning applications on Crown land when the land for development (i) is in the Green Belt, (ii) is in a designated area of outstanding natural beauty and (iii) would conflict with policies in adopted structure or local plans; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 This Government believe that it is usually most appropriate for local planning authorities to determine planning applications, whether such applications come from the Crown or from any other body. That is why we shall remove the Crown's immunity from statutory planning controls as soon as a suitable legislative opportunity arises.
<P>

<a name="80402w01.html_para4">In the mean time, the Secretary of State, when determining disputes which arise when a local planning authority objects to a notice of proposed development issued by a Crown body in accordance with the provisions of DOE Circular 18/84, will continue to have regard to the adopted local plan, and such other matters as the need to protect the green belt and other areas of outstanding natural beauty. Applications for planning permission under s299 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 which the Crown may be required to make to local planning authorities will continue to be determined in the usual way.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if Northern Ireland will be included within the remit of his Department's research project into how driving instructors are <i>(a)</i> trained and <i>(b)</i> tested.  [36813]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The operation of the register of Approved Driving Instructors in Northern Ireland has not been included in terms of the research project we have recently commissioned. However, the Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency will, I understand, look closely at whether the study's findings could be applied in Northern Ireland. The research project will be completed in 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w01.html_spnew7"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We have been working closely with the Local Government Association (LGA) to encourage all local authorities in England to produce and review their Local Agenda 21 strategies by 2000 to meet the Prime Minister's target. When launching in January with the Prime Minister, the joint document showing why and how to produce such strategies, the Chairman of the LGA asked all authorities to send him a copy of their first or revised strategy by 15 December 2000. We believe it is right for the LGA rather than central Government to take the lead in monitoring the production of such strategies and encouraging the sharing of good practice.

<P>
<a name="80402w01.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 My department has had no recent correspondence with Cheshire about their Local Authority Waste Disposal Company (LAWDC) 3C Waste. Cheshire completed divestment of their waste disposal facilities and functions to 3C on 1 February 1993. 3C is still 100 per cent. owned by the County Council but I

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what communications his Department has had with Cheshire County Council about local waste disposal policy. [37082]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w01.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Officials in my department commented on Cheshire's draft Waste Local Plan in November last year. It appeared to conform with the most recent statement of Government policy on waste management, the 1995 White Paper Making Waste Work. The Council are now considering these and others' comments. I understand that the Deposit Waste Local Plan will be published later this year. A six week public consultation period and a public local inquiry chaired by a independent inspector will follow as normal.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w01.html_wqn10"><B> Sir Alastair Goodlad: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is his Department's policy towards <i>(a)</i> incineration, <i>(b)</i> landraising and <i>(c)</i> landfill, as a method of waste disposal.  [37083]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w01.html_spnew10"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 This Government are aiming for more sustainable waste management with high standards of environmental protection. Incineration with energy recovery is, in principle, and in accordance with the waste management hierarchy, preferable to landfilling (including landraising). However, which option is employed for a particular waste stream and in a particular area depends on the Best Practicable Environmental Option.
<P>

<a name="80402w01.html_para5">On 13 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>160</i>, my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment announced a review of sustainable waste management policies which will culminate in a statutory waste strategy. A consultation paper will be issued in May.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what communications his Department has had with North West local authorities about options for future waste disposal in the Mersey Belt; and if he will make a statement.  [37084]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w01.html_spnew11"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Government Office for the North West have asked local authorities through the North West Regional Association (Regional Planning Conference) to provide a report on the facilities for the disposal of waste in the North West Region. According to RPG13, the region should seek to provide a network of waste management facilities located, wherever possible, in close proximity to the source of the arisings and that these should be identified in Development Plans. The NWRA are preparing the report and will forward it to the Regional Office in due course.
<P>

<a name="80402w01.html_para6">In addition, officials from the Government Office for the North West regularly attend Local Authority Recycling Officers forums and the North West Central Region recycling forum, to discuss waste and recycling issues with officers from all of the authorities in the area.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w01.html_spnew12"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Health and safety regulations made under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 generally apply to landfill sites where there is employment. Regulations place duties on employers, the self-employed, and others, in relation to the management of health and safety and risks arising from, for example machinery, processes and work activities. The application of specific regulations made under that Act will depend on the nature of the work activity.
<P>

<a name="80402w01.html_para7">In addition, the following legislation, which has some health and safety impact, may also apply: the Environment Protection Act 1990; the Fire Precautions Act 1971; and the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, if pesticides are used.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 There are two main elements to the enforcement of vehicle roadworthiness in Wales, as in the rest of Great Britain. Almost all vehicles are required to pass an annual roadworthiness test to confirm that key safety and environmental standards are met. Vehicles are also subject to random enforcement checks by examiners from the Department's Vehicle Inspectorate and the police. The Inspectorate prohibits the use of vehicles found not to comply with construction and use or lighting requirements until the defects have been rectified (almost 15 per cent. of vehicles checked during 1996-97 in the South Wales Area were given prohibitions). The police assist the Inspectorate but also carry out enforcement under their own initiatives.

<a name="80402w02.html_para6">The risks are average estimates from working populations with a mixture of smokers and non-smokers. Smoking does not affect the risks for mesothelioma but smokers are estimated to have a 50 per cent. higher risk of lung cancer than shown in the table and non-smokers a risk about ten times lower. Based on past smoking patterns, women's average risk will be about half the average male risk.

<a name="80402w02.html_para8">The environmental risk from asbestos has been examined in a report commissioned by Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions from the Medical Research Council's Institute for Environmental Health--'Fibrous Materials in the Environment'. The report identifies background ambient levels of respirable asbestos fibres may range from 0.000001 to 0.0001 f/ml. Most indoor air concentrations of asbestos are below 0.0002 f/ml which rises to around 0.0005 f/ml in buildings which contain asbestos in good condition. At these low levels of exposure, there is no significant risk of mesothelioma or lung cancer. Cigarette smoking remains the major cause of cancer.

 The decision of the Health and Safety Commission (HSC) to delay consultation on further restrictions on the use of chrysotile asbestos was taken in the light of an interim opinion by a European Commission Scientific Committee. This Committee concluded that insufficient evidence had been provided to justify a conclusion that substitute fibres are safer than chrysotile. The Government's resolve to pursue further necessary restrictions on chrysotile asbestos remains. HSC is expediting the presentation of further scientific justification for the use of substitutes to the European Commission.

 The Special Waste Regulations, which came into force on 1 September 1996, implement the EC Hazardous Waste Directive (91/689/EEC) which covers the most difficult and dangerous wastes. The Regulations provide for movements of hazardous ("special") waste to be pre-notified to the Environment Agencies and to be tracked through a system of consignment notes.
<P>

<P>

<a name="80402w03.html_para5">At present we are aware of about &#163;52 million of offers which are fairly advanced in the pipeline. However, the level of acceptances depends on whether offering estates wish to maintain that offer, whether Ministers agree to acceptance and whether the Commissioners of Inland Revenue accept the offered property in lieu of the capital taxes applying. Therefore this figure can be only a very broad approximation and it is difficult to give a reliable estimate of how amounts might fall into any single financial year.

<P>

<a name="80402w03.html_para6">Against a background of falling Civil Service numbers, progress continues to be made in this important area. For example, at HEO level, the representation of women has increased to nearly 30 per cent., from 28 per cent. in 1996; ethnic minority representation at first management level, Executive Officer, has risen to 4.8 per cent. from 4.4 per cent. in 1996; and the proportion of staff with disabilities now stands at 3.8 per cent.
<P>

<a name="80402w03.html_para7">However, the reports counsel against complacency. They show that women are still under-represented at middle and senior management levels. Ethnic minority and disabled staff are still predominately concentrated in junior grades.

<P>
<a name="80402w03.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 My Department is fully committed to promoting within the Armed Forces an environment which is free from harassment and racial discrimination. As part of our efforts to further that commitment, we have decided to begin monitoring the ethnic origin of members of the reserve forces. Monitoring began on 1 April, and will cover all those who are in service, and all those who join the reserve forces in future. Altogether, we expect 



<P>
<P><I>2 Apr 1998 : Column: 604</I><P>
around 68,000 members of the reserve forces to be included in the survey. The Services are writing to units and individuals to invite them to take a full part in it.
<P>

<a name="80402w03.html_para9">The initiative we are taking underlines the commitment that the Armed Forces have made to ensure equal opportunities irrespective of race. The methodology we shall follow for monitoring the reserves is based closely on that which is already in use for the regular Armed Forces. The statistical information derived from monitoring will allow the reserve force managers to analyse recruitment, wastage and other trends; and it will enable them to develop and pursue policies which ensure that racial discrimination of any kind is eradicated from the reserves.
<P>

<a name="80402w03.html_para10">The reserve forces involved are principally those which recruit directly from civilian life. Specifically they are: the Royal Naval Reserve; the Royal Marines Reserve; the Territorial Army; the Royal Auxiliary Air Force; the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training); the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (University Air Squadron); and volunteers to the Royal Air Force Reserve.
<P>

<a name="80402w03.html_para11">Because our reserves are recruited locally, and because many of them serve part time, we do not expect the first statistics from the survey to be available until towards the end of this year. Thereafter, the information will be available quarterly.

 On 25 March 1998, the MOD and Commission for Racial Equality signed a Partnership Agreement, which ensures that we shall continue to work together with them for a further five years to promote racial equality practices throughout the Services. Effective Ethnic monitoring is a key part of the Agreement to ensure that no policies or practices in the Services are racially discriminatory. We are determined that the quality of our ethnic monitoring of applicants, entrants and in-Service personnel continues to be improved. As well as looking at current and future analysis for emerging trends, and ensuring that sufficient resources are put into making any necessary changes, we will be looking more closely at areas such as performance across all ethnic groups and career progression as more information becomes available.

 The sale of Belfast International Airport was the subject of a Public Accounts Committee hearing in December 1997. Matters relating to the valuation of Belfast International Airport were addressed at that hearing. The Government cannot comment on the sale until the Committee has reported.

<P>
<a name="80402w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 No. There are no plans to use planning controls to restrict the number of base stations in this way. The sharing of masts etc., reduces the overall numbers required, and their impact on the environment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w05.html_spnew0"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 I have recently concluded a review of the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 which was instigated by the previous Government in November 1995.
<P>

<a name="80402w05.html_para0">The purpose of the review was to take a fresh look at the law to see whether it was relevant, effective and proportionate to today's conditions. It has been a wide-ranging examination with no topic excluded. The principal objectives were to maintain rigorous safety standards and sustain public confidence in the authorities' ability to enforce the law effectively while recognising the reasonable expectations of the responsible shooting community and firearms trade. I believe that the proposals for legislative reform which I am publishing today for wider consultation will meet those objectives. Copies of the Consultation Paper have been made available in the libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="80402w05.html_para1">On the particular issue of handgun controls, I have studied carefully the various recommendations made by Lord Cullen in his report into the terrible events at Dunblane, published in 1996. Although his Tribunal did not inquire into the control of firearms in Northern Ireland, it was only right that I should consider whether his Report contained any important lessons for the Province. I believe it does and my findings are explained at length in the Consultation Paper.
<P>

<a name="80402w05.html_para2">After much thought, I am not persuaded of the need to prohibit the possession and use of target handguns in Northern Ireland. Nor do I believe it would be appropriate to prohibit the possession of handguns licensed by the Chief Constable, for the personal protection of those individuals under threat of attack and their families. I realise that my decision may disappoint some people who feel strongly, as do I, about firearms control and safeguarding the public. But I would ask them and others to consider carefully the far-reaching proposals for improving firearms safety and making the law more effective which I am publishing today, and let me have their views thereon.

<P>
<a name="80402w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Government remain committed to implementing Part II of The Family Law Act 1996. A very extensive series of pilots testing a number of different models of information meetings will operate until at least March 1999. It would be wrong to anticipate 



<P>
<P><I>2 Apr 1998 : Column: 609</I><P>
the results of these pilots. Given the timetable for the pilots, and the inevitable time that will be needed to establish a comprehensive system once a preferred model of information meeting is decided upon, it would be safe to assume that the Lord Chancellor will be unable to implement Part II until at least the end of 1999 or even early in the year 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The European Commission's document COM (97) 609 contributes to work being carried on in the Council to make it easier for individuals and companies to enforce any Member State's civil judgments in any other Member State. The Government broadly support the principles underlying the Commission's proposed measures in part 1 of its document. If implemented, they would necessitate changes to the Brussels Convention of 1968 and the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982. Part 2 of the communication is intended to prompt debate on wider questions relating to the enforcement of judgments in the European Union, but it contains no legislative proposals. The Government will be submitting their comments before the 30 April deadline.

 The Lord Chancellor has agreed to public consultation on the proposed closure of Camborne and Redruth, Evesham, Hemel Hempstead, Poole and Shrewsbury county courts. Following public consultation I and the Lord Chancellor are currently considering whether to approve the closure of Holywell and Rochdale county courts. Managers in the Court Service are constantly reviewing the viability of the court network in the light of changing business needs and workload trends. Other courts may therefore be proposed for closure in the future.

 None. However, Lanarkshire Health Board have received representations on this issue from individual obstetricians, paediatricians and midwives from Monklands and Bellshill Hospitals NHS Trust.

 <i>[holding answer 30 March 1998]:</i> The Financial Statement and Budget Report, released on 17 March, contains an environmental assessment of the Budget measures which will have a significant effect on the environment. The inclusion of the assessment within the Financial Statement and Budget Report demonstrates the Government's commitment to put the environment at the heart of Government policy. The assessment shows that the Budget measures will help to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and improve local air quality.

[36857]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w09.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Our reduced VAT rate relief for energy saving materials is primarily a social measure, allowing less well-off people to stay warmer. Nevertheless, the measure will have small environmental impact.
<P>

<a name="80402w09.html_para0">Any estimate of environmental impact is subject to significant margins of uncertainty, but the likely impact is that between about 3,000 and 7,000 tonnes of carbon will be saved each year, assuming that 40,000 extra 



<P>
<P><I>2 Apr 1998 : Column: 623</I><P>
households have basic energy efficiency measures undertaken as a result of this new relief. By the year 2010, the total annual carbon saving will be between about 35,000 tonnes and 80,000 tonnes.
<P>

<a name="80402w09.html_para1">This measure is not aimed at improving local air quality, but there may be some small benefit as a result of lower fuel consumption. A range of other measures in the Budget will have a much greater impact in terms of local air quality--for example, the duty rises for standard diesel, and vehicle excise duty discounts for clean lorries and buses.

 National Savings, which has a key role in helping to fund the Government's borrowing requirements as efficiently as possible, has been carrying out a wide ranging programme to modernise the organisation against a background of a fast-moving and highly competitive retail savings market. This has included the evaluation of a public-private partnership for back office services delivery. After detailed consideration and discussion with those involved, I have today given National Savings Board the authority to proceed to the Invitation To Negotiate stage in the process. From a list of four companies who responded to the Information Memorandum, the two companies who have been shortlisted to the next stage are Siemens and EDS.
<P>

<a name="80402w09.html_para2">I do not expect to make a decision as to whether to conclude a public-private partnership, and if so with which bidder, until some time later in the year. My decision will be based on value for money and will also bear closely in mind the best interests of customers and of National Savings staff.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w09.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what arrangements he plans to make for the inspection of Government-funded vocational training and the Careers Service.  [37661]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Government will shortly be proposing new clauses for the Teaching and Higher Education Bill which would extend the functions of the Office of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools (OHMCI) to include inspection of vocational training and the careers service in Wales.
<P>

<a name="80402w09.html_para3">We wish to make use of OHMCI's reputation for quality and independence to bring to the inspection of Government-funded training the same rigour that applies to education. This is in line with the Government's broader strategy to promote standards of post-16 education and training. OHMCI already carries out inspections of further education colleges in Wales and, given the links between work-based vocational training and that carried out in colleges, it makes sense for the same body to arrange the inspection of both aspects. As for schools and colleges, the purpose of inspection is to raise standards, stimulate the improvement of training delivery, generate more openness and transparency in provision and offer more informed customer choice.
<P>

<a name="80402w09.html_para4">The extension of OHMCI's remit to cover the careers service would streamline arrangements and end the current arbitrary division of inspection responsibilities between careers education carried out in schools and colleges and the work of the careers service. It is also in line with the Welsh Office's objective of achieving greater rationalisation and co-operation between all education, training and careers providers.
<P>

<a name="80402w09.html_para5">We envisage a non-statutory framework of inspection implemented in both cases through contracts with the organisations to be inspected; and, if the legislation is enacted, we will be consulting with those involved prior to implementation.

 Local Education Authorities are actively involved in the New Deal Strategic Partnerships established in all Employment Service Districts in Wales.

 The information requested is not collected centrally. However, Planning Guidance (Wales): Planning Policy, May 1996, makes clear that it is for local planning authorities to take account of the scope and potential for rehabilitation, conversion, clearance and redevelopment of land in their areas. In particular, local authorities should take account of the contribution reclaimable or reclaimed urban land can make to the overall provision of land for housing. Local authorities are able to identify suitable sites via the development plan process.

 Central Government funding for sport is channelled through the Sports Council for Wales. In 1997-98, the Sports Council's grant to the Football Association of Wales is &#163;48,477. This will increase to &#163;52,727 in 1998-99.

 Gooch & Wagstaff were selected following a limited external competition where 4 specialist firms were invited to submit bids to provide independent professional property advice in respect of the 2 sites shortlisted for the National Assembly for Wales. They were selected because of their specialist knowledge, their previous experience with PFI schemes and their fee structure which offered the best value for money. The value of their contract will depend upon the time spent preparing their report, but is not expected to exceed &#163;25,000.

<a name="80402w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The planning application regarding my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's home contained details which should not have been made public for security reasons. When we were alerted to the situation, I acted immediately to ensure that such details were no longer accessible.
<P>

<a name="80402w13.html_para0">The security arrangements at my right hon. Friend's home have been very thoroughly tested and are fully effective.
<P>

<a name="80402w13.html_para1">When major changes to the homes of public figures are planned on security grounds, it is important that local residents who may be inconvenienced by building work are properly consulted so that their concerns can be taken into account. However, a balance needs to be struck between ensuring that local people have their say about major changes to any property and ensuring that the security of public figures is not compromised.
<P>

<a name="80402w13.html_para2">The Home Office, the Security Facilities Executive (SAFE) and Sedgefield Borough Council acted in good faith but the security implications of the planning documents were not fully identified and acted upon. The Home Office and SAFE have introduced new procedures to ensure that this cannot happen in any future case. In addition, other planning authorities which have similar residences have been contacted to ensure that any such risks to security may be avoided.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will specify the section of the Dublin Convention which prevents Her Majesty's Government from returning to EU nations illegal immigrants who have come to the United Kingdom from such countries; and if he will make a statement.  [37352]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Dublin Convention provides a set of criteria for determining which member state should be responsible for considering an asylum application made in the European Union. Where it can be shown in accordance with these criteria that a member state other than the one where the application was made is responsible for considering the application, the applicant may duly be returned to that member state. In all other circumstances, Article 8 of the Convention provides that the first member state with which the application for asylum is lodged shall be responsible for considering it.
<P>

<a name="80402w13.html_para8">The Dublin Convention has made the return of asylum seekers to European Union member states a more complex and time-consuming process. In particular, it is often difficult to obtain sufficient evidence to show that another member state is responsible for an application according to the criteria in the Convention. As Presidency of the European Union, we are taking forward a range of measures designed to improve the operation of the Convention.

<P><I>2 Apr 1998 : Column: 640</I><P>
police officers in the Firearms department were suspended on 13 March, bringing the total number of staff suspended to six. Around 240 claimants in the South Yorkshire area have not yet received payment under Options A and B of the compensation scheme, around 38 per cent of the total. Payments on claims returned by the police after checking are expected to resume this week.
<P>

<a name="80402w14.html_para0">The investigation has resulted in some delays in payments but every effort is being made to keep delays to a minimum, as I explained in my letter to my hon. Friend and the other South Yorkshire Members on 20 February immediately after the problem had been drawn to my attention. As a result of the inquiries, the South Yorkshire police have returned about 100 claims to the Firearms Compensation Section (FCS) after checking them against the surrendered goods. About half of these have not yet been paid. There are a number of queries arising on the claims and the FCS is considering these against our normal checking criteria. Where it is not possible to clear all items in a claim, a part payment will be considered. Payments on those items which are satisfactory began this week. A second batch of 100 claims is expected shortly under the arrangements agreed with the police for returning claims on a regular basis after they have been examined.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what funding is available from his Department for physiotherapy services for schools;  [37218]
<P>
<UL>(2) what guidance he has given to health authorities on the provision of physiotherapy services in schools. [37216]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Department has not given specific guidance to health authorities on the provision of physiotherapy services in schools. The detailed provision and funding of such services is a matter for health commissioners in light of the health needs of their local populations. The Department recognises the essential contribution therapists make to the assessment, development, education and treatment of children with health needs and disabilities. Officials from the Department and the Department of Education and Employment are currently examining ways to facilitate collaboration between the National Health Service and local education authorities, following the response to the Green Paper, Excellence for all Children: Meeting Special Educational Needs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w15.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Department's policy research programme and the central National Health Service research and development programmes are not currently supporting any research on the numbers of children in schools requiring physiotherapy and occupational therapy to assist with physical problems, due to pressure of other priorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w15.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Diazepam is classified as a prescription-only medicine under the Medicines Act 1968.
<P>

<a name="80402w15.html_para1">The British National Formulary (BNF), which is funded by the Department and is provided free to doctors twice a year, provides guidance on the prescribing of diazepam. It also sets out specific advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines.
<P>

<a name="80402w15.html_para2">The BNF also includes general advice on prescribing drugs which are likely to cause dependence, suggesting that the prescriber should prescribe small amounts initially and take care to ensure that doses are not gradually increased to the point where dependence becomes more likely.

<a name="80402w16.html_sbhd0"><H4><center>Mesothelioma</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w16.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Godman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what funds the Government are currently spending on medical research for the management, treatment and cure of mesothelioma; and if he will make a statement. [36742]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The main agency through which the Government support bio-medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC is an independent body which receives its grant-in-aid from the Office of Science and Technology, which is part of the Department of Trade and Industry. The MRC does not currently support any research specifically on the management, treatment or cure of mesothelioma. However, the MRC does provide support for more basic research in related areas which may provide insights into the aetiology of mesothelioma and have an impact on treatment in the future. For example, the MRC Toxicology Unit at Leicester has been working on projects to better understand the cellular mechanisms by which the lung responds to certain toxic materials. These include many toxins that circulate throughout the body and yet cause selective injury to particular types of lung cell as well as inhaled mineral fibres such as asbestos and zeolites.
<P>

<a name="80402w16.html_para0">In addition, the MRC's Committee on Toxic Hazards in the Environment and Workplace produced a report in 1995 (ISBN 1 899110 03 8) entitled "Natural and man-made mineral fibres: UK research priorities"--this was based on workshops organised by the Institute for Environmental Health. This report considers, <i>inter alia</i>, mesothelioma. It is obtainable from the Institute of Environment and Health, University of Leicester, PO Box 138, Lancaster Road, Leicester LE1 9HN (Phone 0116 252 5530 or Fax 0116 252 5146).
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w16.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Godman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what was the annual cost of treating those suffering from <i>(a)</i> mesothelioma, <i>(b)</i> lung cancer and <i>(c)</i> asbestosis- related illnesses in each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement.  [36743]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Information about the costs of treatment classified by disease is not routinely collected locally, hence there is no collation of such data centrally. Mesothelioma is incurable with a prognosis of 12-18 months. The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 5.5 per cent.; surgery and/or radiotherapy offers the best chance of cure.
<P>

<a name="80402w16.html_para1">People with asbestos-related conditions may live some years, dependent on the type of condition which they have. Patients will require a number of investigations and symptomatic treatment to reduce the symptoms from this irreversible condition. Palliative care is the most significant part of treating both mesothelioma and lung cancer.

<a name="80402w16.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>NHS Trusts (Vacancies)</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w16.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what is the maximum amount of time vacancies for NHS trust boards can remain unfilled.  [37401]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 There is no statutory time limit on how long vacancies on trust boards may remain unfilled. However, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would expect posts to remain vacant for no longer than is necessary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w16.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if NHS trust boards have to endorse proposals to merge NHS trusts; and what powers they have to block these proposals.  [37400]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 It is for Ministers, not National Health Service trusts, to decide whether or not trusts should merge. Full public consultation will be held on any such proposals.
<P>

The ES is a key player in our Welfare to Work strategy and has lead responsibility for the effective delivery of the New Deal. The new Aim of the ES reflects its mission of contributing to individuals leading rewarding working lives, by helping people without a job to find work and employers to fill their vacancies. Special attention is focused on helping those at a disadvantage in the labour market move from welfare into work.

<a name="80402w17.html_para6">The new APA, and the new ES Aim and Objectives, are the result of an extensive consultation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w18.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 I am keen to encourage organic farming as a sustainable farming system that can contribute to environmental objectives and can, in particular, deliver real benefits to biodiversity, while producing a product that the consumer wants and is prepared to pay a premium for. To this end, I commissioned a review of the rates and structure of aid to farmers converting to organic farming. Copies of that review have been placed in the Library of the House. Decisions on the recommendations will be taken in the context of the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review but, in the meantime, I am introducing a number of measures to help organic farming.
<P>

<a name="80402w18.html_para0">Firstly, I do not want farmers to be discouraged from early conversion by the prospect of a revised scheme. Subject to approval by the European Commission, farmers whose agreements are approved on or after today's date will be allowed, but not required, to switch to any revised scheme introduced as a result of this review. The total length of the agreement will remain unchanged and any switch will take place on the anniversary of the agreement. Thus, for instance, a participant might receive the year 1 payment due under the existing scheme and the year 2 to 5 payments due under a revised scheme.
<P>

<a name="80402w18.html_para1">Secondly, I wish to help the cash flow of those in the Organic Aid Scheme. I intend that the full annual payment will be made at the end of the first quarter of each year of the agreement. This is an improvement on the current system where the majority of payments are made quarterly in arrears. I shall be laying a Statutory Instrument before Parliament that will allow greater flexibility in the timing of payments and, subject to their approval, I hope it will be possible to introduce this change from 1 August 1998.
<P>

<a name="80402w18.html_para2">If organic farming in this country is to expand, it needs a sound research base. I wish to strengthen our programme of organic R&D. I have asked the United Kingdom Register of Organic Food Standards (UKROFS) to provide advice on priorities and we will be reviewing our R&D programme in May. In the interim, we are increasing our spend by about 30 per cent. to nearly &#163;1.5 million for 1998-99. In preparation for future work we will be commissioning additional work to: review animal husbandry techniques for maintaining animal health within organic farming; assess the causes of different profitability on organic farms; and identify the implications for organic farmers of cross contamination with pollen from genetically modified crops.




<P>
<P><I>2 Apr 1998 : Column: 656</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80402w18.html_para3">I also consider it important that organic farmers should be encouraged to maximise the environmental benefits on their farms and to participate in relevant agri-environment schemes. I intend that, when considering applications for Countryside Stewardship, land registered as organic or in conversion will normally be given extra points, and hence priority over comparable conventional land. This will be introduced for the main Countryside Stewardship Scheme in 1998 (closing date 31 May 1998) and for Arable Stewardship in 1999 (closing date 31 March 1999).
<P>

<a name="80402w18.html_para4">If organic farming is to expand, farmers will need advice on conversion relevant to their own circumstances. A telephone help-line and free farm visits are already available through the Organic Conversion Information Service (OCIS). For 1998-99 I intend to increase the resources available to OCIS to meet an anticipated increase in demand.
<P>

<a name="80402w18.html_para5">If organic production expands, there will be a need for increased funding for the sector bodies who are involved in implementing and checking the Organic Aid Scheme. We will be discussing with the sector bodies the resources needed to compensate them for their roles in the scheme and expect to provide additional help in 1998-99 to enable them to prepare themselves for increased demand.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what tonnage of meat and bonemeal has been exported in each of the past 10 years; and to which countries.  [36689]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 March 1998]:</i> UK Overseas Trade Statistics are not separately available for the export of meat and bonemeal. These products are included under the heading of "Flours, meals and pellets, of meat or offal, unfit for human consumption; greaves". Exports in each of the last 10 years of materials which fall under this heading are as follows. These figures are taken from the Official Overseas Trade Statistics.
<P>

<a name="80402w18.html_para7">The data will be subject to a degree of statistical error. The overall level of errors will be low but these errors will have a much greater proportional effect on countries with small values or volumes of trade.
<P>

<a name="80402w18.html_para8">The hon. Member will be aware that since the adoption of Commission Decision 96/239/EC on 27 March 1996, it has been illegal to export from the UK meat meal, bonemeal and meat and bonemeal derived from mammals. Exports after 27 March 1996 may, however, have included non-mammalian meat and bonemeal.

 We welcome publication of the draft regulations for Structural and Cohesion Funds--which are part of the wider Agenda 2000 reform package. The regulations must now be agreed by all fifteen Member States and approved by the European Parliament.
<P>

<a name="80402w19.html_para13">Our overriding concern in the long negotiations ahead is to ensure that these draft regulations are affordable, durable and fair overall, particularly to the UK.
<P>

<a name="80402w19.html_para14">The UK, like other Member States, would like to see fair and effective criteria which address local needs. This is the starting point of the negotiations. We will be working hard, with other Member States and the Commission, to improve these draft regulations and to reach a fair and affordable outcome.

 The Government appreciate the difficulties that the level of the pound is causing exporters in the East Midlands and elsewhere in the country. But exporters will not benefit from a return to the boom and bust policies of the past. Industry wants, and this Government are delivering, a stable macroeconomic environment.

The Department is also supporting research into availability of skills in the chemicals and shipbuilding sectors.

The UK is also playing an active role in negotiations on anti-corruption measures within the European Union and at the Council of Europe. Domestically, a new hotline has been set up to catch disqualified directors and undischarged bankrupts who flagrantly flout the law and, when Parliamentary time allows, my Department intends to introduce legislation to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the procedure for disqualifying unfit company directors. My Department is also working closely with HM Treasury and the Financial Services Authority in their reform of Financial Services regulation, and a working party is reviewing the current state of regulation in the insolvency profession.

Exact figures depend upon assumptions made on the length of the build-cycle for individual orders and the exact numbers of employees in each yard over that time. The increasing use by yards of external sub-contractors (who are not considered recorded as employees) for many tasks would also reduce this cost, as would the inclusion of employment in the suppliers to the yards.

 <i>[holding answer 31 March 1998]:</i> The UK shipbuilding industry has been telling the Department for many years that the best way to improve its competitiveness is to remove the market distortions caused by subsidies. We agree with this assessment and our policy has been to achieve this, particularly through ending contract aid, as quickly as possible. Our preference is to work through the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement but, failing that, we believe that the Commission's contingency measures will provide a good basis for developing a more viable shipbuilding sector as they will eliminate contract aid and provide similar support on measures for improving the competitiveness as other sectors enjoy. Both the OECD Agreement and the EU proposals improve the market framework but this is only one of many factors affecting the industry, whose success ultimately depends on its ability to win orders.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what estimate is produced by her Department's Policy Simulation Model of the number of people in each income decile who are currently building up second tier pension entitlements by means of <i>(a)</i> occupational pension schemes, <i>(b)</i> other private second tier pensions and <i>(c)</i> SERPS; how many of each group are paying income tax at the (i) 40 per cent., (ii) 23 per cent., (iii) 20 per cent. and (iv) 0 per cent. rate; and what is the mean and median contribution in each case for each type of second tier provision.  [36484]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w21.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Department's Policy Simulation Model is not suitable for answering this question as it is based on data from the Family Resources Survey which does not contain reliable information on pensions. Such information as is available from the 1996 General Household Survey is set out in the table.

1. All estimates are given to the nearest 0.1 million.<P>

2. Income decile 1 is comprised of the 10 per cent. of the Great Britain population aged between 16 and State pension age who had the lowest incomes with income levels in each decile rising until decile ten, which is comprised of those 10 per cent. who had the highest incomes.<P>

3. The income distribution is based on gross unequivalized income.<P>

4. Estimates have been calculated using proportions reporting pension scheme membership in the 1996 General Household Survey, and population projections from the Government Actuary's Department.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what steps her Department plans to take to uprate disability living allowance to take account of road fuel tax increases; and if she will make a statement.  [36854]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 There are no plans to uprate Disability Living Allowance to take account of road fuel tax increases. Disability Living Allowance is not intended to meet specific costs associated with disability, nor is it, of course, aimed solely at people who are dependent on their car.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w22.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Todd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what analysis her Department has made of the medical basis for claims for disability living allowance; and what advice she has received based on that analysis.  [36766]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Two reports were published recently which include information on the assessment of claims for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and Attendance Allowance (AA): "A Study of Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance Awards" published by the Department's Analytical Services Division; and "The Future of Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance--A Discussion Paper" published by the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board (DLAAB), an independent statutory body.
<P>

<a name="80402w22.html_para0">These reports provide a valuable insight into the workings of DLA and AA. They highlight some problems with the current adjudication process, in particular, the evidence used to support a claim and the DLAAB have suggested that more use should be made of medical evidence.
<P>

<a name="80402w22.html_para1">Both reports were discussed with organisations representing disabled people at a seminar hosted by my Noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Baroness Hollis of Heigham on 27 March. We have not drawn any conclusions from the reports at this stage. The Green Paper, "New ambitions for our country: a new contract for welfare reform", makes it clear that there will be full consultation on any proposals for changes to DLA and AA.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment she has made of the amount of state benefits paid out to injured claimants, which was recovered by the Compensation Recovery Unit from legally aided defendants during each of the last three years.  [37012]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80402w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 No such assessment has been made since neither the plaintiff nor the defendant in injury compensation cases, where State benefits are recovered, are required to notify the Department if they have been granted legal aid.

 The Department has to fill 64 vacancies to achieve the 1998/99 Information Technology requirements. This represents 2 per cent. of the current workforce in the Department's Information Technology Services Agency which will be filled by ongoing and planned resourcing activity over the next three months. The vacancies are 7 staff at grade C5 (SEO), 34 staff at grade C6 (HEO) and 23 staff at grade D7 (EO).

<P>
<a name="80402w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The Department's arrangements for Year 2000 compliance were planned well in advance and it has not been necessary to "restrict" or "terminate" any planned work because of the Year 2000 date change problem.
