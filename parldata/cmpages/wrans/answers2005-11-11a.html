 HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) have been receiving an increasing number of claims for repayment of VAT under the 8th and 13th EC VAT Directives which have not been supported by all the required documentation, including valid VAT invoices. HMRC have found that the previous controls for dealing with such claims are not sufficiently robust and are being abused. HMRC have therefore decided that they must tighten their procedures and have recently reminded businesses that claims must be supported by all the required documentation, and about what details a valid VAT invoice must contain. These rules apply equally to all businesses and are no different to the rules that apply domestically for businesses seeking to recover VAT incurred on their purchases.

<i>[holding answer 7 November 2005]:</i> Crowding on all London passenger services, including between Hastings-London Victoria and Brighton-London Victoria are measured against Passengers in Excess of Capacity Rules (PIXC) rules. This is against the number of seats on longer-distance services and against total capacity (seats plus, standing) for services where the first stop that passengers alight (or last stop where passengers board) is not more than 20 minutes from the terminal station. This allows for the scheduled stops within the 20 minute threshold at Clapham Junction and East Croydon in both directions.

<a name="51111w06.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_33">The latest available count data (2004) shows that all morning and evening peak Brighton to Victoria and Hastings to Victoria services are within their official passenger capacities, except for the 1632 Victoria to Brighton service. The Train Operating Company has allocated less carriages to the 1632 Victoria to Brighton train in order to provide longer trains to meet the greater passenger demand in the high peak period after 1700. However, an alternative service between Victoria and Brighton is scheduled shortly after this service at 1636, and this does provide spare capacity.

 The use of stone mastic asphalt materials (SMA) for road resurfacing was assessed by the Highways Agency in the 1990s. As a result of concern regarding the loss of surface texture required for high-speed skid resistance, its use was prohibited as a surfacing on trunk roads including motorways in England. Proprietary materials based on SMA, known as &#039;thin surfacings&#039;, have been developed to address the surface texture concern and these are now widely used on the trunk road and motorway network. The Department, on behalf of the UK Roads Board has commissioned best practice guidance for local authorities on how and where thin surfacings and SMA can be applied. The results of this research will be available early next year.

<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51111w08.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 Measurement of fraud and error in benefits is complex and expensive, therefore the Department concentrates on those benefits with the highest level of risk. We carry out continuous measurement of loss through fraud and error in jobseeker&#039;s allowance, income support, pension credit and housing benefit and we conduct reviews of other benefits. For example a national benefit review of disability living allowance was conducted in 2004 and the results published in July 2005 as &quot;Fraud, Error and other Incorrectness in disability living allowance&quot;, which is available in the Library.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51111w08.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_41">We are committed to continuing these reviews, and over the next few years we will be carrying out a series on other benefits which have a high level of expenditure and potential risk of loss. We envisage that this will enable us to publish a more accurate figure for loss through fraud and error.
