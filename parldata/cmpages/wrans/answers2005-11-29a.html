<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51129w01.html_spmin1"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 There is no contradiction between my comments and the Attorney-General&#039;s letter of 9 July. The Army Prosecuting Authority (APA) was established under the Armed Forces Act 1996 and acts independently of the military chain of command. As an additional measure of protection from interference, the APA is subject to the general superintendence of the Attorney-General but he is not responsible for taking decisions on individual prosecutions. There is nothing unusual about this practice which takes place with the other prosecutors superintended by the Attorney-General, for example, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), Serious Fraud Office, Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office, and the Public Prosecution Office Northern Ireland.

<i>[holding answer 23 November 2005]:</i> There is no official register of plumbers in the UK as there is no &quot;licence to operate&quot; requirement and I cannot be sure that the following information covers all areas of plumbing. Individual plumbers are employed by firms operating in both the domestic and commercial markets. Depending on the nature of their work and skills level, some would be more appropriately referred to as heating engineers. Especially in the domestic market, many plumbers are self-employed and may operate at a very local, or neighbourhood level.

In the event of temporary tightness in the gas supply market there is no limit on fuel switching and the carbon market provides industry with the flexibility to source further allowances if energy intensive users exceed their emissions cap.

<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51129w07.html_spnew8"><b> Jim Knight </b> 
<i>[holding answer 29 November 2005]:</i> There is no requirement in the European Regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme that the farmer claiming aid has to be in legal occupation of the land supporting the claim. However, to receive payment the farmer must carry out an agricultural activity or maintain the land in good agricultural or environmental condition and the land has to be at the farmer&#039;s disposal for 10 months of the year between prescribed dates. Compliance monitoring inspections, including checks on the 10 month provision, are undertaken on a proportion of claims.

 Cross compliance came into force on 1 January 2005 following an extensive period of discussion and consultation with stakeholders. The requirements are based on existing law and good farming practices. Farmers choosing to claim the single payment confirm that they are aware of, and are meeting the standards as part of their application. A breach of the relevant requirements on or after that date will be regarded as a non-compliance and will be assessed for a penalty as required by the EC Regulations. Breaches which commenced prior to the introduction of cross compliance and are continuing, through an act or omission of the farmer, into 2005, will also be assessed for a penalty. If farmers have concerns about penalties for breaches committed prior to cross compliance coming into force, we would urge them to contact the Rural Payments Agency.

Neither this set of projections, nor the set published in the reply given on 8 November, takes specific account of expectations about the future of energy supply, economic activity, fuel prices, sectoral trends and effects of policy measures and for this reason they are not a sound basis for judging whether the UK will meet its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.

 Prior to the implementation of the latest round of CAP reform and the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme, my Department commissioned assessments on possible impacts of decoupling on a range of sectors, including suckler cows in the uplands.

These birds include the following species of gulls&#151;lesser black-backed gull, greater black-backed gull and the herring gull. However, licences cannot be issued to control gulls where they are merely causing a nuisance and to do so would be in breach of the EU Birds Directive.

 The franchising authority pays performance bonuses to train operators for exceeding performance targets. If performance is poor, operators pay a performance penalty.

The following table lists cases where payments by an operator during the financial year concerned exceeded the payments it received from the franchising authority.

 In line with the future maritime operating concept, the Apache AH Mkl is required to operate in support of amphibious forces during ship to shore operations. Extensive ship-borne trials have taken place on HMS Ocean and RFA Argus during which flying and deck operating limits were determined, and maritime modifications, including enhanced corrosion protection, were assessed. These trials have shown that Apache can be operated safely and effectively from these platforms. A declaration of maritime initial operating capability is expected at the end of December 2005. Funding for further trials has been set aside in the equipment plan. However, the benefit of full conversion of the entire Apache fleet is currently being assessed.

<i>[holding answer 17 November 2005]:</i> Employment in the Regular armed forces is open to citizens of Commonwealth countries and Republic of Ireland nationals as well as British citizens; all applicants are given equal consideration and all have to meet the same basic entry standards. The armed forces do not actively recruit overseas with the exception of Gurkhas from Nepal. However, in recent years the Royal Navy and the Army have sent selection teams to some Commonwealth countries at the specific request of the Government concerned, and only then when evidence suggests that there is sufficient interest among the local population to merit a visit. The selection teams screen out those who are not thought capable of meeting the full entry standards, to save them the cost of an abortive trip to the UK to undergo the recruitment process. The costs incurred as a result of the selection team visits were as follows:

<sup>(10)</sup> Breast cancer is defined as code 174 in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and as code C50 in the International Classification of Diseases. Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Newly diagnosed cases were defined using ICD-10; deaths were defined using ICD9 from 1999 to 2000, and ICD-10 from 2001 onwards.<br>

<sup>(11)</sup> Figures for the number of deaths are based on deaths occurring in each calendar year.<br>

<sup>(12)</sup> The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 means that data for breast cancer are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. The data should therefore be interpreted with caution. The effect of the change in classification in 2001 on deaths from cancer by site is described in an article published in August 2004.*<br>

 It is not possible to give a meaningful estimate of possible deaths from exposure in affected areas during the winter months. The Government of Pakistan and international relief effort is focussed on providing shelter and other assistance to those who choose to remain above the snow line and also providing camps for those relocating to lower altitudes. The immediate priorities are to deliver shelter materials with &quot;warm rooms&quot; to remove the risks of exposure and provide water and sanitation interventions for the camps to prevent the spread of disease. The emergency shelter programme involves mobile outreach teams providing material and technical support for the construction of &quot;warm rooms&quot; for families above the snow line.

 There is a distinction between the World Health Organisation&#039;s Roll Back Malaria Department and Roll Back Malaria Partnership: The Roll Back Malaria Department of the World Health Organisation (WHO) is responsible for the co-ordination of the WHO&#039;S global efforts on malaria. As part of the HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria cluster, the Roll Back Malaria Department reports progress using standard WHO results-based management systems, primarily against the organisation&#039;s programme budget. During 2004, DFID conducted an assessment of the WHO&#039;s effectiveness; the results concluded that the WHO was working towards better strategic planning, organisational efficiency and improved accountability for results.

 There are no plans to redevelop St. Helena. Last March, however, I announced proposals to build an airport and establish air services for the island by or around 2010. The commitment was subject to satisfactory contract bids and a rigorous environmental impact assessment. The project budget has not been made public, as to do so might prejudice competition for the airport &quot;design, build and operate&quot; contract. The cost of the airport will be additional to DFID&#039;s regular support for St. Helena, currently running at some &#163;14 million per annum.

Disbursements from those sources are expected to total around &#163;250,000 this year. Funds currently available to St. Helena from the European Union total over &#163;9 million, all of which St. Helena hopes to utilise over the next few years for improvements to its wharf facilities.

<p><a name="st_206"><a name="51129w21.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Calculating the number of diarrhoea! deaths attributable to inadequate sanitation is not an easy task. Most of them occur in the homes of the poor in remote villages and ramshackle shanty-towns, without the knowledge of health care workers. Most can be attributed to multiple contributory causes including malnutrition, malaria, the aftermath of measles and contaminated water, as well as poor sanitation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129w21.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_122">Roughly the same number of people in sub-Saharan Africa lack access to water supply (266 million) as lack sanitation (242 million); indeed, many people lack both.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129w21.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_123">The best available calculation is by the World Health Organisation (WHO), which estimates that 747,500 deaths a year in sub-Saharan Africa could be attributed to deficient water, sanitation and hygiene. The vast majority (99 per cent.) of these are deaths from diarrhoea, and nearly 90 per cent. of those who die are children less than five-years-old. This gives a figure of some 650,000 child diarrhoeal deaths a year due to poor water, sanitation and hygiene.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129w21.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_124">Looking to the future, if progress towards the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) is not accelerated we can expect the number of deaths to decrease very slightly each year, but at this rate we estimate that in 2092 34 per cent. of the population would still lack access to basic sanitation.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps he is taking to increase the amount of household waste that is recycled annually in Northern Ireland.  [32135]</p>




<p><a name="st_262"><a name="51129w29.html_spnew0"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 The Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) promotes the recycling of household waste in two main ways: grant support to district councils and through education and awareness programmes. Its work has yielded encouraging results, with the overall household recycling rate in Northern Ireland growing from 10 per cent. in 2002 to 18.9 per cent. in 2004&#150;05. All district councils in Northern Ireland have increased their household recycling rates. Two district councils have achieved a household recycling rate of almost 40 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129w29.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_169">Since 2001, EHS has provided councils with &#163;36 million via the Waste Management Grant Scheme to help procure infrastructure and assist with operating costs associated with meeting their Waste Management Plans. In 2004&#150;05, &#163;10 million was distributed under the scheme which will finish in 2006&#150;07. Future support for councils will be reviewed in light of the new Waste Management Strategy which is currently out for consultation and is scheduled for publication in March 2006.

<p>
<a name="51129w29.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_170">The &quot;Wake up to Waste&quot; campaign succeeded in raising the profile of waste management among the general public. EHS continues to reinforce the &quot;Reduce, Reuse, Recycle&quot; messages and develop new initiatives aimed at achieving behavioural change through education and awareness.
