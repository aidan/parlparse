 The Government fully support the aims of the Prince's Trust Football Scheme, which uses sport to offer personal development programmes to young people aged 16&#150;25, the majority of whom are unemployed, have recently left social service care, or are ex-offenders. It is noteworthy that of 4,000 participants between 1997 and 2002, some 73 per cent. went on to find employment, or to further education or training.
<P>

<a name="31215w01.html_para0">The Scheme receives &#163;250,000 a year from the Football Foundation's Community and Education Fund, which is part-funded by Sport England and the New Opportunities Fund.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Cawsey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what progress has been made in implementing the Animal Health (Amendment) Act 1998.  [142777]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Animal Health (Amendment) Act 1998 extended the scope of the Order-making powers relating to importation in the Animal Health Act 1981 to cover the welfare of animals in quarantine. Between December 2000 and March 2001, MAFF undertook a consultation exercise on proposals for legislation to update the law on quarantine by reforming the quarantine rules to bring quarantine kennels up to the best modern practice and by introducing statutory welfare provisions.
<P>

<a name="31215w01.html_para1">Owing to the impact on resources of the foot and mouth disease outbreak during 2001, follow-up to that consultation was deferred. Since then, we have reached agreement on the EU Regulation on the movement of pet animals which will require some changes to the quarantine legislation. We are also preparing for consultation on an Animal Welfare Bill. We shall therefore need to review the proposed changes to the quarantine legislation to take account of these and other developments. I expect to complete the review in the first part of 2004.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on how she intends to implement the recommendations of the Farm Animal Welfare Council's Report on the Welfare of Farmed Animals at Slaughter or Killing.  [143558]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 11 December 2003]</i>: I refer my hon. Friend to my earlier answer given on 8 December 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 209W. Decisions on how to implement the recommendations will be taken once the public consultation exercise on the draft response has been completed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w01.html_wqn5"><B> Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what sanctions apply to <i>(a)</i> farmers and <i>(b)</i> her Department in circumstances where an incorrect assessment has been made of areas planted for (i) wheat and (ii) other arable crops in the annual (A) June return and (B) IACS system.  [143666]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w01.html_spnew5"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The June census is a UK survey designed to provide information for statistical purposes and to support policy decisions. In England it is carried out under the Agricultural Statistics Act 1979 which requires farmers to provide the information requested. 



<P>
<P><I>15 Dec 2003 : Column 629W</I><P>
Any mistakes are normally simply corrected and we are not aware of any sanctions ever being applied in such issues. Defra seeks to produce the best estimates it can at particular points in the year. By the nature of the information, some figures will be provisional and subject to revision. The Department will republish if a mistake that significantly affects the results is found.
<P>

<a name="31215w01.html_para2">The IACS rules are part of the EU legislation governing the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy. In respect of arable area payments, they treat wheat and other arable crops in the same way. Where farmers claim arable area payments for less than their planted area there is no sanction. Where they overclaim by a small margin the claim is merely corrected. For larger overclaims the IACS system prescribes a scale of sanctions, which at the extreme can lead to the loss of all payment for the current year and to an equivalent sum being recovered from the claims made over the following three years. No automatic sanctions apply to Defra in such cases, but the European Commission has power to apply ad hoc financial penalties to member states who are found not to have sufficiently robust systems for inspecting claims and applying the prescribed sanctions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w01.html_wqn6"><B> Hugh Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps the Government are taking to speed up approvals for biopesticides.  [143918]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w01.html_spnew6"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Government are trying to find ways of speeding up the approval process for biopesticides. The Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) is carrying out a pilot exercise exploring ways of reducing data requirements and thus the costs and time taken to secure approval.
<P>

<a name="31215w01.html_para3">PSD has also appointed an "in-house" Small Business Champion to assist companies generally and specifically in making applications for approval of biological control agents.
<P>

<a name="31215w01.html_para4">However, PSD must ensure that approved pesticides cause no unacceptable risks to people or the environment. There are, therefore, certain essential data requirements that must be met, regardless of whether an application for a pesticide is for a conventional or an alternative product, such as a biopesticide.

<a name="31215w01.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Bovine TB</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether farmers are able to obtain insurance cover for TB infection in dairy cattle after a TB breakdown and subsequent claim.  [141083]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 It is Government policy to pay compensation at 100 per cent. of the market value, with no upper limit, for cattle that are compulsorily slaughtered under TB control measures. Farmers therefore do not need to take out insurance for their animals. Theoretically, insurance can be bought to cover other consequential losses for which compensation is not 



<P>
<P><I>15 Dec 2003 : Column 630W</I><P>
paid, but this is a commercial matter between the farmers and their insurers. Section 34 (5) of the Animal Health Act 1981 explicitly allows insurers to deduct the amount of Government compensation from the value of any payout that they make.
<P>

<a name="31215w01.html_para5">Insurance companies will make their own decisions on whether to insure, and about the size of premiums, based on their assessment of the risk. Recent contact with insurance industry early in 2003 indicated that, although companies are honouring existing policies, they are not offering new policies to cover TB in cattle herds, particularly in areas where TB is increasingly prevalent. This is because farmers do not wish to take the cover in areas where the risk is low (such as Yorkshire), but do wish to purchase cover in areas of high incidence (such as the South West). However, the insurance companies consider that the financial risks in offering insurance policies in areas of high incidence are too high at present.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the total cost was of compensation paid to farmers in respect of compulsory purchase of bovine animals slaughtered as a result of TB infection <i>(a)</i> between 1994 and 1998 and <i>(b)</i> since 1998.  [142457]<P>

<sup>(2)</sup> The Report of the Chief Veterinary Officer&#151;Animal Health 2002.<P>

<P>

<sup>(3)</sup> In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests that would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also, the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the number of TB reactors identified and slaughtered (and hence compensated for) in 2002 is not comparable to those identified and slaughtered in previous years.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w02.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Animal By-Products Regulations 2003 permit hunt kennels to continue collecting fallen stock; however, they will be required to upgrade to knackers' yard standards if they wish to collect fallen stock for the purposes of feeding to hounds. The effect of a ban on hunting would depend on decisions made by those who currently offer a service and on choices made by farmers leading to take-up of the National Fallen Stock Scheme which the Government hope will be up and running early in 2004. Most hunts already make a charge and there is no reason why such a service should not continue as a business opportunity irrespective of the future of hunting.

 For the year 2002, the most recent year for which complete annual statistics are available and published, 2,752,278 scientific procedures were carried out on animals in the UK. Mice, rats and other rodents, along with fish and birds, were used in some 96 per cent. of the total.
<P>

<a name="31215w02.html_para4">The use of animals in regulated procedures is prohibited by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 in cases where a scientifically valid non-animal alternative is available. The Act also requires that, where replacement of animals is not possible, the number used in any licensed project must be reduced to the minimum, and the procedures must be refined to ensure that no unnecessary suffering is caused. This approach&#151;of replacing, reducing and refining&#151;is known as application of the 3Rs.
<P>

<a name="31215w02.html_para5">Most work on the 3Rs is neither done by Government nor with Government money, as industry spends many millions of pounds each year on the search for and development of alternatives. Nonetheless, every year the Home Office makes available to the Animal Procedures Committee a budget for research aimed at developing or promoting the use of the 3Rs. Details of completed research projects are published in the annual report of the Animal Procedures Committee, which is available from The Stationery Office. The amount made available to the Committee for 2003&#150;04 for this specific purpose is &#163;280,000.

<a name="31215w02.html_para9">The Inter-Departmental Group is also reviewing the effectiveness of the Inter-Departmental Data Sharing Concordat announced in August 2000, which commits United Kingdom regulatory authorities to help resolve legal and other obstacles to data sharing between clients, in order to reduce animal testing.
<P>

<a name="31215w02.html_para10">In the longer term, we believe that further significant reduction in animal use will, and must, continue to rely largely on the scientific community's own efforts to develop, validate and adopt more advanced methods based on the 3Rs. This is not an area where quick gains can be expected, but any lack of progress in research into alternatives is more often due to the limitations of science, rather than to inadequate funding.

 The usual requirement is that the employer must demonstrate that they have been unable to fill the vacancy with a suitably qualified worker from the resident labour force. Employers will normally be required to provide evidence that they have advertised the post in an appropriate medium and the grounds on which they considered resident workers who applied for the post to be unsuitable. These requirements are waived only in respect of intra-corporate transfers, board level posts, inward investment posts and those occupations where Work Permits (UK) has established, on the basis of independent labour market information, that there is an acute shortage of suitably qualified resident workers. The latter do not include seafarers.

<P>

<a name="31215w03.html_para4">In addition, the UK and France have together taken vigorous action to combat illegal immigration to the UK following the closure of the Red Cross centre at Sangatte. Initiatives include the deployment of high-tech freight searching equipment to Calais, and British immigration officers working in an advisory capacity alongside the French Police aux Frontieres (PAF) at the port of Calais. Plans are under way to allow British immigration officers to exercise their full control powers at the ports of Calais, Dunkirk and Boulogne, as they already do at the Channel Tunnel. PAF officers will similarly be able to operate their controls at Dover.

: The market has responded to concerns about a possible shortfall by returning plant to service so that margins are at a similar level to the mid 1990's. However no system can be guaranteed and in the event of a possible power shortage there are a number of steps that NGT could take in order to maintain supplies and avoid rota cuts.

<P>

 Departmental policy is to promote the use of fair trade products. However, this is set against the background of the need to obtain best value for money, the EC procurement rules and the Department's objectives. Within these guidelines the Depatment is committed to supporting ethical trading wherever possible.
<P>

 The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) is developing voluntary standards in the field of personal financial planning. The aim of the standards is to provide an international benchmark for financial planners to work towards and to increase recognition of the financial planning process to ultimately benefit the consumer. The UK member of ISO is the British Standards Institution (BSI) which is independent of Government. The current draft standards are available from BSI for public comment until 4 January 2004.

<a name="31215w05.html_para0">Article 6 (5) of the EU's Market Abuse Directive requires member states to adopt appropriate regulation governing the production and dissemination of investment recommendations. The regulation has to ensure that those making investment recommendations or disseminating such recommendations take reasonable care to present the information fairly and disclose any interests or conflicts of interest they have relating to the relevant financial instruments. Recital 22 to the Market Abuse Directive indicates that appropriate regulation in relation to Article 6 (5) can include appropriate mechanisms for self regulation. The technical arrangements for compliance with Article 6 (5) were set out in an implementing measure agreed by the European Securities Committee on 29 October.
<P>

<a name="31215w05.html_para1">The Treasury will issue a consultation document next year on proposals to transpose the Market Abuse Directive and its implementing measures into UK legislation. At this stage it is expected that the consultation document will outline proposals that journalists either producing or disseminating investment recommendations will be subject to self-regulatory mechanisms. This approach should enable traditional media freedoms in the UK to be maintained while supporting market integrity.

 My Department does not collect information on companies certified to the ISO 9000 standards. However figures produced by the International Standards Organisation indicate that, in December 2002, there were 60,960 ISO 9000 certifications in the UK. Companies have had three years notice that the transition period for the migration of accredited certification, from the 1994 editions of the standard to ISO 9001:2000, would end on 14 December 2003. My Department has provided information about the new edition on its website. From the information my officials have received from representatives of certification bodies, about 90 per cent. of their UK customers are expected to make the transition successfully by the due date.

 The Government take the issue of offshoring of UK operations very seriously. However, decisions on location are commercial matters for companies to take. We nevertheless need to understand better what is happening, and to this end we have launched a consultation document inviting views from businesses, employees and their unions, and consumer groups. I will also chair a round-table seminar in the new year, to help inform the debate on the impacts of offshoring.

<a name="31215w06.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 UK steel exports to the US fell significantly following the March 2002 decision. The impact on the UK industry was lessened to an extent by a number of decisions by the US to exclude particular products from the scope of the safeguard, and by the adoption by the EU of a mechanism to prevent surges of imported steel from third countries. These decisions, which followed lobbying by the Government in support of the steel industry, brought 74 per cent. of UK steel exports to the US outside the scope of the safeguard. However, the impact of the US measures continued to be negative and we therefore welcome the 5 December decision by President Bush to lift the US tariffs. This was a course of action that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister strongly urged the President to take during his visit to London.

<a name="31215w08.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Swire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what the lump sum death-in-service pay is to widows or widowers for an army corporal;  [143021]
<P>
<UL>(2) what percentage of an army corporal's final salary is payable to a spouse following death-in-service.  [143020]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The current Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) final salary benefits are not based on individual earnings but on a representative rate of pay for each rank. This means that all those of the same rank with the same length of service retiring in the same year receive the same rate of pension regardless of their actual earnings. The current representative rate of pay for a corporal is &#163;24,678 per annum. The level of death-in-service lump sum paid to a widow or widower of a 



<P>
<P><I>15 Dec 2003 : Column 655W</I><P>
corporal in the Regular Army depends on length of service and whether the death was attributable to service. Where the cause of death is not attributable, the current lump sum is between &#163;23,938 and &#163;35,907, between 97 per cent. and 146 per cent. of the representative rate of pay. If the death is attributable to service, an attributable gratuity of &#163;11,969 is paid in addition to the non-attributable lump sum; this increases the value of the lump sum as a percentage of the representative rate of pay to between 146 per cent. and 194 per cent. Both the lump sum and gratuity are paid tax-free.
<P>

<a name="31215w08.html_para1">In addition to the lump sum, the widow of a corporal in the Regular Army would receive a short-term pension which is equivalent to 100 per cent. of the individual's final salary, paid, depending on circumstances, for a period of between 91 and 273 days. When the short-term pension ceases, a long-term pension is paid. The non-attributable widow's pension is 6.5 per cent. of the representative rate of pay where the individual has served for five years; this rises to 24.25 per cent. for 34 or more years' service. The attributable widows pension is 39 per cent. of the representative rate of pay.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 There is no Ministry of Defence funding specifically for Northern Ireland veterans. MOD funds programmes aimed at preventing Service leavers, which would include those who have served in Northern Ireland, falling into social exclusion and homelessness such as the Single Persons Accommodation Centre for Ex-Services in Catterick, the Armed Forces Project in Colchester and the Joint Services Housing Advice Office. MOD also contributes towards Project Compass, a partnership project in London aimed at assisting homeless veterans back into employment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The number of homeless veterans who have served in Northern Ireland is not known at present. In January 2004, the Ministry of Defence and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister are planning to begin a study into the extent, causes, impact and costs of homelessness and rough sleeping among ex-Service personnel in England. As part of this study, homeless veterans will be asked about their Service background and operational experience which will include Service in Northern Ireland.

<a name="31215w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 There are no routine statistics of this kind collected on veterans who have either served in Northern Ireland or who live there. The Home Office Research Development and Statistics Directorate survey, carried out in December 2001 in 76 prisons around the United Kingdom, found that 5.6 per cent. of prisoners were veterans of the armed forces, of which 11 per cent. had been in the Royal Navy, 4 per cent. were in the Royal Air Force and 85 per cent. were in the Army.

1. Local programmes are allocated funds at the beginning of each financial year based on their delivery plan.<P>

2. Programmes claim grant quarterly using the Sure Start Unit's online claims system.<P>

3. n/a denotes that the programme was not operational in that year.<P>

4. Where there is spend against a nil allocation, this indicates start up or advance payments, which are anticipated from the first financial year of operation.<P>

5. Claims for the 2003&#150;04 financial year are still on-going&#151;&#163;0 indicates that a claim has either not been made or is in the process of being made.<P>

6. Capital funding for Sure Start local programmes is normally a single allocated sum from which programmes draw down funds for particular projects. As programmes do not make regular claims, this has been shown as spend (or claims) to date. Programmes are encouraged to use their capital allocation within 3&#150;5 years of their delivery plan being approved.<P>

<i>Notes:</i>1. We are unable to provide an accurate picture of the overall revenue spend for the North West region as a whole for financial year 2000&#150;01 because data processes were not set up to collect this information on a regional basis until 2001&#150;02.2. Audit certificates for the financial year 2002&#150;03 are still being submitted to the Sure Start Unit from some of the North West programmes and therefore spend figures for the region as a whole are unavailable at present.<P>

3. The capital spend to date figure refers to the total value of capital projects approved to date, which programmes are able to draw down. The actual amount claimed to date is &#163;15.3 million. The discrepancy is due to building work not being completed (and so not claimed for) or accountable bodies funding work and not yet claiming it back.<P>

 The Higher Education Funding Council for England funds honours degree and foundation degree courses on the basis of a formula which varies according to subject, institution and student factors. The funding is allocated to institutions as a block grant and how they allocate it is for them to determine. Institutions also receive funding from other sources, both public and private and may use it to subsidise some courses or faculties. The actual cost may therefore vary between institutions and subjects.

 All students, regardless of their family income, will be eligible for some financial assistance under the Government's proposals. The non-means tested element (75 per cent.) of the maintenance loan will continue to be available to all students, while the remaining 25 per cent. will be linked to family income. We do not intend to means-test loans for fees, which are to be introduced from 2006&#150;07. Additional support will, as now, be available on a means-tested basis in the form of tuition fee remission and, from 2004&#150;05, a new higher education grant will be introduced for those from poorer backgrounds.

 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2003]:</i> We set up the National College for School Leadership in November 2000 to deliver a wide range of professional development and leadership training opportunities for headteachers, aspiring headteachers and other school leaders at every stage of their careers, including middle managers. Ofsted regularly inspects the effectiveness of school leadership and management and from September this year introduced a new framework for inspecting these skills more rigorously. In June this year Ofsted reported that the proportion of schools with very good or excellent leadership and management has more than doubled since 1996&#150;97. In his statement to this House on 29 October about school funding, the Secretary of State announced that KPMG had been commissioned to work with NCSL and headteacher associations to design and develop a varied menu of support and guidance to help schools' budget and resource management. In the remaining months of the current financial year &#163;1.5 million is being made available for this programme which includes a website, workshop, helpdesk and consultancy.

<i>[holding answer 11 December 2003]:</i> We have pledged that, over time, all primary school pupils who want to should have the opportunity to learn a musical instrument. Ofsted are currently evaluating 12 pilots that aim to demonstrate how schools, LEA Music Services and other providers can work together to offer a programme of wider musical opportunities which builds on the National Curriculum for Music. We will publicise the results of this evaluation in the New Year, along with some new guidance from QCA on how teachers can incorporate instrumental tuition into their classroom work.

 The result of the 2002&#150;03 National Learner Satisfaction Survey, commissioned by the Learning and Skills Council, is excellent news. It shows that learners' needs and aspirations are being met, with more than 90 per cent. overall satisfied with their learning experience. This important customer feedback, taken with other measures of quality we have put in place, is an important indicator against which to judge the success of the learning and skills sector.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w12.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 A review of research conducted by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) in 1998, concluded that there are no significant differences between ability grouping, setting, mixed ability teaching and streaming in terms of outcomes, and that the overall effects are inconclusive. However, the review suggested that it is possible to identify a list of benefits and limitations for the main kinds of grouping at the level of the institution, teacher and pupil.
<P>

<a name="31215w12.html_para4">Pupil grouping by ability is not mandatory for English lessons. It is for schools to develop and determine for themselves, the best form of pupil grouping to meet the learning needs of all their pupils. To support this, both the Primary and the Key Stage 3 National Strategies in English have produced a range of resources for schools to use in meeting the needs of their pupils, particularly those below the expected levels. This allows schools the flexibility of being able to provide for their pupils whole class teaching; short-term optional modules suited to needs and abilities; within class pupil grouping for better differentiation of teaching; mentoring, booster and master class arrangements.

This figure is based on the assumption that the share of total UK employment associated with UK exports to the EU is equal to the share of total UK value added (GVA) generated by UK exports to the EU.

: The Pensions Schemes Registry (PSR), administered by the Occupational Pension Schemes Regulatory Authority (OPRA), holds information on the number of final salary schemes which are currently in the winding-up process and the number of schemes which have entered and completed winding-up. The registry database is, however, limited in a number of ways. Consequently, it does not provide all the information requested, though it nevertheless remains the most comprehensive source of information available on the aggregate number of pension schemes in the UK.

<a name="31215w16.html_wqn12"><B> Mrs. Helen Clark: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the evidential basis is for the claim in his Department's internal memorandum from the Project Manager for the Payment Modernisation Programme, that paying pensions through Post Office accounts costs 30 times as much as through bank accounts.  [143202]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w16.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 The internal memorandum states costs are at least 30 times more for making payments into a Post Office card account than into a bank account. This statement is on the basis that, whereas the financial institutions meet the operating costs of providing their bank accounts, the Government pay additional costs to the Post Office for the provision of the Post Office card account services.

<a name="31215w16.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 We are considering the precise impact on benefits; however, at present, the general principle is that no account is taken of capital held in trust funds until a young person has access to it.
<P>

<a name="31215w16.html_para8">We are aware of concerns about what would happen when Child Trust Funds are realised when young people reach age 18. We said in the pre-Budget report that we will keep under review the treatment of capital in income related working age benefits so that it strikes a sensible balance between providing targeted state support and not unfairly penalising those who have acted responsibly by saving.

 Where an application to the Child Support Agency is made as a result of a parent with care claiming a relevant benefit, any court order for the child concerned is cancelled.

<a name="31215w17.html_para1">Under the new child support scheme, in non-benefit cases either parent can choose to use the services of the Agency even though they may have a court order. In such cases the court order is cancelled. The new provisions only apply to court orders made on or after 3 March 2003 and provided that the order has been in place for at least a year.
<P>

<a name="31215w17.html_para2">Court orders for other children may be taken into account when the Agency determines a non-resident parent's liability for child support maintenance.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. CSA figures include all full maintenance assessment cases only and include direct pay cases and zero assessments.<P>

2. CSA figures produced using IAD 5 per cent. scan of Child Support Computer System (CSCS) and therefore may be subject to sampling variation.<P>

3. Figures are in thousands and rounded to the nearest hundred.<P>

4. As a family can occasionally be part of more than one CSA case (when a parent with care has children by more than one non-resident parent) these figures represent a small over-estimate.<P>





5. The proportion of families entitled to Child Support payments is derived by comparing the number of CSA cases with the number of families in receipt of Child Benefit.<P>

Figures are in thousands and rounded to the nearest hundred.<P>

Figures marked * are less than 500 and subject to a high degree of sampling variation. From November 2002, the methodology for producing these figures was changed to allow statistics to be published much sooner. This has resulted in a small increase in the reported caseload. This is because some cases which have actually terminated but have not yet been updated on the computer system are now included.<P>

small gifts of cash to relatives under the age of 18 will be exempted from the Pension Credit and Income Support deprivation of capital requirements.  [144002]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w18.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 As with all the income related benefits, someone may be treated as having capital they do not actually have if they deliberately deprive themselves of the resource to secure or increase entitlement to Pension Credit, but it is not necessarily the case that they will be. The main purpose of this is to guard against people giving away capital with the intention of increasing benefit entitlement.
<P>

<a name="31215w18.html_para0">In addition, in Pension Credit people will not be treated as depriving themselves of capital if they have used their resources to reduce or repay a debt (for example, a mortgage), or to buy something which was reasonable in their circumstances (for example, a car). This is part of normal financial planning which people age 60 and over may undertake, particularly on retirement.
<P>

<a name="31215w18.html_para1">Guidance provides that decisions must be made in the light of the circumstances of each case and the considerable body of case-law which has developed on similarly worded provisions.

<a name="31215w18.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Woodward: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) what steps the Government have taken since May 1997 to ensure that members of final salary pension schemes were made aware of risks to their accrued pension rights upon employer insolvency and scheme wind-up;  [142380]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the Government's policy is on advising existing pension scheme members of risks to their pension rights as a consequence of employer insolvency.  [142384]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w18.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Government encourage anyone considering joining or leaving a pension scheme to obtain as much information as possible about the options open to them and to seek independent financial advice. As well as highlighting further sources of information, leaflets published by the Pensions Service provide basic information on occupational pensions for people to use as they decide the best way in which to provide for their retirement. Similar information aimed at pension providers is published by the Inland Revenue.
<P>

<a name="31215w18.html_para2">Occupational pension schemes are provided voluntarily by employers and the trustees are required as a minimum to make funding information available to members as part of the annual report. It is the responsibility of employers and scheme trustees to monitor how scheme assets compare with scheme liabilities and take whatever action is required to address any funding shortfall, working within the legislative framework provided by the Government. To reduce the risks to members' accrued pension rights as a consequence of employer insolvency, the Government is introducing the new Pension Protection Fund. The introduction of new scheme-specific funding requirements will raise member awareness and understanding by requiring that trustees send regularly updated information to scheme members each year, containing key information about the funding position of their scheme.

While the work is in progress, the existing Jobcentre in South Street, together with the Social Security Office in the High Street will continue to operate as normal. In May 2004, following the opening of the new office, the existing Jobcentre in South Street will close.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The End of Life Vehicles Directive requires member states among other thing, to put in place measures to ensure that end of life vehicles are disposed of cleanly. In most cases initially, this will be by vehicle keepers and after 2007, by producers.
<P>

<a name="31215w20.html_para4">The purpose of continuous registration is to maintain an accurate vehicle register entry for every vehicle in use. In the event that it is disposed of by scrapping, the last keeper will be issued with a certificate of destruction by the DVLA. Under continuous registration the keeper is continuously responsible for licensing or declaring a Statutory Off Road Notice on their vehicle every year until transfer to another keeper or disposal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The level of increase in noise would depend on the distance of individual residents from the proposed runway and its flight paths and the level of other existing noise sources. Illustrative noise contours, and the areas and populations contained within them at 3dBA intervals from 54dBA Leq up to 72dBA Leq are set out in Chapter 7 of the consultation document, "The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: South East, Second Edition", published in February 2003, pages 56 and 57.

[144115]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w20.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Noise from aircraft flying into and out of Heathrow airport is regulated by Notices made under section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982. These include night restrictions, departure noise limits, noise preferential routes and approach procedures. Noise from surface access modes is treated essentially as for those sources on non-airport routes or journeys. The noise implications of a further runway at Heathrow were set out in the consultation on the "Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom (South East)".

 The Design and Equipment Sub-Committee will next meet from 1 to 5 March 2004.

Additional guidance and regulations are being developed on crew training and the maintenance of equipment.
<P>

<a name="31215w21.html_para5">In the longer term, the Sub-Committee seeks to simplify standards for the design of lifeboats in order to make them easier and more reliable to use. It is essential that safety standards in this area are established on an international basis. The UK delegation will therefore support the Sub-Committee by working with international partners to ensure guidelines to the shipping industry are sufficient and effective.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the overall investment figures in the London Underground were for each year between 1990 and 2003, broken down by line.  [140927]<P>

<P>
<a name="31215w21.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 London Underground, which transferred from central Government to Transport for London on 15 July, does not record investment by line. They have provided the following information. In April 2000, London Underground adopted new accounting treatment for its investment expenditure which removed the category 'investment renewals' the majority of this expenditure was reclassified as capital, although some (&#163;90 million) became resource expenditure. Therefore the figures before and after April 2000 are not directly comparable and are presented in two separate tables with the years 1990&#150;91 to 1999&#150;2000 on one consistent basis and those for a restated 1999&#150;2000 to 2002&#150;03 are on another. It is normal accounting practice when a change in accounting treatment occurs to restate the previous year's figures on the same basis in the accounts, so that a true comparison can be made.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps the Government are taking to limit the possibility of ships colliding with offshore wind turbines.  [141909]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My Department will continue to strive to ensure that the risk of ships colliding with offshore wind turbines is kept as low as practicable. When granting consents under the Coast Protection Act 1949 my Department ensures that offshore wind turbines are not located in areas of high collision risk. When construction begins, the existence of offshore wind turbines in a specific location is made known to mariners by way of Notices to Mariners issued by the UK Hydrographic Office and, where necessary, by annotations on nautical charts. Offshore wind turbine developments are also required to be marked in accordance with guidance issued by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities.
<P>

<a name="31215w22.html_para2">In considering the second round of bids for site leases, my Department is working with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Crown Estate to help direct offshore renewable energy developments towards areas of the sea associated with low numbers of ship movements. My Department wishes to obtain a full understanding of the cumulative impact on shipping caused by the potential development of the site leases and will consult the shipping and ports industries on the outcome of the Crown Estate's tender assessment panel.
<P>

<a name="31215w22.html_para3">There will also be further consultation by developers as the legislative consents process requires an environmental impact assessment to be made for each site. To assist developers assess the risks posed by shipping and the measures that they should take to mitigate those risks, detailed guidance has been made available by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.
<P>

<a name="31215w22.html_para4">The Government are introducing legislative proposals in the Energy Bill for safety zones to be established around offshore renewable energy developments. The Bill, which was introduced into the other place (House of Lords) on 30 November, also makes provision for the creation of a new offence in respect of unauthorised ships entering, or breaching the restrictions on operating within, a safety zone. My officials will work closely with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Department for Trade and Industry in establishing safety zones, appropriate to individual offshore turbine developments, in order to further reduce the risk of collisions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w22.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The procedures for deciding whether to reduce or discontinue a rail service are designed, among other things, to ensure that the particular needs of passengers with disabilities or mobility problems are fully taken into account. The level of service which an operator must provide is governed by a Passenger Service Requirement (PSR) and any change requires Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) approval. Where station or line closures are proposed a statutory closure procedure, which includes consultation with passengers, must be followed. In deciding whether to approve a service reduction or closure, the SRA or statutory authorities are expected to take proper account of the implications for all affected groups, including disabled passengers.

 The Strategic Rail Authority recently completed consultations on the proposed Integrated Kent Franchise. The consultation included options for domestic services on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) but the aim is to improve rail services throughout Kent, not only to destinations which might be served by the CTRL. Further consultations on a more detailed service pattern are planned for early in the new year and it is therefore too soon to say what the outcome might be for individual destinations.
<P>

<a name="31215w22.html_para5">The CTRL domestic service options set out in the consultation are, regardless of the stations they might serve, dependent on completion of the line. Section 2 is on target to open early in 2007.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to his answer of 4 December 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 162W, on shipping, how the Government determine that ships which do not fly the red ensign but qualify for the tonnage tax regime are strategically and commercially managed in the UK.  [143499]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w22.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The strategic and commercial management test arises from the European Commission's guidelines on State Aid in the maritime sector. As no specific EC guidance is available on the meaning of "strategically and commercially managed" the Government adopt a common sense interpretation, taking into account the various different strands of management activity that can be carried out in respect of a ship. Elements of both legs of the test must be demonstrated. Among the indicators that might be considered are:

 There have been encouraging developments in the peace process in Burundi, but it would be premature to say that peace has been fully restored. At the regional summit on Burundi which took place in Dar es Salaam on 16 November, the Burundi transitional government and the CNDD/FDD rebel group agreed to cease hostilities and share power pending national elections at the end of the transitional period in 2004. Efforts are continuing to persuade the remaining rebel group, the FNL, to cease hostilities and enter negotiations.
<P>

<a name="31215w23.html_para0">The UK is providing substantial aid support to Burundi. DFID assistance is likely to amount to some &#163;7 million during the present financial year, comprising humanitarian assistance, and support to local peacebuilding programmes, government capacity building, and to the national HIV/AIDS programme. This does not include DFID's 5-year $25 million pledge to the Multi-Donor Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme for the Great Lakes Region, which will support Burundi's national Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) programme once it is under way.

Funding will be subject to the GFATM reflecting a clear poverty focus, achieving a better financing system, integrating the fund's activities more effectively with national programmes and meeting agreed benchmarks to monitor its effectiveness. We have been working closely with the fund on all of these issues and made some good progress at the recent Board meeting held in October&#151;particularly on improving the financing system by moving to a more reliable system of replenishment based on commonly agreed performance measures.

 My Department has no plans to adopt a system of contributions based on an equitable contribution framework.

 A national immunisation campaign is under way in Iraq which aims to vaccinate Iraq's 4.2 million children under five against preventable diseases such as polio, measles, tuberculosis, diphtheria and tetanus. The Ministry of Health, supported by UNICEF, has run a series of national immunisation days since June encouraging routine immunisation.

<P>
<a name="31215w25.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 With permission, I will reply to all six questions together. Reproductive health supplies are normally provided as an integral part of broader programmes to promote sexual and reproductive health and prevent HIV/AIDS. The Department for International Development (DFID)'s data capture systems do not, therefore, allow us to isolate expenditure specifically on provision of reproductive health supplies.
<P>

<a name="31215w25.html_para1">DFID spent a total of over &#163;270 million on reproductive health and HIV/AIDS programmes in the financial year 2002&#150;03, up from around &#163;40 million in 1997&#150;98. DFID is one of the leading bilateral providers of condoms and other reproductive health commodities to developing countries. We are supporting a number of male and female condom social marketing programmes that combine condom procurement and distribution with encouraging behaviour change, communication and capacity building.
<P>

<a name="31215w25.html_para2">The Government have also committed &#163;16 million (over five years) to the Medical Research Council's microbicide development programme. This promises to be an important new technology that, like female condoms, will empower women to protect themselves from sexually transmitted infections.
<P>

<a name="31215w25.html_para3">Condoms or drugs alone are not the answer to tackling HIV/AIDS. We regard provision of reproductive health supplies as an integral part of DFID's wide-ranging support for reproductive health. This includes HIV/AIDS programmes, prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, family planning and maternal and adolescent health. The fight against HIV/AIDS must include effective public programmes involving education, prevention, treatment, care and support and impact mitigation.
<P>

<a name="31215w25.html_para4">Examples of reproductive health and HIV/AIDS programmes supported by DFID that include provision of reproductive health supplies are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>&#163;2 million for a regional HIV/AIDS prevention programme in Asia;
<P>
<BR>
&#163;7.65 million for a regional AIDS programme in Southern Africa;
<P>
<BR>
&#163;2.9 million for support for reproductive health in Zambia.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="31215w25.html_para5">DFID supports a &#163;15 million HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care Project in China, which includes working with vulnerable groups, such as commercial sex workers, through civil society organisations. To date, this work has been focussed on reducing risk and vulnerability through increased condom use, access to education and health services. Government capacity to address the rights of children vulnerable to or affected by HIV and the need to address the gender dimensions of HIV and poverty are being given renewed attention.
<P>

<a name="31215w25.html_para6">More widely, DFID provides technical assistance to strengthen local capacity for health sector planning in a number of countries, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Nepal and Tanzania.




<P>
<P><I>15 Dec 2003 : Column 723W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31215w25.html_para7">The Government are also a major donor to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and supports the Fund's work to provide the widest achievable range of safe and effective family planning and contraceptive methods, including condoms to prevent HIV/AIDS. This includes providing technical assistance to strengthen local planning capacity. DFID's core support has increased from &#163;15 million a year up to 2001&#150;02 to &#163; 18million a year from 2002&#150;03 (planned) until 2005&#150;06. We intend to enter into a funding arrangement with UNFPA for several years ahead, to coincide with their work programme, which will give them greater stability of funding. We have no plans to make an additional grant to UNFPA in the current financial year for provision of reproductive health commodities in addition to the core grant.
<P>

<a name="31215w25.html_para8">The UK played a leading role in setting up the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM), which is now an important source of funding for HIV/AIDS programmes. In July 2003 the UK pledged an additional US$80 million to GFATM (US$40 million per annum over two further years). This will extend our current commitment to 2008 and bring our total contribution to US$280 million.
<P>

<a name="31215w25.html_para9">The Government also support reproductive health activities at a country level. DFID works through Sector Wide Approaches and Direct Budget Support as ways of supporting countries' own development frameworks, which are often in the form of Poverty Reduction Strategies. We work to ensure that sufficient attention is given to reproductive health issues, including the supply and availability of reproductive health commodities. In many circumstances, for example in Cambodia, DFID is also continuing to ring-fence support for reproductive health and HIV/AIDS work, including the supply of reproductive health commodities. The most recent data shows that, in the financial year 2002&#150;03, out of a total of &#163;96 million spent by DFID on Sector Wide Approaches, &#163;31 million (32 per cent.) was spent on programmes that had reproductive health services as one of their target objectives. We work with partners to increase access by poor people to good quality reproductive and sexual health care and services.

 The recent national elections&#151;the first since 1994, when genocide claimed the lives of over 800,000 Rwandans&#151;were an important step towards Rwandan democracy.

But we believe that they were also flawed. The European Union's Election Observation Mission highlighted a

<a name="31215w26.html_para3">We conclude that the Government of Rwanda is committed to establishing a democratic and inclusive state, at the pace that Rwanda's continuing social fragility dictates. We see evidence of this in the recent national elections, the first since the 1994 genocide and civil war. Although flawed, these elections were also well organised and peaceful, and helped establish a democratic process in Rwanda. The Government aims to build democracy from the bottom, by empowering local communities to engage with local government structures around policy development and resource allocation. It believes that democracy built in this way, with its emphasis on social participation and inclusion, will act as a counter-balance to political extremism including genocidal ideology. Local government structures are being established at a rapid rate, and significant resources are now being channelled to them.
<P>

<a name="31215w26.html_para4">We cannot determine a particular year by which "democracy" should be established. The pace of democratisation will be determined by the country's experience as it moves to establish local government, re-integrate ex-combatants returning from the Democratic Republic of Congo and individuals guilty of genocide and allows greater space for Parliament and the public to scrutinise the executive. But we have identified with Government a number of actions that should be taken over the next 12 months in certain key areas of political governance which are necessary to strengthen and demonstrate the move towards democratisation. These actions will be set out in the 2004 UK/Rwanda Memorandum of Understanding, which we will sign with the Government of Rwanda in January.

 Food aid always has the potential to disrupt incentives to local farmers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has been involved from an early stage in detailed consultations with the Home Office and other Government Departments about the implications of an identity cards scheme. The FCO's initial concerns were addressed in the Home Office's paper "Identity Cards: The Next Steps" of November 2003. Issues such as the scheme's compatibility with EU legislation are being addressed in the drafting of the Bill. The FCO is represented on the interdepartmental programme board for ID cards which is taking into account the implications for foreign nationals and British nationals overseas, as well as our visa and consular services.
<P>

<a name="31215w28.html_para0">The Government have adopted an incremental approach to the introduction of ID cards which will ensure that successful roll-out in the first stage is a precondition for any move to compulsory cards.

 The Government of Saudi Arabia have taken significant steps to combat al-Qaeda-related terrorism in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks and in response to increased terrorist activity in Saudi Arabia. It has ratified six of the 12 International Conventions on terrorism; and has signed, but not yet ratified, the Convention on the financing of terrorism. It publicly condemned the 11 September attacks and has made clear repeatedly its condemnation of all terrorism.
<P>

<a name="31215w29.html_para1">Over the past year, the Saudi authorities have adopted wide-ranging measures against terrorism. They have publicly identified wanted terrorist suspects, made many arrests, seized significant caches of terrorist weapons and explosives, sought to counter the ideology underpinning the terrorists' activities, enhanced the security presence in public places, including around residential compounds, and taken measures to counter the flow of terrorist funding. We are co-operating closely with the Saudi authorities, as is the US and other international partners.

<P>
<a name="31215w30.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The expected monthly running costs of the Northern Ireland Assembly while suspension continues are &#163;1.93 million, comprising &#163;0.83 million for MLA salaries, office cost allowance, travel and subsistence expenses and party allowances and &#163;l.l million for general administration. The monthly costs when the Assembly was last fully operational were &#163;2.64 million, comprising 0.97 million for MLA salaries, office cost allowance, travel and subsistence expenses and party allowances and &#163;1.67 million for executive and general administration costs. It is not possible to separate the executive costs of running Assembly business from the general administration costs.

 There are no official figures on the number of people exiled from Northern Ireland as a result of paramilitary intimidation as not all incidents are reported. The needs of exiles are examined in detail in the Legacy Report, an independent needs analysis of victims of the Troubles living in Great Britain. One of the major contributors to this research was Maranatha, a Christian community which has considerable experience in this area. Maranatha estimates that around four people per month are exiled from Northern Ireland to Great Britain.

 As the Chairman of the Northern Ireland Police Fund stated on 5 December 2003, he was made aware on the previous day of serious allegations, including financial irregularities, in respect of the Fund. Two members of staff were questioned by the police, although they were subsequently released without charge. I welcome the commitment of the Fund's Directors to provide continuity of care and services to the Fund's clients, as far as possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how the interests of victims and survivors of the Northern Ireland Troubles from Great Britain are represented in the talks between the British and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland political parties.  [142750]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w30.html_spnew7"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Joint Declaration of 6 May 2003 commits Government to work with the Irish Government, the political parties and victims and survivors to seek to establish what further practical steps can be taken to recognise and address the suffering of all victims, taking into account the state of readiness of the community as a whole to engage. The Government continues to work towards meeting these commitments and as part of this process I am currently engaged in a consultation process to develop the next generation of victims' policy. Included within this process are the findings of The Legacy Report, a recently completed needs analysis of victims of the Northern Ireland Troubles living in Great Britain. The report was commissioned by the Legacy Project, an initiative of the Tim Parry Jonathan Ball Trust which has been allocated Government funding of &#163;250,000. The recommendations made in the report are now under consideration.

[142751]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w30.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Legacy Report, an independent needs analysis of victims of the Northern Ireland Troubles living in Great Britain, makes a number of recommendations for Government across a range of its Departments. One of the recommendations is that the Victims Liaison Unit in the Northern Ireland Office should organise a conference to share best practice and experiences from Northern Ireland. This and other recommendations are currently under consideration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w30.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Association is on the list of organisations consulted when changes are proposed to the Building Regulations in England and Wales, and most recently it has commented on the overall structure and aims of the current review of Part L of the Regulations, which deals with energy conservation.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the Barker report. [R]  [144197]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w30.html_spnew10"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister welcomes the report. Kate Barker and her team have done a thorough job in getting to grips with the issues of housing undersupply.
<P>

<a name="31215w30.html_para2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister believes the review complements the Communities Plan, by highlighting the need for additional housebuilding, and for a more responsive industry in high demand areas. The Barker report deepens our understanding of the constraints that must be overcome.
<P>

<a name="31215w30.html_para3">The report is right to emphasise that this is not just a matter of getting housing numbers up. We have to build sustainable communities, not just houses. For if we do not achieve this, we risk repeating the mistakes of the past, where residents are reluctant to see further development, and this reduces housebuilding further still.
<P>

<a name="31215w30.html_para4">The report says we need to deliver the socially optimal numbers, type and location of housing. That means carefully balancing different objectives and considerations&#151;economic, social and environmental, which fits in well with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's overarching objectives.




<P>
<P><I>15 Dec 2003 : Column 744W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31215w30.html_para5">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister agrees that the planning system is not perfect. Reforms are currently before parliament in the Planning Bill. These, we believe will improve planning policy and process. We look forward to hearing what recommendations are produced in the final Barker report.
<P>

<a name="31215w30.html_para6">Finally, we welcome the analysis of the housebuilding industry, and agree that the industry seems to be in a low output equilibrium. We reinforce Kate Barker's conclusion that the industry could and should make better use of modern methods of construction.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w30.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what measures he will introduce to increase house building as recommended in the Barker report. [R]  [144198]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w30.html_spnew11"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister welcomes the research undertaken by the Barker Review, especially the figures for the additional housing required to fulfil particular aims. The review makes clear that it is not recommending a rate of housebuilding, however, and that it is up to Government to determine what the appropriate level is. It also makes clear that the country needs a housebuilding industry that is more responsive to prices.
<P>

<a name="31215w30.html_para7">The Planning Bill currently before Parliament already puts in place measures that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister believes will deliver a more responsive industry and a higher level of housebuilding. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister also looks forward to seeing the recommendations in Kate Barker's final report in which she will present her policies. Only then will we be in a position to respond fully to any requirement for a higher level of housebuilding.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will take steps to allow parity of access to council housing lists between council officials and elected councillors.  [143850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w31.html_spnew2"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Homelessness Act 2002 made changes to the legislation governing the allocation of accommodation by local authorities (Part 6 of the Housing Act 1996) which came into force on 31 January this year. As a result, local authorities can exclude persons the housing waiting list in only very limited circumstances: namely, if they are certain persons from abroad (who are ineligible for an allocation) or if the authority has determined that they have been guilty of unacceptable behaviour serious enough to make them unsuitable to be a tenant (who may be treated as ineligible).
<P>

<a name="31215w31.html_para2">Elected councillors are bound by the Local Authorities Model Code of Conduct (SI 2001 No. 3575). This does not restrict members' access to housing waiting lists, but does require them to register any interest that they have in land within the authority's area (including tenancies of council property). The Code also requires members to ensure that they do not use their position as a member improperly, to confer on or secure for themselves an advantage or disadvantage, or do anything that compromises the impartiality of those who work for the authority.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what powers, in addition to existing age specific means-tested concessions on council tax, local or billing authorities have to offer discretionary council tax concessions to those over the age of 75.  [143992]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w31.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Local Government Act 2003 provides a power for local billing authorities to offer a locally defined council tax discount if they wish on an individual basis, or for a class of council tax payer. This new power came into force on 18 November 2003. More generally local authorities may also be able to use their "well being" power under section 2 of the Local Government Act 2000. It is for local authorities to decide how they use such discretionary powers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w31.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 For property built after 1991, council tax valuations are based on an estimate of the price the property would have fetched if it had existed and been sold on 1 April 1991.

 It will be for each local authority and registered social landlord to consider the implications on their local circumstances and in particular on their decent home delivery plan of the Inland Revenue's preliminary opinion. While there might be slight delays in any particular transfer it is unlikely this will impact on either the standard of housing or an authority's short-to-medium term housing policy.

 The Government's planning policies on Green Belts are set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 2 (PPG2). These policies include a general presumption against inappropriate development in the Green Belt. Most new building is inappropriate development in the Green Belt and should not be approved, except in very special circumstances. In preparing development plans for their area and determining planning applications, local planning authorities must have regard to the policies in PPG2 wherever green belt land would be affected. In its action programme, "Sustainable Communities: building for the future", published by the Office of theDeputy Prime Minister in February 2003, the Government included a target for each region to maintain or increase the area of land currently designated as Green Belt in local plans.

 Council tax liability is based upon the identification of a "chargeable dwelling". Unauthorised sites are generally too transient to establish that a dwelling exists for the purposes of council tax. If, however, a caravan remains on private land for a period of at least six months, the listing officer may include an entry in the valuation list for council tax purposes. Council tax will then be collected by billing authority, based on the band in the list, by using their normal recovery procedures.

 The Department does not collect this information. However we know that closed lists are restricting the exercise of patient choice in some areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w35.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Department of Health does not use a central database of individual small businesses for consultation purposes. Individual client groups within the Department keep in touch with organisations operating within their policy responsibilities, as appropriate, but these bodies would rarely include small businesses. If a small business interest was identified, the Department would arrange for consultation through the small business service of the Department of Trade and Industry.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health when his Department's electronic recruitment project will start to operate; what sums have been invested in the system; what savings are expected in the NHS recruitment advertising budget; what the reach of the system will be in numerical terms; and whether the NHS will continue to use the print media and other forms of advertising after the electronic system is introduced.  [141205]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w37.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The NHS Careers jobs board pilot (www.nhs.uk/jobs) was launched on 1 December. The cost of the service will be &#163;6 million over a five-year contract. Savings in advertising costs are estimated to be around &#163;24 million a year once national rollout has been achieved. This estimate is based upon a 75 per cent. take-up over three years. The service will be voluntary and all savings will be directed to local patient care. The National Health Service will continue to use a wide range of media in order to attract the best candidates.

 None. Section 6(5) of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 sets out that the Independent Regulator may not authorise an applicant as a national health service foundation trust unless satisfied that the applicant has sought the views of specified persons. The Department of Health guidance, issued to first wave applicants in August, is consistent with the requirements in the Act. The Secretary of State will only support applications where there is evidence that consultation has taken place in line with this guidance.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council does not propose to have a part of the new register with the designated title of health visitor. However, public protection will be assured because anyone proposing to work in a health visiting role must be registered on the specialist community public health nurse part of the register.

<P>
<a name="31215w37.html_spnew11"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The national health service has made good progress on the milestones for management of heart failure. We have made the improvement of care for patients with heart failure a major priority in the next phase of implementation of the coronary heart disease (CHD) national service framework (NSF).

This significant increase includes provision for the impact of the WTD. In addition, &#163;46 million has been allocated over a three year period on top of baseline funding to cover costs associated with the set-up of new ways of working. The WTD pilot sites are testing solutions such as extended roles for non-medical staff, multi-disciplinary teams, networking between sites and consultants working differently. Lessons from the pilots are being disseminated through the WTD bulletin, "Calling Time".

 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2003]:</i> Midwives play a key role in public health, as part of the multidisciplinary team providing pregnancy care. They are often the main pregnancy care provider and are in an ideal position to provide information and support in areas such as parenting, breastfeeding, smoking cessation and early detection and referral for women experiencing domestic violence or post natal depression.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to increase the number of midwife-led maternity units.  [143420]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w38.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Ladyman </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2003]:</i> The national health service provides a variety of types of care for women during pregnancy and childbirth including care in midwife-led units for low risk births. The Government expects this variety to continue and does not support any one single model of maternity service provision in preference to all others. We advocate local decision making in designing appropriate, effective services within available resources. It is inevitable that the requirements of women will vary in different parts of the country and this is why it is so important that decisions about service provision are made at a local level and informed by the ethos of woman-centred care.

<P>
<a name="31215w38.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Ladyman </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2003]:</i> Midwives currently provide an integrated service across primary and acute care sectors. Next year we shall be publishing the children's national service framework (NSF) which includes maternity services. The NSF will outline our plans for maternity services for the next 10 years and will examine the healthcare professionals needed to ensure that women's individual needs are met.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how many midwives <i>(a)</i> took up and <i>(b)</i> resigned from posts in the NHS, in (i) England and (ii) each region in each year since 1997, broken down by strategic and area health authority;  [142049]

<P>
<a name="31215w38.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Information on the number of midwives resigning from or taking up posts in the national health service is not collected centrally. The Department collects information on the number of midwives employed in the NHS as at 30 September each year. As at September 2002, there were 860 more midwives employed in the NHS than in 1997.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list departmental targets relating to midwives and midwifery.  [143799]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w38.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 There are no specific departmental targets relating to midwives or midwifery. Midwives are included in the NHS Plan, manifesto and "Delivering the NHS Plan" targets for increasing the number of nurses, midwives and health visitors employed in the national health service and the number of nurses and midwives entering training each year. The targets are for 20,000 more nurses, midwives and health visitors by 2004 over 1999 levels, 20,000 more by 2005 over 2000 levels, and 35,000 more by 2008 over 2001 levels respectively, and for 5,500 more nurses and midwives entering training each year by 2004 over 1999 levels.
<P>

<a name="31215w38.html_para6">My right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington, speaking at the Royal College of Midwives conference in May 2001, stated that we expect there to be an extra 2,000 midwives employed in the NHS by 2006 over 2000 levels. As at September 2002, there were 680 more midwives employed in the NHS than in 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to introduce a chlamydia screening programme for men.  [142065]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w39.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The chlamydia screening programme, which is being implemented nationally, actively promotes screening for both men and women. The programme is also targeting men that do not traditionally use health services by introducing screening at venues such as armed forces bases and male prisons. The Department of Health have also commissioned the Men's Health Forum to oversee the 'Men and Chlamydia Project'. This project will increase men's awareness of chlamydia, promote the adoption of safer sex practices and encourage men to seek screening and treatment where appropriate.

<P>
<a name="31215w41.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Sheerman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) if he will take steps to ensure that regional variations in the provision of pain management services are tackled;  [140676]
<P>
<UL>(2) what guidance is issued by strategic health authorities on the management of chronic pain in primary and secondary care;  [140677]
<P>
(3) if he will ensure that the recommendations of the Clinical Standards Advisory Group report into pain services are fully implemented;  [140679]
<P>
(4) if he will commission a review into provision of pain services, based upon the reforms undergone by the national health service since the Clinical Standards Advisory Group report in 2000;  [140680]
<P>
(5) whether, in light of the Dr. Foster report, Adult Chronic Pain Management Services in the UK, he will reiterate the recommendations of the Clinical Services Advisory Group calling for closer links between local pain and primary care services;  [140772]
<P>
(6) what action will be taken by his Department in the light of the Dr. Foster and Pain Society report, "Adult Chronic Pain Management Services in the UK".  [140773]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w41.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Clinical Standards Advisory Group report showed that many national health service trusts had developed excellent services, but in some places more needed to be done to drive up standards. The report made recommendations to commissioners and trusts to review local provision of pain services, and how these might be improved. The Department welcomed the report, and expects commissioners and trusts to take these recommendations into account when they plan their service so that variations in provision is reduced and links with primary care trusts improved.
<P>

<a name="31215w41.html_para3">The Department encourages openness in the use of NHS performance information and welcomes independent scrutiny of this information, such as the Dr. Foster and Pain Society report on "Adult Chronic Pain Management Services in the UK". We are committed to making NHS performance information widely available to patients, carers and the public in an accessible and readily understandable format.
<P>

<a name="31215w41.html_para4">The Department has no plans to review the provision of pain services in the NHS or to reissue the Clinical Standards Advisory Group Report. The quality of the service should be monitored locally through the trust, primary care trust commissioners and strategic health authorities to ensure it is provided to meet the needs of the local population.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the omission of <i>(a)</i> community health councils and <i>(b)</i> patient forums from the list of patient organisations who were sent the consultation document, "Choice, Responsiveness and Equity".  [141936]<P>

 The consultation document referred to was a resource pack developed specifically for strategic health authorities (SHAs) and voluntary organisations to support them in leading local consultations. It was 



<P>
<P><I>15 Dec 2003 : Column 784W</I><P>
not sent directly to community health councils (CHCs) as SHAs were responsible for involving CHCs in the local health community's contribution to the consultation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w41.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 December 2003]:</i> It is not possible to give an absolute staffing figure as some staff are employed exclusively to support the patients' forums while others perform additional functions within their organisation. Since the contracts were awarded in September to the forum support organisations, which were formerly known as local network providers, the organisations have been working to recruit staff and build their capacity, ensuring sufficient support for patients' forums was in place from 1 December. Organisations which have been drawn from the not for profit and voluntary sector will continue to build their resources and to respond effectively to demands as they arise from the patients' forums.

However, the position is changing daily as CPPIH continues to process the huge numbers of applicants and make final appointments.
<P>

<a name="31215w41.html_para6">Since 1 September, CPPIH has had in place regional centres and forum support organisations to provide information and guidance to members of the public who may wish to get involved or who have concerns that need addressing locally.
<P>

<a name="31215w41.html_para7">Training of forum members is currently underway and forums will be fully operational shortly. In the meantime all forums are contactable through the forum support organisations.

<P>
<a name="31215w42.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to the answer from the Secretary of State for Defence on 1 December 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 39W, if he will make it his policy to <i>(a)</i> offer annual medical examinations to retired or ex-radiation workers and <i>(b)</i> to amend the guidelines to medical professionals to encourage them to note the profession of radiation workers in the medical notes of their families.  [143034]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w42.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Ionising Radiation Regulations provides for an appointed doctor to undertake pre-employment health checks, reviews of health at least once a year while in work, and a review of health when the employment has ceased where this is necessary to protect the health of the individual.
<P>

<a name="31215w42.html_para0">Authoritative scientific and medical opinion is that health checks for all persons with past employment in the radiation industry would, in most cases, be both clinically inappropriate and a diversion of valuable clinical time away from patients with known needs; unless the person indicates symptoms of disease, or the general practitioner has been informed by the appointed doctor of the special circumstances leading to a possible need for continuing surveillance.




<P>

<a name="31215w42.html_para1">The content of patient records is essentially a matter for the clinical judgment of the practitioner, taking account of guidance from his or her professional body and all of the circumstances. However, in addition to a general obligation to render to patients all necessary and appropriate personal medical services&#151;including offering to patients consultations and, where appropriate, physical examinations for the purposes of identifying, or reducing the risk of, disease or injury&#151;general practitioners in the national health service are required to seek and record relevant information about patients' and patients' families medical history as well as social factors (including housing, employment, and family circumstances) that may affect patients' health.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w42.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 No disease is excluded under the new general medical services contract. All practices will provide essential services, which provide for the management and on-going treatment and care of patients who are ill, or believe themselves to be ill. Practices will continue to offer consultations and, where appropriate, physical examination for the purpose of identifying the need, if any, for treatment or further investigation.

<a name="31215w43.html_para0">For years five and six of the traditional medical undergraduate course, and years two to four of the graduate entry course, the Department of Health/national health service-funded arrangements apply, in which students make no contribution to tuition fees; their liability being met from the Department of Health's multi-professional education and training levy and paid direct to higher education institutions by the NHS Student Grants Unit.
<P>

<a name="31215w43.html_para1">While the proposals contained in the DfES' White Paper, "The Future of Higher Education", include allowing universities to increase tuition fees, there is as yet no clear indication from the higher education sector of the scope or scale of any increased charges.
<P>

<a name="31215w43.html_para2">I have already made it clear that we will if necessary take measures to ensure that any increase in the level of tuition fees will not have an adverse impact on the supply, retention, diversity or quality of students undertaking medical training.

 Section 2 of the National Health Service Act 1977 gives the Secretary of State powers to do anything which is calculated to facilitate the discharge of his duty to continue the promotion of a comprehensive health service. Schedule 3, Paragraph 5 A of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 gives the Secretary of State the power to make a payment to a national health service trust. The payments were made under these powers.

<P>

 The Working Time Directive (WTD) is an integral part of modernising and improving services. The national health service has been aware of the implications of implementing the WTD for doctors in training since 2000, and planning for it forms part of overall NHS planning. Strategic health authorities are currently ensuring that plans will achieve compliance by 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment has been made of the change in the number of <i>(a)</i> doctors and <i>(b)</i> nurses needed in each NHS trust as a result of the implementation of the Working Time Directive.  [141405]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31215w43.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department's guidance to the national health service, HSC 2003/001 'Protecting Staff, Delivering Services&#151;Implementing the European Working Time Directive for Doctors in Training', states that while the number of doctors on an individual rota will generally have to increase, trusts should find ways to reduce the number of resident rotas. A number of methods of doing so are being explored in the 20 Working Time Directive (WTD) pilots and several "Hospital at Night" pilots. Thus, the total staffing requirement does not increase substantially as a result of the WTD.
<P>

<a name="31215w43.html_para5">The NHS is currently developing action plans to achieve compliance with the WTD. As part of this, additional training opportunities will be made available for trusts where the need for a post is agreed by their strategic health authority. This agreement is subject to funding and educational approval being obtained.
<P>

<a name="31215w43.html_para6">It is for local organisations to determine the level of staff needed to implement the WTD and to deliver a quality service. However, the Department is supporting a programme of work to develop new ways of working for nurses and other professional staff.
