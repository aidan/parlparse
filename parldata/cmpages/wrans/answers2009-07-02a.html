 The Office of the Third Sector provides over &#163;515 million of funding for third sector programmes and has commissioned a number of evaluations of individual programmes including Capacitybuilders, Futurebuilders and Grassroots Grants.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families what recent research he has evaluated on levels of efficiency in relation to <i> (a)</i> his Department's spending on schools and <i> (b)</i> funds spent by maintained schools. [283096]</p>

 In recent years, the Department has sponsored a number of research projects and in-house analytical projects in this area. In relation to the efficiency of the Department&#146;s spending on schools, the Consistent Financial Reporting data collection has been implemented since 2002-03. It is used at national and school level internally for modelling the impact of new policies and used externally at school level via the Financial Benchmarking website. This site enables users to prepare charts that compare their school&#146;s income and expenditure profile with that of similar schools so that they can make informed decisions on how to manage their resources effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="90702w0003.htm_para7"><a name="09070268000921">In relation to the efficiency of funds spent by maintained schools the Department has constructed school level measures of efficiency derived from Data Envelopment Analysis models. These models generate a measure of efficiency for every secondary school, which express how effective they have been in delivering pupil outcomes given their resourcing levels and pupil context relative to the most efficient school in the sector that faces similar funding and contextual constraints. A similar project for measuring efficiency in primary schools is due to take place this summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="90702w0003.htm_para8"><a name="09070268000922">The details of the efficiency measures for secondary schools can be found in the following publication:</p>

 Regional Spatial Strategies are required to undergo sustainability appraisals, incorporating the requirements of the European Directive on Strategic Environmental Assessment.

The potential environmental effects of policies for development of broad locations, and any policies involving green belt reviews, are identified in these appraisals and taken into account in the development of the strategy.

 It is the Government's intention to ratify the Convention as soon as possible. In accordance with Article 9 of the Convention of Cluster Munitions, the criminal offences to enforce the Convention's prohibitions on use, development, production, stockpiling, retention and transfer of cluster munitions need to be in place before ratification. A Cluster Munitions Prohibitions Bill which will create the necessary criminal offences has a place in the Government's Draft Legislative Programme that was published on 29 June 2009.</p>

 Reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are collected by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and Commission for Human Medicines (CHM) through the spontaneous reporting scheme; the Yellow Card Scheme. The scheme collects ADR reports from across the United Kingdom for all medicines, including those from prescriptions, over-the-counter and general retail sales. Reports are also received for herbal medicines and other unlicensed medicines.</p>

None of the 23 individual studies reported under this programme to date demonstrates that biological or adverse health effects are produced by radiofrequency exposure from mobile phones or telecommunications base stations (masts).

 There are no current plans to do so. Although specific arrangements are available on request within the national health service to support patients who require oxygen in multiple locations, including holidays within England, there are no imposed arrangements to support the transportation by patients of their own oxygen and medical equipment by air. Each airline has its own regulations about whether they allow patients to take their own oxygen cylinders or medical equipment on board; or whether the airline will supply the equipment (usually at a fee). Before considering flying, those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who require provision of oxygen should also consider consulting their general practitioner about their fitness to fly.</p>

This is especially important in the context of the current economic conditions and welfare reform changes planned for the next two to three years. In addition to our network of modernised Jobcentres we aim to make our services accessible to customers by providing a range of support through outreach, often delivering advisory and other support on partners&#146; premises. That is particularly important in locations where maintaining a Jobcentre could not be justified. Typically such services can be delivered in partnership with Children&#146;s Centres or on Local Authority premises or in conjunction with one of our Welfare to Work Providers.</p>

In both cases, customers remain on jobseeker's allowance. This training could be with a range of learning providers, including further education colleges and provision arranged through the devolved Administrations' vocational training programmes.</p>

Customers undertaking full-time training are transferred to a training allowance, to which the 16-hour study rule does not apply.</p>
