To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on what date he was informed of the Defence Scientific Advisory Council statement on the comparative injury potential of the L547 baton round with the L21A1 baton round issued on 21 August; and what steps he took to bring this to the attention of each of the bodies engaged in finding an alternative to the plastic baton round.  [158052]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The development of the new baton round (the L21A1) was the result of extensive research and included a report by the Defence Scientific Advisory Council on the comparative injury potential of the L547 baton round and the L21A1 baton round. Ministers became aware of the report shortly after it was completed 



<P>

and, confirming as it does the greater safety of the new round over the old one, it was a key factor in the decision to introduce the new round for operational use from 1 June.

 The table provides the information requested. It should be noted that manpower figures for 1 January 2000 are not readily available therefore the nearest possible date of 17 February has been used.

 No police officers have been specifically deployed to control traffic at disinfection points.

Attendance has varied as has been deemed necessary.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, pursuant to his answer of 30 January 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 135W, on terrorism, what his estimate is of <i>(a)</i> the cost of creating statistics on numbers of individuals who have been notified they are at risk as a result of personal files or information discovered in the possession of paramilitaries and <i>(b)</i> the cost of counting the files maintained at RUC headquarters.

<P>
<a name="10423w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The manual records used by the Royal Ulster Constabulary are held on an individual basis so as to ensure that appropriate action is taken in respect of each person who comes under threat. To date there has not been a statistical need to collate this information in a single database. The information requested is therefore not readily available and to undertake a specific scoping study to evaluate the need and cost of setting up such a database would incur a disproportionate cost.

 Since May 1997 my Department has introduced and developed a variety of initiatives which will impact on my hon. Friend's constituency and which promote our objectives of access, excellence, education, and creativity and employment. We have published our strategies to take this forward in "Tomorrow's Tourism" and "A Sporting Future for All", which was recently followed up by the Government's Plan for Sport. We have tackled the issue of social inclusion taking forward the recommendations of Policy Action Team 10 on Arts and Sport and developing social inclusion policies across all our areas which is recognised within the most recent progress report "Building on PAT10".
<P>

The number of people who will benefit, and the resulting cost, will depend on the precise structure of the new provisions and on the number of housing managers who, in future, make the relevant changes to previously qualifying accommodation. The cost of the ARC scheme is not met from public funds but represents a reduction in television licence fee revenue collected.

 The Radio Authority must ensure that licences are re-advertised adequately ahead of the expiry dates to minimise the risk of any gap in the service to listeners.

<a name="10423w05.html_spnew1"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 The Government have no such plans. We believe the interests of deaf people are better served by improving their access to television services rather than by the provision of licence fee concessions. This was the view of the independent review panel on the future funding of the BBC, in its report of July 1999. The Government accepted the report's recommendation that there should be substantial increases in the BBC's targets for subtitling on its new digital services, and the BBC is working towards 100 per cent. subtitling on its digital channels by the tenth anniversary of their launch. The Corporation also aims to increase the amount of subtitling on BBC1 and BBC2 from its present level of 67 per cent. to 80 per cent. by 2003-04.

 As these questions were originally addressed to my right hon.

Such effects are not normally measured by reference to constituencies so it is not practicable to give information in the form requested. However, prior to the transfer of functions to the National Assembly on 1 July 1999, a range of all-Wales policy initiatives and other actions taken by my Department will have impacted on these four constituencies.

<a name="10423w05.html_para1">Caernarfon, Ceredigion, Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and Ynys Mon are included in the area for which the Government secured Objective 1 status at the Berlin European Council in 1999.

 High Sheriffs have no political role, their functions are largely ceremonial, and they neither disburse nor receive any public funds, other than strictly defined (and modest) expenses for a limited number of formal court attendances. Political affiliation has not therefore been regarded as a relevant consideration in their appointment. Sheriffs are, however, asked to refrain from all active participation in local and national politics during their term of office.

To ask the Solicitor-General if he will take steps to ensure that the Crown Prosecution Service provides full disclosure of all the information and evidence concerning the death of Malcolm Reddican to Mr. Reddican's family.  [157964]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w05.html_spmin4"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Disclosure of the evidence and all documentation in relation to the case has been requested by, and on behalf of, Mr. Reddican's family. The Crown Prosecution Service has always indicated a willingness to meet with the family and their legal representatives to discuss the case.
<P>

<a name="10423w05.html_para4">However, leading counsel for the Crown was asked to consider the question of disclosure, in particular the Human Rights implications of disclosing all the case papers. He advised that, while the family are entitled to a full debriefing and to reassurance that the murder of Malcolm Reddican was fully investigated and properly prosecuted, the rights of others must nevertheless be balanced against the rights of the family.
<P>

<a name="10423w05.html_para5">Indeed national policy of the Crown Prosecution Service is generally to withhold details of decisions in individual cases, since not to do so would breach confidentiality and might adversely affect the interests and reputations of the parties involved--witnesses, the victim and the suspect. To discuss publicly a decision not to prosecute could amount to a trial of a suspect without the safeguards which criminal proceedings are designed to provide.

 Some of the information sought by my hon. Friend is already available in supplementary volumes of the annual Home Office publication Criminal Statistics England and Wales, which includes a breakdown of case outcomes by offence type.
<P>

<a name="10423w06.html_para0">In the past, the Crown Prosecution Service has held no records in respect of particular offences, and has been able to publish only aggregate figures on case outcomes. This was because the Service lacked the technical infrastructure required to hold and analyse the vast 



<P>
<P><I>23 Apr 2001 : Column: 22W</I><P>
quantity of data that such records would involve, and because the administrative burden of maintaining manual records was prohibitive. However, there are now two important initiatives within the CPS which promise more detailed and informative case outcomes records for the future.
<P>

<a name="10423w06.html_para1">Firstly, the CPS is conducting a detailed review to ascertain exactly what information on case outcomes is required to manage properly the prosecution process and to account to parliament and to the public for the standard of its work. This review will consider, and make recommendations on, their requirement for detail on the outcome of particular offences and offence types.
<P>

<a name="10423w06.html_para2">Secondly, the Service has a new electronic case management under development, named Compass. This will provide the CPS with the modern technology it needs both to support its core business of reviewing and prosecuting criminal cases, and to make available the management information identified by the review mentioned above.
<P>

<a name="10423w06.html_para3">Of course, no information system can ever be comprehensive. Even with the most sophisticated computer support, a balance must be struck between the data we would like, and the costs of collecting and recording those data.
<P>

<a name="10423w06.html_para4">Wider developments in information management throughout the criminal justice system must also be taken into account. The various criminal justice agencies are working together to develop common systems of data collecting using agreed definitions, with the aim of providing a fully consistent picture of criminal proceedings from the commencement of the case to its conclusion. This project should specify criminal justice information needs for the foreseeable future, and manage the transition to fully automated data collection.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w06.html_spmin2"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Tiverton and Honiton constituency falls within the geographical area covered by the Devon and Cornwall area of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). In November 1999, in line with national policy, CPS Devon and Cornwall, in liaison with the police and the central Devon magistrates court, introduced procedures based on the Narey proposals. All adult defendants charged with a criminal offence in central Devon should make their first appearance before Exeter, Tiverton or Honiton magistrates courts within eight days. Due to the imminent court rationalisation, Tiverton court is due for closure.
<P>

<a name="10423w06.html_para10">A CPS Crown court unit, based in Exeter, deals with serious crime at Exeter Crown court and Barnstaple Crown court. The CPS has set as a goal the better handling of serious cases in the interests of justice and of victims. From 15 January 2001, a fast-track procedure was adopted which will ensure that offences which must be heard in the Crown court normally come before a judge within eight clear days of their first hearing in the magistrates court.
<P>

<a name="10423w06.html_para11">The CPS, together with other agencies, has been working to speed up youth justice, particularly cases involving persistent young offenders. The time taken for Persistent Youth cases has fallen in the CPS Devon and Cornwall area from 141 days in 1997 to 60 days in 2000. This places Devon and Cornwall at the top of the national league.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what measures he is introducing to remove dead badger carcases from holdings.  [154032]<P>

<P>
<a name="10423w07.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 March 2001]:</i> The survey of badger carcases for bovine TB, announced on 7 November 2000, included provision for the collection of badger carcases from farms in badger culling trial areas in Cornwall, Devon, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire. These arrangements have been temporarily suspended following the redirection of State Veterinary Service resources to foot and mouth disease control. In its response to the report of the independent Husbandry Panel the Government recognised the need for more practical guidance for farmers on how to dispose of badger carcases. They are considering how this may be met.

However, farmers in the UK have benefited from this Government's policies to the tune of &#163;1.35 billion since 2 May 1997 in addition to the figure of approximately &#163;3 billion per year in direct CAP payments. Within this total, the value of agrimonetary compensation amounts to some &#163;4,800 per average arable farmer, &#163;3,200 per average dairy farmer, &#163;1,400 per average sheep farmer, and &#163;1,140 and &#163;3,800 per average farmer for agrimonetary compensation related to the Beef Special Premium Scheme and Suckler Cow Premium Scheme respectively.
<P>

<a name="10423w08.html_para10">Hill farmers in Wales will also benefit from the funding which Government are putting into Tir Mynydd, the new support scheme for farmers in less favoured areas. Farmers in the Caernarfon constituency will also have available to them all of the schemes available under the Rural Development Programme for Wales, which is backed by funding of around &#163;0.5 billion over the period 2000-06.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimate the Government have made of the proportion of the overall EU fisheries resource accounted for by British territorial waters.  [153369]

<P>
<a name="10423w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 It is not possible to estimate the UK's share of the total EU fisheries resource occurring in British territorial waters. Fish movements are not determined by international boundaries. They also vary over time according to biological, environmental and other conditions. Furthermore, the ICES scientific assessments on which Total Allowable Catch decisions are based are provided in relation to the level of fish stocks within ICES rectangles. These include areas outside EU waters and do not take account of territorial waters.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w10.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Yeo: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on Her Majesty's Government's policy in respect of the European Parliament's decision on <i>(a)</i> abolishing national control over fishing in coastal waters, <i>(b)</i> access to the North sea and <i>(c)</i> the Shetland and Irish boxes.  [153237]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 I assume that the hon. Gentleman is referring to the resolution which the European Parliament adopted on 17 January 2001 in relation to the Commission report on the consultations the Commission conducted throughout the EU in 1998-99 in preparation for the 2002 Review of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). This resolution is not binding on the Commission and Council. Nor does it call for the abolition of national control over over fishing in national waters but, rather, for maintenance of the status quo if there is any controversy over the future of the six to 12 mile limits. The text of the resolution if available in the Library of the House. As we have consistently made clear, we are confident that the six to 12 mile access restrictions will again be renewed in the forthcoming review of the CFP. We shall be arguing then for these access restrictions to be made permanent.
<P>

<a name="10423w10.html_para1">In the North sea, all the main commercial stocks are now subject to TACs with quotas allocated according to the principle of relative stability, which will continue to apply unless a qualified majority of the Council on the basis of a Commission proposal decides otherwise. There are no signs that this will happen. As a result, we do not expect to see new or increased access to the North sea after 2002.
<P>

<a name="10423w10.html_para2">Restrictions on access to the Irish Box are laid down in the western waters effort regime, which the Commission has confirmed will continue automatically beyond 2002.
<P>

<a name="10423w10.html_para3">The Shetland Box will be rolled over automatically beyond 2002 unless, on the basis of a Commission proposal and acting by qualified majority, the Council decides to make any changes. The Government are currently reviewing the effectiveness of the Box in terms of the objectives originally set for it and a way of clarifying the arguments for its continuation beyond 2002.
<P>

 Following an announcement by the Commission of a formal investigation into state aid schemes in France and Spain, the Government wrote to the European Commission on 28 February setting out the UK's position on these aids.
<P>

<a name="10423w10.html_para4">In particular, we made clear our view that such aids should be considered incompatible with EU state aid guidelines as they distort competition in the fisheries sector and that paying operating subsidies prevents or delays the necessary restructuring of the least economic parts of the fleet. We understand the French aid scheme has been discontinued following Commission investigation.

 MAFF does not hold statistical information on a constituency basis relating to the Department's policies. Information on land use, crop areas, livestock numbers, and labour on holdings in England by parliamentary constituency has been produced from 1 June 1999 Annual Agricultural and Horticultural Census. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House. Information from 1 June 2000 census will be available shortly and also placed in the House Library.
<P>

<a name="10423w11.html_para0">As many of the Department's policies flow from measures agreed within the framework of the EU Common Agricultural Policy, statistical data are normally available on a UK or England basis. Farmers in the UK receive approximately &#163;3 billion per year in direct CAP payments. This does not include the significant additional costs to consumers as a result of CAP price supports which keep EU prices above prevailing world prices. The value of direct CAP payments to the average farmer is set out in the table.

 MAFF does not hold statistical information on a constituency basis relating to the Department's policies. Information on land use, crop areas, livestock numbers, and labour on holdings in England by parliamentary constituency has been produced from 1 June 1999 Annual Agricultural and Horticultural Census. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House. Information from the 1 June 2000 census will be available shortly and also placed in the House Library.
<P>

<a name="10423w11.html_para6">As many of the Department's policies flow from measures agreed within the framework of the EU Common Agricultural Policy, statistical data are normally available on a UK or England basis. Farmers in the UK receive approximately &#163;3 billion per year in direct CAP payments. This does not include the significant additional costs to consumers as a result of CAP price supports which keep EU prices above prevailing world prices. The value of direct CAP payments to the average farmer is set out in the table.

<P>
<a name="10423w12.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 2001]:</i> Disinfected straw laid across the entrance to a farm will provide a limited measure of protection against the spread of the foot and mouth virus. However, even with regular topping up, disinfectant will only be applied to the tyre treads of the vehicles passing over them. The best method of disinfection is the combination of thorough cleansing, preferable with a pressure hose, followed by the use of an approved disinfectant applied to all exposed surfaces using a hose or spray. The advice to people working in the countryside contained on the MAFF website (http://www.maff.gov.uk/) emphasises the importance of thorough spraying.

 The importation of meat is not permitted from regions where foot and mouth disease is present.

Fully matured boneless beef, which does not pose an FMD risk may be imported from other regions subject to veterinary certification. Countries to which these controls currently apply are Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay. Because of their FMD situation prohibitions are currently in place on imports of meat of FMD susceptible species from South Africa, Swaziland and Argentina. All meat imported from third countries is subject to veterinary checks at Border Inspection Posts to ensure that import requirements are met.

 <i>[holding answer 22 March 2001]:</i> I assume that the hon. Member's questions relate to the media speculation that the Government were aware that foot and mouth existed in the UK prior to the first notification of disease in Essex on 19 February. Such speculation is entirely without foundation.
<P>

<a name="10423w12.html_para9">The Ministry has contingency plans to deal with all notifiable exotic animal diseases, including foot and mouth disease. These are regularly updated and tested by the State Veterinary Service. As part of this process, Animal Health Offices, including the one at Stafford, will quite correctly contact contractors from whom they may need services or supplies during a disease outbreak. Any inquires directed to the businesses mentioned by the hon. Member would have been made as part of these contingency planning arrangements.

<a name="10423w12.html_spnew18"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 April 2001]:</i> MAFF Ministers and officials have long been aware of the possibility that foot and mouth disease might be introduced through contaminated meat imports. Foot and Mouth disease is a notifiable disease under Community and Office International Des Epizooties (OIE) protocols and the risks are well known. Notified outbreaks necessarily lead to trade restrictions. Responsibility lies with the European Commission to inform member states of disease controls in other countries and to take appropriate action to safeguard the Community from the risk that disease might be introduced in imported meat. Community law permits member states to take unilateral action to limit imports from countries where a particular risk has been identified, pending the introduction of Community measures.

 Genomics is expected to make a significant contribution to UK agriculture. Genome maps for many agriculturally important plants, animals and micro-organisms have been produced in the last few years. Research on genome maps for plants, livestock and micro-organisms should enable scientists to identify those organisms with desirable traits. This information would be beneficial in speeding up breeding programmes.

<a name="10423w14.html_para12">The increase in advertising and promotional expenditure for the DVLA is partly due to the introduction of the national wheelclamping scheme and the photocard licence campaign. This increased the number of Vehicle Excise Duty campaigns from 17 in 1996-97 to 27 in 2000-01. Highways Agency expenditure during the past two years is set out in the table. The Agency was unable to provide information relating to years 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99.

 The Flaxmill project is for the restoration and refurbishment of a unique grade I listed and historically significant structure in the county town, i.e. the first iron-framed building in the world. The project is to create development space for retail, educational, arts and leisure and residential uses. Advantage West Midlands is to make a significant contribution to the project of some &#163;2.8 million over a three-year period.

Contracts were due to be exchanged in February 2001. But the outstanding matter, together with a delay in the completion of legal documentation between Mowlem Midlands, the joint developer and works contractor, and the owner of the site, meant that this was not possible.

 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> This list identifies the most rural and least densely populated LA areas in England. The decision to target additional Government support on these areas reflects the fact that in broad terms it is the most rural areas that are suffering most of all from the effects of FMD. It equates broadly with the worst effects of FMD, including its broader economic effects. It does not attempt to match every FMD case. Other authorities are likely to suffer less because they are closer to large urban centres and have a wider spread of economic activity. That is why we have targeted relief in this way, using a standard definition of rurality, developed by the Rural Development Commission and the Countryside Agency.

<i>Notes:</i>
<BR>
<i>Housing</i>
<BR>
The housing subsidy figure for 2000-01 is still provisional.
<BR>
The reduction in HIP resources for 2001-02 is due to the introduction of the new Major Repair Allowance, ie a new way of allocating resources for works to council stock; the table shows Cannock's indicative figure for 2001-02.
<BR>
 <sup>3</sup>  There is no data for Loan Charges Defective Housing.
<BR>
<i>Cannock Chase SRB</i>
<BR>
<i>Cannock Gateway</i>
<BR>
A comprehensive package of private sector led development with community involvement in a coal closure area. The seven-year scheme aims to tackle problems of drug abuse and child issues, low levels of educational attainment and involves major land reclamation schemes for private sector led employment development.
<BR>
<i>Trent Challenge</i>
<BR>
A six-year scheme led by Cannock Chase District Council, which complements the Regional Challenge bid for inward investment at the Lea Hall Power Station site. It targets three settlements, which have experienced considerable change in the wake of the closures of the local coal mine and power station. The scheme will enhance employment prospects through initiatives aimed at raising education and skill levels and by addressing housing, environment and quality of life issues.
<BR>
<i>Transport</i>
<BR>
The transport figures in the table apply to Staffordshire and not Cannock Chase District.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will set out, with statistical information relating as directly as possible to <i>(a)</i> Plymouth, Sutton constituency, <i>(b)</i> Plymouth, Devonport constituency and <i>(c)</i> South-West Devon constituency, the effects on the Plymouth unitary authority area of his Department's policies and actions since 2 May 1997.

<P>
<a name="10423w16.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The principal funding that this Department has provided to Plymouth city council in the years 1997-98 to 2001-02 and to Devon county council in 1997-98 is shown in the tables. These include grants and borrowing approvals for revenue and capital expenditure.
<P>

<a name="10423w16.html_para0">It is not possible to determine how much of this money has been spent on Plymouth, Sutton and Plymouth, Devonport constituencies and the part of South-West Devon constituency in the Plymouth unitary authority area. It is for the local authority to decide where within its boundary these resources are applied.

The Annual Capital Guideline (ACG) figures for Hammersmith and Fulham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest reflect small additional allocations made to those boroughs to fulfil ministerial commitments that authorities with housing stock would receive a combined 2001-02 housing ACG and Major Repairs Allowance (MRA) allocation that was at least 10 per cent. above their 2000-01 housing ACG. The adjustments were necessary as the final MRA allocations were not known until after the Housing Investment Programme allocations had been decided. <P>

 Under the previous Government, long-term projections of household growth were converted using a "predict and provide" methodology into inflexible targets for new housing. This Government's approach is to enable public consideration at the regional level about the likely rate of housing provision required in a region over the foreseeable future, expressed as an annual rate, and to keep this under regular review.

 The information requested on planning permissions within and outside green belts is not available centrally. The Department's land use change statistics provide estimates of the annual aggregate change to residential use within and outside green belts in England. In 1998, the latest year for which figures are available and during which the last Government's policy guidance on housing was still operational, 2,650 hectares of 'not previously developed' land outside green belts changed to residential use. Over the same period, 140 hectares of land within green belts changed to residential use, about 0.01 per cent. of the total area of green belts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w18.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Rateable value thresholds for mandatory rate relief were increased on 1 April 2000, when the recent business rate revaluation came into effect. The rateable value thresholds under the village shop rate relief scheme were increased from &#163;5,000 to &#163;6,000 for mandatory relief and from &#163;10,000 to &#163;12,000 for discretionary relief. The rateable value threshold below which rates are not payable on empty properties was increased from &#163;1,500 to &#163;1,900. These increases reflect average changes in the rateable values of properties below the old thresholds. The &#163;2,500 reduction in rateable value of properties used for the breeding and rearing of horses and ponies remained unchanged at the 1 April 2000 revaluation, because there was no significant change in the rateable values of such properties.

 It is for local planning authorities in the first instance to decide on specific planning conditions. The advice in DOE Circular 11/95--The Use of Conditions in Planning Permissions--is that the use of conditions may be acceptable to secure a high quality of design in a proposal to make a positive contribution to a site and its surroundings and show consideration for its local context. Conditions may, for example, specify matching materials or the use of only original materials on listed buildings but the source of materials is a matter for the developer or builder.

 Where proposed lighting installations, or proposals involving lighting, constitute development, they fall within the scope of planning control, and require submission of a planning application to the local planning authority in the usual way. Where they decide to approve an application, local planning authorities can impose planning conditions to limit any adverse impacts of light. However, the installation of some lighting does not constitute development--for example, if it does not materially affect the appearance of the building--and is therefore outside planning control. The courts have ruled that light itself cannot be treated as development. We have no plans to change the position.

 The Government are committed to controlling pollution from abandoned mines and have both strengthened the regulatory regime concerning abandoned mines and supported works and programmes to address minewater pollution. Under the Mines (Notice of Abandonment) Regulations 1998 operators must now give the Environment Agency advance warning of any proposed abandonment to allow preventive action to be taken to avoid minewater breakouts. In addition, the Government have brought into effect section 60 of the Environment Act 1995, thus removing a statutory defence for owners and former operators of mines for minewater pollution, and have given the Environment Agency new powers to take remedial action under the Anti-Pollution Works Regulations 1999. Among the specific remedial and preventative schemes supported by the Government are programmes operated by the Coal Authority in close liaison with the Environment Agency and Scottish Environment Protection Agency to prevent and treat significant water pollution from abandoned coal mines. Twelve treatment sites are now working and five others are under construction with a forward programme for four sites each year.

However, the scheme must also operate without prejudice to other requirements of EU or national law on relevant product issues, which may include animal testing, and which determine which products may actually be placed on the market.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on his policy on major developments in <i>(a)</i> the area of national parks and <i>(b)</i> areas of outstanding natural beauty in respect of the provisions of paragraph 3.21 of PPG7.  [158389]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w20.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 PPG7 makes it clear that major developments should not take place in national parks save in the most exceptional circumstances. Such developments will need to demonstrate that they are in the public interest before they proceed. All such applications for development are subject to rigorous examination and will be subject to the specific assessments set out in paragraph 4.5 of PPG7. The Government have made clear that it expects the same considerations to apply for proposals for major developments in areas of outstanding natural beauty.
<P>

<a name="10423w20.html_para1">Paragraph 3.21 of PPG7 indicates that new house building and other new development in open countryside, away from established settlements or from areas allocated for development in development plans, should be strictly controlled. But this paragraph also includes policy which would exceptionally allow individual isolated new houses to be built in the countryside if the proposals were of the highest quality and truly outstanding in terms of architecture and landscape design.
<P>

<a name="10423w20.html_para2">The Government believe that there is a need for more affordable housing in rural areas, and do not see the current planning exception for isolated large dwellings which may be built in unsustainable locations as consistent with that priority, or with its objectives for the countryside more generally. We therefore intend to consult on amendments to PPG7 to remove the exceptions policy which allows such large dwellings to be built.

 Over 60,000 new defence contracts are placed each year and the Ministry of Defence does not routinely analyse all of these on a regional basis. However, it is estimated that the value of defence equipment contracts placed in the north-west of England was &#163;850 million in financial year 1997-98 and &#163;1,200 million in 1998-99. These estimates relate to the locations of defence equipment contractors, and do not take account of the locations of sub-contractors.

 As a consequence of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) initiative, operations at the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) range, Shoeburyness, known also as New Ranges, will be carried out by NewDERA under an arrangement which is currently being negotiated. The intention is that NewDERA will have the flexibility to conduct operations on ranges while meeting the needs of the Ministry of Defence and maintaining value for money for the taxpayer. Meanwhile DERA is continuing to work with SERCO Ltd. to rationalise the New Ranges estate to introduce new businesses which are able to co-exist with continuing range activities.

 There are well-established procedures in place to enable civil authorities to raise requests for military assistance in a wide variety of circumstance.

The procedures ensure that past experience and the current capabilities of the armed forces are drawn upon in order to make the most effective and appropriate contribution to crisis management and (in this case) combating the spread of the disease. In particular, the armed forces are skilled practitioners in a number of important roles such as logistic support and command and control. These skills are exercised on a regular basis and, in the event of a crisis, their high state of readiness can be drawn upon.

 Since 1990, the Chemical and Biological Defence Sector at Porton Down has undertaken studies in which 25 service volunteers were exposed to small amounts of dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO). The two protocols covering this work were submitted to the Ethical Subgroup of the Defence Scientific Advisory Committee (DSAC) Medical Committee in November 1989 and April 1990, respectively. The studies were designed to investigate whether DMSO could be used as a chemical warfare agent simulant (training agent). Volunteers were exposed to either DMSO applied as a liquid to the skin or as an inhaled vapour. The quantity of the metabolite dimethylsulphide (DMS) exhaled on their breath was measured.

In this context, when the European Union embarks on detailed examination of an option making use of NATO assets and capabilities, particular attention will be paid to consultation with Canada.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2001]:</i> School Achievement Awards are for schools that have substantially improved their results since 1997 or achieved better results last year than other schools in similar circumstances. They are a very effective way of recognising those achievements and enabling schools to reward whole staff teams. The very regrettable error affecting a minority of the schools involved should not detract from that.

Where an exclusion is necessary, provision for excluded pupils is being greatly increased. There are now 1,000 more places and nearly 600 more teachers and support staff in Pupil Referral Units (PRUs) than in 1997. The quality of education provided by PRUs has improved rapidly and by September 2002 all local education authorities will be required to offer excluded pupils a full-time education, not the 2-3 hours typical in the past.

<a name="10423w28.html_para7">Arrangements for identifying and providing for children with SEN are set out in the Education Act 1996 (and, prior to this, the Education Acts 1993 and 1981). This Act is supported by the Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of Special Educational Needs, issued in 1994, to which local education authorities (LEAs) and schools must have regard. The Government published "Meeting Special Educational Needs: A Programme of Action" in November 1998 following consultation on its proposals to support the increased achievement of children with SEN.
<P>

<a name="10423w28.html_para8">The Code of Practice sets out five recommended stages for addressing the different levels of pupils' SEN. Stages 1-3 are school-based, with support from specialists from outside the school at stage 3. The vast majority of these children will have their needs met in mainstream schools. Stage 4 involves the LEA considering the need for, and if appropriate making, a multi-disciplinary assessment of the child's needs. Stage 5 involves the LEA making and monitoring a statement of SEN. The Government are currently reviewing the Code of Practice.

<P>
<a name="10423w28.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Section 324(3) of the Education Act 1996 requires that statements specify the special educational provision to be made for individual children. We have no plans to change this. The existing Special Educational Needs Code of Practice recognises that, in many cases, specific provision should be quantified, while in other cases flexibility should be retained. The revised Code of Practice, which will shortly be placed before Parliament for approval, will expand on this guidance. It will make it clear that a statement should describe clearly all of the child's special educational needs in full; set out the main objectives that the special educational provision aims to meet; specify clearly and detail the provision required to meet each of the child's needs; describe the arrangements for setting shorter-term objectives for the child and any special arrangements for the annual review of the statement. The revised Code will recognise that there may often be a need for provision to be expressed in terms of hours, equipment or personnel, and it will also state clearly that authorities must not, in any circumstances, have blanket policies not to quantify provision in statements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w29.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 This matter does not come within the provisions of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill. Specific provision for speech and language therapy might be set out in a statement of special educational needs (SEN) maintained in relation to a particular child. In the draft revised SEN Code of Practice 



<P>
<P><I>23 Apr 2001 : Column: 117W</I><P>
we have indicated that addressing speech and language impairment should normally be recorded as educational provision unless there are exceptional reasons for not doing so.
<P>

<a name="10423w29.html_para0">Local education authorities receive support under the Standards Fund to enhance speech and language therapy services in conjunction with the NHS and the voluntary sector. Of the &#163;82 million available for SEN under the Standards Fund 2001-02, we envisage that about &#163;10 million will be spent on improving speech and language therapy provision.
<P>

<a name="10423w29.html_para1">In addition, I announced on 27 March a &#163;10 million initiative to provide communication aids for children with SEN and disabilities. This expenditure will be incurred over the period 2002-03 and 2003-04.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w29.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We do not hold information centrally on the number of primary schools currently teaching a second language, but it is estimated that one in five do so. The National Curriculum contains guidance for teaching 7 to 11-year-olds, covering skills, knowledge and understanding, together with attainment targets. We have also published a scheme of work for primary French, and further materials for primary German and Spanish.
<P>

<a name="10423w29.html_para2">I recently announced further funding of over &#163;200,000 for the Early Language Learning initiative, through which we are piloting approaches to extend language teaching in primary schools, gathering good practice and developing classroom materials. In our formal response to the Nuffield Languages Inquiry we set out our intention to build on existing links between primary schools and specialist language colleges. The increasing number of colleges and the developing focus on their roles as 'hubs' of excellence will enhance opportunities for primary schools to access languages expertise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w29.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The number of specialist schools has increased threefold since May 1997, from 181 to 536, with a further 73 designated to start operating from September 2001. Our target of 1,500 specialist schools by 2006 proposed in the Green Paper "Schools: Building on Success" is an increase of 1,000 on our original target of 500. As a result of the 2000 Spending Review, the Government will be providing an additional &#163;33 million from the Capital Modernisation Fund over the next three years to make it possible to expand the specialist schools programme at a faster rate to reach 1,000 specialist schools by 2003. This will enable us to introduce all three of the new specialisms (Science, Engineering, and Business and Enterprise) in September next year.

of the number of people with learning disabilities who have experienced bullying and harassment at work in the last year.  [158077]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w29.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 People with learning disabilities can take cases under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) where they believe they have faced harassment or bullying which amounts to a "detriment" on account of their disability. My Department monitors Employment Tribunal decisions and emerging case law on all aspects of the DDA, including complaints made by disabled people about harassment and bullying. In its final report, "From Exclusion to Inclusion", the Disability Rights Task Force commented that the DDA is effective in its treatment of harassment but proposed strengthening the Employment Code of Practice. In our response to the Task Force, entitled "Towards Inclusion" and published on 5 March, we explain that we have asked the Disability Rights Commission to ensure that the current section in the Code of Practice on harassment is reviewed and strengthened, as necessary.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2001]:</i> The net present value of the estimated &#163;982 million income contingent loans issued in 1999-2000 to students domiciled in England and Wales is estimated to be &#163;590 million. The nominal rate of interest required to maintain this net present value with a threshold for repayment of &#163;15,000 per year is estimated to be around 4&#189; per cent.

 I am pleased to confirm that the Central Government National Training Organisation completed a workforce development plan for the Civil Service. The plan is called "Developing 21st Century Skills" and sets out the priority skills needs for the Civil Service and actions that will be taken to address these needs.

<P>

<a name="10423w30.html_para0">There is one exception. Candidates for appointment to the Civil Service Appeal Board must be either recently retired or about to retire from the Senior Civil Service or a recently retired (or about to retire) Civil Service Trade Union official. They are appointed for an initial period of three years with a possibility of re-appointment. This is explained in the advertisement. To ensure that board members are up to date with civil service/trade union practice and procedures, they are not allowed to serve beyond age 70. In practice, however, appointees normally complete their full period of office before reaching that age.

 EU partners felt it was important to send an early and clear message to those concerned including China and member states of the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) about the EU's approach towards the US resolution on China, and the expected Chinese no-action motion at the current UNCHR session. EU Foreign Ministers agreed a common position at the General Affairs Council on 19 March, after receiving informal briefing from the US authorities. It was agreed not to co-sponsor the US resolution on China at the UN Commission on Human Rights, but to strengthen the EU common position by actively lobbying against the expected Chinese no action motion, for the first time since 1996.

 Kazakhstan's human rights record since independence is mixed. In August 1998 the Government acceded to four UN Conventions: the Convention Against Torture; the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; the Convention on the Eradication of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Foreign Secretary pressed President Nazarbaev, during the latter's visit to Britain last November, for Kazakh accession to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and abolition of the death penalty.

<a name="10423w30.html_para2">Serious problems remain.

 In accordance with the recommendations for further study in the preliminary report Phase 2A, the procurement and installation of measuring equipment on the islands is now complete and the collection of data has begun. At least six months of data are required before the next phase, 2B, can start. A project manager for Phase 2B has been appointed and terms of reference are currently being drawn up. We hope to have let the tender for this phase within 5-6 months. It is too early to say when the report will be ready but we would expect Phase 2 to take about one year. Phase 3 studies will depend on the findings of Phase 2.

 There were no UN observers at the Lockerbie trial. There were several international observers, representing five organisations, nominated by the Secretary-General. We understand that one of these observers has written a report in a private capacity. The Registrar of the Lockerbie trial was sent a copy of the report and has made the report available to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

 We have been and continue to be very concerned about events in Indonesia, and especially in Maluku. The second anniversary on 19 January of the outbreak of intercommunal unrest was marked by renewed violence in Ambon: at least 14 people died in clashes between Muslims and the security forces. This illustrated the fragility of the situation in Ambon at a time

<P>

<a name="10423w31.html_para1">Both the Secretary of State for International Development and I visited Indonesia in October 2000 and discussed the situation in Maluku with President Wahid and senior ministers. We urged tolerance and restraint and made clear to them the Indonesian Government's responsibility to maintain law and order and take immediate steps to bring the perpetrators of the violence to justice. I also discussed events with Alwi Shihab, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, in the margins of the EU-ASEAN meeting in Vientiane on 12 December. I further discussed the situation in Indonesia with the Indonesian Ambassador in London on 4 April.

<a name="10423w31.html_para2">Our Ambassador to Indonesia has visited the Moluccas twice this year. The visits provided an opportunity to assess the situation at first hand.

 We remain concerned about the human rights of all in Sudan and we regularly urge all sides in the civil war to respect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms. We make representations about our human rights concerns to the Government of Sudan, both bilaterally and with our EU colleagues through the EU/Sudan critical dialogue. The dialogue provides a forum for strong criticism of the Sudanese Government, and allows for a co-ordinated EU assessment of the human rights situation.
<P>

<a name="10423w31.html_para4">We also work with our EU colleagues in the UN fora to keep our concerns on the international agenda. For example, the EU recently sponsored a UN General Assembly human rights resolution on Sudan and we are currently working on a similar text at the UN Commission on Human Rights.

 The information has been provided by the Chief Constable and is set out in the table. It compares the actual number of officers in post with the police authority's budgeted provision. The number of funded police posts has not been increased due to civilianisation of support posts that were previously filled by police officers. Between December 1992 and 31 January 2001 civilian support staff numbers in Devon and Cornwall Constabulary have increased by 380 to 1,428.

<P>
<a name="10423w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 In addition to existing work with the Prince's Trust in several young offender institutions, I am pleased to announce a new joint initiative, running for 12 months between the Prison Service and the Prince's Trust.
<P>

<a name="10423w32.html_para2">We plan to run the Trust's Volunteers programme for young adult offenders in six prisons--Chelmsford, Gloucester, Leeds, Liverpool, New Hall, Norwich and at Her Majesty's Young Offender Institution Reading.
<P>

<a name="10423w32.html_para3">The purpose of the Volunteers programme is to assist in the personal development of young people. The aim of this initiative is to replicate the scheme's current record, as assessed by the Trust, of moving 70 per cent. of unemployed participants on the programme into full-time employment, training or education within three months of completing the programme for this challenging group of young people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I was joined on 22 March by the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) representatives to launch publicly the availability of the

<P>

<a name="10423w32.html_para4">The braille and audio tape versions of a leaflet on postal voting, "Make your voice heard", also contain information about the new voting procedures at polling stations for blind and partially sighted voters.

<a name="10423w32.html_para5">Electoral administrators have been encouraged to make contact with local organisations representing the visually impaired to organise demonstrations of the voting device. The RNIB has been closely involved in the development of the device and has assisted in publicising the new voting procedures.

<a name="10423w32.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Heald: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the full-time equivalent number of officers was who <i>(a)</i> transferred out of Metropolitan police and <i>(b)</i> were seconded to other forces as a result of the major boundary changes in 2000; and if he will provide a figure for the number of officers in the Metropolitan police, taking the changes into account, immediately prior to the boundary change which is comparable with subsequent equivalent figures.  [157779]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w32.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2001]:</i> I understand from the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis that between 1 January 1999 and 6 April 2001, 108 officers transferred to the Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey forces.




<P>
<P><I>23 Apr 2001 : Column: 131W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10423w32.html_para6">I am also told by the Commissioner that 466 police officers were seconded to the forces of Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey when the boundary change took effect on 1 April 2000. These officers will return to the Metropolitan police over the following two years as and when replacements are recruited by the three county forces.
<P>

<a name="10423w32.html_para7">The effects of the boundary change were incorporated into the police funding formula and the overall transfer was in terms of financial resources, not of officers. Where data on police numbers are used in the formula, a notional transfer of 887 from the Metropolitan police to the three county forces was applied. Because it is for police authorities and Chief Constables to decide how resources are utilised, it is not appropriate to convert the notional transfer directly into a full-time equivalent strength for the Metropolitan police immediately prior to the boundary changes.
<P>

<a name="10423w32.html_para8">Between 31 March and 30 September 2000, the strength of the Metropolitan police fell by 790, to 24,695. This will have been due to a combination of boundary change resources and the temporary secondments to Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey. By 31 January 2001, the numbers of officers in the Metropolitan police had risen to 24,861, 166 more than on 30 September 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w33.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Tynan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what powers he has to prevent the trafficking of women and girls in to the United Kingdom for sexual exploitation and prostitution; and what action is being taken at international level to combat such exploitation.  [157527]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w33.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2001]:</i> The Sex Offences Review recommended to Government in "Setting the Boundaries" that there should be a specific new offence of trafficking for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation for reward. The Government are considering that recommendation in the light of the responses to the report. The Home Office is also co-ordinating a wide range of work by various Government Departments in relation to establishing trafficking offences. These measures support and supplement work being done internationally both in the European Union (EU) and the United Nations (UN). The United Kingdom has already signed the UN Protocol on Trafficking in Persons, especially women and children; and is taking part in discussions within the EU on proposals to establish common offences and penalties in relation to preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, paying particular attention to the sexual exploitation of women and children.
<P>

<a name="10423w33.html_para0">The EU funded STOP programme exists to encourage, support and reinforce practical co-operation to tackle trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation in children. The International Organisation for Migration, of which the United Kingdom is a full member, is also engaged on work in this field.
<P>

<a name="10423w33.html_para1">Apart from prosecution for other offences, traffickers who attempt to facilitate the illegal entry of their victims may be prosecuted for the offence of facilitation which now carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment. 



<P>
<P><I>23 Apr 2001 : Column: 132W</I><P>
Alternatively, or in addition, such traffickers who are also foreign nationals may also be refused leave to enter the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="10423w33.html_para2">Apart from prosecuting traffickers, the National Crime Squad, National Criminal Intelligence Service, Immigration Service, Police and Europol are all actively involved in the gathering and dissemination of intelligence on trafficking and people smuggling. This work has been co-ordinated through a multi-agency taskforce entitled Project Reflex. The establishment of a network of Immigration Liaison Officers at strategic locations will further facilitate the exchange of information. The announcement by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary in his reply to my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) on 5 April 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 256W, of an additional &#163;90 million over three years to combat organised crime includes an additional &#163;22.5 million in support of Project Reflex. This new money will enable further work to be carried out to combat trafficking and people smuggling, including the establishment of a joint team drawn from the National Crime Squad and Immigration Service. The EU is working closely together, drawing upon existing co-operation, to tackle the criminals responsible for this horrific trade.

 The Home Office is working to build a safe, just and tolerant society in which the rights and responsibilities of individuals, families and communities are properly balanced, and the protection and security of the public are maintained. Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in Home Office Annual Reports.

 Essex police conducted a review of the initial criminal investigation by Sussex police, which considered their treatment of the possibility that the assault on Jay Abatan was racially motivated. Although the Essex review did raise a number of concerns with regard to lessons which could be learnt from the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report, it does not specifically criticise Sussex police for not treating the assault on Jay Abatan as racially motivated.

 It is, as yet, too soon to evaluate the impact of section 111 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (previously section 4 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997), which introduced mandatory minimum sentences for repeat burglars. The effects of the provisions, which were brought into force in December 1999, will take some time to be felt because section 111 applies only when all three offences are committed after implementation and one of the two previous offences is committed after the offender has been convicted of the other.

The FIVE Project (Education, Training and Employment) is a partnership of the Prince's Trust with the Youth Offending Teams (YOTs) and local education authorities in five cities of England and Wales. It works with young offenders and those at risk of offending, aged 14-17, through the provision of two Prince's Trust programmes. These mentoring and education programmes can be used in support of Final Warnings to young offenders. The YJB have contributed approximately &#163;340,000 to this scheme. The YJB are also contributing almost &#163;248,000 to Plymouth Community Justice Project. This restorative justice project includes Family Group Conferencing, Victim Offender Mediation, direct and indirect reparation to the community where possible. The project will involve young people at all stages of the Criminal Justice System (Final Warning, Action Plan Orders, Supervision Order, Detention and Training Orders).

<a name="10423w35.html_para15">Plymouth Community Justice Project--Mentoring is aimed at Persistent Young Offenders and those on Bail Support programmes, together with other young offenders at risk of further offending or harmful behaviour. The objectives of this project include reducing offending, reducing the risk of offending, increasing the numbers on bail attending court and not offending while on bail, demonstrating an improvement in the young person's self esteem/confidence and contributing to the target Behaviour Support Plan to reduce school exclusions. The YJB are contributing &#163;176,000 to this project.

 The Lieutenancies Act 1997 requires the lord lieutenant of a county or area to notify to Her Majesty the name of any person whom he proposes to appoint as a deputy lieutenant. A commission as deputy lieutenant is not granted to that person until the lord lieutenant has been informed by the Secretary of State that Her Majesty does not disapprove of the granting of the commission.

 There are 41 lieutenants in Lancashire. They come from all parts of the county. The deputy lieutenants of a county or area are appointed by the lord lieutenant, subject to the Queen not disapproving of the granting of the commission. When considering the appointment of deputy lieutenants, the lord lieutenant looks at the geographical spread, to ensure that all parts of the county are represented. No information about the political affiliation of deputy lieutenants is held, though appointments are based not on political affiliation but on place of residence and service to the community. Information about how many of the county's deputy lieutenants are Lancastrians by birth is not held. Lords lieutenant are specifically advised that within each county or area, deputy lieutenants should be widely representative of its life in social range, gender, ethnic mix and service to the community.

 For the first time Departments and agencies nationally and locally have been brought together to work in partnership towards joint performance targets. The Home Office has been at the fore of the 10-year strategy launched in May 1998 to break the link between drugs and crime. The strategy was underpinned with an additional &#163;217 million over three years for anti-drugs activity from the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review. This is in addition to the &#163;1.4 billion spent annually on anti-drug work. The targets for the 10-year strategy as set out in "Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain" are:

</FONT></UL>
<a name="10423w36.html_para5">The Government's anti-drugs strategy clearly recognises that law enforcement continues to be vital in tackling the drugs problem in the United Kingdom. The police service at all levels will continue to concentrate on targeting drug dealers and traffickers and bringing them to justice. There is a particular emphasis on Class A drugs, as these cause the greatest harm. The strategy encourages the police to work with other agencies to disrupt local drug markets and to force drug dealers off our streets, thereby reducing the harm to our communities and the exposure of young people to drugs. The strategy builds on the existing work by the police with the aim of reducing levels of street dealing and the availability of drugs in communities.
<P>

<a name="10423w36.html_para6">The Drug Treatment and Testing Order (DTTO), a community sentence aimed at serious drug misusing offenders, has been available to courts in England and Wales since 1 October 2000. Its main aim is to get offenders to stop re-offending, with the longer-term aim of getting them off drugs for good. The decision was made to roll-out the DTTO in the light of an independent

<a name="10423w36.html_para7">The Government are well on the way to ensuring that all police forces in England and Wales have Arrest Referral Schemes in place to help drug-misusing arrestees to access the treatment they need ahead of our 2002 target. While it is too early to properly measure the success of this scheme, initial feedback from October to December 2000 suggests that half of arrestees seen by arrest referral workers had not accessed treatment previously, which suggests a positive impact on crime.
<P>

<a name="10423w36.html_para8">In the Prison Service, in the short term we look at measures such as the random mandatory drug testing (MDT) rate or the take up of drug treatment. Both show extremely encouraging results with the random MDT rate falling from 20.8 per cent. in 1997-98 to a projected figure of 12.5 per cent. in 2000-01. We expect over 37,000 CARATs (Counselling, Assessment, Referral, Advice and Throughcare services, the new drug package of treatment services) assessments to have been completed in 2000-01. In the long term, the Prison Service is establishing independent research to measure the effectiveness of its drug strategy in reducing both drug misuse and reoffending rates.

 The Department's policies and initiatives have made a significant contribution to the Government's overall objectives of eradicating child poverty in 20 years, and halving it within 10; promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age while protecting the position of those in greatest need; and, combating poverty and promoting security and independence in retirement for today's and tomorrow's pensioners.
<P>

<a name="10423w37.html_para17">These goals are being pursued nationwide and our achievements are set out in our annual "Opportunity for all" reports. Our second report, "Opportunity for all--One year on: making a difference" (CM4865, September 2000) sets out what progress has been made in the past year, as well as highlighting what more needs to be done. Nationwide statistical information is necessarily more complete than data at a local authority level, but the following provides a comparative guide to the effect of the Department's policies and actions in Plymouth, Sutton, Plymouth, Devonport, South-West Devon and the Plymouth unitary authority area since May 1997.
<P>

<a name="10423w37.html_para18">Measures in our five Budgets so far will lift over 1.2 million children nationally out of poverty. These include record increases to Child Benefit, the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit, increases in the income-related benefits, the minimum wage and tax changes.
<P>

<a name="10423w37.html_para19">Child Benefit is worth &#163;15.50 a week for the eldest child and &#163;10.35 a week for other children from this April: nationally about 7 million families receive Child Benefit, in Plymouth, Sutton 9,631 families benefit, in Plymouth, Devonport 13,143 families benefit, in South-West Devon 11,376 families benefit and in the Plymouth unitary authority area 29,365 families benefit.
<P>

<a name="10423w37.html_para20">We now have the lowest unemployment rate in 25 years. The New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the over 50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. In the period since May 1997 the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance nationally has reduced from 1,562,400 to 960,600; in Plymouth, Sutton the number has reduced from 4,600 to 1,900, in Plymouth, Devonport from 3,700 to 1,400, in South-West Devon from 1,300 to 500 and in the Plymouth unitary authority area from 9,000 to 3,700. Since May 1997 the number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased from 1,013,500 to 894,100 nationally; in Plymouth, Sutton the number has reduced from 2,400 to 1,800, in Plymouth, Devonport from 2,800 to 2,600, in South-West Devon from 700 to 600 and in the Plymouth unitary authority area from 5,600 to 4,800.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what age limit is placed on appointments to public bodies in his Department; if this limit is mentioned in advertisements for such posts; and what the basis for this limit is.  [158130]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w39.html_spnew0"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 For appointments as members of the Law Commission in England and Wales, no mention is made of any age limit in the advertisement, but in the information pack sent to applicants it states that the Lord Chancellor will consider applications from candidates up to the age of 65. Law Commissioners work full-time and this is the normal age of retirement.

committees, save in exceptional circumstances, a member will not be appointed over the age of 65 and the retirement ages are as follows:

<a name="10423w39.html_para4">For the equivalent advisory committees on JPs and on GCITs in England and Wales, appointments cannot normally extend beyond a person's 70th birthday.

<a name="10423w39.html_para5">Otherwise, no age limit is placed on the non-judicial appointments the Lord Chancellor makes to his non- departmental public bodies. However, where the appointment is to be held by someone who is a serving member of the judiciary, including JPs, the retirement ages for judges will be borne in mind.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w39.html_wqn1"><B> Tony Wright: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department for what reason his Department advertises part-time appointments with an age limit for applicants of 62.  [158061]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w39.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 A normal upper age limit of 62 for applicants to part-time judicial posts is principally set to take account of the retirement age for judicial offices, which for part-time judicial office holders is 65. In setting the upper age limit at 62 the Lord Chancellor has taken into account the expectation that office holders should be able to complete a reasonable period of service before reaching the compulsory retirement age.
<P>

<a name="10423w39.html_para6">However, in exceptional circumstances the age limits set for appointment may be relaxed at the Lord Chancellor's discretion. The Lord Chancellor's discretion may be invoked, for example, where an otherwise well-qualified candidate has had a career break or started his or her career later than usual. Other factors that the Lord Chancellor would take into account, in considering whether or not to exercise his discretion, would include evidence of a previous judicial appointment, or that the applicant was particularly well qualified for the post applied for.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what recent representations he has received in relation to the time limit for homeless applicants to appeal to the county court under section 204 of the Housing Act 1996; what research his Department has commissioned relating to this issue; what its findings were; and if he will make a statement.  [158071]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w39.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 I have received correspondence from both Shelter and the Law Society about this. Although this research has not been specifically undertaken into this issue, it was considered in this Department's Research Report No. 9/99, "A Regional Study of Local Authority and Court Processes in Homelessness Cases", which was published in 1999 and recommended that further consideration should be given to the time limit. We are considering issues arising out of the research in the context of the Homes Bill, which is currently in another place.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what specific assistance is available within the legal system to adults with learning difficulties.  [158079]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w39.html_spnew3"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Court Service staff have been given training on helping people with learning difficulties. This includes explaining terminology and jargon in simpler terms; and advising the judge of any known effect the learning difficulty may have on a hearing. The Court Service also operates a free helpline providing advice on how disabled customers can be helped to use the courts.
<P>

<a name="10423w39.html_para7">Training seminars for judges include dedicated sessions and case studies on disability issues, of which learning disabilities form a part. A new section of the Equal Treatment Bench Book for judges, entitled "Disability", was published in January 2001. This section includes material on learning disabilities and a chapter on the provisions of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 relating to witnesses with learning disabilities.
<P>

<a name="10423w39.html_para8">These measures in this Act include new powers to clear the court when the witness is giving evidence. The timetable for implementation in the Crown court and the magistrates courts is under consideration.
<P>

<a name="10423w39.html_para9">The criminal law recognises that those with severe mental impairment require protection from sexual offences.

<P>

<a name="10423w39.html_para10">The Police and Criminal Act 1984, and Code of Practice C made under that Act, also provide specific protections for adults with learning difficulties who may be suspected of committing a criminal offence.

 The Lord Chancellor has agreed to an overall review of the Family Graduated Fees Scheme after a fixed period of operation. It is intended that the review will take place 12 to 18 months after implementation, to allow sufficient time for data collection. It will assess the impact of the scheme and will include a review of the level of rates paid within the scheme, on a cost per case basis, to determine the actual percentage reduction in fees.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w40.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 I am advised on questions of food safety by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). The shipments of German beef in question were found to include a small number of beef forequarters to which pieces of spinal cord remained attached. Under the European Union-wide rules on specified risk material (SRM), the spinal cord should have been removed from the carcases at the abattoir at which the animals were slaughtered.
<P>

<a name="10423w40.html_para0">The presence of SRM on imported meat is clearly unacceptable. I have raised the issue personally with the Federal German Minister of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture on several occasions to stress the importance of effective implementation of the SRM rules and to press for remedial action at the abattoirs concerned. The FSA has also raised the matter with the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection who also expressed his concern to the German authorities. I am satisfied that the German authorities fully recognise the importance of effective SRM controls and are taking appropriate steps when breaches of these controls are discovered.

 <i>[holding answer 30 March 2001]:</i> Fresh meat, including beef, may be imported into the European Union only from specific third countries which have been approved by the EU on the basis of compliance with a range of animal health and public health criteria. Moreover, fresh meat imported from such countries must have been produced in plants specifically approved for the purpose by the EU. The list of approved countries and approved meat plants (by category) is published by the European Commission on its website. Fresh meat may not, therefore, be imported from meat plants and/or countries not appearing on the approved list.
<P>

<a name="10423w42.html_para0">All consignments of fresh meat imported from third countries must be accompanied by appropriate veterinary certification confirming that the meat has been produced in accordance with EU animal health and public health requirements.

[156380]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w42.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 March 2001]:</i> The hon. Member is referring to the list of countries that are exempt from the generally applicable ban on the sale for human consumption of beef from cattle aged over 30 months at slaughter. They are countries that traditionally supplied the United Kingdom and in which there was no history of BSE. There have been no confirmed cases of BSE in any of them and I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that any risk to public health from over 30-month beef from these sources would be very small.
<P>

<a name="10423w42.html_para1">However, the FSA is currently reviewing the list of exempt countries in the light of recently strengthened European Union BSE controls, including assessments of geographical BSE risk. A further statement will be made when I receive the FSA's advice.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will review NHS student support arrangements; and if he will make a statement.  [156856]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w42.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 As a result of the review we considered a range of options for change to the existing arrangements taking full account of representations received from students, their representative bodies and others. Following the announcement in the Budget of a substantial package of additional funding for the National Health Service over the next three years, the decision was made to provide additional help for students using an across the board increase in the NHS Bursary. From September 2001 student nurses studying at diploma level will receive a &#163;500 (10.4 per cent.) increase in their bursary, the biggest increase since introduction of bursaries in the late 1980s. 



<P>
<P><I>23 Apr 2001 : Column: 168W</I><P>
This increase contrasts sharply with practice through much of the 1990s when the bursary was frozen, before the present Government introduced a policy of annual uplifts in 1998.
<P>

<a name="10423w42.html_para2">My ministerial colleagues and I continue to take a close interest in the effective operation of student support arrangements, including the NHS Bursary scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w42.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Peter Bradley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what assessment he has made of the prevalence in the pharmaceutical sector and the cost to the NHS of the practices criticised by the OFT following its investigation of Napp Pharmaceutical's pricing policies; and if he will make a statement;  [157089]
<P>
<UL>(2) what steps he proposes to take to reduce the costs to the NHS which arise from pricing practices of drug companies which have been condemned by the Office of Fair Trading following its investigation of the conduct of Napp Pharmaceuticals Ltd.  [157400]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w42.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The investigation carried out by the Office of Fair Trading relates to one product from one company, which was the subject of a specific complaint. Ministers are examining closely the implications of the decision of the Director-General of Fair Trading and of the direction which he may give to correct the practices which he has criticised, taking into account any appeal which the company may make.
<P>

<a name="10423w42.html_para3">The Department keeps the level of competition in the pharmaceutical sector under review, and has mechanisms in place to prevent profiteering. It secures value for money through the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) which controls the profits which companies make from the supply of branded medicines to the National Health Service. Under this scheme a high price for one product may be balanced against a low one for another, provided that the company's overall profits remain within the limits permitted by the scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health when proposals to establish a European Food Authority were published and by whom; what steps Her Majesty's Government have taken to publicise this decision; when it agreed to it; what consultations it has had; and on what Treaty base the Authority is expected to be established.  [157326]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w42.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The European Commission introduced a proposal, dated 8 November 2000, for a "Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing a European Food Authority (EFA), and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (COM (2000) 716 final)."
<P>

<a name="10423w42.html_para4">In December 2000 the Food Standards Agency began a formal consultation on the EC's proposal. This consultation is open and ongoing and details may be found on the FSA's website www.foodstandards.gov.uk. The FSA has held meetings with stakeholders and sends out letters reporting on negotiations in Brussels.

<P>

<a name="10423w42.html_para5">The establishment of the EFA is not yet agreed. Negotiations on the EC's proposal are continuing in Brussels.
<P>

<a name="10423w42.html_para6">As drafted, the EC's proposal gives the Treaty base for the establishment of the EFA as Articles 37 (Common Agricultural Policy), 95 (internal market), 133 (common commercial policy) and 152(4)(b) (public health).

<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w42.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what research his Department has carried out into the links between fuel poverty and excess winter deaths; and if he will make a statement on links between the level of winter deaths and the number of households in fuel poverty since 1997.  [157453]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w42.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 It is estimated there were some 5.5 million fuel poor households in the United Kingdom in 1996. Further analysis suggests this may have fallen to around 4.5 million by 1999. In 2000 every pensioner household received &#163;200 winter fuel allowance providing further help to cut fuel poverty. In the UK from December to March, there are on average between 20,000-50,000 excess deaths compared to the rest of the year. We are committed to ending the blight of fuel poverty for vulnerable households by 2010 and launched our fuel poverty strategy as a consultation document on 23 February 2001.
<P>

<a name="10423w42.html_para7">Links have been established between cold, damp housing and increased ill-health. However, the relative contributions of cold homes, outdoor temperatures and other factors to excess winter deaths are complex and not fully understood.
<P>

<a name="10423w42.html_para8">The Department has commissioned a systematic review of the effect of cold on otherwise healthy individuals, particularly older people. It will address: 1) the effect of cold exposure on mortality and morbidity; and 2) the effect of cold exposure on physiological changes and risk factors associated with coronary heart disease.
<P>

<a name="10423w42.html_para9">Additionally, the Department, together with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, has funded a pilot project to look at the impact of cold homes on health. This will help determine what further research may be considered.
<P>

<a name="10423w42.html_para10">The Department of Health has already initiated a number of measures to help combat excess winter deaths. The "Keep Warm, Keep Well" campaign, which runs from October to March each year, gives advice to the public and health professionals on staying warm in winter. Additionally, this winter the 'flu vaccine on the National Health Service was extended to include everyone aged 65 and over. The vaccine can prevent complications from influenza. There is also a vaccine against pneumococcal disease which can be given at the same time as the 'flu vaccine to people in high-risk groups which can help prevent pneumococcal pneumonia among other conditions.

 We have welcomed proposals from the General Dental Council for increasing its lay membership. Amendments to the Dentists Act 1984 would be required which we plan shortly to submit for scrutiny and debate by Parliament under section 60 of the Health Act 1999.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement about the General Dental Council's decision not to allow dental patients access to professionals complementary to dentistry, with particular reference to clinical dental technicians.  [157447]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w42.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Currently only two groups of professionals complementary to dentistry are registered by the General Dental Council (GDC): Dental therapists and dental hygienists. The GDC has agreed that additional groups should be registered including clinic dental technicians whom the GDC proposes should be allowed to work remote from the dental practice, but to the prescription of a dentist. Amendments to the Dentists Act 1984 would be required which we plan, in due course, to submit for scrutiny and debate by Parliament under section 60 of the Health Act 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w43.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The draft directive would not change the status of products which are regulated by medicines legislation. Its purpose is to establish a framework for regulation of supplements, including those containing herbal substances and vitamins, sold under food law.
<P>

<a name="10423w43.html_para0">Our view is that, in the interests of consumer choice, the market should be open to all products which are safe and properly labelled. The Food Standards Agency, which is representing us in discussions on the proposal, is pressing this case in negotiations.

<P>
<a name="10423w43.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 There are no proposals to make compensation payments. Part-time National Health Service employees, who become entitled to backdated membership of the NHS pension scheme, will be expected to pay their share of the arrears of scheme contributions.

 "Children's needs--parenting capacity", published by the Department in 1999, draws on a wide range of research, and examines how factors such as drug misuse may impact on children and may affect parental capacity to respond to children's needs.
<P>

<a name="10423w43.html_para4">In addition, a number of studies in the programme of research on the Children Act 1989 have explored the link between drug misuse by those caring for children and the risk of abuse and neglect, in particular "Family support in cases of emotional maltreatment and neglect" and "Making care orders work: A study of their implementation". These two studies will be summarised in a forthcoming Department overview of contemporary research, entitled "The Children Act now: Messages from research". They are being used to inform our key initiatives to improve children's services, in particular quality protects.
<P>

<a name="10423w43.html_para5">We have also recently commissioned research to explore the reasons why increased numbers of children are being looked after by local authorities. This study will provide an opportunity to explore in greater depth the link between drug misuse by those with the care of children and children experiencing neglect and entering local authority care. It is about to start and plans to report by the end of the year.

 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> The overarching requirement in providing services is to ensure that they are configured to meet the needs of the local population. The Chorley and South Ribble National Health Service Trust and Preston Acute Hospitals NHS Trust have an excellent record of providing a range of acute services to their locality. However, it is recognised that there is a need for more specialised services to be provided to a larger population through managed clinical networks. Organisational arrangements must reflect the most effective way of providing access to the full range of acute services. Sharing and integrating the services of the two trusts should be encouraged and built upon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w44.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department has recently issued guidance to health professionals on the legal and good practice requirements for seeking valid consent from patients for proposed examinations or treatment "Reference Guide to Consent for Examination or Treatment". Where an adult patient is mentally able to give or withhold consent to proposed treatment, consent must always be sought directly from the patient himself or herself. It is good practice to involve those close to the patient, such as family, carers and friends, in the decision-making process if the patient wishes for such involvement.
<P>

<a name="10423w44.html_para2">In some cases, patients may be so severely disabled that they are not able to give, or withhold, consent for a proposed examination or treatment. In such cases, health professionals may legally provide the treatment if it is in the patient's best interests to receive it. Although the health professional concerned is ultimately responsible for the decision as to whether or not treatment is in the patient's best interests, those close to the patient (parents, carers and others) should be fully involved in any discussions, unless the patient has made clear that particular individuals should not be involved in their care.

 Information about the proportion of people with learning disabilities that have been sexually abused is not held centrally. The White Paper, "Valuing People, A new Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century" says that local councils will need to ensure that learning disability services are represented on the local adult protection management committees, and that information about incidents of abuse of people with learning disabilities is gathered and recorded. This will improve our knowledge about the incidence of abuse.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will publish the advice given by his Department on the method of calculation of local authority payments to those also assisted by the Independent Living Fund.  [158586]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w45.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Local councils may make direct payments to people whom they have assessed as needing support, whether or not the individual also receives assistance from the independent living extension fund or the 1993 independent living fund. Copies of the policy and practice guidance on direct payments have been widely distributed and are also available on the Department's website www.doh.gov.uk. In determining the extent of a user contribution to the cost of social services support, councils should treat alike those receiving direct payments and those receiving council-commissioned services. The Department has recently consulted on draft guidance for local councils, "Fairer charges for home care and other non-residential social services", which includes advice on any assessment of ability to pay charges for people who are also assisted by the independent living fund.

<a name="10423w45.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Endometriosis is the second most common gynaecological condition in this country, affecting about two million women. The prevalence of endometriosis is such that managing and treating it should be part of the routine work of every gynaecology department. Treatments range from managing the symptoms to surgery. The right treatment will be that which suits a particular woman's condition and needs. This will be achieved only by a woman discussing her needs fully with her doctor.
<P>

<a name="10423w45.html_para1">The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has produced clinical guidelines on "The Investigation and Management of Endometriosis". These bring together the latest evidence-based knowledge and best practice on the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis, and examine options for treatment in the light of the presenting symptoms. The guidelines have been distributed to all of the Royal College's Fellows and members working in the health service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w45.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Until April this year reports of incidents of MRSA came only through specimens submitted voluntarily by trusts for specialist microbiological tests. From April 2001 all acute trusts will be required to collect data on MRSA blood stream infections and the information will be published from April 2002. Work is under way to extend the national surveillance system to cover other areas such as surgical site infections focusing initially on orthopaedic surgery.

<P>
<P>

 The information requested is not available centrally. Policy on appropriate screening arrangements will vary from hospital to hospital depending on local circumstances, the nature of any infection, risk and other factors. These decisions are best determined locally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w45.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The National Health Service litigation authority received reports of 70 claims between April 1995 and July 2000 where MRSA is mentioned in the incident details. The outcome of those claims is not known and so the cost of claims to the NHS cannot be quantified.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w45.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Considerable funding is provided for research to develop new drugs by the pharmaceutical industry, including work contracted to the Public Health Laboratory Service. The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC). In order to encourage research in the broad area of antimicrobial resistance, the MRC has issued a highlight notice welcoming proposals. My Department funds research to support policy and the delivery of effective practice in the National Health Service and will shortly publish its own call for research in the antimicrobial resistance field for which there is central funding of &#163;2.5 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will publish a list of antibiotics that are effective against MRSA.  [158289]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w45.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Different strains of MRSA vary in the pattern of resistance shown to other anti-staphylococcal antibiotics. Therefore, there is no definitive list of antibiotics that are effective against MRSA.
<P>

<a name="10423w45.html_para2">Most MRSA that occur in the United Kingdom are still sensitive to, and may be treated with, vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, or quinupristin/dalfopristin. They may also be sensitive to rifampicin, fluoroquinolone antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin), chloramphenicol and to some other antibiotics. Decisions on the antibiotic(s) appropriate for the treatment of any one patient must, therefore, depend on microbiological laboratory testing of the individual bacterium.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the responsibilities of Customs and Excise officers who enforce border inspection rules, with particular reference to illegally imported meat and other foodstuffs.  [158448]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10423w49.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 There are two main aspects to Customs role at the UK's border: processing declarations of commercial consignments being moved into and out of the country; and detecting attempts to evade the prohibitions and restrictions on items being moved either commercially or privately.
<P>

<a name="10423w49.html_para0">Commercial imports and exports of goods from or to locations outside the European Union must be declared to Customs to help ensure any revenues due are properly accounted for and that restrictions are complied with. Declarations of meat and meat products are identified from Customs systems and referred to a MAFF approved border inspection post. The goods are only released from Customs control on receipt of notification from the border inspection post that any necessary checks are complete.
<P>

<a name="10423w49.html_para1">Customs detection activity at the border is focused on finding and dealing with irregularities across the full range of contrabands; these include controlled drugs, high revenue items such as alcohol and tobacco, cash linked to drug trafficking, paedophile pornography and illicit weapons. When the detection systems find travellers carrying meat products outside the MAFF allowance (one kilogram of cooked meat products in a sealed container) the material is seized and disposed of in accordance with procedures agreed with MAFF and the local port health authority.
