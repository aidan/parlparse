 Special Advisers are appointed under terms and conditions set out in the "Model Contract for Special Advisers". Schedule 1, Part 1 of the Model Contract sets out the role and duties of Special Advisers. As well as research for Ministers and reviewing papers, contributing to policy planning within the Department and preparing policy papers, speechwriting and liaison with outside interest groups, their role explicitly includes liaising with the Party and helping to brief Party MPs. Records are not held of when such briefings are given. Similar arrangements have applied under successive Governments.

 A copy of the data available has been placed in the Library. The tables show the average expenditure per council dwelling receiving major renovation work (repairs and improvements costing more than &#163;500 per dwelling) in each local authority, region and nationally. Every year, about 22 per cent. of council owned dwellings receive renovation work costing at least &#163;500.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many empty homes owned by <i>(a)</i> Government agencies and <i>(b)</i> local authorities were brought back into use in 1998 as a result of the developing empty property strategy promoted by his Department.  [89678]<P>

 In general information is not collected centrally on the numbers of empty homes brought back into use. Instead data are collected on the numbers of vacant dwellings, which is the key outcome of action to reduce the number of empty homes. Figures for vacant dwellings in England at 1 April 1998 were published in Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions Information Bulletin 189/99 on 2 March 1999 which has been placed in the Library of the House.

<a name="90707w02.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Cummings: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the numbers of young, single homeless people in <i>(a)</i> the district council areas of (i) Easington, (ii) Durham City, (iii) Chester le-Street, (iv) Derwentside, (v) Wear Valley and <i>(b)</i> the boroughs of (i) Sedgefield, (ii) Darlington, (iii) Sunderland and (iv) Hartlepool.  [89834]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90707w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 None, but we are working up a methodology to allow local authorities to produce such estimates. There are real problems in attempting to measure the scale of youth homelessness, either nationally or locally. Few estimates of single homelessness break figures down by age. The term 'homeless' may also be used to represent a number of different levels of housing need. At one extreme, rough sleeping is the most visible and disturbing form of homelessness. But there are also young people accommodated in emergency night shelters, direct-access hostels, squats, bed-and-breakfast accommodation and longer-term hostels. Some people, especially the young will stay with friends and relatives on a temporary basis, sometimes under difficult and trying circumstances. Although there have been a number of estimates commissioned by the voluntary sector to assess the extent of youth homelessness they have not been able to overcome these inherent difficulties and have come up with widely differing estimates.




<P>
<P><I>7 Jul 1999 : Column: 531</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90707w02.htm_para0">My Department has recently commissioned research into youth homelessness as part of the Youth Homelessness Action Partnership. One output from this research will provide a more reliable estimate of the numbers of young people affected by various types of homelessness. A tool-kit will also be produced which will be made available to local authorities and the voluntary sector to help them produce accurate figures locally.

The two bodies will include a wide range of interests including lay members, specialists in ethical matters, consumers and those with a knowledge of the industry. One of the functions of the Commissions will be to consult key stakeholders and the public in formulating their advice to Government.

 <i>[holding answer 6 July 1999]:</i> Special Advisers are appointed under terms and conditions set out in the Model Contract for Special Advisers. Schedule 1, Part 1 of the Model Contract sets out the role and duties of Special Advisers. As well as research for Ministers and reviewing papers, contributing to policy planning within the Department and preparing policy papers, speech writing and liaison with outside interest groups, their role explicitly includes liaising with the Party and helping to brief Party MPs. Records are not held of when such briefings are given. Similar arrangements have applied under successive Governments.

<a name="90707w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The red route project and powers are exclusive to London. Elsewhere, it is primarily for local authorities to use their existing traffic management powers to give appropriate priority to buses. We look to them to do so, in the context of developing their local transport plans and bus strategies.

<P>
<a name="90707w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 I fully understand non-domestic ratepayers' concerns about the revaluation and their keenness to know, as early as possible, how they will be affected. They need time to plan ahead. However, we do not yet have complete information about the detailed effects of the revaluation, and will not do so for a while.
<P>

<a name="90707w02.htm_para4">We therefore aim to publish in late September a consultation paper outlining options for handling the impact of the revaluation in England. We recognise the need in formulating the proposals for this consultation paper to take account of the views of business organisations. I am therefore convening a consultative forum of national bodies representing business interests to consider this issue and I expect the first meeting to be later this summer.

This is a set of general principles requiring the prosecutor to apply an evidential and a public interest test to determine whether a prosecution should take place or not.

<a name="90707w04.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the proposed changes to the distribution mechanisms for civil defence grants.  [89960]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90707w04.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Home Office provides &#163;14.038 million civil defence grant per annum to eligible local authorities in England and Wales as a contribution towards the cost incurred in meeting their civil defence duties. The grant is not intended to meet the full cost of their emergency planning services.
<P>

<a name="90707w04.htm_para0">The current system of grant distribution is based on a formula, agreed with the then Local Authority Associations in 1992, and largely based on a two-tier system of local government. The reorganisation of local government created new Unitary authorities in England and Wales, all with a responsibility for emergency planning and, consequently, access to civil defence grant. This reorganisation created numerous anomalies within the funding arrangements that could only be properly addressed by introducing a new mechanism.
<P>

<a name="90707w04.htm_para1">The sole avenue of consultation on this issue has been with the Local Government Association (LGA). Following discussions with the LGA a new three-tier grant distribution mechanism has been announced. The mechanism is based on the following rationale:
<P>

<a name="90707w04.htm_para2"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>all 178 grant eligible authorities will receive a basic allocation of &#163;45,000 to ensure a minimum level of service, and the delivery of basic standards of preparedness;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90707w04.htm_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>County Councils will receive an allocation of &#163;10,000 for each of the District Councils within the County boundary in recognition of the service that a County must provide to constituent Districts; and
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90707w04.htm_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>remaining grant after the first two elements have been addressed will be allocated according to Bellwin thresholds. The Bellwin Scheme, operated by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, sets a level of expenditure above which central government may contribute to costs incurred by local authorities in responding to major incidents. The use of Bellwin acknowledges the relationship between population size and the workload of emergency planning teams in large areas.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90707w04.htm_para5">This new mechanism provides funds to all eligible authorities and now has the advantage of being clear, readily understood and equitable.
<P>

<a name="90707w04.htm_para6">To ensure protection to those areas where grant will reduce, the full impact of the new mechanism will be phased over one year, 2000-01, with no authority losing more than 10 per cent. of its current allocation.

<P>
<P><I>7 Jul 1999 : Column: 543</I><P>
exhibition of the Institute of Wastes Management in Torbay. It was very well received and is being distributed through the Energy from Waste Association and other relevant trade bodies and through companies and local authorities actively supporting energy from waste as an essential element of an integrated approach to sustainable waste management. The pamphlet complements three other publications produced under the Department's new and renewable energy programme: "An Introduction to Household Waste Management"; "Energy from Waste--Best Practice Guide"; and "Household Waste Management--Some Examples of Current Practice". The latter publication was jointly sponsored with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) and all are available from the New and Renewable Energy Enquiries Bureau at ETSU, Harwell, Didcot, Oxfordshire, OX11 0RA (tel: 01235 432450). On 30 June DETR published "A Way With Waste--A Draft Waste Strategy for England and Wales" for public consultation. This envisages that increased recycling and energy from waste will be vital in the next decade. During the month of June 1999 the "Sustainable Energy from Waste" pamphlet was the single most requested publication from the New and Renewable Energy Enquiries Bureau. It will be publicised further in issue 41 of "New Review", the magazine for renewable energy, which is expected to be published at the end of July and will also be available from the New and Renewable Energy Enquiries Bureau.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make it his policy that all homes within the United Kingdom should be connected to mains electricity by the end of 2002; and if he will make a statement.  [89851]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90707w04.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Obviously it is desirable that the relatively small number of homes without mains electricity (less than 1 per cent. of the total UK housing stock) should enjoy such a service. Unfortunately, since the majority of these households are in remote areas, the costs involved can be significant. As is recognised in existing legislation, it would be unfair for existing customers to subsidise the cost of connection to bring down the price for new ones. However, in cases where a supply has been requested and a quote for the connection has been given, the charge can be subject to determination by the Director General of Electricity Supply. Some remote communities have benefited from EU fund assistance with the cost of connection.

<P>
<a name="90707w05.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Channel Tunnel has been assessed by the Independent Safety Authority as being 100 per cent. blue in Action 2000 terms--as having no substantive risk of material disruption. There were no significant failures during a full scale test of the systems at the beginning of July. However, the systems will continue to be monitored for compliance and existing contingency planning arrangements will be under constant review over the coming months.

In this case, these include the resettlement of the local population and protection of cultural heritage. ECGD will also consider the economic and political risks involved.

 Following the suspension of UN Sanctions in April, the Department has encouraged several private sponsors of trade missions to take forward their plans for taking business delegations to Libya this summer and autumn. However, up until now that encouragement has fallen short of formal endorsement of particular missions or offering financial assistance. Without a functioning Commercial Section in a British Embassy in Tripoli, British Trade International is currently unable to offer the full range of assistance which is usually associated with visits which receive full Government assistance. We are actively pursuing the re-establishment, at the earliest opportunity, of a fully operational commercial section.

 <i>[holding answer 6 July 1999]:</i> Special Advisers are appointed under terms and conditions set out in the Model Contract for Special Advisers. Schedule 1, Part 1 of the Model Contract sets out the role and duties of Special Advisers. As well as research for Ministers and reviewing papers, contributing to policy planning within the Department and preparing policy papers, speechwriting and liaison with outside interest groups, their role explicitly includes liaising with the Party and helping to brief Party MPs. Records are not held of when such briefings are given. Similar arrangements have applied under successive Governments.

 The table shows approximate estimates of the percentage of taxpayers who are subject to higher rate tax for 1996-97, the latest year for which these estimates are available. These estimates are based on a sample survey and the sample size is not large enough to allow separate estimates to be made for some unitary authorities in Scotland and Wales or for Northern Ireland areas other than Belfast.

 <i>[holding answer 2 July 1999]:</i> Under English and Scots law companies are liable for injuries to their workers caused by their negligence. The courts decide in accordance with well established legal principles under each legal system whether claims may proceed in the English or the Scottish courts when it is alleged that the cause of injuries to overseas workers was operational decisions taken in the United Kingdom.

 <i>[holding answer 2 July 1999]:</i> Under Article 2 of the 1968 Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters, to which the United Kingdom is a party, a defendant is entitled to be sued in the courts of a member state of the European Union where he is domiciled. Once this basis of Jurisdiction has been established the courts of that state generally have no discretion to refuse to hear the case. However, this rule applies only to those cases falling within the scope of the Convention. In all other instances, and notwithstanding that jurisdiction has otherwise been established under English law, a court in England and Wales has a discretion to refuse to hear a case if in all the circumstances of that case it is satisfied that there is another jurisdiction which is clearly more appropriate to hear the case. The courts in England and Wales apply this long-established discretion in the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice and the Government has no plans to amend it.

There are also no guideline judgments reported on sentencing in these circumstances. Within the statutory sentencing framework laid down by Parliament, the nature and severity of penalties imposed by the courts are matters of judicial discretion. Guidance can however be found in recent decisions by the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division), in particular in <i>Ali</i> Osman (1999) 1CR.APP.R.(S.) 230 and <i>Daljit</i> Singh (1999) 1CR.APP.R.(S.)490.

<P>
<UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90707w08.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The Better Government for Older People Programme (BGOP) began in April 1998 and runs until April 2000. It is steered by a partnership led by the Cabinet Office and supported by Age Concern, Anchor Trust, the Carnegie Third Age Programme, Help the Aged, the Local Government Association and the Warwick University Local Authorities Research Consortium. It is an important part of the drive to modernise government so that public services are better equipped for the 21st Century. The Modernising Government White Paper sets as one of its targets that, by the end of the year 2000, older people should benefit from joined up services and integrated planning in at least half our local authorities.
<P>

<a name="90707w08.htm_para6">Older people represent a significant and growing proportion of the population. For example, there are currently 10.5 million people over state pension age in the UK. This figure is expected to have increased to around 15 million by 2040, by which date 24 per cent. of the UK's population--the highest percentage in the EU--will be 60 or over. All these people, and many others, are the potential beneficiaries of the BGOP Programme.
<P>

<a name="90707w08.htm_para7">Evaluation is an ongoing and integral part of BGOP. We will publish the results when the Programme comes to an end. Older people are already beginning to feel the benefit of improvements achieved at the local level by the 28 pilot projects, many examples of which are featured in "Making It Happen", the report of the first year of the BGOP Programme. But by far the biggest group of potential beneficiaries is those who will experience better-designed and delivered public services as a result of learning from the pilot projects.
<P>

<a name="90707w08.htm_para8">BGOP's Learning Network brings together older people, the pilots and other partners in the Programme as well as local authorities. Its role is to help examine what does and does not work in relation to public services used by older people. It will inform the development of good practice and new models for better service delivery in the future. It links, through the Cabinet Office and the Inter-Ministerial Group on Older People to central government.
<P>

<a name="90707w08.htm_para9">7,000 copies of "Making It Happen" have been printed at a cost of &#163;9,925. Copies are being sent to all MPs, party leaders in the House of Lords, local authority chief executives, the pilot projects, all members of BGOP's Learning Network and others who have asked to be kept

<a name="90707w08.htm_para10">As one of the six partner organisations steering the Programme, the Cabinet Office provides &#163;51,000 per annum to support the work of the Programme's Core Team, which co-ordinates its activities. Other Departments making substantial contributions include &#163;154,000 from the Home Office, &#163;30,000 from the Department for Education and Employment and &#163;30,000 from the Health Education Authority. Further contributions and support come from the other Programme partners, the 28 local authorities leading the pilots and their partner organisations. The programme raises additional funds from charging local authorities for membership of the Learning Network.
<P>

<a name="90707w08.htm_para11">The overall cost of the Programme (including contributions from partner organisations) is estimated to be around &#163;750,000 in the 1998-99 financial year. This represents an excellent investment in ensuring that older people receive in the future the improved public services they deserve.

 Special Advisers are appointed under terms and conditions set out in the "Model Contract for Special Advisers". Schedule 1, Part 1 of the Model Contract sets out the role and duties of Special Advisers. As well as research for Ministers and reviewing papers, contributing to policy planning within the Department and preparing policy papers, speechwriting and liaison with outside interest groups, their role explicitly includes liaising with the Party and helping to brief Party MPs. Records are not held of when such briefings are given. Similar arrangements have applied under successive Governments.

 <i>[holding answer 2 July 1999]:</i> The development and maintenance of NVQs is undertaken by National Training Organisations. Since April 1998 archaeology has been the responsibility of the Cultural Heritage NTO. It was previously covered by the environmental lead body, COSQUEC. The first NVQs, accredited in 1994, were removed in 1998 from the national framework by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) as there was very low take up.

 There have been no direct bilateral discussions, but throughout 1998 and 1999, the Government has actively participated in joint discussions with other members of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) on the causes of child labour and how best to combat it. We have also continuously supported the ILO's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC), and the adoption of the new International Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour.

 The Conference considered environmental issues in the UK Overseas Territories and highlighted the diversity of natural resources in these small island states. Coral reefs and mangrove forests are among their more threatened environments. They directly provide a range of services important to poor people, including food, income, building materials, and tourist-related employment. Mangroves and coral reefs are often the only resources to which poor people have ready access. The Conference discussed the importance of controlling the exploitation of these ecosystems at sustainable levels by engaging the coastal peoples in their management, and helping to develop alternative livelihood options. We are actively engaged in supporting such programmes in UK Overseas Territories and other island states.

 The themes in the All-Party Group's five pledges on the excellence and equity in Cancer Care Strategy reflect the issues raised at the cancer seminar in Downing Street in May at which the Prime Minister announced a plan of action to tackle cancer and save lives. The Government are committed to improving quality of and access to cancer services and a comprehensive programme of work is in hand to tackle the issues raised at the Downing Street meeting.

 <i>[pursuant to her reply, 6 July 1999, c. 494]:</i> The recently published report by the United States of America Institute of Medicine presents strong arguments for the retention of smallpox stocks, which we accept. Since the eradication of naturally occurring smallpox over 20 years ago, very few people have been immunised against smallpox. It is vital before the virus stocks are destroyed that investigations of the genetic structure and pathogenesis of smallpox are carried out to ensure that we have all the information we need to protect the population should smallpox re-emerge as a threat in the future. We are advised that this work requires the retention of the smallpox vaccine stocks and that their retention will also allow the development of effective anti-viral treatments and new vaccines.

I discussed the situation with OAU Secretary-General Salim Salim on 28 May and underlined our continued support for the OAU Framework peace proposals.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will ensure that when a Minister of his Department next visits Turkey he or she discusses with the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Turkey the lack of response to letters that have been sent to him by the Chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, regarding the decision taken by the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Mrs. Loizidou v. Turkey; and if he will make a statement.  [89817]<P>

 We continue to make clear to Turkey, including in the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers' Deputies, the need to respect the European Court of Human Rights' judgment in the case of Loizidou v. Turkey. We supported the decision of the Chairman of the Committee of Ministers to write to the Turkish Foreign Minister on 22 June requesting clarification from

 We take every opportunity to try to improve the conditions of ethnic minorities in Burma. We raise concerns both here and in Rangoon directly with the regime, most recently about repression in Kayah and Chin States. We are also active in international forums, for example co-sponsoring UN resolutions which put pressure on the regime to improve the human rights situation. We were instrumental in the adoption of a resolution by the International Labour Conference on 17 June which stated that Burma's behaviour, notably the continued use of forced labour (a major burden on ethnic minorities), was incompatible with ILO membership. And we support the work of the Burma Consortium for those who have fled regime repression.

 As longstanding friends of Pakistan and India, we are deeply concerned by the continuing fighting in the Kargil sector of Jammu and Kashmir following armed infiltration across the Line of Control. My right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary and I, and our High Commissions in Islamabad and New Delhi, have urged both countries to work to lower tensions and to refrain from action which might escalate the fighting. We have reinforced our concerns in the EU statements of 27 May and 24 June and the conclusions on G8 Foreign Ministers on 31 May and heads of Government on 19 June.

 The Government's position on this matter was recently re-examined by the DTI in the course of preparing a response to a letter on the same subject which my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) sent to my colleague the Minister for Energy and Industry. The Minister's reply to my hon. Friend for Northfield sets out the detailed conclusions reached and reflects the advice of the UK Safeguards Office. This was the same advice as that on which I based my earlier statement. A copy of that reply has now been placed in the Library.
