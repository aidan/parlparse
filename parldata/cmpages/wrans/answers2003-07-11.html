<i> [holding answer 10 July 2003]:</i> A review of the present arrangements is not considered necessary at this time. The 12-month concessionary period during which new residents with valid non-European Economic Area driving licences may drive in Great Britain is designed to allow sufficient time for them to become familiar with road traffic conditions here and to take British driving tests. To ensure continuous driving entitlement, a British provisional licence must be obtained and driving tests passed before the 12-month period elapses.
<P>

<a name="30711w02.html_para1">The same 12-month concessionary period exists for visitors with non-EEA licences. This is provided for under the Paris Convention of 1926 and the Geneva Convention of 1949, and protects the interests of tourism and trade.

<a name="30711w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Stansted airport received planning approval in September 2002 to expand to cater for 25 million passengers per annum (mppa) and a section 106 agreement between BAA and the local authority has recently been signed. BAA Stansted and SRA are currently negotiating a parallel legal agreement, which has been agreed in principle, for a package of improvements to meet anticipated increased rail use associated with the airport to 25 mppa, the costs of which are to be borne by BAA. Highway works at junctions 8 and 8A of the Ml 1 have also been agreed and are estimated to cost about &#163;300,000.
<P>

<a name="30711w02.html_para4">The SERAS study included an estimate of costs for new road and rail infrastructure to support options for expanding Stansted. These were of the order of &#163;800 million&#150;&#163;1.8 billion, for options providing one, two or three new runways. Most of the costs were for rail investment. It is not possible at this stage to estimate what share of the costs might fall to the airport developer or the timing of any schemes since that will depend on decisions in the air transport White Paper, and other decisions associated with the London-Stansted-Cambridge Growth Area.

<P><I>11 Jul 2003 : Column 1027W</I><P>
the autumn with a wide range of individual businesses and their representatives, unions and employment experts. My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and other Government ministers attended the roundtables and heard views directly from those who will be affected by the directive. Building on this initial consultation, the Government then held discussions with the CBI and TUC, and a range of other organisations about implementation. An agreed framework for implementing the directive was published on 7 July 2003 in a consultation document "High Performance Workplaces: Informing and consulting employees", together with draft legislation and a regulatory impact assessment on which we are inviting comments. The Government were aware that business might be concerned about how the directive will be implemented in the UK. This is why we have agreed with the CBI and the TUC a framework for implementation that is flexible, and allows firms to agree with their staff arrangements that are best suited to the individual circumstances of the business.

 A number of studies indicate that the elimination of barriers to trade in goods could bring significant benefits both to European Union and to developing countries. Although these studies do not separately identify the effects on the UK economy, there are good reasons to suggest gains to the UK will be in line with those of the EU as a whole.

 Since 1995 there have been 24 incidents of self-harm overdose, involving either prescription or non-prescription drugs, recorded at Deepcut barracks. None of these involved illegal drugs. The Army does not make 'arrests' in relation to the use or supply of illegal drugs; instead, cases are investigated and reported to the chain of command for disciplinary action. Since 1995 eight possible cases were recorded at Deepcut as a result of which five military personnel were charged with drug offences under the Army Act.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the criteria that must be met by training organisations seeking preferred supplier status to the Resettlement Training Centre at Aldershot; and which independent assessor awards that status.  [123861]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30711w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The Resettlement Training Centre (RTC) at Aldershot lies within Aldershot Garrison, and is wholly owned by the Ministry of Defence. The RTC is however being leased to Right Management Consultants Ltd. during the currency (October 1998 to September 2005) of a contract it holds from the Department to provide Career Transition services (CTS) to eligible members of the armed forces during the last two years of their service.
<P>

<a name="30711w04.html_para3">In accordance with the contract the RTC provides some training direct to Service leavers through courses run at the centre. It also operates the preferred suppliers' list in order to advise Service leavers on different types of external training from providers which have been vetted, and in which the service leavers can be confident of the standard of training provided.

<P>

<a name="30711w04.html_para4">The requirement for the contractor to run a preferred suppliers list has been part of the contract since inception.
<P>

<a name="30711w04.html_para5">Training organisations seeking preferred supplier status must provide training which, among other things, fits the transferable skills Service leavers have, provides training which will lead to jobs in the civilian market, have the capability to provide training in the longer term (by having the right facilities, financial and staff resources), and have policies in place promoting quality, equal opportunities and health and safety.
<P>

<a name="30711w04.html_para6">The Contractor is wholly responsible to the Department to run the preferred suppliers list and to vet applications from prospective training providers. Advice is sought as necessary from Lead Bodies, National Training Organisations, Sector Skills Councils and other Government Agencies. Comments are also sought as necessary from such agencies as Regional Resettlement Centres, the Regular Forces Employment Association, and Ministry of Defence's second line Resettlement Advisers to confirm local requirements. The contractor ensures that the process is managed in accordance with ISO 9001:2000 and its Quality Management Operating Procedures, which are externally assessed by Det Norske Veritas, an accredited UKAS accreditation body.

 The sale, in 1996, of 57,428 properties in England and Wales raised &#163;1.662 million for the Exchequer. The average price per dwelling, nationally, was approximately &#163;29,000, and in the Colchester area, approximately &#163;25,000.

<a name="30711w04.html_para7">Some 1,400 properties in the Colchester area were included in the 1996 sale and leaseback agreement with Annington Homes Ltd. Of these, all but 46, which were surplus to requirements at the time, were leased back by the Ministry of Defence to house Service families. 180 properties have subsequently been handed back to Annington Homes Ltd. and it is intended that a further 40 will be handed back during the current financial year. MOD wishes to reduce vacancy levels in Service family accommodation and significant disposals are needed to progress towards the target of reducing the vacancy rate to 10 per cent. of working stock. The Defence Housing Executive (DHE), the MOD agency that manages the properties, decides which properties to return to the owners (Annington Homes Ltd.) in consultation with unit commanders. The subsequent use or disposal of those properties is a matter for Annington Homes.

A total of 3,952 Further Education teachers benefited from this &#163;3 million scheme. The 2002&#150;03 Laptops for Further Education Staff Scheme is more flexible, easier for colleges to administer and allows more staff to benefit. These benefits are being evaluated as part of the National Learning Network evaluation and decisions about future funding are being discussed with the Learning and Skills Council, who are responsible for administering the scheme.

Currently, services are being offered at Portsmouth Central Jobcentre, Portsmouth North Jobcentre, Guildhall Walk Social Security Office. These offices are not large enough to accommodate the integrated services of Jobcentre Plus, nor do they have the capacity for expansion. Suitable premises are being identified, which will have the capability to deliver the full range of enhanced services to the people of Portsmouth. Partners and stakeholders were consulted about these plans in June and September 2002. Their comments are currently being taken into consideration in reaching final decisions, which have yet to be announced.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what recent meetings he has had with the natural supplements industry on legislation relating to natural supplements; what action he plans to take as a result of these representations; and if he will make a statement.  [123337]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30711w07.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Public Health met with representatives of the Health Food Manufacturer's Association to discuss the Food Supplements Directive on 9 June 2003. Issues covered in discussion fell under four main headings: nutrients and nutrient sources missing from Annexes I and II in the Food Supplements Directive and requirements for safety dossiers; the recently-published report of the Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals and advice on safe upper levels therein; future setting of maximum permitted levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements at EU level; and plans for future action on chromium picolinate.
<P>

<a name="30711w07.html_para0">Following representations from the Food Standards Agency, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and relevant parties will meet to discuss the potential for simplified dossier requirements and the potential for read-across between dossiers for substances which are likely to have similar toxicological profiles. The European Commission supports this move.
<P>

<a name="30711w07.html_para1">Further, to ensure that the Government's policy objectives for regulation of food supplements in the EU are met, the Government continue to argue for maximum limits for nutrients in food supplements to be based on thorough risk assessment and set at levels which protect public health, but which neither unnecessarily limit consumer choice nor unduly restrict trade. The Government continue to press this view strongly in Brussels at every opportunity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30711w07.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Iddon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many substances he has succeeded in adding to the positive list of Annex II to the EU Food Supplements Directive.  [123563]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30711w07.html_spnew1"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The lists of permitted nutrients and nutrient sources in the annexes to the Food Supplements Directive 2002/46/EC remain open pending safety assessment of additional substances; additional nutrients or nutrient sources can be added to the relevant permitted list following a favourable assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Industry is currently working to compile safety dossiers for a number of the substances currently omitted from the annexes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30711w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 It is not appropriate for the Department to provide direction on the content of nurse training. The regulatory Council for Nursing and Midwifery sets the standard and outline requirements for pre registration nurse education. It does this in collaboration with higher education, employers and the nursing profession. Students have opportunities to undertake supervised practice in caring for cancer patients. Qualified nurses can undertake more specialised programmes, such as cancer nursing, following registration.

 The Department's proposals for extending independent nurse prescribing, including some opiates for use in palliative care, are set out in a consultation paper, issued jointly by the Department of Health and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on 30 April 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how many NHS cancer nurses have <i>(a)</i> retired, <i>(b)</i> left the NHS and <i>(c)</i> been recruited to the NHS in each of the last five years;  [123250]
<P>

 Data on the number of permanent or agency cancer specific nurses are not collected centrally nor is information on the number of leavers or retirees from the national health service.
<P>

<a name="30711w07.html_para3">The Department of Health Workforce Census shows that, between 1997 and September 2002, there was a net increase in nurses working in the NHS of nearly 50,000. There are now 367,520 nurses employed in the NHS. This increase has enabled the recruitment of additional cancer-site specific nurse specialists, chemotherapy nurses, district nurses, palliative care nurse specialists and additional nurses on wards caring for cancer patients.

<P>
<a name="30711w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 &#163;73 million in total has been allocated to the national cataract initiative. The aim of the initiative is to reduce waiting times for cataract operations to three months by December 2004 with many areas achieving this by summer 2004 and, following the reduction in waiting times, to pilot the introduction of choice at the point of general practitioner referral in a major specialty.
<P>

<a name="30711w07.html_para4">Strategic health authorities have been asked to work with local trusts and primary care trusts and secure the early engagement of local clinicians to develop implementation plans setting out the following:

<P>
<P>
<a name="30711w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton  </B>

<P>

<a name="30711w07.html_para7">As a further protective measure, the chair of the HFEA wrote to all licensed centres in March 2001 asking them to introduce routine screening of patients for HIV as well as hepatitis B and C. This will become mandatory in December 2004. All gamete donors are already routinely screened for HIV and detailed guidance on this is included in the HFEA's Code of Practice. This includes a requirement for donor gametes to be stored for 180 days and re-tested to minimise as far as possible the risk of HIV transmission.
<P>

<a name="30711w07.html_para8">In addition to patient and donor screening, the current edition of the HFEA's Code of Practice requires laboratories in licensed centres to have procedures in place to ensure that all blood products are pre-screened for HIV.

<a name="30711w08.html_para4">The National Horizon Scanning Centre at the University of Birmingham, has a contract with the Department of Health to examine the impact that new health technologies and drugs may have on health expenditure. This year, for the first time, we have asked the National Horizon Scanning Centre to consider the impact that health technologies and drugs may have on average length of stay.

 The available figures are shown in the tables. Regional figures are by Government Office Region. Mortality rates come from death registration information. Morbidity rates are less easy to define and collect. However, the Health Survey for England gives the proportion of survey respondents who reported having any illness, disability or infirmity that they considered had troubled them or was likely to affect them over a period of time.

<P>
<a name="30711w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP) is administered by Work Permits UK at the Home Office and has only been in operation since 28 January 2002.
<P>

<a name="30711w10.html_para3">Work Permits UK are responsible for approving applications under the HSMP and for issuing permits to successful applicants. All HSMP permit holders require a visa under the provisions of paragraph 135 A-H of the Immigration Rules. Possession of a HMSP permit is not a guarantee that a visa will be issued. The applicant must still be able to demonstrate that <i>(s)</i>he qualifies for entry to the UK in accordance with the Immigration Rules.
<P>

<a name="30711w10.html_para4">Work Permits UK have approved 2,700 applications under the HSMP since January 2002. However, they cannot provide statistics on the number of those who were granted entry into the UK. UKvisas do not hold statistics on the number of visas issued to applicants who have been granted HSMP permits. These figures are subsumed within the general category of visas issued to work permit holders.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30711w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The UK has regular discussions with the Indonesian Government about assistance in aiding its process of reform, mostly through our embassy in Jakarta. We aim to continue devoting our resources to assisting in the creation of a stable, democratic, peaceful Indonesia. Assistance with reform of the judiciary and armed services are important parts of our overall strategy. We have active co-operation through a programme of Bar Council and Law Society visits. We provided human rights training for five Supreme Court Judges this March, with further training planned. The Governance Partnership, which is undertaking research to help develop a constituency for governance reform, and which is supporting the rule of law, police reform and anti-corruption initiatives, is working on judicial oversight in the justice system. We have a UK Security Sector reform strategy, aimed at strengthening democratic control over the armed forces and helping the Indonesians rethink their security needs. During the visits of my noble Friend Baroness Kennedy of the British Council in June 2002, and my noble Friend Baroness Scotland, the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the FCO, in September 2002, seminars were held with the Indonesian Chief Justice and members of the Indonesian Supreme Court. Through support to the International Committee of the Red Cross we are providing the security services with training in human rights and international humanitarian law. These programmes are ongoing.

<P>
<a name="30711w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 A key priority for United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR), embodied in their mandates from UN Security Council Resolution 1244, is to create a safe and secure environment for all Kosovo's citizens. Overall, statistics for the first five months of 2003 showed a continuous decrease of serious crime in Kosovo. This includes a reduction in ethnically motivated attacks, though any such crime continues to be a cause for concern.
<P>

<a name="30711w10.html_para7">KFOR continues to use its troop presence to prevent attacks on minorities. For example, in Multinational Brigade East 190 security patrols are mounted every day, 65 checkpoints are manned and 64 facilities, such as Serb patrimonial sites, are guarded. KFOR also conducts air surveillance, response to emergency calls, search operations, border control, escorts for Serbs, and support to UNMIK Police in investigation of criminal activities and arrest or detention of suspected criminals. The Kosovo Police Service (KPS) has also been

established as a genuinely multi-ethnic force working alongside international police to help deter violence and build confidence.
<P>

<a name="30711w10.html_para8">A key step in Kosovo's progress is to ensure that ethnically motivated violence is considered unacceptable. In building a tolerant society that can provide security for all its minorities, Kosovo Albanian leaders and political parties are publicly condemning acts of violence that appear to be ethnically motivated.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when it became his Department's policy not to enforce removals of people refused asylum to <i>(a)</i> Iraq, <i>(b)</i> Zimbabwe and <i>(c)</i> Somalia; and what the reasons are for this policy in each case.  [124239]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30711w13.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Returns of failed Iraqi asylum seekers have not been enforced since the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1990 due to the nature of the Saddam regime and subsequently due to the recent conflict. It is important that Iraqis start returning to their country now the conflict is over. At present only voluntary returns are appropriate but we will start enforced removal once conditions allows.
<P>

<a name="30711w13.html_para2">Returns of failed Zimbabwean asylum seekers have not been enforced since 15 January 2002. On that date my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced that removals had been suspended. This decision was initially made in the light of the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe in the run up to elections due in March 2002. Since that date we have not considered that it would be right to recommence enforcing removals to Zimbabwe.
<P>

<a name="30711w13.html_para3">Returns of failed Somali asylum seekers have not been enforced since 1988 to the north of Somalia and since 1991 to the country as a whole. The original reason for this was the civil war and the overthrow of Siad Barre's administration in 1991. Somalia has since remained without a functioning central government and the security situation in much of the south of the country remains poor. Nevertheless, there are regions of the country, most notably Somaliland, where a functioning administration is in place and to which the Home Office believes enforced returns to be sustainable subject to agreement with the regional authorities. Home Office officials have been undertaking negotiations with the authorities in Somaliland on such an agreement.

<a name="30711w13.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The average time between application and initial decision was six months for initial decisions made in the financial year 2002&#150;03, compared with 20 months for April 1997. This has been calculated using all cases for which data are available, including older cases decided as part of the reduction of the number of outstanding cases, as well as new cases decided as part of normal work in progress.
<P>

<a name="30711w13.html_para4">Information on the proportion of cases decided, up to and including final appeal, within six months, will be published in the Home Office's Annual Report in order to report on the Public Service Agreement (PSA) target seven, published in July 2002. Due to the nature of the target, performance data will not be available until more than six months following the relevant financial year. For example (subject to data quality), it is planned that performance against financial year 2003&#150;04 will be reported at the end of November 2004, although provisional figures for applications made between April 2003 and September 2003 will be available earlier.

 For single asylum seekers and childless couples the legislation allows for support to be provided to asylum seekers until a final decision is made on their claim and, in the case of unsuccessful applicants, for 21 days after the receipt of the final decision on the claim. In the case of families including children under the age of 18, support is provided unless and until the family fails to comply with removal directions or until the youngest child reaches 18.

Letters sent at this stage to failed asylum seekers provide details of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), who

will assist the person to make a voluntary return, and also the Immigration Service who will arrange for them to return to their home country.
<P>

<a name="30711w13.html_para8">Failed asylum seekers may be provided with accommodation if they are in a position where they cannot leave immediately through no fault of their own e.g. because they are suffering from a temporary physical incapacity or need a travel document to enable them to go. It would be inappropriate to extend this to all failed asylum seekers. We are determined to increase the number of failed asylum seekers who are removed or who leave of their own accord and providing support until they are removed would thwart this policy.
<P>

<a name="30711w13.html_para9">All asylum claims are carefully and fully considered. In some cases where asylum is refused there will be humanitarian or discretionary reasons which make it appropriate to grant leave. Once an asylum claim has been refused and all appeal rights are exhausted it is not our practice to grant temporary status until the failed asylum seeker is removed. We have no plans to amend this procedure.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department who will be responsible for affording protection in the proposed regional protection areas for asylum seekers; what the basis of contributions to the cost of running the zones will be; what the estimated per capita cost is of doing so; who will undertake the initial decisions; what provision will be made for asylum seekers to obtain disinterested legal advice and representation; what appeal mechanism will apply for those who are refused refugee status; what provision will be made for humanitarian and secondary protection outside the provisions of the 1951 Convention and according to which country's criteria; and what the basis will be of allocating to EU countries those who have been granted refugee status and humanitarian and secondary protection.

<a name="30711w13.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Under international law the Host State is legally responsible for affording protection in refugee areas. However, one of the aims of our proposals is to strengthen their capacity to provide such protection so that they meet the core standards of 'effective protection'.
<P>

<a name="30711w13.html_para10">We are looking to identify the precise needs of prospective host states and aim to provide appropriate resources in collaboration with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), our coalition partners and the European Commission. We cannot at this stage provide per capita costs as this will depend on the needs of the host country and the scale of the refugee caseload we are seeking to help. However, it is our intention to start on a small scale.
<P>

<a name="30711w13.html_para11">The primary objective is to provide effective protection closer to the source country, not to process asylum applications in large numbers overseas. Asylum processing will be considered only as part of finding durable solutions. Any decision on who to admit to the United Kingdom as a refugee will be taken by British immigration officials.

<P>

<a name="30711w13.html_para12">We are working closely with UNHCR to develop appropriate logistical, staffing and legal arrangements. Where it is appropriate, decision-making processes will be overseen by UNHCR to ensure refugee interests are taken fully into account.
<P>

<a name="30711w13.html_para13">Our commitment to improving refugee protection goes beyond the 1951 Convention and we will be looking to develop appropriate solutions within the limits of our resources. This may include repatriation and local integration, but we may also resettle some refugees on a burden-sharing basis with our partner countries. The precise working arrangements will need to be agreed with host countries.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what criteria are used by immigration officers, who release a person from immigration detention, to determine whether an address is suitable as one where the person will be required to live under the terms of the temporary admission; and what checks immigration officers are expected to carry out before releasing a person from detention to ensure an address meets these criteria.  [124238]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30711w14.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Immigration officers have the power under the Immigration Act 1971 to admit temporarily to the United Kingdom any person who is liable to be detained or is detained already.
<P>

<a name="30711w14.html_para0">Temporary admission is granted to any person where the immigration officer considers likely they will comply with its terms. There are no specific directions to immigration officers on what checks should be made when temporary admission is granted. Each case is treated on its individual merits. There are a number of checks that can be made including:

The electoral register.

The Casework Information Database (CID), which allows immigration officers to enter postcode details and shows whether an address at that postcode exists.

<a name="30711w14.html_para1">Where temporary admission is granted, the immigration officer may decide to also enforce further restrictions, such as the requirement to report regularly to a reporting centre or police station, thus allowing closer monitoring of the temporary admission.
