Policy Statements, a new single consent regime to replace the eight existing development consent regimes for nationally significant infrastructure projects, and the establishment of an independent Infrastructure Planning Commission to examine and (where a relevant National Policy Statement is in force) determine applications made under this new regime, at the same time locking more meaningful public involvement into each stage of the process. The aim is to reduce the time taken from application to decision to under a year in the majority of cases, saving up to an estimated &#163;300 million a year. Under the Act, ministers must, when preparing National Policy Statements, do so with the objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development, and all NPSs will be subject to an appraisal of sustainability, ensuring that sustainable development is at the heart of the new regime.</p>

Last year it introduced a unilateral legal mechanism for the provision of tax information assistance pursuant to which they have extended assistance to a further 12 other jurisdictions. This approach is currently being considered by the OECD with a view to confirming whether it meets their standard. The Cayman Islands, along with other relevant overseas territories, is also compliant with the requirements of the EU savings tax directive.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development which non-governmental organisations have received funds from the public purse to conduct aid work in Iraq in the last five years; and how much each received. [270474]</p>

<p><a name="st_101"><a name="09043032001369"><a name="90430w0008.htm_spnew0"><a name="09043032001680"><b>Mr. Michael Foster:</b>
 The Department for International Development (DFID) provided funding directly to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Iraq over the last five years through two principal mechanisms: the Political Participation Fund and the Civil Society Fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="90430w0008.htm_para0"><a name="09043032001370">The &#163;5 million Iraq Civil Society Fund (CSF) supported projects that strengthened the capacity of Iraqi, civil society organisations through partnerships with international NGOs. Funding was given to Christian Aid, Save the Children (UK), Mines Advisory Group (MAG), Help Age International, Women for Women International, Salvation Army, International Centre for Trade Union Rights, UNISON and the Women's National Commission. These NGOs, in turn, partnered a range of Iraqi organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="90430w0008.htm_para1"><a name="09043032001371">The &#163;7.5 million Political Participation Fund (PPF) provided grants to grass-roots Iraqi civil society organisations to enable potentially marginalised groups to participate in the political process. Under the PPF, the international NGOs we supported were AMAR, Arab Gulf Studies Centre, Institute of War and Peace Reporting (IWPR), and the Irish Human Rights Network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="90430w0008.htm_para2"><a name="09043032001372">We have also contributed &#163;55 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross for their humanitarian appeals during 2003-2009. We also provided recent funding directly to the BBC World Service Trust, to strengthen independent television and radio broadcasting in southern Iraq; and to the International Legal Assistance Consortium (ILAC), to support development of the Iraqi justice sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="90430w0008.htm_para3"><a name="09043032001373">Since 2003 DFID has also provided approximately &#163;130 million of funding to UN agencies to support the most vulnerable people displaced inside Iraq and in the region. The UN agencies themselves pass the majority of these funds onto the international NGOs who act as the UN's implementing partners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="90430w0008.htm_para4"><a name="09043032001374">Finally, DFID has agreed Partnership Programme Arrangements to provide core funding to a number of major international NGOs. Of those, Oxfam, Islamic Relief and CAFOD all have programmes in Iraq.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps he is taking to ensure his Department's policies meet internationally agreed development goals in relation to provision of services relating to family planning, reproductive health and meeting the needs of young people; and if he will allocate 10 per cent. of overseas development assistance to population assistance.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) accepts that there is a large, well documented, unmet need for family planning and is working to address this. We provide significant resources to improve access to sexual and reproductive health information, services and supplies (e.g. contraceptives). DFID supports the core work of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) with &#163;8.5 million per annum and is providing &#163;100 million to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) over the five-year period to 2013 to increase access to reproductive health commodities.

DFID's country-led development approach is to support recipient governments to spend development assistance on the priorities they set themselves for helping their people out of poverty. DFID is committed to working to the Paris Principles concerning donor harmonisation and as part of this strongly supported the outcome of the recent the Accra High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness to drive partner country ownership and leadership and for donors to support this.</p>

 Prior to April 2009, collaborative research activity across culture and sport was centred on Regional Cultural Observatories (RCOs) and research capacities led by the Regional Cultural Consortiums (RCCs). As a result of the recent DCMS Review of Regional Working, the RCCs closed on 31 March 2009. The Arts Council, in partnership with English Heritage, the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council and Sport England has commissioned BMG Research to conduct an options appraisal to consider how regional culture and sport research needs can best be met now that the RCO hosts have ceased to operate. This project is expected to report in June 2009. DCMS funding of RCOs ended with the closing of the RCCs on 31 March 2009. In the meantime, some of the functions and services that were previously provided by RCOs are continuing in some regions. In particular, in the North West a consortium of higher education institutions, led by the University of Liverpool, has become the new host for the North West Cultural Observatory and the Arts Council is contributing &#163;10,000 to support the transition to the new arrangements in 2009-10.</p>

Each premises licence authorising the supply of alcohol must specify one individual holding a personal licence as the designated premises supervisor ("DPS"). A DPS has no other unique statutory responsibilities other than those which apply to personal licence holders or more generally, to all persons retailing alcohol, such as the prohibitions on sales to people under 18 years or to people who are drunk.

Indeed, given that the premises could be authorised to retail alcohol for up to 24 hours a day for 365 days each year, it would be unreasonable and probably unlawful to expect a single employee to be present at all times. Compliance with licensing law remains the responsibility of the premises licence holder (which may be a business, an organisation or an individual) at all times and cannot be delegated. Where necessary for the promotion of one or more of the four licensing objectives, a condition can be attached to a premises licence requiring the presence at all times of a personal licence holder.</p>

 The Government's 2012 Legacy Action Plan (LAP), published in June 2008, sets a cross-Government target to get two million more adults active through sport and physical activity by 2012. DCMS and Sport England lead on getting one million more people doing more sport. A range of Government Departments will deliver programmes that will increase wider physical activity. Many of these programmes are outlined in the Department of Health's new Physical Activity Plan &#145;Be Active, Be Healthy&#146; published on 11 February 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="90430w0009.htm_para5"><a name="09043037000085">Baselines for the two million and sports targets will be established using the 2007-08 Active People Survey. The baseline for Sport England's one million sports target is 6.8 million, whereas the baseline for the wider two million target will be calculated to take account of the additional data collected on dance and gardening from January 2009 onwards.</p>

 As part of the administration of funds in court the Lord Chancellor regularly reviews the interest rates paid on client accounts. In reviewing and setting the rate paid, the Lord Chancellor takes into account a number of factors including the amount of interest received on funds against the amount of interest paid to clients, the changing level and mix of funds held by CFO and administration costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="90430w0011.htm_para8"><a name="09043037000413">Income generated on the client funds is influenced by the Bank of England rate. In light of recent movements in the Bank of England rate it has been necessary to reduce the level of interest paid on the special and basic accounts. Interest rates were reduced on 1 February from 6 per cent. to 3 per cent. on the special account and from 4 per cent. to 2 per cent. on the basic account. It has become necessary to reduce CFO&#146;s rates further and from 1 June the special account rate will be 1.5 per cent. and the basic account 1 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="90430w0011.htm_para9"><a name="09043037000414">There are currently around 119,000 deposits in the special account: 101,000 held on behalf of young people with damages awards and 18,000 belonging to Court of Protection clients. The financial impact of the recent reduction in the special account rate on children and Court of Protection clients varies, as the latter tend to hold larger sums of money in the special account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="90430w0011.htm_para10"><a name="09043037000415">CFO rates compare favourably to most rates offered on instant-access accounts by banks and building societies. For example, for a deposit of &#163;25,000 placed in a bank or building society savings account, the average rate of interest offered by some 464 different types of account is 0.71 per cent. gross AER (information taken from the FSA&#146;s comparative tables (www.fsa.gov.uk/tables) as at 17 April 2009 Financial Services Authority.)</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="90430w0011.htm_para11"><a name="09043037000416">It is important to stress that the purpose of the CFO and its special account is not to compensate or make financial provision for a client&#146;s situation&#151;that is the role of the court or the welfare system as appropriate. The role of the special account is to provide a safe place for client&#146;s funds and to provide a reasonable rate of return. All special account clients continue to benefit from safeguards offered by this account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="90430w0011.htm_para12"><a name="09043037000417">The majority of deputies representing Court of Protection clients should have the ability to withdraw funds from the CFO and place them elsewhere if they believe this is in the best interests of the person they represent.

 Authorities do not have to have academies or submit further proposals for academies in order to access Building Schools for the Future (BSF) funding. They must demonstrate how they will use BSF to raise standards in schools. &#147;Strategy for Change&#148; guidance makes clear that local authorities should undertake a proper and objective evaluation of academy options when developing their plans. Where an authority does not propose an academy as replacement for a poorly performing maintained school, it must be demonstrated that an equally strong alternative, innovative strategy is in place for raising standards at the school.</p>

 The Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families (2000) is used for the assessment of all children in need, including cases where there are concerns that a child may be suffering significant harm.

 It is crucial that all young people leave school with the skills and confidence to manage their money well. The revised curriculum for secondary schools introduced in September 2008, includes a new dedicated programme of study for &#147;Economic Well Being and Financial Capability&#148; as part of a revised Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education. We have also said that, subject to consultation, we will make PSHE, which is currently non-statutory, part of the statutory national curriculum. Elements of financial capability are also delivered through other curriculum subjects. For example, Citizenship education, which is statutory at Key Stage 3 and 4, requires that  14 to 16-year-olds be taught how the economy functions, including the role of business and financial services. We are also introducing functional mathematics to the maths GCSE, which means that from 2010, all pupils who achieve a grade C or above will have mastered the basics.</p>

 For most young people, eligibility for education maintenance allowance (EMA) is subject to an assessment of their household income based on the financial year prior to the academic year in which they start their course. A successful assessment provides a young person with a guaranteed entitlement of up to three years of EMA on the same rate, plus a guaranteed minimum level of non-repayable student support should they progress into higher education within three years.</p>

Recent increases to child benefit will provide additional support for parents regardless of income, and the increase to the child element of the child tax credit, a measure brought forward in the Budget, will provide substantial additional support to families.

 The statutory standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and requirements for Initial Teacher Training do not include such a requirement. QTS standard Q30 requires that trainees should be able to identify opportunities for children and young people to learn in the school grounds and in out-of-school contexts such as museums, theatres, field centres and work settings. The guidance that accompanies the standards and requirements explains that trainees should be able to plan out-of-classroom work that relates to current learning, that is appropriate to the age and ability of learners, and that helps learners to make progress. In order to meet the standard, trainees are not expected to undertake out-of-school visits, or to take sole responsibility for the organisation and leadership of any such visits.</p>

1. Includes activity in English National Health Service Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>
2. Alcohol-related admissions: The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory. Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions. Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more alcohol-specific conditions were listed. This is because the research on which the attributable fractions are based does not cover<br>
under 16s. Alcohol-specific conditions are those that are wholly attributed to alcohol&#151;that is, those with an attributable fraction of one. They are:<br>
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6)<br>
Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br>
Alcoholic liver disease (K70)<br>
Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br>
Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br>
Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br>
Chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced) (K86.0)<br>
Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br>
Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br>
Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br>
Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br>
Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br>
Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br>
3. Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis: These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
4. Ungrossed data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
5. Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
6. Primary diagnosis: The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
7. Secondary diagnosis: As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
8. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
9. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
10. Assignment of episodes to years: Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br>

Data represent activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector<br>
<i> Alcohol-related admissions</i><br>
The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions.<br>
Figures for under-16s only include admissions where one or more alcohol specific conditions were listed. This is because the research on which the attributable fractions are based does not cover under 16s. Alcohol specific conditions are those that are wholly attributed to alcohol&#151;that is, those with an attributable fraction of one.<br>
The ICD-10 codes used to answer this PQ are K70, K73 and K74, which are the codes for liver disease that is wholly or partially attributable to alcohol. K70 has an attributable fraction of one, K73 and K74 have an overall attributable fraction of 0.73 for males and 0.50 for females.<br>
Number of patients who had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis<br>
These figures represent the number of patients where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a hospital episode statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
<i> Ungrossed data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Primary diagnosis</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
<i> Secondary diagnosis</i><br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Assignment of episodes to years</i><br>
Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient&#146;s hospital stay.<br>

Measures in the 2009 Budget, such as &#163;4 billion support for UK renewable energy projects and &#163;405 million for developing a low carbon energy and green manufacturing sector, offer further scope to promote university collaboration with the private sector in this area. Publication of the new Higher Education Framework will set out how the HE sector will take a more active approach to building British competitive strengths through higher skill levels, research and knowledge transfer.

4. The telecommunications market is very complex, with many different providers, all with their own tariffs and call plans. Recent research by the Department shows that over 80 per cent. of our customers contact the Department using landlines. As BT account for two-thirds of landline provision the table uses BT&#146;s landline tariff to calculate average costs. Only 9 per cent. of BT landline customers do not have a package that may now include free calls to 0845 numbers.<br>
5. Figures for average call length include speed of answer and time spent with an agent.<br>

 The average cost of a call from a mobile telephone to numbers used by the Department varies widely. It depends on the contract between mobile operators and a caller, the number used&#151;0800 for initial claims and 0845 for changes in circumstances, and the length of the call.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_429"><a name="90430w0021.htm_para0"><a name="09043051000723">Charges are generally in the 10p to 15p range, but can be up to about 40p for some &#145;pay as you go&#146; contracts. If a mobile caller is concerned about charges, they can ask to be called back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_430"><a name="90430w0021.htm_para1"><a name="09043051000724">Following consultation with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) and the Office of Communications (OFCOM), the Department is making representations to mobile telephone operators to reduce and where possible eradicate these costs for its customers. As a first step, it is approaching operators to provide a free phone service for 0800 numbers. BT has already announced that calls to 0800 numbers will be free from 1 May. The Department hopes other operators will follow this lead.</p>

 Causes of incapacity are based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, published by the World Health Organisation. To qualify for incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance, claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work which is called the personal capability assessment. Therefore, the medical condition recorded on the incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefits. For example, the decision for a customer claiming incapacity benefit on the grounds of mental or behavioural disorders would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities in the personal capability assessment.</p>
