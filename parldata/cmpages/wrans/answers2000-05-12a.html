<a name="00512w01.html_wqn0"><B> Sir Paul Beresford: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 30 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 228W, on housing improvement agencies, what previous experience Collective Enterprises Ltd. has had in administering Government grants; and on what basis he determined that CEL possessed <i>(a)</i> broad-based expertise in housing and care issues, <i>(b)</i> the capacity to support individual agencies and their managing agents across England and <i>(c)</i> the ability to deliver services from a position of independence and impartiality.

<a name="00512w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Officials of my Department and the Department of Health evaluated the tenders received from Care and Repair England Ltd. and Collective Enterprises Ltd. (CEL) against a range of criteria, including those mentioned by the hon. Member, and recommended that CEL's tender as a whole offered a more effective approach to the delivery of the requirements of the national co-ordinating role. My Department's contract with CEL does not require them to administer the system of grants to individual home improvement agencies.

<a name="00512w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what the average fine imposed on businesses prosecuted by the Environment Agency was in each of the last three years;  [121843]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many businesses were successfully prosecuted by the Environment Agency in each of the last three years.  [121842]

<P>
<a name="00512w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Environment Agency publishes prosecution statistics in its annual reports. Although these figures do not distinguish between companies and individuals, and it would cause disproportionate cost to do so here, most prosecutions are against businesses. The 1999-2000 annual report will be laid before Parliament in July. Figures for the previous two years are as follows.

<P>
<a name="00512w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The good practice guidance we have prepared in partnership with the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment will be published on Monday 15 May. Copies of "By Design. Urban design in the Planning System; towards better practice" will be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="00512w01.html_para0">"By Design" will form a key part of the Government's strategy for promoting better urban design in the planning and development system. It provides sound, practical advice on how to implement the Government's commitment to good design as set out in Planning Policy Guidance, in particular PPG1 "General Policy and Principles" and PPG3 "Housing". It also reinforces the call in the Urban Task Force's report "Towards an Urban Renaissance" for earlier, greater and better-informed attention to urban design.

 The Franchising Director would normally verify the accuracy of any privately produced railway study, using external consultants where necessary. Virgin Trains' study was presented to the former Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (now the shadow Strategic Rail Authority), and the Franchising Director judged its conclusions to be valid, having considered it in line with the organisation's process of due diligence.

This is attributable to the new or refurbished stock now available on the Northern, Jubilee and Piccadilly lines. The reduction of signal or points failure in 1999-2000 compared with the two previous years reflects investment and maintenance work enabled by the additional funding provided by the Government.

 No state in Europe has privatised its main air traffic control service provider. However, a number of states are, like the UK, looking at ways to commercialise their service providers and at how to introduce new management expertise and financing into the provision of air traffic control.

 None. Under the provisions of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997 the Axminster and Exmouth magistrates courts are managed locally by the Devon and Cornwall Magistrates Courts Committee. Decisions concerning closure are for that Committee to determine, although a contributing local authority may appeal to the Lord Chancellor against a proposed closure. The procedure for such appeals is set out in section 56 of the Act. In the absence of an appeal the Lord Chancellor has no locus in the matter.

<a name="00512w05.html_para3"><i>Letter from Gordon Hextall to Mrs. Ann Winterton, dated 12 May 2000:</i>
<P>

<a name="00512w05.html_para4">

<BR>
The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking how many former service personnel who participated in the nuclear tests programmes in Australia and South Pacific have been awarded war pensions after they developed (a) leukaemia, excluding chronic lymphatic and (b) multiple myeloma; when was the first time that former service personnel were awarded war pensions after developing these illnesses; and if he will make a statement.
<BR>
The War Pensions Agency processes claims for war disablement and war widows' pensions and for associated supplementary allowances. Under the war pensions scheme, awards may be made in respect of any condition which is due to any service in the armed forces.
<BR>
We do collect statistics of all claims for war pensions from British nuclear test veterans who believe that they might have been exposed during service to excessive radiation. However, these also include claims from personnel who served, for example, on nuclear submarines.
<BR>
The statistics at 10th May 2000 are as follows:
<BR>
Leukaemia: 9 cases (5 disablement, 4 widows)
<BR>
Multiple myeloma: 13 cases (10 disablement, 3 widows)
<BR>
You will wish to know that the background to these awards is that as a result of concern amongst some test participants about the effects that the participation may have on their health, the Ministry of Defence commissioned an independent study by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) in 1988 to investigate the subsequent health of participants. The study compared the mortality and cancer incidence in over 20,000 test participants with that of a similar-sized control group of ex-servicemen who had not participated in the test programme.
<BR>
<i>The 1988 NRPB Report and the Department's position</i>
<BR>
The NRPB Report published in 1988 confirmed that participation in the UK tests has not had a detectable effect on the participants' expectation of life, nor on their risk of developing cancer in general. It did, however, raise a reasonable doubt that leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) and multiple myeloma might be due to participation. Whilst the NBPB Report did not causally relate leukaemia and multiple myeloma specifically to participation in the nuclear weapons tests, its' evidence was nevertheless accepted as raising a reasonable doubt that leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) and multiple myeloma may have resulted from such participation. Thus, any claim for war pension in respect of disablement or death due to leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) and multiple myeloma was likely to succeed. This policy was effective from 28th January 1988.
<BR>
<i>The 1993 NRPB Report</i>
<BR>
The study was extended and the second NRPB Report was issued in 1993. This confirmed the overall conclusion of the 1988 Report, that participation in the tests had no detectable effect on the participants' expectation of life, nor on their risk of developing most cancers. It concluded that the small hazard of multiple myeloma suggested by the 1988 Report was not supported by the additional data, although the possibility of some small risk of developing leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) in the first 25 years after participation could not be ruled out.
<BR>
As a result of this later Report, it is now the Secretary of State's normal policy to accept any new claim in respect of leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) if the participant developed the condition within 25 years of his participation in the tests. This change was effective from 11th December 1993. War Pensions 



<P>
<P><I>12 May 2000 : Column: 498W</I><P>
already in payment to test participants or their widows in respect of disablement or death due to leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) or multiple myeloma were not affected by that decision.
<BR>
<i>Evidence of service-related ionising radiation exposure</i>
<BR>
Should there be reliable evidence of service-related ionising radiation and where there is a recognised link between the claimed condition and such exposure, an award of war pension will be considered.
<BR>
The Secretary of State does not accept evidence of participation in the nuclear tests as itself equating to proof of service-related ionising radiation exposure.
<BR>
If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to ask.

Under the war pensions scheme awards may be made in respect of any condition which is due to any service in the armed forces. Unfortunately, our statistics do not specifically record the number of claims from, and awards to, ex-service personnel whose service included participation in the British nuclear test programme. To obtain that precise information would require a clerical exercise which could only be carried out at disproportionate costs.
<BR>
However, we do have statistics of claims for war pension from British nuclear test veterans who believe that they might have been exposed during service to excessive ionising radiation, but these include claims from personnel who served, for example, in nuclear submarines.
<BR>
At 31st March 2000, these statistics record 1,228 claims which resulted in 467 awards, but these are for a miscellany of conditions, some of which have no connection to participation in the test programme.
<BR>
If I can be of any further assistance, then please do not hesitate to contact me.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00512w06.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The 1998 White Paper on Strategic Export Controls proposed that new primary legislation should provide for parliamentary scrutiny of secondary export control legislation, but the White Paper stated that the Government did not consider there should be advance parliamentary scrutiny of individual export licence applications as this would slow down significantly the process of decision making and raise difficult issues of commercial confidentiality. The Foreign Affairs and Trade and Industry Committees endorsed this conclusion while the Quadripartite Committee on Strategic Export Controls has stated that it will seek to come to conclusions on this issue in its next Report.
<P>

<a name="00512w06.html_para1">All the White Paper proposals are under review in the light of comments received. In coming to conclusions on this issue, the Government will take account also of the conclusions of the Committees, including any conclusions reached by the Quadripartite Committee on this matter.

 The DTI is responsible for many forms of assistance to small firms. All those services are subject to regular evaluation.
<P>

<a name="00512w06.html_para2">At a regional level, business support can be provided in a variety of ways. Some services are provided by the Government Offices in the regions; others are provided by the Regional Development Agencies. But the most important mechanism for providing support for small businesses at the local level in England is the network of Business Link partnerships. These provide their own services, but also access to other forms of support from both the public and private sector. Funding mechanisms also vary and, in relevant areas, EU funding can be a significant source of business support.




<P>

<P>

<a name="00512w06.html_para3">It is critically important that the services provided and funded by Government are effective both in terms of content and delivery. The Department therefore asked each Regional Development Agency (and the London Development Partnership) last year to report on the delivery of business support in their region. A number of RDAs supported their reviews with external research. Those reports are now being received and the newly- established Small Business Service will be taking forward the reports with each of the RDAs. In parallel, the Small Business Service is itself restructuring the Business Link network, with the aim of new Business Link partnerships coming into operation from April 2001. The new partnerships will be expected to develop their services within the context both of the RDA regional economic strategies and national priorities established by the SBS.

 I announced on 25 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 199W that I had decided to extend the availability of the Shipbuilding Intervention Fund to 31 December 2000. I am pleased to confirm that that remains the position.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> perceptions of the effectiveness of the home shipbuilding credit guarantee scheme and <i>(b)</i> the plans the Government have to alter the scheme.  [121469]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00512w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 I believe that the scheme has played an important role in helping UK yards win new orders since its inception in the 1960s, and continues to do so. The scheme has supported some 1,200 vessels to the value of more than &#163;4.5 billion. It currently supports UK built ships to the tune of &#163;200 million.
<P>

<a name="00512w06.html_para8">The Department runs the scheme on a comparable basis to similar schemes in our main competitor countries and we believe that its current terms/facilities are competitive. To this end, and in response to recommendations from our partnership with the industry in the Shipbuilding Forum in 1999, we delivered significant improvements to the scheme by making loans available in euros and US dollars, and by making guarantees only facilities available too. This makes the scheme one of the few to offer guarantees only, and to offer finance of up to 12 years.
<P>

<a name="00512w06.html_para9">Following the introduction of these improvements, there is now a high level of inquiry for finance under the scheme involving potential orders for eligible ships at virtually all the UK yards.
<P>

<a name="00512w06.html_para10">In line with our general approach we remain ready to consider constructive suggestions for ways that the scheme might be strengthened in the future.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on his Department's support for shipbuilding <i>(a)</i> on the River Clyde and <i>(b)</i> in the United Kingdom as a whole.  [121315]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00512w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 My Department's strategy is to support and promote all parts of the UK shipbuilding industry equally, irrespective of their location. In particular, the policy is to assist the industry to improve its competitiveness. In July 1998 my Department established the Shipbuilding Forum whose membership comprises representatives of the shipbuilding and ship repair industry, trades unions, equipment suppliers and customers, both private and public sector. Also involved are the National Training Organisation for the marine sector and relevant Government Departments. The Forum's terms of reference are to consider the current situation of the shipbuilding and ship repair industry and how to improve its competitiveness so as to increase its share of the European market, leading to increased output, profitability and employment.

 New Deal actively promotes equality of opportunity and outcome for people of all ethnic and racial groups. Targets have been set for all Units of Delivery to achieve parity of outcome on jobs between white and ethnic minority young people, by the end of this Parliament. Latest figures show that to the end of February 2000, in Greater London, 19,157 men and 10,035 women from ethnic minority groups have benefited from starting the New Deal for young people and that 12,198 men and 2,565 women from ethnic minority groups have benefited from starting the national New Deal for long-term unemployed people aged 25 or over. Many others will have benefited from the New Deal for Lone Parents and other New Deals.

 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2000]:</i> Admissions procedures are a matter in the first instance for individual higher education institutions.
<P>

<a name="00512w08.html_para6">The Government wish to see a widening of access to higher education, and we share the aspiration of those who promote the use of Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SATs) that higher education should be available to all who can benefit from it. The substantial reform of post-16 qualifications to be introduced from September will help broaden access to university by giving recognition to a wider range of qualifications. In addition, we are investing heavily in raising standards in deprived areas through "Excellence in Cities". This year we shall be launching new summer schools to help young people to understand better the opportunities higher education can offer. New "Opportunity Bursaries" of up to &#163;1,000 per year will also be introduced from next year to give able young people from areas without a history of participation in higher education the extra financial incentives and confidence they need to embark on a higher education course.
<P>

<a name="00512w08.html_para7">The Sutton Trust is running a small pilot of SAT-type tests in schools in England this year.

<a name="00512w08.html_para8">Although its research is entirely separate from DfEE activities in this area we are happy to work closely with the Trust because its work is focused on widening the socio-economic profile of students in higher education.

<a name="00512w08.html_para9">The differences between the figures for England and those for Somerset are a result of the authority receiving a below average share of the national total for education standard spending to reflect social deprivation and area costs.

Since 1997-98 Somerset's education SSA per pupil has increased by &#163;338, and its special and specific grants per pupil have increased by &#163;193.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if the targets against which cluster bombs were deployed by the Royal Air Force during Operation Allied Force were selected by <i>(a)</i> Her Majesty's Government and <i>(b)</i> by NATO multilateral targeting arrangements.  [121668]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00512w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 During Operation Allied Force, Royal Air Force Harrier GR7s released cluster weapons (RBL755s) against fixed targets and Yugoslav/Serbian fielded forces. The selection and allocation of fixed targets, and the nomination of aircraft to specific tasks, was the responsibility of NATO's Combined Air Operations Centre at Vicenza in Italy. This selection and tasking process was conducted in close coordination with the UK's air commander in theatre who scrutinised all targets and tasks against national Rules of Engagement and targeting constraints, where appropriate consulting the UK national chain of command.
<P>

<a name="00512w10.html_para0">On the other hand, attacks against fielded forces were normally conducted in response to targets which had been located, identified and allocated by an Airborne Forward Air Control aircraft. In these highly responsive circumstances, the Harrier GR7 pilot was responsible for locating, positively identifying and assessing the validity of the target against clearly defined Rules of Engagement; the pilot was also responsible for selecting the most appropriate number and type of weapon to be released. UK armed forces will always use the weapons judged most appropriate against a given target, taking into account weapon effectiveness and the need to minimise collateral damage.

Because the minimum term of a detention and training order is four months, all the orders which have been made since 1 April remain in force.

 There are no specific provisions in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 directly covering the sale or purchase of vouchers issued to asylum seekers under the new support arrangements. However, it is made clear on the face of a voucher that it is only for the use of the person named on it. Accordingly, any attempt to obtain cash or goods by a person other than the one named on the voucher could constitute an offence under the Theft Acts or conspiracy to defraud at common law, for which there is a range of maximum sentences. In certain circumstances, the offences of making false or dishonest representations (the maximum penalty for which is seven years imprisonment on conviction on indictment), under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, may be made out. These latter offences correspond to anti-fraud provisions in social security legislation.

We understand that at least 21 were in respect of persons under the age of 18, of which at least 14 were in respect of persons aged under 16.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00512w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Savings resulting from the introduction of credit card payment for postal passport applications are likely to offset the costs of handling charges. Therefore, this development is unlikely to result in an increase in passport fees. The savings will result from more efficient processing of passport fee receipts. The facility to pay by credit card will also be more convenient for many passport customers than existing payment methods.

 It is the Government's policy that the Prison Service should contribute to the wider aims of the criminal justice system by: protecting the public by holding those committed by the courts in a safe, decent and healthy environment; and reducing crime by providing constructive regimes which address offending behaviour, improve educational and work skills and promote law abiding behaviour in custody and after release.
<P>

<a name="00512w12.html_para8">The Prison Service's priorities for 2000-01 are therefore to maintain security and prevent escapes, to deliver improved regimes, including joint approaches with the Probation Service and to manage the prison population safely.

 The current methodology was developed by Coopers and Lybrand in 1994-95 and has been updated in subsequent years by Home Office staff. The 1998-99 results show that privately managed prisons cost on average 0 per cent. to 13 per cent. less than comparable publicly managed prisons. The present methodology does not cover prisons which have also been designed, constructed, managed and financed by the private sector (DCMF prisons), three of which have now been fully operational for a year. The Prison Service is therefore commissioning independent consultants to develop a revised methodology which will include DCMF prisons, and an invitation to tender will be issued shortly.
