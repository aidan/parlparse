 DFID is working to increase life expectancy through a variety of activities including support for the provision of clean water and sanitation, large-scale immunisation and insecticide-treated bednets programmes and addressing related maternal mortality. Safe hygiene practice and improved access to clean water and sanitation are also vital for reducing child mortality. DFID produced the Water Action Plan in March 2004, and we will double our spending on water and sanitation to &#163;95 million by 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="70517w0001.htm_para0"><a name="07051798000059">In Nigeria we are providing &#163;20 million to rebuild routine immunisation services and a further &#163;80 million for malaria control. In Tanzania we continue to provide support for the social marketing of bednets as part of the national Insecticide Treated Net Programme, and in Sierra Leone we are designing a new long term Child Survival and Maternal Health Programme with the World Bank and national partners. In Malawi we are contributing &#163;100 million over six years to the government's essential health and human resource programme, and significant progress has been made on child survival through immunisation and malaria programmes. Similarly in Zambia we are major donors to the National Strategic Health Plan, which includes a focus on improving child health through expanded vaccination, curative care and improving access to services. In Kenya we are supporting a sector wide approach for the long term strengthening of the health system and improved service delivery. We have funded the development of a number of plans in human resources, procurement and financial management. We are also concentrating much support on the prevention of malaria, the major cause of mortality in children in Kenya. By the end of 2007 we will have spent more than &#163;45 million on insecticide treated bednets and distributed 11 million nets, saving approximately 167,000 lives. DFID is indirectly supporting South Africa's efforts to reverse under-five mortality rates through the &#163;30 million, five-year HIV/AIDS Multi-Sectoral Support Programme (MSP). Our support to the Maternal Child and Women Health Unit in the Department of Health supports research in the area of Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT), the development of fertility options policy, and research on barriers to antiretroviral uptake among children and pregnant women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="70517w0001.htm_para1"><a name="07051798000060">DFID continues to provide strong support to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria (GFATM), and also played a central role in the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm) which issued its first bonds in November 2006. This will disburse $4 billion over the next 10 years and is estimated will save 10 million lives, including five million children before 2015. DFID also recently pledged long term support to UNITAID, the International Drug Purchase Facility, starting with a &#163;15 million contribution in 2007, to ensure poor countries benefit from lower prices for drugs to treat AIDS, TB and malaria.</p>

 There has been progress in driving down the prices of HIV/AIDS drugs in a number of ways. Competition between multiple producers is leading to significant falls in the prices of some first-line Antiretrovirals (ARVs). The work of UNITAID, trade measures, research and improved transparency around pricing in developing countries, are also combining to bring down prices and improve access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="70517w0001.htm_para2"><a name="07051798000063">DFID is supporting UNITAID, the international drug purchasing facility established in late 2006. UNITAID has already approved several significant expenditures, including $61.7 million for paediatric anti-retroviral therapy (ART), $70 million for second line ART and $52.5m for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. We hope that UNITAID will contribute to the necessary reductions in the prices of second-line drugs such as Viread and Kaletra.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="70517w0001.htm_para3"><a name="07051798000064">UNITAID and the Clinton Foundation recently announced a major cut in the price of 16 ARV formulations which will be available to 66 developing countries. UNITAID has committed over $120 million in 2007 and 2008 to this programme, and the Clinton Foundation has negotiated price reductions on average between 25 per cent. and 50 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="70517w0001.htm_para4"><a name="07051798000065">DFID and other Whitehall Departments have worked with the EU and World Trade Organisation (WTO) member states, to ensure that developing countries have the necessary flexibilities in the WTO Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement to safeguard their pressing public health needs. TRIPS now allows countries without manufacturing capacity to issue compulsory licences to import generic copies of patented medicines. The EU is taking steps to implement legislation transposing this agreement into European law. We have funded several programmes including pilot projects in Kenya and Botswana to help them implement legislation allowing them to use TRIPS flexibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="70517w0001.htm_para5"><a name="07051798000066">The UK is also involved with others in research, largely through public private partnerships including the International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), and recently launched an international Medicines Transparency Alliance (MeTA) to focus on price, quality and availability of medicines across the supply chain in-country.

 DFID is helping to improve the economic conditions in the Middle East in a number of ways:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="70517w0001.htm_para6"><a name="07051798000069">We are supporting the Iraqi Government in their economic reform efforts through a &#163;13 million programme, providing technical advice on fiscal (including budget management and public financial management) and macroeconomic policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="70517w0001.htm_para7"><a name="07051798000070">We are providing &#163;15 million to the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The TIM and other international assistance has helped to slow economic decline. The World Bank has highlighted the restrictions on movement and access of Palestinians as the biggest economic constraint, and the UK Government have made our concerns clear to the Israeli Government on this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="70517w0001.htm_para8"><a name="07051798000071">As part of our Yemen programme of &#163;12 million this year, we are investigating various ways in which we can support growth and jobs for poor people. We also focus on improving the efficiency of Government. We are supporting the Ministry of Finance to implement National Public Financial Management Reform. This includes support to budget development and management, procurement reform and auditing. Currently we have &#163;1.1 million committed (2006-08) to this multi-donor Government programme, and are looking to expand over 2008-11 if opportunities to build on progress exist. At community level, the Social Fund for Development (SFD) is supporting small and micro enterprise development throughout the country to which DFID is providing approximately &#163;800,000. DFID has over the past couple of years worked with the Government and other donors to harmonize donor assistance in Yemen in order to make it as effective as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="70517w0001.htm_para9"><a name="07051798000072">At regional level, DFID supports economic reform across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region through contributions to the EC European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) which will provide &#8364;5.6 billion (approximately &#163;3.8 billion) for 17 MENA and eastern European countries from 2007-10. Approximately &#8364;1 billion (approximately &#163;0.6 billion) of this will come from DFID&#146;s budget. The ENPI is designed to promote good governance and equitable social and economic development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="70517w0001.htm_para10"><a name="07051798000073">DFID also directly supports the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and partnership (FEMIP) which has loaned &#8364;2 billion (approximately &#163;1.4 billion) to MENA countries to help them meet the challenges of economic and social modernisation and improve regional integration. DFID has provided &#8364;3 million (approximately &#163;2 million) in grants to a technical trust fund which helps to ensure the FEMIP lending is effective.</p>

Most recently the British high commissioner to Uganda and the Head of the DFID Office in Uganda met with President Museveni on 10 May 2007. He reconfirmed his support for the Juba peace process. In all of our discussions with the Government of Uganda on northern Uganda we emphasise the importance of dialogue as essential to resolving the conflict. The UK has provided &#163;250,000 to a UN fund set up to support the talks and we have made it clear that we will do more if necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="70517w0001.htm_para14"><a name="07051798000083">Accurate data on the number of Acholi people who have been raped are also not available. Many women and girls do not come forward and say that they have been raped because of the stigma involved, and the practical problems associated with reporting such incidents. However the risk of sexual and gender based violence is high. As part of our humanitarian assistance, DFID has provided approximately &#163;2 million to UNICEF and Save the Children over the last two financial years for their programmes to protect women and children in the North. Communities have also stressed the importance of a police presence in tackling issues of sexual and gender based violence. In response we are providing &#163;700,000 from the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool funds in support of a plan to strengthen civilian policing in the North.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="70517w0001.htm_para16"><a name="07051798000085">In July 2005 DFID supported a Uganda Ministry of Health and World Health Organisation led survey that measured crude mortality rates in northern Uganda. This found that the crude mortality rate in northern Uganda was 1.54 deaths per 10,000 people per day. A crude mortality rate of over 1.0 per 10,000 a day is considered an emergency. As a direct response we have provided over &#163;37 million in humanitarian assistance over the last two years, including &#163;9.6 million in support of a UN programme aimed at tackling some of the main causes of death, including malaria, diarrhoea and respiratory tract infection. There is strong anecdotal evidence that mortality has fallen but a repeat survey will be carried out before the end of the year to check that this is the case.</p>

 The Hercules C-130K explosion suppressant foam (ESF) modification takes approximately 44 days per aircraft to complete. The less complex Hercules C-130J modification takes approximately 16 days. The difference in time scale between the two marks of aircraft is due to the need to replace the fuel tank sealant on the older C-130K. In order to improve overall aircraft availability to the front line command, the ESF modification has been combined with scheduled maintenance wherever possible.</p>

 The Department has not received any formal representations. Child protection is a matter for local authorities and their partners. Safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children requires effective co-ordination in every local area. For this reason, the Children Act 2004 requires each local authority to establish a Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB). LSCBs came into force on 1 April 2006. Their core membership includes local authorities, health bodies, the police and other key agencies providing services to children and adults. The objectives of LSCBs are to co-ordinate local work and to ensure the effectiveness of the work of member agencies to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. The Government&#146;s statutory guidance &#147;Working Together to Safeguard Children&#148; (2006) sets out their roles and responsibilities including their relationship to the wider children&#146;s trust arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="70517w0005.htm_para2"><a name="070517103000204">This guidance also sets out the processes to be followed if there are concerns about a child&#146;s welfare. Firstly, a referral should be made to local authority children&#146;s social care and it should decide whether to undertake an initial assessment to establish whether the child is a child in need. If the child is a child in need under s17 of the Children Act 1989, then the LA should decide what services are required to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child and which agency is best placed to provide them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="70517w0005.htm_para3"><a name="070517103000205">If there are concerns that a child may be suffering, or is likely to suffer significant harm, then a multi agency strategy meeting&#151;led by local authority children&#146;s social care&#151;should be held to determine whether to undertake inquiries under s47 of the Children Act 1989 and what action is required to safeguard the child&#146;s welfare. If a child is at continuing risk of harm, then a child protection plan would be put in place. Children&#146;s social care and the police, together with the other services are required to work closely together during these assessment and decision making processes.</p>

 The admission arrangements for maintained schools are consulted on and determined each year by the relevant admission authority. This information is published annually by each local authority for all schools in their area in their composite prospectus for parents. We do not collect this information centrally and have no plans to do so. Through discussions with local authorities, schools and faith providers, we know that practices vary widely and that a number of schools with a religious character do not give priority in admissions to children on the basis of their faith and others offer a proportion of places to children without reference to faith.</p>

 The Department has not made any assessment of the difficulty of Mandarin in comparison with other modern language GCSEs. However, the Key Stage 3 programme of study for languages sets out statutory modifications to the level descriptors for listening, responding and reading for pupils studying Mandarin and Cantonese. These modifications assume that Mandarin may be spoken at a slower speed, the range of topics may be more limited and pupils may work with a limited number of characters. There are no similar modifications for other languages.</p>

 We do not promote the teaching of one language over another, and have not provided any specific funding for the teaching of Mandarin in schools. It is for individual schools to decide which languages they offer. However, the Department signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Hanban (Office of the Chinese Language Council International) in July 2006 designed to promote Chinese learning and teaching in English schools and to increase cooperation between the two countries.</p>

 The Secretary of State has not had any discussions with education providers on the teaching of Mandarin in schools. The Languages Review, published in March 2007, proposed widening the range of languages taught in schools. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has recently finished consulting on the revised Key Stage 3 languages curriculum. The consultation proposed removing the requirement that schools must first teach a European language to allow them to teach any major spoken world language, including Mandarin, depending on local need and circumstances. We are considering the potential implications of these changes for the school workforce. </p>

 In the last 10 years the Department has received a total of 248 applications (109 of which in respect of closed schools) that involve the disposal of an area of land capable of forming a sports pitch of at least 0.2 hectares. Of the total received, 54 must be subsequently withdrawn, 16 are still under consideration, 176 have been approved and two were rejected. Of the approved applications, the sale proceeds were used to provide new or improved sports or educational facilities in every case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="70517w0008.htm_para0"><a name="070517103000616">Since the School Playing Field Advisory Panel was set up, in July 2001, the Department has approved 1,076 general consent applications. The effect of a general consent is that, in certain circumstances, the specific prior consent of the Secretary of State is not required to dispose of school playing field land. Such circumstances include the disposal of an area of land to provide a facility as part of an extended school, such as childcare, lifelong learning etc.; the disposal of the ancillary social and recreational areas that surround the buildings of a closed school; certain disposals where playing fields remain as playing fields (for example a transfer to the district council); the exchange of one school playing field for a replacement newly-created school playing field of at least equal size, resulting is no net loss of facility; the disposal of areas of playing field under 50 square metres; and a temporary loss of school playing field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="70517w0008.htm_para1"><a name="070517103000617">Data on school playing fields were supplied to the Department by local authorities in 2001 and 2003. However, because the data were incomplete, it is not possible to assess accurately the number and area of school playing fields.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="70517w0008.htm_para2"><a name="070517103000618">Education Ministers only have power to regulate the disposal of school playing fields. They do not have any statutory powers to govern the future use or development of school playing fields. These are matters for local planning authorities to consider.</p>

<i> [holding answer 14 May 2007]:</i><i> </i>As part of their core funding, &#163;36.3 million was claimed from 2004 to 2006 by School Sport Partnerships for the release of primary school teachers from the timetable to undertake training in physical education. This enables teachers to take places on the national PE, School Sport and Club Links strategy&#146;s professional development programme. This has seen over 143,000 teacher training places being undertaken by primary school teachers from April 2005 to March 2007. These places develop teacher&#146; skills in delivering high quality physical education for their pupils.</p>

 The changes in science and geography are in line with the remit that the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority was given in February 2005 when it was asked to review the Key Stage 3 curriculum. Although some of the language in the draft programmes of study has been changed, the extent of the subject content remains the same. These changes have been made to ensure that pupils can progress from their Key Stage 2 understanding through Key Stage 3 to a point where they can progress to Key Stage 4.</p>

Inspectors observed a number of inadequate lessons at The Ridings School, and in some, the school's behaviour policy was not being followed. Other evidence, such as that emerging from discussions with support staff, indicated that children were being sent to the internal exclusion unit without earlier procedures being followed, supported the view that the problem was more widespread than those specific teachers. The school does not disagree with this judgement. However, the school inspection framework does not require&#151;and indeed, there is insufficient time&#151;for inspectors to observe all teachers in lessons.</p>

The school&#146;s management team, governors and the Local Authority gave this as one reason for the difficulty the school was experiencing in moving forward and the evidence seen by inspectors triangulated this view. For example, an inspector observed a lesson taught by a teacher who was not a specialist in that particular subject area. It was a very poor lesson in which there was no planning, school behaviour policies were not followed by the teacher and the work was not appropriate for the students. As a result, students made no progress in their learning. The teacher explained that he was following union guidance to not adhere to any school policy regarding planning of lessons, preparing work and following behaviour policies when teaching lessons which were not in their specialist subject area.</p>

The Carers Grant was &#163;125 million in 2004-05, &#163;185 million in 2005-06 and &#163;185 million in 2006-07. It is worth &#163;185 million in 2007-08.</p>

The main component of the feedstuff produced is pelleted feed in a computer controlled operation which includes a heating process to at least 80C. Whole wheat grains are added to the pellets making up to 30 per cent. of the final ration.

 Separating out the administrative costs for the Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) and its constituent schemes would incur disproportionate cost.

In part, this is because it is recognised that hares can cause serious agricultural damage, and farmers need the flexibility to address problems when they occur. But mainly it is because there is currently no evidence that the introduction of a close season would significantly enhance hare numbers. Hare numbers have declined throughout Europe despite protection with close seasons.</p>

This discourages farmers from shooting hares for commercial gain at this time, and aims to limit control during the breeding season to that necessary for crop protection.</p>

The steering group, which advises DEFRA on this species, has therefore not recommended the establishment of a close season. If there is any change to this advice then a case for new legislation to protect the brown hare would be considered.</p>

 The main criterion in drawing up the Environment Agency&#146;s (EA) list of the top 10 worst invasive pests was the impact that a particular non-native invasive species has on the EA&#146;s activities and responsibilities. In November 2005, a questionnaire survey asked all 26 of the EA&#146;s area teams to identify species that were having an impact and to rank the top 10 using a simple scoring system (one to 10). The overall top 10 list was derived from the aggregate scores across the EA as a whole.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 14 May 2007]:</i> Council Directive 99/74/EC lays down minimum standards for the welfare of laying hens. The directive bans the practice of keeping laying hens in conventional cages throughout the EU from 1 January 2012. This has been implemented in England through the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No. 1646).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_402"><a name="70517w0013.htm_para16"><a name="070517103001240">The directive specifically requires the EU Commission to prepare a report on the various systems that exist for keeping laying hens, including their health and environmental impact. The report will also take into account the socio-economic implications of the various systems and their effects on the Community's economic partners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_403"><a name="70517w0013.htm_para17"><a name="070517103001241">We will consider the report and the evidence it contains once it is published. In the meantime, our policy remains that there should be no conventional cages from 2012. Reviewing the future of conventional cages on an EU basis will ensure that any legislative changes apply to all EU producers, thus avoiding the risk of simply displacing egg production to other countries.</p>

4. Figures for 2006-07 refer only to the main payment run so they do not include the late payment run figures. We estimate that there are approximately 100,000 people in Great Britain paid in late payment runs (0.8 per cent. of all payments). Since most of the payment runs are to people who are not receiving another benefit from DWP and whose claims had not been received by the qualifying week, most are men aged 60 to 64.<br>

<i> [holding answer 16 May 2007]: </i>Analysis from a recent independent poll indicates that the CRB is making a real difference to the protection of children and vulnerable adults; in the last three years, 60,000 unsuitable people have had offers of employment which involved working with children and vulnerable adults withdrawn on the basis of information contained on their Disclosure. This analysis also demonstrates that users of the Criminal Records Bureau&#146;s (CRB) service feel that the information provided on Disclosures useful when making recruitment decisions.</p>

Following a CRB Internal Audit report in 2006, a proposal was put forward to adopt a system of outcome measures, which the CRB are currently exploring, that will be used to determine further the effectiveness of the CRB&#146;s service in terms of child and vulnerable adult protection.</p>

 The Government believe that cross-border information exchange is fundamental to the fight against organised crime and terrorism and have therefore supported various EU initiatives to improve the exchange of information between member states.

 Police authorities now operate a separate pensions account into which are paid officers&#146; contributions and an employer&#146;s contribution (currently 24.6 per cent. of pensionable pay) and out of which pension payments are made. Wiltshire police authority has recently provided the Home Office with its unaudited accounts for 2006-07 which show a &#163;3,066,000 deficit in their pensions account. In November 2006, Wiltshire police authority estimated a deficit of &#163;3,296,000 in their pensions account for the 2007-08 financial year. Under the new system of funding for police pensions, any deficit in an authority&#146;s pensions account is reimbursed with a grant from central Government each year; any surplus is recouped.</p>

However, the guidance states that patients who were receiving Cetuximab should have the option to continue to do so until they and their consultants decide that it is the right time to stop treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_451"><a name="70517w0019.htm_para5"><a name="0705181000954">It will be for individual primary care trusts to decide whether to fund Cetuximab for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in the light of NICE'S recommendations. It would be inappropriate for ministers to intervene.</p>

 The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 placed a duty on all public authorities to address issues of racial inequality. The Department is a public authority under the meaning of this Act and is required by law to undertake race equality impact assessments. One such assessment was carried out by an external contractor to ensure independence and impartiality in 2004-05 at a cost of &#163;10,125 to the Department following its major change programme of 2003-04. This assessed the impact of a significant restructuring programme across the whole Department. The conclusions are summarised in an executive summary, a copy of which has been placed in the Library. The Department continues to take action to ensure an ongoing commitment to equality is embedded within the organisation.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 May 2007]:</i> In April 2003 the National Health Service Security Management Service (NHS SMS) was created and assumed responsibility for tackling violence against NHS staff, together with all other security related issues in the NHS in England. A comprehensive strategy has been implemented detailing both preventative and re-active action to be taken to tackle this problem both nationally and locally.</p>

 This information is not held centrally. However, we do know that electronic record systems, such as those being delivered by the national programme for information technology, capable of sharing patient information wherever and whenever it is needed, provide more complete data and lead to the delivery of better care. No significant body of medical opinion disputes their enormous potential to support better clinical decision taking and reduce the incidence of medical error.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_466"><a name="70517w0022.htm_para7"><a name="0705181001464">Evidence from environments where electronic patient record systems are already routinely available and used shows, for example, that the number of failed appointments falls because hospitals have accurate and up-to-date addresses for patients. The number of duplicate diagnostic procedures and tests also reduces so that patients do not have to undergo repeat X-rays, reducing their risk of excess radiation and, importantly, patients benefit from knowing their records are up-to-date.</p>
