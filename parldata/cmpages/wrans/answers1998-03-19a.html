[34113]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has received representations from three members of the public and from the Commercial Radio Companies Association about the BBC's promotion of its public service programmes. He has received a number of representations from members of the public about the BBC's promotion of the licence fee, but our records do not provide an exact figure. No representations on this subject have been received from commercial broadcasters.
<P>

<a name="80319w01.html_para2">The Government believe that the BBC should be allowed restricted use of free airtime to promote the licence fee and its public service programmes, provided such promotion meets the requirements of fair competition. The use of such airtime informs licence fee payers of the range and type of public services available, assisting them to get full value from the licence fee.

(3) if the Government will make it their policy not to allow the Elgin Marbles to leave the custody of the British Museum.  [34023]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 It is for the Government's policy that the Parthenon sculptures should remain in the British Museum. More generally, the retention or disposal of objects in our national museums and galleries is a matter for the trustees of those institutions. However, the trustees can only dispose of objects within the scope of their statutory powers, and in many cases those powers limit trustees' discretion to the dispersal of articles which have become useless by reason of damage or are otherwise unsuitable for retention in the collection. The Government have no powers to intervene and no plans to change the law.

 I refer the right hon. Member to the answer that I gave on 12 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>309</i>.

 Bilateral conversion rates between currencies of countries participating in the single currency will form the basis for the conversion rates between national currencies and the euro, in accordance with Article 1091(4) of the Treaty on 1 January 1999. These bilateral rates will be announced on 3 May 1998. There will be no regulations on spreads or commissions covering the period from 3 May 1998 to the start of stage three.

<a name="80319w02.html_para3">Conversions from the euro unit to the national currency units of participating countries from 1 January 1999 and vice versa will be required to use the special conversion rate in accordance with council regulation (EC) No. 1103/97 of 17 June 1997.

Council Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 of 17 June 1997 which will be applicable in all member states, including the United Kingdom, provides confirmation that references to the Ecu in contracts and other legal instruments, including legislation, will be presumed to refer to the euro.

<P>
<a name="80319w02.html_spnew12"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 It is a rule of the conflict of laws, applied by courts in the various jurisdictions in the United Kingdom, that a foreign currency has the status accorded to it by the law governing that currency. Courts in the United Kingdom will therefore recognise the status that the euro will have under EC law, including Council Regulation 1103/97 of 17 June 1997 which confirms that references in contracts to national currencies replaced by the euro will be interpreted to refer to the euro. Domestic legislation will not be required in the United Kingdom.

 The UK Government are not in a position to make reliable estimates of the impact of sanctions on Iraq. However, we take seriously disturbing reports from international humanitarian organisations suggesting that the people of Iraq are suffering deprivation and hardship.
<P>

<a name="80319w03.html_para0">The issue is complex, given the many influences that bear upon the well-being of the population, of which sanctions are one. Numerous attempts have been made, e.g., under the auspices of the UN, to estimate the impact of sanctions on Iraq, but the findings are open to differences of interpretation. In addition, there are practical difficulties. UK missions to Iraq attempt to monitor the situation, but are currently restricted to the north of the country. We do not have independent access to Baghdad-controlled Iraq.

 The Luxembourg European Council established a framework which will allow Cyprus and the ten applicant countries of Central Europe to join the EU as soon as they are ready. We shall launch accession negotiations with six of these countries on 31 March. The speed of each applicant's progress will depend on its preparations for membership. So it would be misleading to set any deadlines for the completion of accession negotiations.

[34683]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Halving the time between arrest and sentence for persistent young offenders is our top law and order priority, and we intend to achieve this objective as soon as possible. We have already encouraged all youth justice agencies to take action within the current statutory framework to tackle unnecessary delays, including establishing fast track arrangements for persistent young offenders.
<P>

<a name="80319w04.html_para2">Ministers from all the relevant Departments joined my right hon. Friend and my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor to promote this initiative and it is clear that real efforts are being made at a local level to respond. In addition, the Crime and Disorder Bill, currently before Parliament, includes a range of important measures to streamline the system, improve case management and provide for statutory time limits.
<P>

<a name="80319w04.html_para3">Since coming to office, the Government have carried out a survey of persistent young offenders dealt with by the youth justice system in 1996.

<P>
<P><I>19 Mar 1998 : Column: 681</I><P>
71 days. To monitor progress towards that pledge, we are ensuring that systems are put in place to produce regular data on the time between arrest and sentence for persistent young offenders. During this month, we are contacting youth justice agencies to find out what progress has been made locally to tackle delays and to establish fast tracking arrangements for persistent young offenders.
<P>

<a name="80319w04.html_para4">In response to the consultation paper "Tackling Delays in the Youth Justice System" we received 48 representations concerning the Government's proposed definition of persistent young offenders. Nine respondents welcomed the definition of persistent young offender. 25 respondents suggested that a range of different definitions of persistent young offender should be used, or that there should be no standard definition at all. Others commented more generally on the proposed definition. The definition is intended primarily for monitoring purposes, and is not intended to exclude others from being fast tracked. Local areas may use their discretion in deciding which additional cases to fast track, including spree offenders and others.

<P>

<a name="80319w05.html_para0">It is illegal to sell tobacco to a person under the age of 16, whether or not he or she appears to be so. The Children and Young Persons (Protection from Tobacco) Act 1991 places the responsibility on the retailer to take steps to ensure that the individual is aged 16 or over before the sale is made. If in doubt, the retailer should ask for identification. Guidelines were issued to local authorities in 1992 on the application of the Act, including particular types of enforcement activity. Local authority enforcement of the Act is the responsibility of local trading standards officers.
<P>

<a name="80319w05.html_para1">We are monitoring the effectiveness of the Act. In 1996 (the latest year for which figures are available) there were 140 prosecutions of individuals and companies, 119 of which resulted in findings of guilt.

<a name="80319w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Whilst each asylum claim is considered on its individual merits, it has been a long-standing practice (since the early 1990s) to consider the grant of exceptional leave, on account of the length of stay here, in those asylum cases where a decision had not been taken seven years after the application was made. There are criteria for considering such cases and the grant of exceptional leave is not an automatic outcome.

 The Government keep the law on rape under review to ensure that it is effective in punishing and deterring crime and is fair to victims.
<P>

<a name="80319w05.html_para2">A wide ranging inter-departmental review of the way in which vulnerable and intimidated witnesses are treated by the criminal justice system is currently being conducted. Amongst other things, this review is looking at ways to prevent unrepresented defendants from personally cross-examining victims in rape and other serious sexual offence cases, curbs on cross-examining victims about their previous sexual history and the more widespread use of the power to hear similar fact trials together as well as other measures to assist vulnerable or intimidated witnesses, including victims of rape. The review is nearing completion and we will be considering its recommendations very carefully.
<P>

<a name="80319w05.html_para3">In addition, the Home Office has commissioned a research study to discover what factors influence whether or not a recorded rape leads to a conviction and whether such factors have changed since a similar study of 1985 cases.

The final report of this study will be available later this year. The Government will consider whether changes to the law are required in the light of these research findings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 We have made it clear that we are determined to increase public access to the countryside, including woodlands. As Britain's largest landholder, and as the country's largest single provider of outdoor recreation, the Forestry Commission has an important role to play in this; one of its key objectives is the development of opportunities for woodland recreation.
<P>

<a name="80319w06.html_para0">We are still considering the Commission's future activities as part of its Comprehensive Spending Review. Nevertheless, we have agreed that in the coming year the Commission should offer to buy suitable areas of land where it can provide additional public access and recreation facilities, especially in the National Forest, the Community Forests and the Central Scotland Forest. In addition, we wish to ensure that as many of the Commission's woods as possible are open to the public, and so the Commission will also offer to buy out freeholds where the leases currently restrict access to its existing woods.
<P>

<a name="80319w06.html_para1">The Forestry Commission, like any large landowner, needs to be able both to buy and to sell land in order to manage its estate efficiently and effectively, and to carry out its activities within its budgetary provision.
<P>

<a name="80319w06.html_para2">For the coming year, therefore, while the moratorium on large scale sales of forest land will stay in place, the Commission will be able to sell a small amount of land which is surplus to its requirements. This will include agricultural land, unplantable land, and relatively small and isolated blocks of forest land which do not make a significant contribution to the Commission's objectives. Areas of forest land which are important for public access will not be sold unless an access agreement is in place. The Commission will also be prepared to sell areas for development where this is in the public interest.

 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced on Tuesday 17 March 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1112, that additional funds would be allocated to the National Health Service including &#163;44.5 million in Scotland specifically aimed at tackling the problem of waiting lists.

<a name="80319w06.html_para5">We shall be allocating &#163;20 million of that money at the beginning of April to Health Boards in Scotland with a request that they should draw up comprehensive plans for tackling waiting lists. The initial priority will be to tackle the number of people waiting for in-patient treatment, but I shall also expect them to look at out-patient referrals.
<P>

<a name="80319w06.html_para6">In order to push forward this work, I shall be appointing a Support Force under the Chairmanship of Mr. Tom Divers, General Manager, Lanarkshire Health Board and including as members Mr. Douglas Harper, Medical Director, Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary NHS Trust; Mrs. Lesley Summerhill, Director of Nursing, Dundee Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust; Dr. Erik Jespersen, General Practitioner, Oban; and Mr. Dermot McKeown, Consultant Anaesthetist, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh NHS Trust. The Support Force will be asked to review the plans to be submitted by Health Boards, to pursue particular problem areas, to monitor the progress of Health Boards and Trusts towards reducing waiting lists and to identify and disseminate good practice in managing waiting lists wherever possible.
<P>

<a name="80319w06.html_para7">Of the remaining resources, &#163;4.5 million will be retained as moneys to be paid to Trusts which perform well and achieve their targets quickly and efficiently. The money would be available for purchases of equipment and other facilities in line with strategic requirements for the Trust.
<P>

<a name="80319w06.html_para8">The remaining &#163;20 million will be used to fund particular initiatives or resolve particular problems identified by the Support Force which require additional funding, and to influence more strategic change in service delivery to achieve long-term reductions in waiting lists.

 The Government are keen to see an increase in the amount of waste which is recycled, and are exploring measures to increase collection of recyclable materials and to stimulate and develop the market for recycled goods generally. The Construction Directorate of my Department invests around &#163;4.4 million in a programme of research and innovation aimed at improving the environmental performance of the construction industry and the industry's contribution to sustainable development. One of the initiatives in this area is directed at increasing the usage of renewable materials (mainly timber) in construction. As part of the programme my Department has recently started to fund a project in collaboration with industry which aims to encourage the adoption of best practice in wood residue management by the UK timber industry.

 As the Global Positioning System (GPS) is a US military system, date-related problems with it are primarily a matter for the US Department of Defense. The US GPS Joint Program Office has issued advice about 1999 (known as the GPS End of Week (EOW) rollover issue) and Year 2000 date-related issues. The US maintains that there are no problems with the system but the timing mechanism within GPS satellites may cause a problem with some older generation GPS civil receivers. Although manufacturers are aware of the problems and have taken, or are taking, action to remedy them, users are recommended to check with the manufacturer of the equipment that they own or use.

 We shall be considering the practical and legal implications of bringing some or all of the types of vehicle operation currently subject to the United Kingdom national rules on drivers' hours within the scope of the European Union rules. Such a change would require primary legislation and we would consult operators and their employees before making it. Any change would need to strike a reasonable balance between road safety and operational flexibility. Subject to the outcome of any consultation, it is unlikely that we would extend the requirement to fit tachographs to vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes.
<P>

<a name="80319w07.html_para0">There is also the possibility that European Union proposals to extend limits on working time to the road transport sector will apply to vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes. The aim will be to ensure that workers are protected against adverse effects on their health and safety caused by working excessively long hours, inadequate rest or disruptive working patterns. We expect an initial proposal on working time in road transport from the European Commission later this year.

 The Sustainable Development Unit was set up within ETR in July 1997. It provides advice on sustainable development matters to all parts of DETR and to other Departments. It provides support for the network of Green Ministers and is the focal point for Government contact with the Environmental Audit Committee. It has taken the lead in the consultation, launched on 4 February, which will lead to a new sustainable development strategy; in producing, jointly with the Local Government Association and the Local Government Management Board, the guidance "Sustainable Local Communities for the 21st century", published on 14 January; in preparing Policy Guidance on Environmental Appraisal, to be

Over the same period the volume of traffic on the road has increased by 38 per cent. Although children are now walking less, there appears to have been an overall reduction in the rate of child pedestrian accidents in that period.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action the Civil Aviation Authority is taking following reports on incidents involving electronic equipment interfering with flight equipment.  [34751]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w09.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 March 1998]:</i> The Civil Aviation Authority requires all aircraft systems and equipment to have a high degree of immunity from interference. In the reported cases of possible interference from 'passenger carry on electronic devices' (PEDs) it has not been possible to reproduce or substantiate the reported effects. While these incidents are more of a nuisance than a hazard, they are taken seriously by CAA. The CAA has consequently issued specific information and instructions to aircraft operators regarding the use of mobile phones and PEDs in Aeronautical Information Circulars and a Notice to Air Operator Certificate Holders. However, it remains the responsibility of the aircraft operator to ensure that any equipment carried on or stowed in the aircraft cannot impair the airworthiness of the aircraft.
<P>

<a name="80319w09.html_para0">In addition, the CAA has initiated research through the Defence Evaluation Research Agency's Electro Magnetic Compatibility Club. This research is comparing the levels and frequencies of the signals produced by PEDs with aircraft systems and the equipment interference immunity and susceptibility standards with the aim of establishing whether any coupling to aircraft systems could occur. While the research is not yet complete, the indications are that PEDs cannot interfere with flight safety and management systems but there may be a theoretical possibility of indirect coupling to VHF radio equipment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w09.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 March 1998]:</i> The watch levels set out in "Focus for Change" are suggested and are not therefore prescriptive. Watch complements which fall below the suggested levels through staff vacancies and unplanned absences are allowed to prevail subject to operational risk assessment by local management. Risk assessment are kept under review and contingency arrangements are in place at

At Aberdeen new Coastguard Watch Assistants (CWAs) are currently being trained; at Stornoway two serving CWAs have been selected for promotion to Watch Officer and the resultant CWA posts will be filled through local recruitment. These measures will address vacancy issues at these stations.

 The Environment Agency is responsible for the regulation of waste disposal in England and Wales. Last year the Environment Agency published a number of quantitative assessments of the risks to public health from BSE via environmental pathways. This included the risk of the infective agent being ingested via drinking water. It was concluded that the risk to human health was very low, negligible compared to other risks in daily life. The reports, which were published on 25 June 1997 incorporated expert advice from the Government's independent advisory committee, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), were

 I am today announcing the names of the twenty three authorities which will be able to proceed, on a voluntary basis and subject to the approval of their tenants, with proposals to carry out 28 transfers of all or part of their housing stock to Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) in 1998/99. The programme will involve over

<P><I>19 Mar 1998 : Column: 700</I><P>
85,000 dwellings in large scale voluntary transfers, generating capital receipts of over &#163;482 million. Sixteen of the transfers will be supported by Estates Renewal Challenge Funding.

<a name="80319w10.html_para1">This reflects the Government's commitment to a continuing programme of transfers as a means of generating private finance to repair and improve the condition of social housing.

 The Government will be considering in the light of the Regeneration Comprehensive Spending Review and the consultation on their paper 'Regeneration--the Way Forward', issued in November 1997, how to take forward the development of regeneration policy. In practice, the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) Challenge Fund has already carried forward the principles of City Challenge. The results of the fourth round of the SRB Challenge Fund are expected to be announced shortly.

<P>
<a name="80319w11.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Estimates from the leisure accident database, administered by the Department of Trade and Industry, suggest that there were 801,499 sporting injuries in 1996. The estimate was based on a sample of 18 hospitals in the United Kingdom. However, it is not possible to distinguish those resulting from "hazardous" sports from others. No estimate has been made of the cost of sporting accidents to the NHS. Accidents, generally, cost the National Health Service around &#163;1.2 billion per annum.

<P>
<a name="80319w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Extending the transitional provisions in Article 12 of the European Specialist Medical Qualifications Order 1995 to doctors holding qualifications awarded in the Irish Republic would be difficult to justify as it would amount to discrimination against European Economic Area (EEA) nationals holding other EEA qualifications.
<P>

<a name="80319w11.html_para5">The effect of extending the transitional provisions in the Order to include all EEA qualifications would be to allow a large number of doctors holding EEA qualifications which do not meet the requirements of the European Commission Medical Directive (93/16/EEC) to gain access to specialist practice in the United Kingdom. This would represent a significant inroad into the principles upon which the Order was drafted, and could potentially compromise the standard of clinical practice in the UK.

<a name="80319w12.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Clinical guidelines on the management of patients affected by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, published in 1990 and commended by the Department to the National Health Service in 1994, have recently been revised by the professional working group that originally produced them. It is expected that the final version of the revised guidelines will be published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in the next few months. The Department will then consider whether they should subsequently be issued to the NHS as Department of Health guidance.

<P>
<a name="80319w12.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Nosocomial Infection National Surveillance Scheme (NINSS) is a new national surveillance system for hospital acquired infection. It is based at the Public Health Laboratory Service. NINSS will consist of a number of modules, each relating to a particular type of infection and/or group of patients. 



<P>
<P><I>19 Mar 1998 : Column: 707</I><P>
Data from the hospitals are collected using a standard methodology and are collated and analysed by the Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Unit. Each hospital is given information about its own results together with anonymised aggregate data from the other participating hospitals. Individual results remain confidential to the particular hospital but once sufficient data have been accumulated to permit meaningful interpretation, the aggregated data will be published.
<P>

<a name="80319w12.html_para2">Two modules--blood stream infection and wound infections following certain surgical procedures--have so far been developed. These were successfully piloted in 1996-97 by 16 hospitals for bloodstream infections and by 34 hospitals for surgical site infection. Initial data have been fed back to these hospitals. Over 100 hospitals have now taken part in these surveillance schemes.
<P>

<a name="80319w12.html_para3">Data collected by NINSS include information about the causative organism of infection (where this has been isolated by the hospital's own laboratory) and its sensitivity or resistance to different types of antibiotics, including, in the case of staphylococcus aureus, sensitivity to methicillin.

<a name="80319w12.html_wqn6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what were the results of the quinquennial review of the Law Commission.  [35693]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 A review was begun during the first part of 1997, and was completed, following the General Election, in July of that year. It concluded that a managed programme of law reform remained an essential part of a modern democracy's responsibilities and that the Law Commission remained a vital part of that process.
<P>

<a name="80319w12.html_para4">In the course of the review the need for a number of changes of approach to the initiation and management of law reform projects was identified.
<P>

<a name="80319w12.html_para5">An action plan based on the review's conclusions, agreed between the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Law Commission and approved by the Lord Chancellor in December last, is now in large part complete. The action plan has today been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w12.html_wqn7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what decisions he has reached on the unimplemented Law Commission reports within the responsibility of his Department. [35694]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 As previously indicated, the Government intend to bring forward legislation on "Delegation by Individual Trustees" (Law Com No 220) and the first part of "Restitution for Mistake of Law: Ultra Vires Public Authority Receipts and Payments Law" (Com No 227) when time permits. It will also bring forward legislation on "Privity of Contract: Contracts for the Benefit of Third Parties" (Law Com No 242), again when time permits. The Government's Green Paper on mental incapacity includes proposals in "Mental Incapacity" (Law Com No 231); the consultation period ends on 31 March.
<P>

<a name="80319w12.html_para6">The Government have decided not to implement "Transfer of Land--the Law of Positive and Restrictive Covenants" (Law Com No 127), but will ask the Law Commission to consider, in the context of its other priorities, how future developments in property law might affect the recommendations in this report. The Government have also decided not to implement the remaining part of "Overreaching: Beneficiaries in Occupation" (Law Com No 188), or "Land Mortgages" (Law Com No 204), as these proposals have not been supported sufficiently widely. However, we will invite the Law Commission to reconsider their proposals in "Law Com No 204" after they have finished their current work on land registration.
<P>

<a name="80319w12.html_para7">Decisions on other reports will, where possible, be reached by Easter and will be announced. All Law Commission reports, even though some remain unimplemented, play a valuable role in the clarification and development of the law. The Government are most grateful to the Law Commission for the extensive contribution it makes to producing a modern and effective legal framework for England and Wales.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w14.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. David Davis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment (1) for what reasons, in setting achievement targets for primary and secondary schools, he uses data based on pupils' eligibility for, or take-up of, free school meals;  [35330]
<P>
<UL>(2) what reasons, in setting achievement targets for primary and secondary schools, he does not use data based on pupils' prior achievement.  [35331]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 It is for schools themselves, rather than for the Secretary of State, to set achievement targets. In doing so they will draw on relevant data, including socio-economic characteristics of their intake and the prior attainment of their pupils. School targets should take account of the 1997 benchmark information and other comparative data set out in the Performance and Assessment reports recently provided to each school. School targets should also take account of the national targets for English and Mathematics at age 11.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w15.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Illsley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many further education places he expects to be offered to participants in the Government's New Deal schemes following his decision to make available extra money to allow further education colleges to recruit students in the New Deal group above their targets.  [33579]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w15.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The &#163;6.05 million made available by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State may benefit up to 12,000 unemployed people in England who might otherwise be unable to access further education.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w15.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Illsley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment (1) what plans he has in respect of the balance of funding between employers and the public purse in respect of further education provided through franchised arrangements with partnership organisations; [33577]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the impact of increasing to 50 per cent. the contribution made by partnership organisations to franchised schemes managed by further education colleges on the subject availability of those schemes and the number of places provided on them.  [33578]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w15.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 We are seeking a fairer balance between state and employer contributions to the cost of employer-led provision in further education, against the principle that employers should be meeting at least half the cost. Last November, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State asked the Further Education Funding Council (FEFC) to make arrangements to secure next year an extra &#163;20 million in employer contributions. In response, for 1998-99, the FEFC has decided to reduce by one third the rate of funding available for college provision delivered for an employer, normally on the employer's premises, either by direct or collaborative provision, in the expectation that colleges will seek a greater contribution from employers. There will still be significant public funding for such provision. We have had no evidence that this change will have an impact on subject availability.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w15.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 I am today making public the results of a joint UK-US review of what has become known as the "Sabahiyah" incident, in which a large tank of liquid, initially thought to contain Iraqi mustard agent, was found in Kuwait after the end of the Gulf conflict. The review has concluded that the tank did not contain chemical warfare agent, but rather inhibited red fuming nitric acid to fuel Iraqi Silkworm anti-ship missiles.
<P>

<a name="80319w15.html_para3">This is the first of three reviews of events during the Gulf conflict which we pledged to carry out last July. Preparation of the case narrative, which is also being published today in the US, has involved close and detailed cooperation between the MOD and the US Department of Defense. A copy of the case narrative will be placed in the Library of the House.

 <i>[holding answer 11 March 1998]:</i> I met a delegation from Sinn Fein on 5 November, following which I wrote to Mr. Adams.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what factors led to the all-Ireland Institute of Public Health being sited in Dublin; how many jobs are being funded there from UK public funds; at what annual cost; and if she will make a statement. [34616]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 The key factor influencing the initial location of the Institute of Public Health in Ireland was the opportunity to work in close proximity to the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland which will provide suitable accommodation and essential support for the new body. It is anticipated that the Institute will have seven staff and that the contribution to core funding from UK public funds will be approximately &#163;100,000 per annum.
<P>

<a name="80319w16.html_para3">The Institute will be required to demonstrate that its activities in support of existing public health bodies benefit people throughout both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The location of the Institute in the long-term will be guided by the needs of the body in carrying out its work programme effectively.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if she will increase funding for the counselling of sex abuse survivors; and if she will make a statement on the waiting times presently experienced for such counselling at the Nexus Institute.  [34617]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 The Department of Health and Social Services does not allocate funds to Health and Social Services Boards specifically for the purposes of counselling victims of sexual abuse. The amounts to be committed for such purposes are matters for the Boards to decide within the context of their overall resource allocations and their priorities for the provision of services within their areas.
<P>

<a name="80319w16.html_para4">The lengths of the waiting lists for counselling by the NEXUS Institute are a matter of concern to the Department. However, a new counsellor training programme was launched by NEXUS in 1997 and it is hoped that this will have a significant impact later this year in reducing the waiting lists.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w17.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 The Government recognise the impact of currency movements on agriculture, but it is difficult to assess these effects precisely. UK farmers receive a substantial degree of protection from the impact of currency movements on their receipts under the CAP through the EU agrimonetary system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Government action in this sector is constrained by the rules of the CAP regime for sheepmeat. In recognition of the depressed state of the sheepmeat market, I recently instructed my officials to ask the Commission to open tenders for Private Storage Aid in the UK. The Commission responded promptly to our request, fixing a flat-rate Private Storage Aid of 1,400 ecu per tonne for a maximum of 3,000 tonnes of sheepmeat to be placed into storage in the Republic of Ireland and the UK.

<P>
<P>

 Urban farms have a role based more on education than production. The Department gives no specific support to farms simply because they are situated in an urban area.

<P>

<a name="80319w17.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Levitt: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what progress has been made with the selective cull of cattle; and if he will make a statement.  [35686]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 In Great Britain, we have contacted all the herds in which BSE cases were born and sought to identify animals which were exposed to the same feed as these cases. Where these animals have been sold off the farm of origin, we have tried to trace and locate them. Not surprisingly, given the age of the animals, we have found that about 156,000 animals have already been slaughtered, including those taken under the Over Thirty Months Scheme. But under the selective cull we have identified and slaughtered about 66,000 animals to date. A further 10,000 animals have been traced but not yet slaughtered, including a number for which the owner has the option to offer them but has not so far done so.
<P>

<a name="80319w17.html_para0">In addition, in Northern Ireland all the 1,461 animals to be taken under the cull have been slaughtered. As a result, the total to date for the United Kingdom is over 67,000. All these animals attract the special rates of compensation payable under this scheme.




<P>
<P><I>19 Mar 1998 : Column: 728</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80319w17.html_para1">It is now estimated that the total number slaughtered under the selective cull will be about 80,000-85,000. We are determined to finish the cull as quickly as we can and are continuing to treat it as a high priority. The last stages will focus on tracing animals which have moved from their natal herd. This is a time-consuming and difficult task, made more difficult by the lack of the computerised cattle tracing system which we are now developing. Progress on the cull will inevitably become slower, as increasingly often it is single animals that have to be tracked down. However we expect to complete the whole work by the autumn.
<P>

<a name="80319w17.html_para2">The selective cull has been an enormous task. Farmers themselves have made a substantial contribution. It has been an unwelcome and for many a distressing task. We are grateful for their co-operation and their recognition that this has been an essential step in fulfilling the Florence preconditions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w17.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 I have not visited the South West. However, my noble Friend Lord Donoughue, the Parliamentary Secretary, has specific responsibility for the MAFF South West region and he has visited Devon twice and Cornwall once since 1 May 1997.

 I and my colleagues receive many requests for meetings from individual, and groups of, hon. Members, about numerous issues, many of which cut across party boundaries. To seek to identify those requests on the basis of party allegiance would be misleading and would serve no useful purpose. However, I can confirm that I and my Ministerial team have held meetings with hon. Members from both the Government and the majority of Opposition parties, including the Conservative Party.

 The Department held no discussions with either organisation prior to the publication of the White Paper 'The Food Standards Agency: <i>A Force for Change</i>'.

<a name="80319w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The guidelines to which my hon. Friend refers puts the onus on Departments to maximise the value they secure from the assets they retain. The Executive Agencies of the Ministry undertake commercial activities where appropriate, and along with the rest of the Department will continue to seek new possible opportunities in the market. The operating, commercial and legal aspects will require careful consideration, along with the need to ensure that the independence of those undertaking regulatory functions is not compromised.

 I have today placed in the Library of the House copies of the first two consultation papers in a series inviting views on the options for modernising local government in Wales.
<P>

<a name="80319w18.html_para0">The first paper sets the broad policy in the context of Wales and the Assembly. The second, on local democracy and community leadership, makes proposals for developing new ways in which councils can listen to their local communities and involve them in their decisions for devising new ways of working, for strengthening councils' roles as community leaders and for modernising local electoral arrangements.
<P>

<a name="80319w18.html_para1">Later papers in the series will deal with best value, aspects of the local government finance system and a new ethical framework for local government.

The amount of lottery funding to be devoted to the celebrations in Wales will be announced soon: this will be supplemented by the sponsorship funding which NMEC intends to raise.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what steps his Department is taking to ensure that all rural communities in Wales obtain the benefit of high-quality telecommunication services including ISDN.  [34801]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80319w18.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The provision of telecommunications is a matter for the infrastructure companies. However, the wider provision of ISDN and digital services to rural communities should become a practical and cost-effective reality in the relatively near future through the use of radio fixed access technology and the roll-out of more comprehensive digital mobile networks. In addition, support from the European Regional Development Fund is being made available to assist the development of advanced services in parts of rural Wales. I will continue to press for Wales to benefit from high grade telecommunications links.

 My department does not gather centrally precise data on the number of seats and vacancies on non-departmental public bodies since many of them have some flexibility in the total number of members. Neither does it hold central data on whether members have retired, resigned or not been reappointed. Information on the public appointments which I make in Wales is collated and published quarterly. The December edition, a copy of which is in the library of the House, shows that 622 of those currently serving on public bodies were appointed before 1 May 1997 and the remaining 90 were appointed subsequently.

The large majority of such payments had been made to service personnel and members of the foreign service by the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The collection of arrears would have involved a considerable administrative cost and produced no additional Government revenue.

 <i>[holding answer 9 March 1998]:</i> It is not possible to use the data from the New Deal for Lone Parents to draw conclusions about the lone parents' exit rate from employment because the data sample is small, and provides only a snapshot of lone parents in short-term work. It is also not possible to draw comparisons between the exit rates of these lone parents and that of different groups in society based on this information. However, analysis and comparison of exit rates will be made when the New Deal for Lone Parents is evaluated by the independent Social and Community Planning Research, which will report in 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many cases of <i>(a)</i> fraud, <i>(b)</i> customer error and <i>(c)</i> departmental error have been identified by the Benefit Integrity Project; of those cases in which fraud is suspected how many have been referred to the Benefit Fraud Investigation Service; and what estimate her Department has made of the number in which there is a realistic prospect of a conviction.

 The Benefit Integrity Project aims to ensure that those in receipt of Disability Living Allowance are entitled to it. While it is right to check that 



<P>
<P><I>19 Mar 1998 : Column: 740</I><P>
people are receiving the correct amount of benefit, we are determined that those checks should be undertaken as sensitively as possible. Also, we should ensure all decisions taken as a result of the project are right. We have, therefore, acted to introduce an extra safeguard to improve the quality of, and confidence in, benefit decisions made by the Project.
