 The Electoral Commission informs me that it has considered two donations made to the Labour party by Catz club, a permissible donor under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Both donations arose from payments made by Catz club to attend Labour party events.

 European regulation 1107/2006 on the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air imposes obligations on airlines with respect to the services they provide, including an obligation to carry passengers' medical equipment free of charge.

The code was developed with input from the Civil Aviation Authority, Health and Safety Executive, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, the Devolved Administrations and aviation industry representatives. The code includes a section on oxygen which advises that air carriers may approve the carriage of small gaseous oxygen or air cylinders required for medical use, but notes that carriers will wish to ensure that these do not pose a risk to security. The code also recommends that portable oxygen concentrator devices should normally be allowed if battery powered. Where air carriers wish to supply medical oxygen to passengers on request, the code acknowledges that it would be possible to make a charge for this service to cover the provision of the oxygen.</p>

However, the Highways Agency carries out regular network condition surveys and timely safety inspections to ensure appropriate funds are allocated to maintain the network in a safe and serviceable condition. The Highways Agency's experience is that road defects due to extreme weather are likely to be safety related, which are treated promptly as part of the routine and winter maintenance programme.

 The Volunteer estate, which currently consists of over 2,000 sites, is a key element of the reserve forces, not only providing unit locations and training facilities but also retaining the important military footprint across the UK and the associated ability to connect with the nation. The review confirmed the importance of the Volunteer estate but noted that much of it was old, expensive, underused and located to serve the population centres of the nineteenth century as opposed to those of the twenty-first century. To ensure that the reserves have an estate that is modern, provides value for money and is correctly located to match changes in the demographics and national infrastructure, the Review recommended that the Ministry of Defence conduct a detailed requirements based study.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if he will commission the Social Exclusion Unit to review its work on the prison population and the cost of reoffending. [268819]</p>

 Since the publication of the Social Exclusion Unit&#146;s report &#147;Reducing re-offending by ex-prisoners&#148; in 2002 we have had significant success in reducing the reoffending by offenders released from custody. Between 2000 and 2006 there was a 22.9 per cent. fall in the frequency rate from 189.4 to 146.1 offences per 100 offenders. Additionally the rate of serious re-offending decreased by 11.1 per cent. over the same period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_611"><a name="90505w0016.htm_para0"><a name="0905061000385">The Government&#146;s social exclusion agenda is now led by the Social Exclusion Task Force (SETF), which has a strategic role in delivering better working across Departments on social exclusion issues. This includes the Socially Excluded Adults Public Service Agreement (PSA), which aims to increase the proportion of socially excluded adults in employment and accommodation. The Ministry of Justice is working closely with the SETF and other delivery departments to take forward this PSA and to tackle other factors linked to reducing reoffending. With this aim in mind a Reducing Reoffending Inter Ministerial Group (IMG) chaired by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Justice (Mr. Hanson) and my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills (Mr. Simon), and including Ministers from 13 Government Departments, is responsible for ensuring the alignment of departmental targets and PSAs to support crime reduction and the reduction of reoffending, and ensure delivery of agreed cross government plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_612"><a name="90505w0016.htm_para1"><a name="0905061000386">Work is also in hand to collect data associated with the costs of reoffending. The Ministry of Justice is currently developing a segmentation approach better to understand different offender groups, including their behaviour and criminal careers. This will include an assessment of which offenders are likely to cost society the most through their reoffending, and therefore where there are likely to be higher benefits to the public  <br>

through reducing further reoffending. Additionally, the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is undertaking a Specification, Benchmarking and Costing Programme, which aims to create a robust framework of costed service specifications thereby exposing choices for the business about what services should be delivered, to which offenders, at what level of quality. Both of these work-streams will help us to understand how to best target resources and intervene more effectively in the future to minimise the cost of reoffending.</p>

 No research on the effectiveness of tagging in Essex, or Castle Point in particular, has been carried out or is planned. The current research programme within the Ministry of Justice includes further research on the effectiveness of a wide range of interventions aimed at reducing re-offending including a feasibility study into reoffending by prisoners released on home detention curfew but not on electronic monitoring in general.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_613"><a name="90505w0016.htm_para2"><a name="0905061000389">Current evidence suggests that electronic monitoring has a neutral effect on re-offending.

Atherosclerosis of arteries in the neck and inside the skull can lead to strokes through thrombosis, embolism or sometimes haemorrhage. The table therefore includes a single category of deaths with mention of one or more ICD codes in the range that includes thrombotic, embolic and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular diseases. Pulmonary embolism and venous thrombosis have been combined, because when one is part of the sequence leading to death, the other nearly always is as well, whether it is mentioned on the certificate or not.</p>
</ul><a name="90505w0017.htm_brev38"><a name="0905061002418"><ul><p class="tabletext">Arteriosclerosis can affect any artery in the body, including those supplying the brain, the heart and all other vital organs. Whether the term used is arteriosclerosis, coronary or ischaemic heart disease, the medical condition is virtually the same - lack of oxygenated blood (ischaemia) to the heart muscle because of atherosclerosis (narrowing and stiffening) of the coronary arteries. This clinical category is represented by the ICD-10 code range 120-125. The whole range has been used to count deaths with any mention of atherosclerotic/ischaemic/coronary heart disease in the attached table.</p>
</ul><a name="90505w0017.htm_brev39"><a name="0905061002419"><ul><p class="tabletext">Type I and Type II diabetes are distinct clinical entities, which are easily identified and tabulated from death certificates using ICD codes. However, the type of diabetes is not always accurately recorded on the death certificate. Therefore, ICD codes have been used to tabulate death certificate mentions of diabetes specified as Type I or Type II, and also those where the type has not been specified.</p>
</ul><a name="90505w0017.htm_brev40"><a name="0905061002420"><ul><p class="tabletext">When interpreting the data in these tables, it is important to be aware that many deaths will have more than one of the requested conditions mentioned. Thrombosis of the coronary arteries in the heart is one of the steps in a heart attack; thrombosis of cerebral arteries may cause a stroke. In both these cases, atherosclerotic narrowing of the arteries will usually have led to the thrombosis. Therefore, many deaths will be represented in more than one of the causes listed.</p>

<i> Guide to Quality:</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220<br>
<i> Key Coefficient of Variation (CV) (%) Statistical Robustness</i><br>
* 0 = CV&lt;5 Estimates are considered precise<br>
** 5 = CV &lt;10 Estimates are considered reasonably precise<br>
*** 10 = CV &lt;20 Estimates are considered acceptable<br>
**** CV 20 Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes<br>
It should be noted that the above estimates exclude people In most types of communal establishment {e.g. hotels, boarding houses, hostels mobile home sites etc.)<br>

 Redundancy payments to NHS staff are made in line with the arrangements set out in section 16 of the Agenda for Change Terms and Conditions of Service Handbook. These came into force from 1 October 2006. At the same time changes were made to the National Health Service (Compensation for Premature Retirement) Regulations 2002 and the NHS Pension Scheme Regulations 1995. These were also negotiated in partnership with the NHS trade unions. Under these arrangements the standard redundancy terms are one months pay per year of reckonable service up to a maximum of 24 months pay. Members aged over the minimum pension age may choose to use their redundancy payment to pay for their retirement pension to be paid on redundancy without reduction. The previous redundancy arrangements involving enhancements of service of up to 10 years are being phased out and will cease to apply completely from October 2011.</p>

1. Primary diagnosis: The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
<sup>(1)</sup> Primary diagnosis codes used:<br>
160 Subarachnoid haemorrhage<br>
161 Intracerebral haemorrhage<br>
162 Other nontraumatic intracranial haemorrhage<br>
163 Cerebral infarction<br>
164 Stroke not specified as haemorrhage or infarction<br>
2. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
3. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in<br>
activity over time.<br>
4. Ungrossed data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in the data, i.e. the data are ungrossed.<br>
5. Discharges: A discharge episode is the last episode during a hospital stay (a spell), where the patient is discharged from the hospital (this includes transfer to another hospital).<br>
6. Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
7. Deaths: HES data cannot be used to determine the cause of death of a patient while in hospital. Deaths recorded on the HES database may be analysed by the main diagnosis for which the patient was being treated during their stay in hospital, which may not necessarily be the underlying cause of death. For example, a patient admitted for a hernia operation (with a primary diagnosis of hernia) may die from an unrelated a heart attack. The Office for National Statistics collects information on the cause of death, wherever it occurs, based on the death certificate and should be the source of data for analyses on cause of death.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> A death in hospital is coded as discharge method = 4 (died).<br>

Furthermore, benefits such as housing benefit and council tax benefit are in-work, as well as out-of-work benefits, and are specifically designed to ensure that people have sufficient encouragement to find and to remain in work, particularly when their income from that employment is low.</p>

1. Data are unrounded.<br>
2. The stocks of live unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br>
3. The median duration (in days) is calculated by ranking all the vacancies in order of ascending duration and taking the middle value. Half the vacancies will have a duration greater than the median, and half will have a duration less than the median. For most purposes, the median will give a more representative measure of the average duration a mean figure tends to be distorted by a small number of vacancies that have very long durations. The median duration is available using live unfilled vacancy figures only.<br>

 HSE has not identified a need to convene any special summits or conferences on the impact of the economic downturn. Workers and others should still expect to be properly protected against the very real risks presented by work activities. It is particularly important during the downturn and the eventual recovery that hard won standards of health and safety be maintained; standards for which the UK should rightly be proud. HSE will not back away from pursuing enforcement action where necessary against those who seek to avoid or abuse their legal responsibilities. HSE is not unsympathetic however to the effects of the downturn  <br>

 Where a new build property has been developed with grant for one of the HomeBuy schemes, a developer has to get consent to sell the property outside the affordable housing sector. For RSLs this requires an application to the TSA for a section 9 consent to dispose. This constitutes a relevant event and triggers grant recycling. For non-RSL investment partners (including private sector developers) where properties are retained by the developer on completion, the rentcharge requires that they seek consent from the HCA before selling. If such consent were given, under the rentcharge, grant would be repaid with a link to value, the calculation for which is set out in the rentcharge. Generally, where grant is paid to private sector developers, at build completion, ownership and management is transferred to an RSL, in which case the requirements outlined above in relation to RSLs would apply.</p>

 Communities and Local Government has commissioned a long-term evaluation of local area agreements (LAAs) and local strategic partnerships (LSPs).

 Homeowners Mortgage Support will enable eligible borrowers who suffer a temporary loss of income to cut their mortgage interest payments for up to two years to help them get back on track with their finances. Before entering the scheme, borrowers must receive independent money advice. We have estimated the increase in mortgage debt arising as part of the government scheme to be around &#163;200 million, based on assumptions explained in detail within the impact assessment published alongside the launch of the scheme.

 It is too early to make an assessment of the contribution that guidance and shared good practice from the New Deal for Communities (NDC) programme is making to the development of local sustainability plans in NDC areas.</p>

The Department has issued various guidance notes which relate to succession throughout the programme, most recently comprehensive succession guidance on 4 December 2008. This was launched at a conference attended by NDCs and local authorities, which was designed to assist them with preparing long term succession strategies to ensure that the benefits and improvements made to the areas can be sustained.</p>

The overall effect of the differences is that the FSA's statistics on possessions are slightly higher.</p>

Young people may also apply directly to training providers and employers.

 The continued use of top slice of the revenue support grant (RSG) for local authorities, as a means of funding the entry training of educational psychologists (EPs), was one of the options considered by a group of interested parties, including members drawn from the Local Government Association (LGA), EP professional interests and training providers. The LGA, however, decided that it no longer wished to use RSG top slice for that purpose. The effect of this recommendation was that the funds were redistributed to local authorities through the formula grant system administered by the Department for Communities and Local Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_750"><a name="90505w0033.htm_para12"><a name="0905069000040">As formula grant is an un-hypothecated block grant it is not possible to identify amounts within it provided for a particular purpose. The decision as to how much of its budget an individual local authority might wish to earmark to a particular activity, such as support for the training costs of trainee EPs, is a matter for each local authority and not something on which this Department collects information.</p>

To this end, the CWDC will continue to seek the views and engagement of all key stakeholders through its Educational Psychology National Forum, and to carefully examine options for future funding, while working with local authorities to secure their support for the current subscription scheme.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families what estimate he has made of the <i> (a)</i> overall cost of introducing the Early Years Foundation Stage and <i> (b)</i> cost of monitoring the 69 learning goals in (i) 2009-10 and (ii) 2010-11. [272554]</p>

 The EYFS Framework was launched on 13 March 2007 and became a statutory requirement from September 2008. The cost of developing, designing and printing the original Early Years Foundation Stage statutory guidance pack for providers was &#163;610,000. The cost of the information and communications activity surrounding the launch of the EYFS was &#163;245,000 which included communications to raise awareness, launch events, leaflets to parents, surveys exercises and media activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_755"><a name="90505w0034.htm_para0"><a name="0905069000547">The Department funded Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) training and development in schools through the School's Standard Fund. The level of funding provided was &#163;5 million in 2007-08 and &#163;7.9 million in 2008-09.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_756"><a name="90505w0034.htm_para1"><a name="0905069000548">EYFS training and development in the private, voluntary and independent sector is funded through the General Sure Start Grant (GSSG). We topped up this funding during 2007-08 with an additional &#163;7 million exclusively for the level 3 certificate in EYFS. At the same time we enabled greater flexibility of the Transformation Fund, which is designed to raise the level of professional qualifications in the early years workforce, to enable further EYFS training for the private, voluntary and independent sector. Because of the way we fund local authorities through these broad grants it is not possible to provide a breakdown of how much was spent specifically on EYFS training per se.</p>

This funding also includes the range of activities and support that QCA provides to local authorities, including accredited training and to make sure practitioner judgements are moderated and that the data is secure. We also funded QCA a total of &#163;290,000 in 2008-09 to process and manage applications for exemptions from the EYFS learning and development requirements.</p>

 Ministers and officials have received a number of representations about the problems training providers have experienced in finding work placements for apprentices to enable them to complete their apprenticeship framework. The construction industry is one sector where problems have been most acute and we have worked with employers, trade unions and sectoral bodies through the construction taskforce to identify measures to help providers, employers and apprentices. Most notably we have, together with ConstructionSkills established a matching service to help those apprentices in the construction sector at risk of redundancy to find alternative employment and to complete their apprenticeship. We are currently working with the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to explore how this approach might be extended to other sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_764"><a name="90505w0034.htm_para9"><a name="09050612000028">We are also taking steps to encourage employers to continue to support training and apprenticeships through the &#163;175 billion a year Government spend on procuring goods and services. Government have made a commitment to routinely consider skills issues and promote training opportunities through their procurements. In construction, Departments and Agencies have made a specific commitment to consider the case for including a requirement that a proportion of the project workforce is apprentices when letting new construction contracts. We are looking to build on this approach in other major areas of spend, including IT.</p>

Friend the Prime Minister in January for an additional 35,000 apprenticeship training places will help fund new provision in both the public and private sectors, and will extend the opportunities available to people facing redundancy. We have also developed some flexibilities to help apprentices who have been made redundant. Redundant apprentices can now continue their training with a provider for up to six months while they and their provider look for an alternative employer. The National Apprenticeship Service has provided revised guidance about access to EMA and hardship funds which is already available. If a redundant apprentice is close to completing their framework and has evidence of the relevant employer experience, we expect providers, Sector Skills Councils and awarding bodies to be considerate to their individual circumstances in order to support them in completing their course of study.</p>

 The number of learners was previously provided alongside starts and completions. This can present a misleading picture because the figures cannot be immediately related to each other in the same year. This is particularly true where the number of starts changes significantly because there is a time lag before completions increase, as seen in Train to Gain over the last few years. Therefore the Statistical First Release (SFR), DS/SFR1, published in December 2008, focuses on the most instructive and transparent measures of starts and completion rates. Starts provide insight on growth in the programme and completion rates demonstrate the quality of delivery in the system.</p>
