 The Legal Services Commission (LSC) were only able to identify six cases in the answer of 22 March 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 793&#150;94W. This does not include possible judicial reviews because the LSC does not record figures for judicial review by way of type of application.

Different Departments record their information in different ways, therefore the Government have been unable to match the records for all of these six cases without incurring disproportionate costs.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many requests the UK Government have made to non-EU countries requesting that child pornography websites be removed from the internet; and on what legal basis.  [203677]</p>








<p><a name="50406w12.html_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 No such requests have been made by the Home Office. Where investigation by a UK law enforcement agency identifies a child abuse image being hosted in another jurisdiction, it will seek to notify the appropriate authority in that country of its presence so that they can seek its removal and take further appropriate action. A similar process is also undertaken by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF). The IWF was 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Apr 2005 : Column 1500W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
formed in 1996 following an agreement between the Government, police and the internet service provider industry that a partnership approach was needed to tackle the distribution of child abuse images online. The IWF operate the only authorised hotline in the UK for the public to report their inadvertent exposure to illegal content on the internet. The hotline provides internet users with a means of reporting potentially illegal content that are located on websites that specifically contain images of child abuse (hosted anywhere in the world), criminally obscene content (hosted in the UK) or criminally racist content (hosted in the UK). As a result of these arrangements less than one per cent. of potentially illegal content is apparently hosted in the UK. Figures for the number of instances on which such requests have been made to other jurisdictions by UK law enforcement are not collated. The legal basis for removing such sites will be dependent on the legislation in place in the particular country in question.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50406w12.html_para0">
More generally, the Government continues to talk with our international partners about further measures which can be taken to combat the abuse of children and remove such images wherever they are hosted. The G8 countries have adopted a strategy on protecting children from sexual exploitation on the internet. As part of this strategy the UK is leading the development of an international child image database, housed at Interpol which aims to act as a global repository of images of child abuse contributing to the identification of victims and offenders and analysis of images.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50406w12.html_para1">
The UK also leads in promoting co-operation among law enforcement agencies through the creation, by the National Crime Squad in 2003, of the Virtual Global Taskforce (VGT). This is an international alliance of law enforcement agencies delivering innovative crime prevention and crime reduction initiatives to deter and prevent individuals from committing child abuse on-line offences. The VGT is engaged in a number of initiatives which compliment and support the work of existing law enforcement agencies. These include Operation Pin, a website purporting to host child abuse images but which in fact directs those searching for child abuse images to a law enforcement page. The VGT have also developed an international website (www.virtualglobaltaskforce.com) which was launched on 26 January 2005. This acts as a gateway to a wide range of information on how to use the internet safely and links to a range of support agencies around the world that advise and support parents, children and victims of abuse.

It is always a matter of concern when any prisoner who is placed on Home Detention Curfew commits an offence.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received concerning the possible arrival in the UK of paedophiles from overseas who have not been convicted of any offences under UK jurisdiction; and what measures he is able to take to protect the public in such cases.  [224201]</p>








<p><a name="50406w13.html_spnew2"><b> Paul Goggins </b> 
<i>[holding answer 4 April 2005]:</i> Where the Foreign and Commonwealth Office receives information that an individual with a conviction for a serious sexual offence will be travelling to the UK then the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) will be informed. NCIS may also receive information directly from the foreign authorities through Interpol. Where it is judged to be appropriate, NCIS will then liaise both with appropriate police forces and ports of entry in order to arrange a meeting with the offender on his arrival.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50406w13.html_para3">
The notification order, introduced by the Sexual Offences Act 2003, is a civil preventative order designed to ensure that offenders who receive convictions or cautions for sexual offences overseas can be made to sign on the sex offenders register while they are in the UK. Application for such an order is made by the police to a magistrates court. If an offender fails to comply with the registration requirements then he commits a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of five years&#039; imprisonment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50406w13.html_para4">
The 2003 Act also provides for sexual offences prevention orders (SOPO). SOPOs are made on application from the police to a magistrates court and impose prohibitions on a sexual or violent offender who poses a risk of serious sexual harm. They also require the offender to sign on the sex offenders register. When making a SOPO courts set such prohibitions as they consider necessary. For example, an offender could be prohibited from being alone with children under 16 and/or from being within a certain distance of a school, a playground and/or a swimming baths etc. If an offender breaches a SOPO then he commits a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of five years&#039; imprisonment.

 Studies have been carried out into the effect of the presence of roadside advertisements and other potential distractions to road accidents. It is, however, difficult to derive a direct causal relationship because accidents are often the result of several factors. Studies have also monitored the duration of drivers&#039; eye movements from the road to roadside distractions, including signs, which provides an indicator of accident potential. I am not aware of any specific consultation with drivers that has been undertaken as part of the research. I do not propose to commission a study on the potential for distraction of temporary wheeled billboards placed next to motorways. It is for local planning authorities to use their enforcement powers to remove unlawfully displayed advertisements.

<p><a name="50406w18.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 As reiterated in our White Paper, &#039;Skills: Getting on in business, getting on at work&#039;, published on the 22 March, we remain strongly committed to ensuring the availability of a wide range of learning opportunities for adults, including for personal and community development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50406w18.html_para0">
The DfES and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) will agree each year an overall indicative budget for the funds that should be used to support education and training programmes which do not lead to qualifications. Nationally, this will be based on the broad proportion of LSC funds currently spent on this type of learning. But within it, the range of provision needs to keep evolving so that it best meets changing learner and community needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50406w18.html_para1">
We will therefore continue to provide significant non-vocational provision to meet the needs of a wide range of learners. However it is learning providers and local LSCs who are best placed to assess the learning needs of their communities and to prioritise funding accordingly.

Policy proposals pass through an option appraisal,&#151;the regulatory impact assessment&#151;looking at the net costs and benefits of each option proposed.

In many cases, the benefits of policy in one area&#151;for example an improvement of people&#039;s environmental quality&#151;are traded off against smaller costs in others, for example costs to consumers to particular service.

Copies of the Raptor Working Group report are available from the Library of the House.

Birds of prey are usually the top predators in their food chains. As with other predatory species, populations of birds of prey are normally heavily influenced by their prey populations rather than the other way around. The available evidence suggests that recovering populations of birds of prey are not responsible for recent declines in some songbirds and that other factors related to habitat change and the intensification of farming are mainly to blame.

<p><a name="50406w20.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Environment Agency is the statutory body with a duty to manage water resources in England and Wales and it advises the Secretary of State accordingly. The agency&#039;s current assessment is that even with average rainfall over the next six weeks there may still be some localised water supply problems in southern England this summer. Below average rainfall is likely to result in more serious problems for water companies in the South and this may extend towards the South-West and into the Midlands and East Anglia. Water companies may need to activate the measures in their drought plans, such as hosepipe bans, if the rainfall deficit does not diminish.

<p><a name="50406w20.html_wqn7"><b> Sue Doughty: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent discussions she has had with water companies on the adequacy of future supplies; and if she will make a statement.  [224062]</p>








<p><a name="50406w20.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Environment Agency is the statutory body which has a duty to secure the proper and efficient use of water resources in England and Wales and it advises the Secretary of State accordingly. Each water company in England and Wales produces a water resources plan setting out how it proposes to maintain the supply and demand balance of water for the next 25 years. The plans are assessed by the Environment Agency and reviewed annually.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50406w20.html_para6">
The plans were updated as part of the recent periodic review of water company prices. The agency reported to Ministers, in July 2004, on these plans in &quot;Maintaining Water Supply&quot;, which is available on its website.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50406w20.html_para7">
The agency concluded that all water companies should be able to meet their customers&#039; needs in the short term, although some companies need to work quickly to address security of supply issues. It believes that greater attention to demand management measures could offset the need, identified by some companies, for new or enlarged reservoirs that are expensive and potentially damaging to the environment.

 Travel by Ministers makes clear that special flights may be authorised when a scheduled service is not available, or when it is essential to travel by air, but the requirements of official or parliamentary business or security considerations or urgency preclude the journey being made by a scheduled service. In respect of overseas travel by Ministers, since 1999 the Government have published an annual list of all visits overseas undertaken by Cabinet Ministers costing &#163;500 or more during each financial year. The list published in 1999 covers the period 2 May 1997 to 31 March 1999. Where RAF/Private Charter aircraft are used this is shown in the list. The Government have also published on an annual basis the cost of all Ministers&#039; visits overseas. Copies of the lists are available in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="50406w28.html_para0">
A recent study of survival and disability in children born at 25 or fewer completed weeks of gestation confirms the association with mortality, and with morbidity and disability for survivors, which may persist into later life. It also notes that the greater introduction of antenatal treatment with corticosteroids and surfactants are important determinants of the increased survival of extremely preterm infants and observes that this may have some bearing on long-term outcomes. The study, entitled EPICure, is available on the following website: http://www.nottinaham.ac.uk/human-development/EPICure/.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what his policy is on whether patients who are being treated privately for a hospital operation may receive public funding to meet part of the cost.  [224765]</p>








<p><a name="50406w28.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 There is no statutory power under existing legislation, which would enable patients to receive public funding, in whole or in part, for private treatment in such circumstances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50406w28.html_para1">
Current legislation makes provision for a national health service which is delivered free of charge, except where there is a statutory basis for making a charge. Any other charge for a NHS service would be unlawful. We have no plans to introduce legislation to change this, and remain committed to a free NHS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50406w28.html_para2">
There is no statutory provision for charging United Kingdom residents for their hospital operations funded by the NHS, whether they are carried out by an NHS organisation or through the independent sector. Nor is there any statutory provision for such services to be part funded in this way by the NHS. If they are funded by the NHS they must be free of charge to the patient and funded in full.
