<p><a name="50301w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office whether years spent in the Civil Service Pension Scheme up to 2013 will continue to attract pension rights based on the final salary of the employee on their retirement at age 65 years following the proposed changes to the scheme; and if he will make a statement.  [218185]</p>




<p><a name="50301w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 The Cabinet Office&#039;s consultation document, &quot;Building a sustainable future&quot;, proposes that pension rights earned before April 2013 by staff in post on 5 April 2006 will continue to be calculated by reference to a pension age of 60 and their final salary whenever they choose to retire or leave service.
</p>





<p><a name="50301w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what assessment he has made of the effect that the changes to the Civil Service Pension Scheme retirement age will have on serving prison officers who may become unable to carry out their prison work beyond the age of 60 years due to physical incapacity; and if he will make a statement.  [218186]</p>




<p><a name="50301w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 The Cabinet Office&#039;s consultation document, &quot;Building a sustainable future&quot;, proposes that the new pension arrangements will, as now, include provisions for members who have to retire before pension age because of ill health or physical incapacity. The document also recognises that the physically-demanding nature of some members&#039; jobs may not be compatible with a pension age of 65. Officials are discussing with employers of civil servants in physically-demanding occupations (including the prison services) the most appropriate way to handle these groups.
</p>





<p><a name="50301w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what estimate he has made of the number of people who transferred pension rights from the armed forces to the Prison Service who will work for a number of years at the end of their careers without building up any further pension rights; and if he will make a statement.  [218188]</p>




<p><a name="50301w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 No assessment of the number of people who transferred pension rights from the armed forces to the Prison Service has been made. The Cabinet Office&#039;s consultation document, &quot;Building a sustainable future&quot;, addresses the issue of restrictions on benefits and asks whether we should allow members to build up their pension without limiting them to 40 years&#039; service.

 To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office how many serving <i>(a)</i> prison officers and <i>(b)</i> other civil servants will be affected by the changes to the Civil Service Pension Scheme.  [218189]</p>






<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Mar 2005 : Column 1020W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="50301w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 The Cabinet Office&#039;s consultation document, &quot;Building a sustainable future&quot;, proposes that the main changes to the Civil Service Pension arrangements should apply to existing staff from 1 April 2013, but that some changes might apply before then. As at 31 March 2004, there were 617,000 members of the scheme, of which some 27,000 are prison officers. The Scheme Actuary estimates that, of those members who are likely to be in post on 5 April 2006, 420,000 will still be in service in April 2013.

Travel by Ministers makes clear that special flights may be authorised when a scheduled service is not available, or when it is essential to travel by air, but the requirements of official or parliamentary business or security considerations or urgency preclude the journey being made by a scheduled service.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) if she will make a statement on the priority scoring system for flood defence funding;  [217064]
</p>



<p>(2) what criteria are used to score flood defence projects to determine whether they are eligible for funding; and what criteria must be met for such funding to be received.  [217068]</p>




<p><a name="50301w05.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Despite large increases in Government funding&#151;up from &#163;312 million in 1997&#150;98 to &#163;570 million in 2005&#150;06&#151;there is still not enough to fund all worthwhile proposals from the flood and coastal defence operating authorities (the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards). Defra therefore operates an objective and published priority scoring system which is intended to direct our finite funds to best effect nationally, to maximise the benefit obtained from the programme as a whole.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w05.html_para4">
The current scoring system was introduced in 2003 after extensive consultation following a pilot introduced in 1997. In summary, proposed projects are scored on three elements&#151;their estimated economic benefits, the number of people they are likely to protect and protection and enhancement of environmental and/or heritage assets. All three are compared to cost so that projects are treated fairly regardless of size. The higher the score, the higher the priority.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w05.html_para5">
In order to be eligible for funding from Defra, projects must achieve Defra&#039;s published threshold score for the year in which they start. The threshold scores were last revised in November 2004 to take account of changes in operating authorities&#039; investment plans. Because of an increased demand for grant nationally, the thresholds had to rise and are now 19 for projects to start in 2005&#150;06 or 2006&#150;07 and 15 in 2007 08.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w05.html_para6">
The scoring system has no effect on the overall sum available for grant aid. It does not attempt to allocate funding to projects in an absolute sense but simply to rank proposals in a relative priority order. Defra is then able to allocate its funding to projects in priority order. The actual threshold score which a project must achieve 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Mar 2005 : Column 1038W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
will depend on available funding compared to need nationally. The thresholds are set by analysis of forward plans provided to Defra by operating authorities each year&#151;proposals for funding are compared with available funds and I set the lowest threshold that can be afforded for the following financial year, together with indicative estimates of the likely thresholds for the following two years. The latter are reviewed a year later in the light of updated authorities&#039; plans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w05.html_para7">
The threshold is the same for all projects and is applied broadly equally to all operating authorities. There can be exceptions such as for the very few projects required to protect environmental sites of international importance under the Habitats Directive but the amount of funding spent on these projects is low.

<p><a name="50301w05.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 All watercourses effectively fall into one of two categories: <i>(a)</i> main rivers which are the responsibility of the Environment Agency and <i>(b)</i> ordinary watercourses which are the responsibility of local authorities or, where they exist, internal drainage boards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w05.html_para8">
Recognising that some ordinary watercourses create significant flood risk, in March 2003 the Government announced that all the so called &quot;critical&quot; ordinary watercourses (COWs) would become the responsibility of the Environment Agency (EA).

</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w05.html_para9">
Once a COW has been transferred, it becomes a main river and the EA assumes full responsibility for all associated flood risk management and for dealing with any flooding from it.

 Defra has overall policy responsibility for flood and coastal erosion risk in England. We fund most of the Environment Agency (EA)&#039;s flood risk activities and provide grant aid on a project by project basis to the other flood and coastal defence operating authorities (local authorities and internal drainage boards) to support their investment in improvement works. Defra does not build defences, nor direct the authorities on what specific projects to do. The works programme to manage risk is driven by the operating authorities.

 Defra&#039;s priority is to maximise the protection of people and assets in relation to the funding available. While there is no bias in the priority score system against rural projects, it is however true that projects are less likely to go ahead in sparsely populated areas as these will tend to score less highly than projects which protect larger numbers of people or higher asset values for a given cost. Most of the components making up the priority score of a given project are compared to cost so the crucial measurement is on benefits per unit cost and not on the absolute benefits of proposals. This ensures smaller projects are considered on an equal footing to larger ones.

<a name="50301w07.html_para10">
We do not classify projects by urban or rural location and often the distinction will not be clear. We could not seek to gather this information without incurring disproportionate cost.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what investigations there have been into the loss of decommissioned nuclear weapons and related material and equipment following South Africa&#039;s abandonment of its nuclear weapons programme; and if he will make a statement.  [217710]</p>




<p><a name="50301w10.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 Upon accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1991, South Africa submitted an initial report providing a full inventory of its nuclear materials. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) conducted a number of inspections to verify the completeness of South Africa&#039;s report. They concluded that there was no evidence that the inventory was incomplete.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w10.html_para3">
In 1993, however, the then South African Prime Minister F. W. de Klerk revealed that South Africa had been pursuing a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s and 1980s, but that this programme had been abandoned in 1989. A team of IAEA technical experts travelled to South Africa in April 1993 to assess whether South Africa had indeed abandoned its programme. They found nothing that was inconsistent with South Africa&#039;s declaration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w10.html_para4">
Subsequently, under South Africa&#039;s nuclear safeguards agreement with the IAEA, inspectors have carried out regular checks to ensure that there has been no diversion of nuclear materials. They have not reported any discrepancy to the IAEA Board of Governors. A further reassurance is provided by the adoption by South Africa of an Additional Protocol to its safeguards agreement.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent assessment his Department has made of the political situation in Togo; and if he will make a statement.  [217988]</p>




<p><a name="50301w10.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 We are concerned about the events following the death of President Gnassingbe Eyadema. We have urged the Togolese authorities to hold early credible and democratic presidential elections.

<p><a name="50301w10.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. George Osborne: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how many bodies of British victims of the tsunami have been <i>(a)</i> identified and <i>(b)</i> repatriated.  [216224]</p>




<p><a name="50301w10.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 As at 16.00 on 23 February, we have confirmed that 65 British nationals died in the tsunami. Of those, 35 have been repatriated to the UK. The discrepancy is explained by the fact that some bodies await repatriation, others were either buried or cremated locally, and some were resident in third countries, to where they have been repatriated.
</p>





<p><a name="50301w10.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. George Osborne: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the time taken to identify the British victims of the tsunami; and what assessment he has made of the merits of using fingerprinting instead of DNA testing.  [216225]</p>




<p><a name="50301w10.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 We are aware that delays in identifying victims adds to the distress of the families concerned. But there can be no short cuts in the Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) process and, even when bodies are found, the process of formally identifying them can be difficult and lengthy. More details of the process can be found on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website, www.fco.gov.uk/tsunami.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w10.html_para5">
The police have considered the merits of the three main ways in which bodies may be identified. Dental records, fingerprints and DNA may each be of value, either separately or in conjunction. The approach is decided on a case-by-case basis, because the precise value of each method depends on factors such as the condition of the body and the availability of ante mortem data. Most matches so far have been based on dental records.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the outcome of the Turkish Cypriot elections on 20th February.  [217721]</p>




<p><a name="50301w10.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 We believe this outcome reflects the Turkish Cypriot Community&#039;s on-going desire to work for a comprehensive settlement on the basis of the Annan Plan and to realise in full the benefits of EU membership.

2. Private spending is calculated in a similar way as for ONS Health Accounts. From 2003&#150;04, it is assumed to carry forward as a constant share of GDP.<br>

3. The EU figure is a simple average of the then 15 EU countries; it is not weighted by country population.<br>

The estimated &#163;30 million cost of increasing the limit to &#163;600 is based upon assumptions about the additional number of TESPs that would be opened and additional contributions made to take advantage of the higher limit.

 No date, no single route has been served by both a military and a civilian plane on DFID&#039;s behalf. Calculations of costs per task are based upon the flying time between the two locations. There are other variables such as airport handling charges but these would be common to both military and civilian charter or repositioning costs. In comparing costs of military and civilian aircraft carrying out similar tasks with the same payload, the best comparator is the rate charged per flying hour. For the C-17, tasked by DFID to transport relief items to countries affected by the Indian Ocean disaster, the MOD quoted an hourly flying rate of approximately &#163;1,975.

This programme is linked to a 50 place neighbourhood nursery (Treetops Nursery) in Dursley with additional outreach and family support being delivered from Rednock Community Centre in Dursley and from GL11 Community Project in Cam. Sure Start has contributed &#163;256,000 in capital funding towards the nursery&#039;s integrated education and care facilities.

Notes:<br>

1. A finished admission episode is the &quot;first&quot; period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

3. University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust was formed on 1 April 2000 following the merger of Leicester General Hospital NHS Trust, Leicester Royal Infirmary NHS Trust, and Glenfield Hospital NHS Trust. Leicestershire Mental Health Service NHS Trust was established in 1993 and dissolved in April 1999. Fosse Health, Leicestershire Community NHS Trust was established in1994 and dissolved in April 1999. Leicestershire and Rutland Healthcare NHS Trust was established 1 January 1999. The new trust replaced the Leicestershire Mental Health Service and the Fosse Health, Leicestershire Community NHS Trusts. Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust was established in April 2002. The new trust came into being when it changed its name from Leicestershire and Rutland Healthcare NHS Trust to Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust.<br>

The GAC plays a unique role in the UK in displaying works of art from its holdings in major Government buildings at home and abroad, in order to promote British art, culture and history. Due to the nature of Government buildings and current security issues, it is not possible for the general public to gain open access to most of the works on a daily basis. However, the buildings in which works of art are displayed&#151;in reception rooms, entrance halls, Ministers&#039; and Ambassadors&#039; offices&#151;all receive many thousands of visitors per year, all over the world.

Members of the public may consult the GAC to see individual works of art. Additionally, many Government buildings in the UK (including the GAC&#039;s own premises) are accessible during the annual Open House Weekend. The GAC also gives regular tours throughout the year round its premises, lends works of art to public exhibitions, and operates a website www.gac.culture.gov.uk listing and illustrating all its original works of art. A growing number of historical and modern prints are being added to this.

However, since April 2003 offenders charged in certain areas with certain offences known to be commonly committed by drug users have been tested for opiates (heroin) and cocaine/crack as part of the Drug Interventions Programme. The following table summarises the total number of offenders tested, and the numbers and percentages of those testing positive for opiates or crack/cocaine between January and December 2004 in the 47 DATs that operate drug testing on charge as part of the Drug Interventions Programme. This gives some indication of the proportion of property crime that may be linked to drug use, although it should be noted that not all crime by drug users is necessarily committed to support their habit.

 The total amount of money recovered in the United Kingdom under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 since the Act came into force on 24 February 2003 is &#163;25,484,192. The Proceeds of Crime Act already allows for the seizure of cash and the freezing of all property and assets that are derived from crime. The value of property and assets are then recovered following their sale. The Act contains significant new powers to investigate and recover criminal assets. It established a dedicated Assets Recovery Agency with new powers of civil recovery and taxation of criminal assets. We are determined that the powers in the Act will be used to the full to recover the proceeds of crime. There are no plans at this time to introduce further powers on recovering the proceeds of crime.

<i>[holding answer 3 February 2005]:</i> Under the Firearms Act 1982, imitation firearms that are readily convertible to fire live ammunition are treated in law as real, working guns and are therefore prohibited or require a firearms certificate. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced a new mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment for the unlawful sale or possession of prohibited firearms. There are otherwise no restrictions on the sale of imitation firearms, some of which are capable of discharging low powered projectiles and some not. Any imitation sold as a toy must not have an energy level in excess of 0.08 joule.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w25.html_para3">
The Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 introduced a new offence of carrying an imitation firearm in public without reasonable excuse. The police believe that this is a significant contribution to dealing with problems of misuse as they can now challenge anyone seen in public with an imitation and can arrest them if they do not have a reasonable explanation. It is also an offence to possess an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of unlawful violence.

 The courts set fines to reflect the seriousness of the offence while taking into account the means of the offender. Therefore the fines imposed for driving while uninsured are often lower than &#163;200, the level of the fixed penalty notice. This may be addressed in part by the Management of Offenders and Sentencing Bill. It proposes a simple statutory methodology for calculating the amount of the fine. In addition courts will have the discretion to adjust the amount of the fine up to the level of the fixed penalty that otherwise would have been imposed.

 Schedule 12 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 gives designated organisations (the yes and no campaigns) the right to send a referendum address post free. The referendum addresses must be sent by the universal postal provider.

To ensure that the Royal Mail had complied with the contract and delivered the referendum addresses to a high standard, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister also had a small quality control contract with NOP. NOP contacted a sample of the electorate by telephone to ask whether they had received leaflets from the yes or no campaigns. To do this effectively, NOP had to describe the leaflets.

 The Government&#039;s role is to provide a supportive regulatory/fiscal framework for the development of renewable energy sources. The Government&#039;s key mechanism for supporting the development of renewables is the Renewables Obligation. The obligation is a market-based mechanism which is technology neutral. In addition to the obligation the Government are spending over &#163;500 million between 2002 and 2008 on R and D and funding for capital grants for emerging renewable and low carbon technologies.

Hydrogen is an energy carrier (like electricity), not a renewable energy source. It can be produced via a number of different routes, including electrolysis using fossil, renewable or nuclear electricity, or by chemical reactions using biomass, natural gas or coal.

<p><a name="50301w33.html_wqn3"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) how many personnel are employed as part of the Civil Contingency Reaction Forces;  [217811]
</p>



<p>(2) how many personnel are employed as part of the Civil Contingency Reaction Forces in a state of permanent readiness;  [217810]

</p>



<p>(4) how many of the reservists who make up the operational capability of Civil Contingency Reaction Forces are on active duty overseas.  [217733]</p>




<p><a name="50301w33.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The 14 Civil Contingency Reaction Forces (CCRFs) are based on the 14 TA infantry battalions spread across the country and, should the need arise, would be manned by members of the Volunteer Reserve Forces, albeit mainly the Territorial Army. A list of qualified volunteers up to a maximum of 500 per CCRF is maintained by each CCRF Headquarters in order that they can respond at short notice to a crisis. But CCRF volunteers are not permanently employed by the armed forces, nor are they held at permanent readiness.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w33.html_para0">
It is, however, a fundamental principle that volunteers for the CCRFs agree to be mobilised at relatively short notice. We expect to be able to deploy a CCRF within 24 hours should the need arise, although this may be tempered by the need for additional training depending upon the nature of the crisis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w33.html_para1">
The list of CCRF volunteers is dynamic and reflects the availability of individuals as their personal circumstances change. When an individual becomes unavailable, whether through operational deployment or any other change in circumstances, they cease to be a member of the CCRF and another volunteer is brought forward to replace them. In this way the CCRF capability is maintained.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w33.html_para2">
Volunteers receive five days training per year, in addition to their normal reservist training. Details of individual training activities are not held centrally, but in general the additional days are used to ensure familiarisation and integration with the local authorities and the emergency services and to ensure that the procedures for mobilisation are well practised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w33.html_para3">
It should be borne in mind that the CCRFs are neither an automatic nor the only option to respond to a request from the civil authorities for military assistance. Regional commanders will identify the best choice from all available units, regular or reserve, depending on the nature and urgency of the request.

<p><a name="50301w33.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b>

 The Bowman PRC325 High Frequency patrol radio and the AN/PRC117F radio are both variants of the Falcon II range of radios.

[215950]</p>




<p><a name="50301w33.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Recruitment of officer cadets under the Future Infantry Structure will be by regiment rather than by battalion.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) which naval bases have a policy of mandatory secondary monitoring; which do not; and if he will make a statement;  [218441]
</p>



<p>(2) what the reasons were for implementing mandatory secondary monitoring at <i>(a)</i> HM Rosyth and <i>(b)</i> HM Base Devonport;  [218442]
</p>



<p>(3) what recent research he has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated on the effect on levels of safety of introducing mandatory secondary monitoring at HM Base Clyde Faslane;  [218443]
</p>



<p>(4) whether he plans to introduce mandatory secondary monitoring for radiation at HM naval base Clyde Faslane; what modifications of existing facilities would be required to allow such monitoring; and if he will make a statement.  [218444]</p>




<p><a name="50301w34.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 At HM Naval Base Clyde (Faslane) staff working in the Active Processing Facility and the Nuclear Repair Workshop are required to use routine secondary monitoring. Staff exiting submarine reactor compartments are monitored by suitably qualified and experienced workers, using appropriate hand held instrumentation, capable of detecting very low levels of radioactive contamination. This monitoring is precautionary as work procedures and protective clothing are designed to minimise the chance of becoming contaminated. Secondary monitoring (using a walk-through monitor), which takes place after the worker has completed primary monitoring and removed 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Mar 2005 : Column 1146W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
his protective clothing, is mandatory when contamination is suspected or found. All nuclear safety matters relating to the Royal Dockyards at Rosyth and Devonport are a responsibility of the owners of the Dockyards: Babcock Rosyth Defence Limited and Devonport Management Limited respectively. However, they must comply with nuclear safety regulations including the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w34.html_para2">
There are no plans to make secondary monitoring mandatory at the Clyde Naval Base as current arrangements within existing facilities comply with legal requirements and have been assessed by the Health and Safety Executive&#039;s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (HSE/NII). A recent review of the options for enhancing monitoring arrangements for new facilities has been completed and will inform future worker monitoring protocols. There are no further plans, at this stage, to commission research into whether levels of safety would be increased by introducing mandatory secondary monitoring.

<p><a name="50301w34.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Hancock: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to the answer of 3 February 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1017W, on Swan Hunter, what the clerical error was; what investigation he has conducted into the reasons for the error; and if he will make a statement.  [217910]</p>




<p><a name="50301w34.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I have looked into the reasons behind this error and Ministry of Defence officials have found that:
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w34.html_para3">
Shortly after the parliamentary question was received by the Department on 24 November 2004, officials drafted a reply. That draft reply accurately reflected the situation at that time. This was forwarded to the Department&#039;s parliamentary branch on 25 November 2004. As the question concerned a defence procurement issue, the reply was passed to my hon. Friend the Minister for Defence Procurement (Lord Bach)&#039;s Private Office for clearance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w34.html_para4">
My hon. Friend the noble Lord was on official duties overseas between the periods 29 November to 5 December, 6 to 9 December, and 9 to 10 December. Some time between the period 5 to 21 December, my hon. Friend the noble Lord cleared the draft reply. Our records do not show the exact date this happened, but this was more likely to have been towards the end of this period.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w34.html_para5">
On 9 December, the Department concluded its negotiations with Swan Hunter regarding the Landing Ship Dock (Auxiliary) project and a contract amendment was signed. At this point, the reply which had been drafted no longer accurately reflected the situation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w34.html_para6">
By the time the reply was signed out of Minister (DP)&#039;s Private Office on 21 December, the answer was incorrect. This was not identified by the Private Office.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w34.html_para7">
I approved the reply at some point between 21 December 2004 and 7 January 2005, on the assumption that the reply and supporting advice provided was accurate. The reply was returned to the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Mar 2005 : Column 1147W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Table Office on 7 January 2005. The reply appeared in the &quot;Official Report&quot; on the next sitting day, 10 January 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w34.html_para8">
This was a regrettable incident resulting from a genuine error. There was no intention by Ministers deliberately to mislead the House. My hon. Friend the noble Lord has put in place measures to improve the handling procedures in his Private Office which should help prevent such an incident happening again.

<p><a name="50301w34.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 We made clear in the 2003 Defence White Paper (paragraph 3.11) that decisions on the UK&#039;s future nuclear deterrent capability were not needed during this Parliament but were likely to be needed during the next Parliament. Cost factors will of course be taken fully into account along with all other relevant issues.
