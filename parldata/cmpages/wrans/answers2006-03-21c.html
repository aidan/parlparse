 The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that of the 46 million women who have an abortion each year, 19 million are estimated to be unsafe. That is, carried out by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment lacking the minimum medical standards. They do so because they do not wish to go through with an un-intended or unwanted pregnancy. One important reason for this is that many millions of women still lack access to reproductive health and family planning services, and thus have no choice about when and if to have children.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60321w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 Following the tsunami, the Government allocated &#163;75 million to meet the immediate needs of those affected. To date &#163;68 million has been disbursed through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross Movement and non-governmental organisations such as Oxfam, Save the Children Fund, CAFOD and Help the Aged. The balance will be allocated for disaster risk reduction and early warning initiatives across the affected region. We are currently looking at proposals for programmes to utilise these funds.

<a name="stpa_4">The complexity of the response and the changing situation on the ground meant that some organisations have not been able to spend funds according to their original timetable.

Of the &#163;60 million, &#163;13.5 million has already been allocated. Some of the funds have been put into a multi-donor trust fund which provides grants for a range of reconstruction activities including housing, infrastructure, and land titling projects. Additional funds have been used to support the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)&#039;s livelihoods programme and to support a range of smaller technical assistance packages. Of this, &#163;13.5 million, we estimate that &#163;12.5 million has actually been spent. It is difficult to be precise about how much of the UK funds have been spent from the Multi-Donor Fund because it is a pooled funding mechanism. The Multi-Donor Fund estimates that it will have spent $102 million of the $228 million received from donors by the end of March.

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60321w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 The threat of avian influenza is of global significance and requires a co-ordinated global response.

We also expressed our willingness to consider requests from developing country Governments to reprioritise DFID country programmes to finance work on influenza.

The remaining &#163;550,000 has been given as a grant to the World Health Organisation (WHO) which is leading the international response to avian influenza. The WHO will use the funds to support the Government of Nigeria at both federal and state level in reducing the opportunity of human infection, ensuring that the surveillance systems are in place and active, and undertaking assessment of laboratory facilities.

Flooding has been most intensive in the lower Zambezi and Pungue river basins. Nonetheless, the DNA is optimistic that any further large scale flooding on the Zambezi will be avoided, because the amount of water entering the lake behind the Cahora Bassa dam is falling, thus reducing the need, to increase discharges into the lower river. Based on historic patterns the likelihood of more extensive flooding will diminish from the end of March.

 The relief effort in Guatemala in the aftermath of Hurricane Stan is coordinated by the Guatemalan Government Agency, CONRED (Co-ordinadora Nacional para la Reduccion de Desastres) and involves a wide number of Government Departments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), donors and local community groups. Rehabilitation programmes are planned for periods of six-12 months and activities have begun for many of the 1,063 affected communities.

Waterborne disease remains a risk for affected communities and the Ministry of Health have been supported in the provision of transportation services, basic health kits including mosquito nets, and training for communities in health and nutrition awareness. Overall progress in reconstructing sanitation units has been slow, which in many cases has only reached 10 per cent. of target so far. However, some areas have benefited from intensive NGO efforts to ensure safe water, with as many as 10,000 water filters being provided and treatment plants in three municipalities. The installation of systems has been undertaken in close conjunction with local government authorities and communities to ensure sustainability.

<a name="stpa_18">Children have been badly affected by the hurricane the most, and those who remain in shelters will continue to receive psychological and educational support from rehabilitation partners. A continuing concern is the restoration of the livelihoods of the communities affected, either through agricultural support to those who returned to their homes, or through income generation opportunities for those who remain in shelters or have been relocated. DFID and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) have been in discussions with the Guatemalan Government to assess how those worst affected by Stan can begin to rehabilitate their livelihoods.

 There is no universal definition of a small firm.

 Up to now the impact of restrictions on the operation of humanitarian organisations in West Darfur has been minimal, despite the reduction in the number of international staff working in the region. This has been due to the agencies themselves anticipating the deteriorating security situation last January, and pre-positioning relief materials. This has enabled basic water, food and medical supplies to be provided through national staff and local non-governmental organisations (NGO)s.

<a name="stpa_28">However, security restrictions mean that the UN and NGOs can undertake only emergency life saving interventions in some parts of West Darfur. This, and the reduction in staff numbers, means that the international community is now less able to respond to a major challenge such as an outbreak of disease or a further large-scale displacement of the population. Reduced staff numbers mean that the UN&#039;s ability to afford protection of civilians is also more limited.

 Talks at the G6 Ministers (EU, US, Brazil, India, Australia and Japan) meeting in London on 11 March were intense, but unfortunately delivered no major progress. As reflected in my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister&#039;s joint statement with President Lula, the UK remains committed to an ambitious, balanced, pro-development outcome to the round. We believe that all the main parties in the talks need to take bold steps to go beyond established negotiating positions to improve their offers on agricultural market access and domestic support, NAMA and services. Those offers must also take account of the needs of developing countries by delivering improved market access in both agricultural and non-agricultural goods that is comparably high, but in a balanced and proportionate manner, consistent with the principle of special and differential treatment.

Notes:<br>

1.Table 1 is based on the PSNI District Command Unit in which an offender&#039;s address falls. The structure of police District Command Units became operational in April 2001. However, for the purposes of comparability, calendar year 2000 data are also disaggregated by DCU, rather than police division. It is not possible to disaggregate data by DCU for 1999.<br>

2.Figures include convictions for the offences of assault with intent to rape&quot;, indecent assault on female&quot;, indecent assault on male&quot;, indecent assault on female child&quot; and indecent assault onmale child&quot;.<br>

3.Missing&quot; data includes those convictions for which DCU information is not available.<br>

4. Data is collated on the principal offence rule, thus only the most serious offence for which an offender is charged is included.<br>

5.At present there is no means of tracking an offence from when it was reported to the police to whether there was a conviction for the offence, thus the conviction figures included should not be compared with the number of sexual assaults reported. <br>

 This Government have given an unprecedented high profile to tackling bullying and supporting those who have been bullied. Since 1999 it has been compulsory for every school to have an anti-bullying policy in place which details how the school will tackle bullying. Our anti-bullying work, including the anti-bullying Charter for Action, takes an integrated approach to preventing bullying, to addressing causes of bullying&#151;for example prejudice&#151;and to helping those who are bullied.

<a name="stpa_83">As recommended by the Practitioners Group on Behaviour and Discipline, the recent White Paper committed the Department to producing specific guidance for schools on prejudice driven bullying. At the beginning of this month, we launched our new advice &#039;Bullying around racism, religion and culture; how to prevent it and what to do when it happens&#039; as the first of this suite of materials. The advice is presented as a set of interactive web pages on the teachernet website and is being supported by a national programme of dissemination events. Feedback from schools and local authorities so far has been overwhelmingly positive. We will be following this with specific advice on countering homophobic bullying later in 2006.

It is an important arm of the Department&#039;s longer term policy to promote positive behaviour and attendance.

Good information on labour market and skills trends is essential for the council&#039;s work in steering post-16 education and skills provision. In developing its plans the LSC takes account of a wide range of information about current and future skill needs, including the national employer skills survey, research into learner and employer views of learning, and data contained in the Working Futures 2004 to 2014 reports, commissioned by the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA). The LSC is also required to consult and take account of the plans of other organisations, including local authorities and the regional development agencies, and, at the national level, sector skills councils help to identify the skills that are needed for each sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60321w11.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_95">Each year the LSC produces an annual statement of priorities. Plans are then formally reviewed throughout the year by the LSC&#039;s management group, and adjustments are made in the light of changing priorities if necessary. Changes to the LSC&#039;s internal organisation will further strengthen its research capacity, and ensure even more effective delivery against individual and employer needs at national, regional and local level.

Notes:<br>

1.Robust data from the new IT system (CS2) covering period March 2003 to March 2004 are not currently available, and is under development.<br>

2.Maintenance Direct is an arrangement in which the Agency have carried out a maintenance calculation or assessment, and the non resident parent then pays his/her maintenance liability directly to the parent with care. As the Agency is no longer directly involved in the case, it is not possible to say definitively if payment is received where such an arrangement is in place.<br>

<sup>(26)</sup>As at 31 March of each year.<br>

Data on pharmacy numbers.<br>

From October 2002, PCTs took over responsibility for community pharmacies from HAs. Thereforedata on the number of pharmacies in England with NHS contracts is broken down to HA level until 2001&#150;02, and PCT level from 2002&#150;03 onwards. The change from HAs to PCTs may have resulted in some boundary changes and this is reflected in the data.<br>

Information on the number of community pharmacies is collected from PCTs via the annual PHS1 data collection. The latest data available on General Pharmaceutical Services (1994&#150;95 to 2004&#150;05) was published on 27 January 2006. See the following link for this publication: www.ic.nhs.uk/pubs/genphmsvcengwaldecade05<br>

The survey collects information on openings and closures of community pharmacies. Changes of address, relocations within the PCT are excluded. However, pharmacy minor relocations across PCT boundaries are included as an opening or closure as appropriate. Establishments that close under old ownership and re-open under new ownership within 10 days are regarded as staying open, even if the period between closing and opening straddles review periods.<br>

Data for 2005&#150;06 is not yet available. <br>

<a name="stpa_193">The NHS Improvement Plan, published in June 2004, reiterated the Government&#039;s commitment to increase numbers of frontline NHS staff. This built on the NHS Plan which made a commitment to increasing nursing staff numbers&#151;over 20,000 more nurses working in the NHS and 5,500 extra nurses, midwives and health visitors being trained each year by 2004. These targets have already been met and exceeded. The extra investment announced in the 2002 Budget, builds on the NHS Plan target; by 2008 we expect the NHS to have net increases of at least 35,000 nurses, midwives and health visitors.

 The Home Office with its Executive agencies has put in place a range of steps to support staff with mental ill health.

<p><a name="st_289"><a name="60321w33.html_spnew2"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 Drugs and alcohol-related crime are serious social problems and also contribute to the commission of other crimes. For this reason it is not always possible to determine whether a person is employed to deal with these matters specifically, as opposed to dealing with them as part of a wider issue, such as anti-social behaviour, or the support of the police. The units which are specifically tasked with addressing these issues, or which deal with directly related matters are staffed as shown in the table, but civil servants within other parts of the Home Office may also have a role to play in reducing drug and alcohol related crime and its wider effects. Additionally the criminal justice aspects of drug misuse form only one facet of the Drug Strategy and civil servants in other government departments and the government offices also play an important role in reducing the harm caused by drug and alcohol misuse. In some cases the staff within a unit can be identified as working specifically on drug or alcohol related-crime issues. Where this is possible the figure given is that of the staff so identified not the total compliment of the unit.

 The decision by the Legal Services Commission (LSC) to withdraw specialist support funding should have a minimal impact on the workload and case management of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate.

<p>
<a name="60321w33.html_para3">
Specialist support services form part of the LSC special projects budget that was reviewed in the summer 2005 against a number of criteria. The LSC concluded that as specialist support services provide advice in civil categories of law to other legal advisors and not directly to clients, this did not represent the most cost-effective approach to meet the increasing need for front-line advice. The LSC has therefore decided not to continue funding for specialist support from July 2006.

<p><a name="st_296"><a name="60321w33.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I am not aware the Home Department have had any discussions with any of the organisations mentioned on this subject. The Legal Services Commission (LSC) advise that the impact of the withdrawal of specialist support funding is expected to be minimal. A rapid expansion of the LSC&#039;s supplier base in the immigration and asylum category justified a specialist support mechanism for advisers at the time of its introduction but since then the quality of immigration and asylum advice has increased substantially. The LSC has introduced the Immigration and Asylum Accreditation Scheme, which involves the testing and accreditation of individual advisers, and which became compulsory from August 2005. Higher quality standards have obviated the need for specialist support beyond that which will still be available through the instruction of specialist counsel in a small number of specific and complex cases.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many people held in detention who claimed to be victims of torture have had their case referred to his Department&#039;s Management of Detained Cases Unit in the last 12 months; what decisions were made in their cases; how many have not yet had a decision on their case; what the <i>(a)</i> average and <i>(b)</i> longest time is for those still awaiting a decision; what the (i) average and (ii) longest times were from referral to decision in those cases where a decision has been made; and if he will make a statement.

 Rule 35 (3) of the Detention Centre Rules 2001 (SI 238 2001) requires medical practitioners to report to the manager of Immigration Service Removal Centres any cases where there is concern that an individual may have been the victim of torture. It is sufficient for a detainee to claim torture for rule 35(3) to be triggered. Such information may not always be referred to the Management of Detained Cases Unit (MODCU) given that MODCU take responsibility for detained cases after the 28th day of detention. MODCU do, however, have responsibility for managing all cases relating to the detention of families with children from the outset. Caseworkers are required to consider what action may be necessary in the light of such information. Records of the number of cases referred under rule 35(3) and details of what happened in those cases is not held centrally and could only be obtained through examination of individual files at disproportionate cost.

<a name="stpa_248">The cost estimates for second generation biometric passports incorporating fingerprints will partly depend on the timing of their introduction. While our current assumption is that they will be issued prior to the introduction of ID cards, no final decision has been made on the timing as this depends on the ID Cards Bill, implementation timetable of the EU Passport Regulation and the Government&#039;s challenge to its scope. Publishing at this stage would put at risk the ability to secure value for money in negotiations with potential suppliers so these costs are commercial in confidence.

 The following table gives information on staff vacancies against operational staffing requirement at 31 March 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 for each public sector prison establishment and an aggregate shortfall, including staffing availability contributed by officers working contracted supplementary hours (CSH). 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Mar 2006 : Column 320W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Information prior to 2001 is not available and the contribution of CSH to staffing availability was not collated for 2001, 2002 and 2003. Therefore the stated shortfalls for these years show a higher shortfall than was the case. Data is not collated centrally on contracted prisons.

 The Home Secretary set out the Government&#039;s priorities for the Serious Organised Crime Agency in a letter on 9 June 2005 to the Chairman-designate, a copy of which was laid before the House. The letter expresses the Government&#039;s belief that all serious organised crime should be tackled on the basis of an intelligence-led approach which prioritises those criminal networks and markets doing the most harm. It also explains that on the basis of work done so far to analyse harm, we continue to see Class A drugs and organised immigration crime, in that order, as the top strategic priorities. The Serious Organised Crime Agency will be expected to focus the bulk of its effort in these two areas but will also be expected to devote resources to the other threats detailed in the UK Threat Assessment.

 Three accredited sex offender treatment programmes were introduced in the National Probation Service in 2002&#150;03 and are currently subject to an evaluation study. The study is based on psychometric information which measures statistically significant change in factors most closely linked to offending. Results are due later this year. However, it is too early for reconviction studies to be completed.

<a name="stpa_251">The Prison Service offers six accredited programmes for sex offenders, which are provided in different combinations according to the risk and need of the individual offender. The Core Programme, for medium risk offenders, was evaluated in 2003 and the findings indicated that the programme significantly reduced sexual and violent recidivism rates. This was particularly true with medium risk offenders but the programme did not impact on recidivism for high risk

<p><a name="st_315"><a name="60321w35.html_spnew6"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 The three core sex offender treatment programmes provided by the national probation service, all cover attachment theory although in different ways. One programme is explicit in teaching attachment theory to group members, while the other two take a more implicit approach and address the offender&#039;s attachment styles based upon a structured assessment of the offender&#039;s risk and need.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60321w35.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_252">An important treatment target for all three programmes is to address how sex offenders relate to others and how this may need to change in future to reduce risk. This will include specific work throughout each of the three programmes on life skills including the social and emotional management of relationships, together with self management skills.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60321w35.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_253">In the Prison Service, treatment programmes for sex offenders, attachment theory is the basis for modules of the Rolling Sex Offender Treatment Programme (for low risk offenders) and the Extended Sex Offender Treatment Programme (for high risk offenders). In both programmes, participants are taught the basics of attachment theory, helped to identify their individual attachment styles, and develop and practice strategies for moving towards a more secure attachment style. Additionally, all the Prison Service Sex Offender Treatment Programmes involve group work, which, as with the probation service, carries the benefit of offering an opportunity for group members to learn how to interact positively with one another.

In December 2005, we learned of plans by militant groups to kidnap the monitors. This was consistent with the sharp rise we had seen in kidnaps elsewhere in the Occupied Territories, which have included British nationals. In late 2005, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) kidnapped two teachers, demanding the release of Ahmed Sa&#039;adat, one of the detainees.
