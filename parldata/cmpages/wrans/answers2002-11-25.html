<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Paul Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what internal inquiries have been held into accidents involving Ministry of Defence property or equipment since 1997; what insurance policies the Ministry of Defence has in place to insure against accidents involving Ministry of Defence property or equipment; and if he will make a statement.  [82126]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Information concerning numbers of inquiries into accidents involving Ministry of Defence property or equipment is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="21125w01.html_para0">Current departmental policy requires the relevant operating authority to convene a Board of Inquiry or a Unit, Ship or Station Inquiry in the case of accidents, resulting in significant damage to buildings or equipment, or affecting operational capability. Less significant accidents are likely to be investigated at local level.
<P>

<a name="21125w01.html_para1">Accidents involving MOD property or equipment may also be the subject of Boards of Inquiry convened to investigate serious injuries and fatalities.
<P>

<a name="21125w01.html_para2">Treasury guidelines generally discourage public bodies from insuring risks unless it can be shown that the potential cost of claims paid, together with the cost of handling such claims, will exceed the cost of purchasing insurance. As the cost of premiums compared to the amounts paid in compensation would normally favour insurance companies, the MOD self-insures its core activities, and funds claims for compensation and the repair or replacement of lost or damaged property or equipment from its current expenditure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many extra deployable troops will result from his reorganisation of <i>(a)</i> 52 (Lowland) Brigade and <i>(b)</i> Headquarters 2 (South East) Brigade.  [25100]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The two light infantry brigade headquarters (52 Lowland) Brigade and 2 (South East) Brigade are being re-roled from regional brigade headquarters to provide better command and control arrangements for the light infantry role battalions, all of which are currently deployable. Thus the reorganisation of the two brigades will not result in an increase in the number of deployable troops. The change will bring greater coherence to the way that these units prepare for operations, through improved co-ordination of training.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the nuclear laundry facility at the former Chatham Dockyard, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> physical and functional description and <i>(b)</i> outflow and drainage functioning.  [82501]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Health Physics Laundry within the nuclear complex at the former Chatham Dockyard was equipped with washing machines and dryers. The floor of the laundry was finished with an epoxy resin to facilitate decontamination if required.
<P>

<a name="21125w01.html_para3">Laundering was restricted to protective clothing with low or zero levels of radioactive contamination to enable its re-use. Clothing with higher levels of contamination was disposed of as radioactive waste.
<P>

<a name="21125w01.html_para4">The laundry effluent was discharged untreated to the ordinary sewer as permitted by the (then) Department of Environment's Radiochemical Inspectorate. It was subject to regular sampling, to demonstrate that the levels of activity discharged to the sewer were insignificant.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w01.html_wqn3"><B> Jonathan Shaw: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the <i>(a)</i> physical and <i>(b)</i> functional characteristics of the washdown facility for radiation workers at the former Chatham Dockyard.  [82503]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Washdown Area within the nuclear complex at the former Chatham Dockyard was a purpose-built facility primarily for the decontamination of components from the submarine reactor and any associated tools and equipment that had become radioactively contaminated. Separate washing facilities were provided for personnel leaving radioactively contaminated areas.
<P>

<a name="21125w01.html_para5">The Washdown Facility had a stainless steel floor and stainless steel dividers and barriers. Large components were lowered and raised through roof hatches using an electric crane. Tented enclosures within the facility were used for some decontamination and close inspection work. Smaller equipments and tools were cleaned in stainless steel open vats using a solution of special detergents or demineralised water as required. The vats were positioned in an annexe to the Washdown Area with a continuous stainless steel floor, behind a stainless steel barrier, so enabling the containment and ready cleaning of any spillages. Water from the Washdown Area was directed via specific-to-purpose stainless steel drains into holding tanks in the adjacent Effluent Treatment Plant.
<P>

<a name="21125w01.html_para6">Decontamination facilities for personnel leaving radioactively contaminated areas consisted of hand wash facilities and associated monitoring equipment, to meet the requirements of the Ionising Radiations (Unsealed Radioactive Substances) Regulations 1968. In addition, there were showers for use in the extremely rare occurrences of bodily contamination.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w01.html_wqn4"><B> Jonathan Shaw: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence for how long each of the outstanding claims for former Chatham Dockyard workers seeking compensation under the no fault scheme has been 



<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 2002 : Column 3W</I><P>
awaiting decision; how many compensation claims have been awarded in full to former workers or their families; and how many claims are being processed.  [82504]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie:  </B> 
There is one outstanding case involving an ex-Chatham Dockyard radiation worker that has been assessed by the British Nuclear Fuels Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases as eligible for compensation. The level of compensation due has been assessed and an offer in full and final settlement was made on 16 September 2002. A formal response to the offer is awaited.
<P>

<a name="21125w01.html_para7">There have been no full (100 per cent.) awards made to former workers or their families by the Scheme. Two claims have been assessed as eligible for compensation at a lower level. One has settled and the other is as detailed above.
<P>

<a name="21125w01.html_para8">There are no other claims currently being processed by the Scheme which relate to Chatham Dockyard workers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w01.html_wqn5"><B> Jonathan Shaw: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the radiation safety procedures were when workers were performing tasks in the dock at the former Chatham dockyard.  [82524]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Safety procedures for work in the dock at the former Chatham Dockyard were governed by the requirements of the Factories Act 1961 and subsequently the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, and subordinate legislation. The type of work being undertaken in the dock would have determined which safety procedures applied.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 November 2002]:</i> The decision to form 14 Civil Contingency Reaction Forces (CCRFs) from existing Volunteer Reserve personnel was announced on 31 October 2002. None of the CCRFs is yet operational.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what proportion of the extra men training days that have been granted for the Civil Contingencies Reaction Force will be spent on <i>(a)</i> bringing each service man and woman to a common standard of basic training and <i>(b)</i> CBRN training.  [82209]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The training plans for the Civil Contingency Reaction Forces are still being developed. They will be aligned with existing Volunteer Reserve training and, in due course, with the requirements of specific regional contingency plans as these are developed in conjunction with local authorities and emergency services.
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 We expect that the 14 Civil Contingency Reaction Forces will be fully effective by the end of 2003, once they are fully recruited and have undergone an annual training cycle, and once the new regional liaison, planning, command and control arrangements are in place.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the policy is of his Department in relation to the reimbursement of Central London road user charges incurred by its employees.  [81843]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 19 November 2002]:</i> All civil servants are responsible for meeting the cost of their travel between home and normal place of work. The introduction of a Central London Road User Charge will not affect this basic condition of service. Accordingly, the Ministry of Defence has no plans for reimbursing the cost of the Road User Charge where it is incurred as part of normal commuting. However, civil servants travelling on detached duty to other establishments are entitled to claim the cost of the resultant travel. Where road user charges&#151;whether these be urban congestion charges or road/bridge tolls&#151;are incurred on such journeys, these costs can be claimed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what consultants have been hired to advise on computer systems for the Defence Logistics Organisation; and how much has been paid in fees to them.  [80971]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Since the Defence Logistics Organisation was fully formed in April 2000 a number of consultants have been hired across the organisation to advise on computer systems. These are: Alenia Marconi, Belgravia Consultancy, British Telecom, Capital ASI, Cookie Ltd, Cornwell Affiliates Pic, Cap Gemini and Ernst and Young, Dbi, CTPi Logistics, Digital Think, Eurostep Ltd, EDS Ltd, Exe Technologies Ltd, Hancocks, Hays Personnel Services, IBM, KPMG, LSC Group Ltd, Methods Applications Ltd, Northgate Information Systems, Parity Solutions, Recital Corporation Ltd, Scientific Generics and Systems Consultant Services. These companies have assisted with advice on the support for current logistics systems as well as development work on new systems.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Since the launch of the Defence Logistics Organisation on 3 April 2000, the organisation has focused on seven key areas in support of its corporate plan, to enable the delivery of agreed outputs to its customers at greatly reduced costs. The seven areas are people; inventory; industry; capital asset management; engineering support; e-business and convergence. Good progress has been made in all of these areas.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what was the recorded time of death of Private Stuart James McMaster of the 1st Royal Irish regiment on 15th June on Beiseker in Calgary, Canada; what action was taken to secure evidence at the scene of the death; at what time the Canadian police were notified of the death and what the conclusions were of their investigation; what the conclusions were of military police investigators; at what time the family of the deceased were notified; and what arrangements he has made for <i>(a)</i> the return of the deceased to the UK, <i>(b)</i> an inquest and <i>(c)</i> a Board of Inquiry.

<a name="21125w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Ranger (Rgr) Stuart James McMaster died at 15.25 hours Saturday 15 June 2002 during a privately paid for parachute jump at the Skydive Ranch, Beiseker, Alberta. He was deployed to Canada for adventure training, which had recently concluded. Within minutes of the accident, civilian paramedics attended the scene (the STARS (Calgary heli-born medics) and EMF Airdrie (Canadian civilian paramedics)) and pronounced Rgr McMaster dead. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were called to the scene at 15.35 hours and retained primacy of the investigation for the first 48 hours following the death; they concluded that there was nothing suspicious about the death. Jurisdiction was subsequently passed to the Royal Military Police (RMP) detachment at the British Army Training Unit Suffield (BATUS). An investigator from the Land Accident Investigation Team, working for the RMP, concluded that the accident occurred as a result of Rgr McMaster being unstable after exiting the aircraft.

<P>

<a name="21125w03.html_para2">The casualty visiting officer informed Rgr McMaster's next of kin and additional next of kin of his death at 00.45 hours Sunday 16 June. The deceased was returned to the United Kingdom at public expense from Canada to Ireland via London departing on 19 June and arriving in Northern Ireland on 20 June. A coroner's inquest was not held since the deceased did not die in Northern Ireland; however, Rgr McMaster's family were entitled to request an inquest be held.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 When a company and its final salary pension scheme are wound up, pensioners are protected by the 1995 Pensions Act and regulations. A statutory priority order ensures that, after additional voluntary contributions, pensions in payment are secured ahead of other benefits, so that those already in retirement continue to receive a pension.
<P>

<a name="21125w05.html_para0">The employer debt provisions place a debt on an insolvent company's estate that is calculated, in part, to bring a wound up scheme's assets up to a level sufficient to meet the notional costs of buying annuities for pensioners.

<a name="21125w05.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The introduction of universal banking services (which consists of two elements: access to basic bank accounts and the Post Office card account) will help ensure that all customers, including pensioners living in rural areas, can continue to access their benefits in cash at the Post Office. It will also provide customers with a wider range of accounts that they can choose to have their benefit or pension paid into. Universal banking services is an innovative idea that will also help to broaden the Post Office's customer base and open up new sources of income.

<a name="21125w05.html_para5">We are already encouraging employers to adopt non-ageist employment practices through our Age Positive Campaign.

The code was developed with leading organisations including the CBI, TUC, the Employers Forum on Age and Age Concern. Evaluation shows that from 1999 to 2001 the number of companies using age in recruitment had already fallen from 27 per cent. to 13 per cent. and the number of companies having a policy against employing older workers had dropped from 14 per cent. to 7 per cent.

If a claim is successful funds are paid to the trustees of the scheme being wound up. In addition, the Pensions Act 1995 requires salary-related schemes to meet the Minimum Funding Requirement, and provides for a statutory priority order for the distribution of a scheme's assets if a scheme that is required to meet the MFR winds up.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the waiting time is for the processing of applications for adaptations to homes for disabled people; and what is being done to speed up the process.  [82026]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The time scale for having applications completed varies depending on the nature and scale of the work required. For Northern Ireland Housing Executive properties 50 per cent. of urgent heating cases are completed within 17 weeks while in non urgent cases 96 per cent. are completed in 52 weeks. In private sector cases it issues schedules of work in 82 per cent. of cases within 12 weeks of inspection and approves 97 per cent. of cases within six months of receipt of a completed formal application form. The times scales are influenced by factors such as having plans drawn up and approved as well as the need to have an assessment carried out to determine the needs of the disabled person.
<P>

<a name="21125w06.html_para4">For its own properties the Housing Executive and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety have jointly carried out a review of the adaptation service. Significant progress has been made in reducing the requirement for assessment by the occupational therapy service through increased use of fast tracking and waiting times are expected to be reduced by the recruitment of additional Occupational Therapists (17 have been recruited). For private sector cases, the Housing Executive is setting up a working group to examine ways of improving the applications process and in the longer term, the new housing legislation will allow for fast tracking on agreement with the Occupational Therapy Service.

 Poor country producers can best be helped through a combination of supportive policies and programmes in country and significant trade liberalisation in areas of importance to them. Through the Doha Development Agenda agreed at the fourth WTO ministerial in November 2001, the UK is arguing for significant reductions in trade distorting policies and greater access for developing country products to OECD markets, particularly for agricultural goods and light manufactures.
<P>

<a name="21125w08.html_para3">Specifically, the UK Government support the Integrated Framework, which aims to mainstream trade issues into a country's growth and poverty reduction strategies. This ensures that the right sort of complementary policies i.e. rural roads, access to credit or skill training, can be developed to reduce the impact on poor people of changes in their livelihoods and enable small producers to take advantage of new trading opportunities.

about prospects for February and March, when needs are expected to be high. In terms of physical stocks the Ethiopian Food Security Reserve is expected on current estimates to have sufficient food available until April. The European Commission has informed us that they have made available euro 23 million, of which the DFID share is nearly euro 4.6 million, which is equivalent to 97,000 metric tonnes of food aid, to cover food needs until the end of 2002. This total includes euro 5 million, which is equivalent to 13,000 metric tonnes of food aid, to be provided through the World Food Programme. The Commission is also looking at the best ways to provide timely and effective assistance to address the emerging food crisis in 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w09.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 DFID is working closely with the Governments of both India and Bangladesh to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. India has a significant HIV epidemic, with prevalence in some states at around 2 per cent. The number of people with HIV/AIDS is estimated at 3.9 million. In Bangladesh, although HIV prevalence is less than 1 per cent., even in high risk groups, we recognise as a priority the prevention of its further spread.
<P>

<a name="21125w09.html_para0">We are currently considering what role there may be for DFID in working on HIV/AIDS in Indonesia, where evidence suggests that prevalence in certain places and in certain groups has risen quickly. Thailand is often held up as one of the world's success stories in combating HIV/AIDS, having reduced the number of new infections from 143,000 in 1991 to 29,000 in 2001. DFID has no bilateral programme there, but we do continue to monitor carefully the status of the epidemic.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w09.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Sierra Leone judiciary has been in a state of decline for at least the last 30 years. Its operational independence has been deeply undermined. Low pay is a cause of poor morale and contributes to all round ineffectiveness. Investment in training and infrastructure has been minimal. The perception in Sierra Leone is that it is unresponsive, unaccountable, corrupt and inaccessible. It is neither trusted nor respected.
<P>

<a name="21125w09.html_para2">Starting from this very low base my Department has been working with the Sierra Leone judiciary to support reform. Assistance to date has concentrated on the restoration of infrastructure, the provision of equipment, court recording systems and procedures and legal drafting.
<P>

<a name="21125w09.html_para3">We are considering a further programme of assistance that would take an integrated approach to the justice system (police, legal and judicial and penal systems).

<P>
<a name="21125w09.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Sierra Leone agreed an interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) with the international financial institutions in September 2001. It outlines a post-conflict transitional phase focused on restoration of security, re-launching the economy, and provision of basic services to the most vulnerable groups. Longer term programmes for poverty reduction will be contained in a full PRSP that the Government of Sierra Leone intend to prepare by late 2003. Agreement of a full PRSP will be the key step for an agreed agenda between the Government of Sierra Leone and the donor community for poverty reduction.
<P>

<a name="21125w09.html_para4">Peace was declared in Sierra Leone in January this year. Inevitably, the Government's initial focus has been on disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of ex-combatants, and measures to assist the millions of internally displaced persons and returning refugees. After 10 years of conflict, Sierra Leone faces a huge task in developing and implementing policies to address poverty reduction and the Millennium Development Goals. There are some encouraging developments, for example, in improving primary school enrolment and immunisation rates, but much remains to be done in a country severely damaged by conflict.

Under the Poverty Reduction Framework Arrangement signed with the Government of Sierra Leone this month, we have committed &pound;120 million over the next three years, as part of a 10-year commitment of support. This complements the US$172 million poverty reduction and growth facility agreed by Sierra Leone with the IMF in September 2001, and the US$950 million of debt relief available through the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, both of which will assist Sierra Leone to address recovery and poverty reduction.

<P>
<a name="21125w10.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 November 2002]:</i> Urban reinvention is a modernisation and restructuring programme designed to ensure that urban sub post offices can operate as viable businesses for their owners and offer improved services from the right locations to serve their communities.
<P>

<a name="21125w10.html_para6">As identified in the PIU report on the future of the network, the future viability of the restructured urban network will depend on the ability of the business to maximise commercial opportunities, improve efficiency and improve the quality of individual offices. It is anticipated that banking services will make a major contribution towards ensuring a viable future for many urban post offices.
<P>

<a name="21125w10.html_para7">Universal banking services (both the card account and the banks own basic bank accounts), together with the Post Office's plans for an expansion of network banking (commercial arrangements between the Post Office and individual banks providing access to standard bank accounts over post office counters), should lead to a substantial increase in the number of people using post offices to do banking transactions. Wider access to bank accounts at post offices opens up a very much larger market than benefit recipients alone, and this should benefit sub-postmasters both directly and through increased footfall.

<a name="21125w12.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 I understand from the Independent Television Commission (ITC) that terrestrial analogue television services are broadcast across Lancashire from the Winter Hill main transmitter and around twenty relay stations. The ITC advise that a relay station was built in 1975 specifically to provide analogue television coverage to Whalley, Billington and Langho, although a small area of South Whalley remains unserved. Digital terrestrial television (DTT) services are provided from the Winter Hill, Lancaster and Pendle Forest transmitters. Details on DTT availability can be found on the Freeview website at: www.freeview.co.uk. Television services may also be accessed via digital satellite.

 The International Coffee Organisation's (ICO) Quality Improvement programme was approved by ICO Council Resolution 416 on 1 February 2002. The programme commenced on 1 October 2002. It applies to ICO members and requires that exports of coffee, accompanied by Certificates of Origin, shall comply with minimum standards specified in the Resolution. Exporting members are also required to develop and implement national measures to ensure that no exports of green coffee fail to meet the exportable standards. Discussions are currently on-going about how the exports of processed coffee should be dealt with.Exporting members are currently in the process of implementing the Council's Resolution within their countries. Members will report to the ICO Council on the measures they have taken to do so and of any difficulties encountered. This will feed into an ICO review of the programme planned for September 2003.

<P>
<a name="21125w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government has set itself a domestic goal to reduce the UK's carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. This is in addition to the UK's target under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases to 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008 to 2012.
<P>

<a name="21125w13.html_para6">In November 2000, the Government published the UK climate change programme, which sets out a range of integrated policies and measures to reduce emissions in six broad sectors: the energy supply industry; business; transport; the residential sector, agriculture, forestry and land use; and, the public sector. Key policies in the programme include: the target under the Renewables Obligation that 10 per cent. of licensed electricity supplies will be generated from renewable sources by 2010; climate change levy and climate change agreements; the worlds first economy-wide emissions trading scheme; the voluntary agreements between the European Commission and the European, Japanese and Korean car manufacturers to reduce average carbon dioxide emissions from new cars, supported by changes to vehicle excise duty and company car taxation; and the Energy Efficiency Commitment on energy suppliers to encourage consumers to take up energy saving opportunities.

<a name="21125w13.html_para7">We estimate that the quantified policies in the programme could help reduce the UK's carbon dioxide emissions by 19 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. Carbon savings, which have not been quantified, from additional policies could help us achieve our domestic goal.

 The Government has set local authorities a target to recycle or compost at least 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005. This national target has been underpinned by local authority specific statutory performance standards. These standards set levels of recycling and composting that all waste authorities must achieve by 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06. &pound;140 million was provided by the Government under its Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund to help local authorities achieve these targets.

<a name="21125w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Department has no specific information on the practices followed by other member states in relation to the composting of kitchen waste, although visits have been made to look at composting operations in Italy and the Netherlands. However, the new EU Animal By-products Regulation (expected to come into force in 2003) permits the use in composting/biogas operations of catering waste containing meat and low-risk animal by-products. For plants processing only catering waste, the Regulation allows national standards to be set, provided they guarantee an equivalent effect in pathogen reduction to the treatment standard in the Regulation (70&#176;C for one hour in a closed system).
<P>

<a name="21125w15.html_para0">The Department commissioned a risk assessment that looked at the animal and public health risks posed by the composting/biogas treatment of catering waste and spreading it on land. This work concluded that, provided satisfactory controls are in place, composting/biogas treatment can be done safely.
<P>

<a name="21125w15.html_para1">We are therefore developing processes that will allow catering waste to be composted safely, based on the results of the risk assessment (without the risk assessment, we would be obliged to follow the EU standard, which would be more restrictive and, possibly, counter-productive). The aim is to get a draft statutory instrument out for public consultation by the end of November, and to amend the legislation early in the new year. The overall objective is to develop a set of rules that will allow composting of catering waste to take place economically, while fully protecting animal and public health.

 There have been no reported cases of Sudden Oak Death in Europe.
<P>

<a name="21125w16.html_para5">A strain of Phytophthora ramorum, the pathogen which has caused Sudden Oak Death in parts of California, has been found on rhododendron and viburnum plants in a number of European countries in recent years. There have been 122 findings in England and Wales since the first one in April this year. In each case infected plants and those adjacent have been destroyed. Plants in a surrounding cordon sanitaire have been held for further monitoring. In response to a UK initiative, EU measures came into force on 1 November. These require member states to survey for the disease and apply precautionary measures through the plant passport system to prevent spread on nursery stock. Defra inspectors will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these measures.
<P>

<a name="21125w16.html_para6">Defra and the Forestry Commission are funding research to address uncertainties in the risk assessment for the European strain of the pathogen, in particular to determine whether native European trees are susceptible. No effective eradicatory fungicides are known at present, but Defra and Forestry Commission scientists are closely following research into treatments in the affected areas of the USA. Further information is available on the Defra website at defraweb/planth/what.htm.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what controls exist on the use of toxic ash from incinerators as an ingredient in breeze block manufacture; and if she will make a statement on the steps taken by her Department on the construction of such breeze blocks by Ballast Phoenix, using material from the London waste incinerator at Edmonton.  [81582]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 20 November 2002]</i>: It is considered by this department and the Environment Agency that the controls for the management of waste, under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994, extend to the use of incinerator ash until it has been incorporated into a manufactured product (such as breeze blocks). These controls include a duty of care to manage waste safely through the prevention of harm to human health and the environment and through the prevention of the escape of waste. Furthermore, waste disposal and recovery operations are only permitted to take place under the terms of a waste management licence or an exemption from licensing.
<P>

<a name="21125w16.html_para7">Until August 2000, the Edmonton incinerator was mixing bottom ash with fly ash. Following concerns about the levels of dioxins in this material, the Environment Agency launched an investigation into the destination and use of incinerator ash. The investigation found, among other details, that about 15,000 tonnes of mixed ash from Edmonton was supplied by Ballast Phoenix for the manufacture of construction blocks between 1998 and 2000. The investigation included 



<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 2002 : Column 59W</I><P>
research into the release of dioxins from construction blocks made using mixed ash from the Edmonton incinerator. The Agency found that mixed ash construction blocks do not release measurable levels of dioxins into the air, and that any dust from drilling the blocks is likely to contribute very little to typical overall exposures to dioxins.
<P>

<a name="21125w16.html_para8">The Agency also recommended that subject to guidance and appropriate specifications, bottom ash could be a valuable secondary aggregate. Air Pollution Control residues and fly ash, on the other hand, are hazardous wastes and as such are subject to special controls and should be consigned to sites licensed or permitted to dispose of hazardous wastes.
<P>

<a name="21125w16.html_para9">The Government commissioned the independent environmental consultants AEA Technology to produce a report on the use of incinerator bottom ash in road construction, and this is expected to be published shortly. The Agency's investigation is summarised in their report XSolid Residues from Municipal Waste Incinerators in England and Wales". Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of the House, and it can also be found at: http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/105385/ash pdf4.pdf

 Modulated funds may be spent only on a limited range of the measures provided for under the EU Rural Development Regulation-the so-called Xaccompanying measures". Training is not one of them. Modulated funds in England are being used to support agri-environment schemes.

 The withdrawal of payable tax credits on dividends was part of a package of reforms that included cuts in corporation tax and the abolition of advanced corporation tax. These changes were designed to improve the climate for long-term investment in the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w17.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 To receive their entitlement to tax credits, people need to make a claim. The Inland Revenue is writing to claimants of the existing Children's Tax Credit and inviting claims for the new tax credits. Couples must claim the new Child Tax Credit jointly. Child Tax Credit is to be paid to the person in the family who is mainly responsible for looking after the children. Where a claim to the new tax credits is made jointly, the claimants themselves are asked to identify which of them is the main carer.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The need to move to ICD-10 to maintain the value of mortality data to users is internationally recognised and it has been introduced in England and Wales on the recommendation of the World Health Organisation (WHO). ICD-10 more closely reflects current medical knowledge than ICD-9, which was developed in the early 1970s, introduced in 1979 and is now out-of-date. Many diseases or conditions that are now of particular interest to medical practitioners, and those working in public health and epidemiology, cannot be adequately classified using ICD-9, for example HIV/AIDS. In addition to this there is widespread demand for more modem data on heart disease and stroke. ICD-10 has been used for the classification of morbidity data in the NHS and in cancer registration since 1995. This created difficulties in comparing morbidity and mortality.</FONT></UL>

 No specific funding has been allocated for platform refurbishment in connection with access for disabled passengers. Access for wheelchair users between platforms and trains is currently achieved by the use of ramps.
<P>

<a name="21125w21.html_para0">Access to railway stations, as with other public transport infrastructure, is covered by the provisions of Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act. From 2004, station operators will have to take reasonable steps either to remove or alter impediments to access, to find ways of avoiding them or to provide the service by a reasonable alternative means.

 Improving the accessibility of the underground system is an essential part of the plans to modernise the system. 29 of the 253 stations owned by London Underground are currently step free, and a further eight step-free stations are served by underground services. By 2020 over 100 stations will have step free access, opening up large areas of London to many people previously unable to use the network.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 White and brown signs giving directional information about tourist destinations are controlled by traffic authorities as part of their statutory responsibility for securing the safe and efficient movement of traffic. The main purpose of white and brown signs is to guide visitors to their intended tourist destination along the most appropriate route during the latter stage of their journey, particularly where the destination may be difficult to find. The design of signs to direct traffic to tourist attractions and facilities, and of directional traffic signs generally, is controlled through the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD). Revised TSRGD, which we 



<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 2002 : Column 76W</I><P>
expect to lay within the next few weeks, will add to the range of symbols and designs available for traffic authorities to use.
<P>

<a name="21125w21.html_para2">Decisions about the provision of signs at particular locations are the responsibility of the relevant traffic authority in the light of their local circumstances and signing policies. My Department consulted earlier this year on proposals for updated guidance to local authorities and the Highways Agency on dealing with applications for new white and brown signs. We recognise the importance of getting an appropriate balance between the needs of local tourism, safety, efficient traffic management and the environment. The draft guidance has been further revised in the light of the responses to the consultation and to take account of the revisions to the TSRGD, and we expect it to be available early next year.

 We and our EU partners are working to ensure that the effect of enlargement on the EU's relations with Russia&#151;and therefore on the UK's relationship with Russia&#151;will be positive. The EU wants to help Russia maximise the considerable opportunities enlargement offers. EU work with Russia on WTO accession, the EU/Russia energy dialogue, the concept of a common economic space, and increased political and JHA co-operation are all contributing to this end. In addition, the EU is working closely with Russia to ensure that Kaliningrad, its Baltic sea enclave, remains a fully integrated part of the Russian Federation after enlargement.

 On 7 November Belgium alerted EU partners to the request for visas to attend the EU/ACP meeting from Christopher Kuruneri, Zimbabwe's Deputy Minister for Finance and Paul Mangwana, Minister of State for State Enterprises. Both are on the EU travel ban list. The Belgian Government explained that under the terms of the Lome and Cotonou Agreements, Belgium had a legal obligation to grant these visas, since these agreements override Council decisions on sanctions. The Belgian Government undertook to attach maximum restrictions. The banned individuals were granted visas only for the period 19&#150;29 November, restricted to the territory of Belgium.

All access routes to the border to be utilised by the demarcation survey and pillar construction teams have to be checked and cleared of mines where necessary. UNMEE has been mandated by the Security Council to conduct demining operations in support of the demarcation teams, and UNMEE MACC is co-ordinating and managing this project.

 The Department has carried out no specific assessment of the impact of university staff turnover on the quality of academic research and higher education. However, the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise showed that 55 per cent. of research staff now work in Departments containing work of international excellence compared with 31 per cent. in 1996. In addition, the recently completed QAA eight year cycle of HE subject reviews, which included an assessment of teaching quality, identified only 1 per cent. of unsatisfactory provision. The Higher Education Funding Council in September 2002 pointed to some subject areas where it is difficult to recruit including some shortage areas particularly ICT, business, science and engineering. We recognise these difficulties and the challenges our universities face recruiting and retaining in an international market. Top US universities, in particular, pay some academics and researchers salaries, which can be twice as much as their British counterparts earn.

<P>

<a name="21125w24.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Schools are required under part 4 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to take reasonable steps to prevent disabled pupils from being put at a substantial disadvantage compared to non-disabled pupils in respect of education and associated services. This would include, where appropriate, negotiating special arrangements for pupils with disabilities who are taking public examinations. What constitutes a reasonable step will depend on the circumstances of individual cases and schools will need to take into account any relevant factors, including the need to maintain academic, musical, sporting and other standards, the financial resources available to them and the costs of taking a particular step.
<P>

<a name="21125w24.html_para0">In addition, both the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and the examination boards make special arrangements for children with special educational needs, with and without statements, where it can be shown that they usually have additional or different provision in school.

The offer of &pound;100,000 has now been extended to all local authorities, and a further four Trailblazers are being identified to extend the geographical coverage and range of authorities.

<a name="21125w25.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Local education authorities and primary and secondary schools are not required to collect information about the drug use of their pupils' parents. There are inherent difficulties in collecting information about drug use; because of its often illegal nature, drug users are often reluctant to identify themselves to statutory bodies.
<P>

<a name="21125w25.html_para9">The Home Office is responsible for collecting information on the scale of drug misuse in England and Wales. The report of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs XThe Children of Problem Drug Users" is due to be published next year and will contain estimates of the numbers of children affected by parental drug misuse. The report is also expected to make recommendations to address the problem.
<P>

<a name="21125w25.html_para10">When parents use drugs&#151;especially problematic and illegal drugs like heroin&#151;their children may be exposed to a range of emotional and physical hazards. Children may respond in a variety of ways, including: disturbed or anti-social behaviour; becoming withdrawn or introverted; turning to drink or drugs to escape unpleasant home situations; running away from home; losing concentration in class; and reluctance to form or develop friendships with schoolmates. The child may also be the subject of bullying if schoolmates perceive him or her to be 'different' or 'not fitting in' with the peer group. Schooling is likely to be interrupted if the child is depended upon to care for drug using parents.
<P>

<a name="21125w25.html_para11">The Government recognise that the children of drug using parents are a vulnerable group. They should therefore benefit from the new requirement for every top tier or unitary local authority to prepare from April 2003 a local preventive strategy to improve outcomes for children aged 0&#150;19 who are at risk of social exclusion. This was announced by the Minister for Young People on 6 September. On 30 October the Prime Minister announced to the House the Government's intention to publish a Green Paper on Children at Risk in the New Year. My Department is playing a full part in helping to make sure that vulnerable children and young people are identified as soon as possible, and that their needs are met with a coherent and effective response from the relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.

 Since April 2002 the LSC has been responsible for the funding of school sixth forms. In the Secretary of State's Grant Letter for 2002&#150;03 we asked the LSC to widen council representation from the schools sector. Since then the LSC has been actively recruiting school teachers and head teachers and will continue to do so. Currently there are 19 local LSCs with teachers or head teachers of schools with sixth forms on their local councils.

This funding, made available to local education authorities (LEAs) is to support the training of teachers and deliver effective drug, alcohol and tobacco education and prevention programmes. &pound;15.5 million has been made available in 2002&#150;03 and this will rise to &pound;17.5 million in 2003- 04. The breakdown for 2002&#150;03 is: Standards Fund Drug Prevention Grant&#151;&pound;7.5 million; Standards Fund Drug Education Advisers Grant&#151;&pound;5.7 million; Teacher training and Connexions Adviser training &pound;2.3 million.

<P>

<a name="21125w26.html_para3">This increase will improve the quality and coverage of drug, alcohol and tobacco education, fund drug adviser support in each LEA and help teachers deliver programmes tailor-made to meet the needs of young people across the country, including those most vulnerable to the risks of drug misuse.
<P>

<a name="21125w26.html_para4"><i>(b)</i> Through our Behaviour Improvement Programme, we have allocated &pound;50 million to 34 LEAs with high rates of street crime and truancy to work with targeted schools in improving behaviour and attendance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w27.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 18 November 2002]:</i> If no statement is maintained for a child, they must be educated in a mainstream school. Children with statements of special educational needs should also be taught in a mainstream school and the LEA should find a place for them where parents wish it, and it is not incompatible with the efficient education of other children. This will also apply to accommodation centre residents who subsequently remain in this country after leaving the centre. For children and their parents who are resident in an accommodation centre, local education authorities will be able to disapply the relevant provisions of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to name a mainstream school in a child's statement, having carried out a statutory assessment of a child's special educational needs, if they consider that the accommodation centre or a special school will not be able to meet the child's needs. We would, however, expect local education authorities to take this course of action only rarely, and the great majority of children will have their special educational needs met appropriately in the accommodation centres.

<i>[holding answer 19 November 2002]:</i> With the exception of a limited number of staff who are entitled to claim excess fares allowance on permanent transfer, Home Office staff are responsible for paying their own everyday home to office travel costs. The introduction of a Central London Road User charge will not affect this. Home Office staff who travel on official business are required to use the most efficient and economical means of travel, taking all costs into account.

<P>
<a name="21125w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 There is no legal presumption to this effect, and the Government do not intend to introduce one. Road traffic law is based on the principle that the prime consideration in deciding how to deal with road traffic offenders should be the degree of culpability. In many cases, even though an accident between a driver and a cyclist might have had tragic consequences, the driver may not have been at fault. In the police investigation of such an accident, the cyclist and driver are treated on exactly the same basis. Any decision as to charges against either party will depend on an assessment of all the evidence available.

: To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has in relation to tariff-setting arrangements for those convicted of murder. [83771]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w28.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The House of Lords has made decisions today in two cases that deal with the arrangements for the sentencing of adults convicted of murder. These judgments concern matters of fundamental significance for the criminal justice system and the role of Parliament and Ministers in formulating policy on the provision of adequate punishment for the guilty and the protection of the public.
<P>

<a name="21125w28.html_para4">In the case of Pyrah and Lichniak, the House of Lords has confirmed that the mandatory life sentence for murder is compatible with the rights protected by the European Convention of Human Rights. This sentence will remain in place.
<P>

<a name="21125w28.html_para5">The case of Anderson deals with the Home Secretary's power to set the tariff, or minimum period a convicted murderer must remain in custody until he becomes eligible for release. This power has ensured ministerial accountability to Parliament within the criminal justice system for the punishment imposed for the most heinous and serious of crimes. When Parliament took its decision to abolish the death penalty for murder, this was the framework with which it was replaced. The House of Lords has not ruled that the Home Secretary's power is unlawful. All existing tariffs therefore stand. The House of Lords has declared instead that the Home Secretary's power to set tariffs for those convicted of murder is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The existing law and tariffs set according to it therefore remain until new legislation is in place.
<P>

<a name="21125w28.html_para6">This judgment will affect only the issue of who sets the tariff in each case. As is proper in a democracy, Parliament will continue to retain the paramount role of setting a clear framework within which the minimum period to be served will be established. I am determined that there should continue to be accountability to Parliament for these most critical decisions. This is fundamental to our democracy and to the maintenance of confidence in the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="21125w28.html_para7">We need to study the judgment carefully before finalising our proposals but I intend to legislate this Session to establish a clear set of principles within which 



<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 2002 : Column 101W</I><P>
the courts will fix tariffs in the future. These principles will be debated and agreed by both Houses of Parliament and in setting a tariff, the judge will be required, in open court, to give reasons if the term being imposed departs from those principles. The Attorney General already has powers in relation to unduly lenient sentences and it will be open to him to challenge any tariff which he does not consider to be consistent with these principles.
<P>

<a name="21125w28.html_para8">These principles will set a framework within which judicial discretion, which is an essential feature of sentencing, will operate. They will be robust and comprehensive. We envisage that they will comprise a statement of the major guiding principles followed by a series of clear messages about the tariffs Parliament expects to be imposed for different categories of murder. The principles will provide entry points for particular categories of murder, which would be adjusted up or down in line with specified aggravating and mitigating factors. The principles will set out that for the most serious crimes&#151;such as the sexual, sadistic murder of children&#151;life should mean life. The principles will incorporate the same aggravating factors upon which previous Home Secretaries and I have based our decisions. These factors will include murder committed in the course of armed robbery or the murder of prison or police officers in the course of their duty as set out to Parliament by my predecessor Leon Brittan in 1983. In 



<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 2002 : Column 102W</I><P>
the case of existing tariffs, these arrangements will ensure that any judicial reconsideration is on the basis of this same set of principles.
<P>

<a name="21125w28.html_para9">I believe that coupled with the new arrangements for the determination of release of mandatory life prisoners by the Parole Board, under which I will have an opportunity to make representations on the impact of any future offending by the prisoner concerned, the provisions I have outlined will amount to a sensible and secure scheme for the management of life sentences generally. The new scheme will be compatible with our Human Rights obligations and will also ensure that Parliament has established the framework for dealing with the most dangerous and evil people in our society.

<sup>(10)</sup> Home Office grant includes principal formula police grant, Crime Fighting Fund, Rural Policing grant, capital grant, DMA funding and Airwave grant. Under the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) floors and ceilings arrangements, police authorities in England were guaranteed a minimum increase in principal formula police and ODPM grants of 2.3 per cent. for 2002&#150;03. Floors and ceilings are not applied by the National Assembly for Wales, but to ensure North Wales benefited from a minimum increase of 2.3 per cent., my right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary exceptionally agreed to make a special payment to North Wales police authority of &pound;362,000.<P>

<sup>(11)</sup> National Assembly for Wales grant includes national non domestic rates and revenue support grant.<P>

<sup>(12)</sup> Real terms are at 2001&#150;02 prices using gross domestic product deflator at 27 September 2002.<P>

<sup>(13)</sup> Before 1995&#150;96, when most police authorities became independent local authorities, revenue support grant and national non domestic rates were paid as part of respective county council grant funding.<P>

<sup>(14)</sup> The grant figure for 2002&#150;03 is not directly comparable with that for 2001&#150;02 owing to changes in funding for the National Crime Squad/National Criminal Intelligence Service, now funded centrally rather than through police authorities. On a comparable basis, grant for 2001&#150;02 would be &pound;93.3 million.<P>

 The Secretary of State for the Home Department is responsible to Parliament for an efficient and effective police service in England and Wales. To that end the Police Reform Act 2002 has extended the scope of regulations, codes of practice and directions to take remedial action that the Secretary of State may issue. The Secretary of State shares with chief officers of police and police authorities the management of policing, but is not responsible for the deployment of police officers and staff. Nor is he responsible for enforcing the law&#151;this is a matter for those who hold the office of a constable or who have otherwise been given specific powers by Parliament. The control and direction of police officers and police support staff is vested in the chief constable, save for those staff who by agreement work for the police authority.
<P>

<a name="21125w29.html_para1">In former times, the Secretary of State has declined to answers related to police operations and this has been upheld by the Speaker. Recent Secretaries of State have often tried to accommodate hon. members with specific information relating to the police. Most information should be sought direct from the chief officer of police or the police authority.

<P>
<a name="21125w29.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Sir David O'Dowd's taskforce was commissioned to give the Government a police service view of what could be done to tackle the administrative burdens and inefficient working practices which keep police officers off the streets. The taskforce report highlighted ways to free up significant amounts of officers' time. We have now set up a steering group, co-chaired by the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Home Office, to take the taskforce recommendations forward.
<P>

<a name="21125w29.html_para6">The Government recognise its responsibilities to support this work, including considering changes to legislation where necessary. Indeed, in line with a number of taskforce recommendations, the Police Reform Act 2002 has already made the necessary changes in the law to enable chief officers to expand the range of functions that support staff can perform in the custody suite. We will also ensure that significant funding is made available to improve police information technology. This is a vital opportunity to change the culture and management of the police service and bring about a real difference to the everyday lives of officers on the front line.

 I have no current plans to do so.

Good or promising practice in the areas of recruitment, retention and progression will be promulgated when identified.

<a name="21125w30.html_para0">It is healthy to have a degree of interchange of experience between police forces, to allow officers to pursue their personal and career development.

 Statistics are not collected on a regular basis about assaults on shop staff. However, we have launched the first independent crime victimisation study of the retail and manufacturing sectors for 10 years. This will gather valuable information about the types of crime businesses suffer and help in developing the best ways to tackle these. In May 2002 we issued XDon't Discount Crime", a new user-friendly crime reduction guide for retailers. This is of particular relevance to small retailers and includes basic guidance on what steps to take to reduce crime as well as what to do in crime situations. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) also published "Work- related violence: managing the risk in

 We are supporting forces in the recruitment of special constables through advertising and promotional material. In the last year, the Home Office has run a police specials recruitment campaign in the national press. Advertisements appeared under the police XCould You?" campaign branding and sought to demonstrate the kind of situations that a special constable could face.

We intend to amend the Special Constabulary Regulations to provide greater flexibility for police authorities to a limited number of trial schemes for making small payments to specials. These trial schemes will require the approval of the Secretary of State. A new headline role for specials has been agreed and a national Xfoundation" training package developed. We are working on joint Home Office/Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) good practice guidance covering all aspects of the recruitment, management and deployment of specials.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the terms of reference are of the research he has commissioned into the effectiveness of strip searching; what consideration he has given to providing the manual completion and compiling of strip search records while an IT solution is being prepared; and what information on strip searches he has tasked the Prison Service IT provider to monitor.

<P>
<a name="21125w31.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The research into strip-searching to be conducted by the University of Nottingham was commissioned as a response to the review of searching. The Prison Service accommodates large and diverse populations all of which may have differing experiences and attitudes to strip-searching. The research was commissioned to identify whether, and if so what, changes can be made in the procedures for strip searching to improve its effectiveness. The aim of the research is to consider the views of staff, their approach and demeanour while conducting strip searches and the perceptions of prisoners of strip searching. A copy of the review of searching is available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21125w31.html_para0">While some records of strip searches are kept, for example of cell searches, to record every search would pose an unacceptable administrative burden and could only be achieved at a disproportionate cost. Manual records do not allow for easy analysis or collation of statistics and it is for these reasons that an Information Technology (IT) solution is being developed.
<P>

<a name="21125w31.html_para1">The IT provider for the Prison Service has been asked to produce a system that will enable all prisons to record the frequency and outcomes of strip searches, to provide information on the prisoner, such as age, gender and ethnicity, the reason for the search, the amount of time taken to conduct the search, a record of finds, and a facility that can generate statistical information on strip searches.

 The Police and Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) are responsible for carrying out technological research for the Prison Service. They are constantly looking at any new technology that is available on the market to ascertain if it would be suitable for use in prisons and the Prison Service has set aside resources to enable the Police Scientific Development Branch to do this. At present, there are no suitable available alternatives capable of finding all items found during a rub down or strip-search, such as drugs, weapons, or other contraband.

 We have looked carefully with local government during the spending reviews at all the pressures that they face. Additionally, we have provided local authorities with increases in general revenue grant since taking office. London boroughs received an average general grant increase of 5.6 per cent. in the current financial year.

<a name="21125w32.html_para0">We have also revised the formats of the grants providing essential living needs of asylum seekers supported under the Asylum Support (Interim Scheme) Regulations 1999, as amended and are looking to do the same with the grant for unaccompanied asylum seeking children.

 In June this year, the London Borough of Redbridge was allocated just over 426,000 to help them reduce the number of homeless families with children in Bed and Breakfast hotels (B&B) and to meet the national commitment of ensuring that by March 2004 no such household is in B&B, other than in an emergency, and even then for no more than six weeks. Rebridge will also benefit from the increased housing benefit subsidy rates, estimated nationally at &pound;10 million, introduced in April this year. This provides additional subsidy to local

<P>

<a name="21125w32.html_para1">The net costs to local authorities of securing accommodation for homeless applicants, apart from those costs related to the use of authorities' own housing stock, are funded through general grant. Grant is distributed through Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) and local authorities' responsibilities in this area are contained within the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services (EPCS) SSA block. The London Borough of Redbridge received an increase in it's EPCS SSA of &pound;1.35m which equals a 3 per cent. increase. For local authorities overall, the EPCS SSA is set to increase by an average of 4 per cent. a year up to 2005/06.

<a name="21125w32.html_para4">In line with all employers in the public and private sector, the Government believes that the civil service should be allowed to determine retirement age policy with regard to its business needs while giving staff as much choice as possible about when they retire. Departments and agencies are free to set the normal retirement age for their own staff subject only to the requirement that the minimum age at which civil servants can retire with full superannuation benefits is 60.
<P>

<a name="21125w32.html_para5">Against this background, 75 per cent. of the civil service now has the option to remain in work until 65, and a further 11 per cent. has the option to remain in work on short service concessions. Those Departments and agencies which have decided that there is a strong case for retaining a retirement age of 60 in the current circumstances will be expected to continue to re-examine the issue and look positively at offering more flexibilities to older staff.

<a name="21125w32.html_para6">The normal retirement age for the senior civil service is 60. However, Heads of Departments and Agency Chief Executives have the flexibility to retain members of the senior civil service beyond 60 if they judge it to be in the public interest and are satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties.

 English Partnerships and the East Midlands Regional Development Agency have already agreed on much of the infrastructure works and marketing of the former Manton Pit site. In addition, reclamation and the agreed level of infrastructure work has been delivered through an agreement with English Partnerships and the East Midlands Regional Development Agency, which is currently on the market. However, both organisations continue to work towards establishing the needs for further works, and may seek approval for further expenditure depending on the outcome of an economic appraisal which they hope to bring to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister early in 2003.

 The Learning Curve, published on 21 October, is the Government's strategy to promote better skills and knowledge for everyone working in neighbourhood renewal. It sets out 23 measures, including face to face advice, regional networks, and an innovative website, renewal.net, to ensure that everyone, including local authority staff working in our most deprived areas can acquire the skills and knowledge they need to deliver real, lasting change. Some measures are already in place, others will be developed with a range of organisations, including the Local Government Association and local authorities, over the coming months.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister welcomes the publication of the report on the Economics of the Park Homes Industry, which makes an important contribution to addressing issues of concern to park home residents. It highlights the importance of site owners taking a professional approach to financial management of the park, and the need for those who are buying a park home to be aware of their current position under the law and of the costs and risks involved.

 The intention of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is to publish the research by Nathaniel Lichfield and Partners on assessing the implementation of PPG3 as soon as possible, however the timing is dependent on satisfactory completion of the report. 90 per cent. of unitary authorities and district councils responding to the questionnaire survey forming part of this research had, by spring 2002, completed an urban housing capacity study or had one in preparation.

 We will announce the new system for distributing formula grant, including detailed grant allocations for individual authorities, at the time of the provisional local government finance settlement which we expect to be around the start of December. Once the Government have allocated its grant, decisions about budgets and services are primarily for local councils to make. However, we have already guaranteed that no authority will face a cut in grant next year on a like for like basis, and we hope to do better than that when we announce the actual floors and ceilings scheme as part of the provisional settlement.

 Local authorities are responsible for homelessness in their areas and as such also take responsibility for the co-ordination and timing of street counts. It is the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister policy that areas where more than ten people are sleeping rough conduct a count at least every twelve months. This would apply to any local authority areas in West Sussex or London.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21125w34.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Guidance was first published in 1996 on counting methodology developed in partnership with charities and voluntary organisations helping people sleeping rough. Independent evaluation has confirmed that the methodology remains the most robust method for measuring relative levels of rough sleeping and of change over time.
<P>

<a name="21125w34.html_para4">Local authorities are responsible for ensuring that the counts are undertaken and that the methodology is followed. The snapshot counts should take place on a single night, between 12 am and 6 am. The definition of people who should be included in rough sleeper counts is clearly set out in the guidance. It is: people sleeping, or bedded down, in the open air (such as on the streets, or in doorways, parks or bus shelters); people in buildings or other places not designed for habitation (such as barns, sheds, car parks, cars, derelict boats, stations or bashes).
<P>

<a name="21125w34.html_para5">There are no current plans to change this methodology. Changing the methodology could reduce the value of counts in measuring change.

 Adults with autism are benefiting from funding of over &pound;200,000 which the Department made through the Section 64 Scheme of Grants to Voluntary Organisations between 1998&#150;99 and 2001&#150;02. We are currently devoting a further &pound;154,000 over three years to the National Autistic Society project XIndependence and Autism: Good Practice for Service Providers". This will support the development of new services to enable adults with autism or Asperger's Syndrome to live independently.
<P>

<a name="21125w36.html_para2">The XValuing People" White Paper directly covers every adult with autism who also has a learning disability. Implementation guidance, issued in August last year, makes clear that adults with Asperger's Syndrome or higher functioning autism are not precluded from using learning disability services, where appropriate, and may require an assessment of their social functioning and communication skills in order to establish their level of need. By bringing together a wide range of local statutory agencies, XValuing People" gives us the scope to improve opportunities and services for people across the autistic spectrum.

 The Government fully recognise the importance of ensuring that the needs of people with dementia and their carers are met. For that reason, the national service framework (NSF) for older people has a standard, a service model and milestones to monitor progress around the health and social needs of older people with mental health problems, including all people with dementia, and requirements around meeting the needs of their carers.

 The Surrey and Sussex Strategic health authority has advised me the former West Sussex health authority did not have a deficit.
<P>

<a name="21125w41.html_para0">The Princess Royal hospital was part of Mid Sussex national health service trust. On 31 March 2002 the trust was dissolved and the management of the acute services provided by the hospital was transferred to the Brighton and Sussex University hospitals NHS trust. The final accounts of the Mid Sussex NHS trust presented an outturn deficit of &pound;2.7 million. However, the underlying deficit was &pound;4.7 million.
<P>

<a name="21125w41.html_para1">In June 2002 the trust was allocated transitional funds of &pound;4 million from the NHS bank to offset the underlying deficit. The trust planned to manage the remainder of the deficit through cash releasing efficiency savings.
