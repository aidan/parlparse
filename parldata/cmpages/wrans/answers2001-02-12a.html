 This is an operational matter for the Highways Agency and I have asked its Chief Executive, Mr. Tim Matthews, to write to my hon. Friend.

<a name="10212w01.html_para0"><i>Letter from Tim Matthews to Mrs. Anne Campbell, dated 12 February 2001:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Keith Hill, has asked me to write in response to your recent Parliamentary Question relating to how much has been spent on trunk roads in Cambridgeshire in each year since 1990-91. I apologise for the delay in replying.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As we do not keep financial data on a county basis, a very lengthy investigation of our records would be required to answer your specific question. In the early 1990's we used Local Authorities to manage trunk roads on our behalf; however, major Improvement Schemes and other major works were managed as a separate programme and costs were not necessarily attributed to an individual county and some schemes crossed county boundaries.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Since the introduction of private sector Managing Agents in 1996, the management of the trunk road network is not constrained by county boundaries. This approach will continue when these contracts are renewed. However, Lord Whitty has asked me to investigate how the Highway Agency's future records could be kept on a regional or sub-regional basis.</FONT></UL>

 <i>[holding answer 22 January 2001]:</i> Expenditure on entertainment by my Department's Ministers in 1999-2000, the latest financial year for which information is available, was &#163;8,347.

<a name="10212w01.html_para5"><i>(b)</i> The term "fly-tipping" is not legally defined but is generally used to refer to the illegal disposal of waste on a site without either a waste management licence or a registered licensing exemption--in contravention of sections 33 or 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. However, it is also an offence under section 33 to dispose of waste in contravention of a licence.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will set out the timetable for publishing and implementing the regulations under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.  [148920]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10212w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Substantial parts of the Act came into force on 30 January 2001 and further provisions, including the whole of Part IV (Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty), will come into force on 1 April 2001. The implementation of many of the remaining provisions depends on the making of a large number of regulations which my Department will be preparing over the next two or three years. Where appropriate, these provisions will be subject to public consultation.
<P>

<a name="10212w01.html_para7">We expect to lay regulations on vehicular access over common land in May. Immediate priority is also being given to regulations for the mapping of access land, the establishment of local access forums, statutory guidance for the preparation of rights of way improvement plans and making provision for disabled people. The implementation of the right of access to open countryside depends primarily on the completion of the mapping programme which the Countryside Agency have in hand.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what recent reports he has received on the safety of King's Cross station in respect of the ventilation of smoke; and if he will make a statement.  [149099]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10212w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 I understand from London Underground that the magazine "Test" has published comparisons of fire safety at various European stations, which included King's Cross. It should be noted that, while the "Test" report contains some very valid points, it also appears to contain some errors in its description of escape routes from King's Cross and takes no account of the following points.
<P>

<a name="10212w01.html_para8">The basic controls against the risk of smoke at King's Cross are the same as those on the rest of London Underground.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Minimisation of potential sources of ignition, in particular strict enforcement of the ban on smoking;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Very careful selection of materials for the construction of stations and trains to minimise the degree to which they can support combustion and give off toxic fumes and smoke if affected by a fire. At King's Cross, all materials used since 1989 have been subject to these controls;</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Well rehearsed evacuation routines, which are used if a fire is suspected. In the case of King's Cross, evacuation is achieved within six minutes.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="10212w01.html_para9">It should also be noted that King's Cross station is being redeveloped. This redevelopment will take into account modern practice in ventilation systems, in particular lessons learned from the Jubilee Line Extension project on active control of air-flows in an emergency.
<P>

<a name="10212w01.html_para10">To summarise, fire safety controls at King's Cross are the best that London Underground can achieve within the current constraints of the site. However, they are compliant with relevant legislation and plans for further improvement are already in hand.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10212w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In Great Britain during the period 1997-99, 10 per cent. of car trips being made between 8 and 9 am during term time were parents dropping children at school. At the peak times of 8.50 in the morning 18 per cent. of car trips were for this purpose.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10212w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The value of the coastline element contained within the Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) for Fire, for 2001-02, for each fire authority in England, is either zero or the amount listed in the table.
<P>

<a name="10212w02.html_para0">These figures are on an "all other things being equal" basis and provide the amount that is allocated by the coastline element. They specifically do not indicate how much each authority benefits from the inclusion of the coastline element, since other factors would change if the coastline element were to be removed from the SSA formula.
<P>

<a name="10212w02.html_para1">The National Assembly for Wales advises that SSAs in Wales do not contain a coastline element for fire services.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many incidents of flooding have occurred in the last three years where raw sewage was involved in the contamination of people's homes and property; and if he will make a statement.  [149080]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10212w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 The last year for which information is available is 1999-2000 when 7,121 properties suffered internal flooding from sewers. In 1998-99 there were 5,202 properties and in 1997-98, there were 7,169.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10212w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the maximum amount which water companies can be fined for failing to ensure their customers are protected from flood damage and sewage flooding; how often, and on which companies, such a fine has been imposed in each of the last three years; and if he will make a statement.  [149516]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10212w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 Flood prevention generally is the responsibility of the Environment Agency. As far as sewer flooding is concerned, there are no statutory provisions in existing water and sewerage legislation which provides for the undertakers to be fined for failing to ensure their customers are protected from such flood damage. Nor does legislation provide for fines in the event of sewer flooding.
<P>

<a name="10212w02.html_para2">Under the Water Supply and Sewerage Services (Customer Service Standards) Regulations 2000, where effluent from sewerage undertaker's sewer enters a customer's building the customer is entitled, subject to certain exceptions, to a refund of his sewerage charges for the year, up to a maximum of &#163;1,000, for each occasion on which it happens.
<P>

<a name="10212w02.html_para3">On 6 November 2000 my Department published for consultation a draft Water Bill containing proposals for legislation. These proposals include empowering the Director General of Water Services, Secretary of State and National Assembly for Wales to fine a water company up to 10 per cent. of its turnover if it fails to meet appointment conditions, standards of performance or certain statutory or other obligations. Subject to the outcome of the consultation exercise the Government propose to introduce the Bill as soon as parliamentary time allows.

November floods on <i>(a)</i> council tax levels and <i>(b)</i> Council Tax Benefit subsidy limitation; and if he will make a statement.  [149444]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10212w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 We received 24 representations during consultation on the Local Government Finance Settlement 2001-02 concerned with the impact of floods on the flood defence levies and local authority budgets. Four responses were concerned with the overall impact on the authority's level of council tax. Two responses were concerned with the impact on the council tax benefit subsidy limitation scheme (CTBSL).
<P>

<a name="10212w02.html_para4">Local authorities affected by floods are eligible for funding under the Bellwin scheme. We have increased the grant for this from 85 per cent. to 100 per cent. of eligible costs above a threshold equivalent to 0.2 per cent. of an authority's annual budget. In addition, the Government have recently announced a package of &#163;11.6 million to pay for the Environment Agency's emergency and repair costs, reducing the costs of flooding being passed on to council taxpayers.
<P>

<a name="10212w02.html_para5">Spending on flood defence is generally a relatively small component of an authority's total budget requirement. It is up to local authorities to determine their spending priorities in consultation with their taxpayers, taking account of the funding available to them. Flood defence expenditure is no different from other items of expenditure and the Government have decided not to make any allowances within the CTBSL scheme for expenditure on flood defence which is above the increase in flood defence SSA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10212w02.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 As part of the special measures introduced to deal with the recent adverse conditions, the Department will settle valid claims within 15 working days of receipt of an application. We have also taken steps to encourage interim unaudited claims. Again these will be paid within 15 workings days.

<P>
<a name="10212w02.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Parish and town councils can claim eligible expenditure through their local authority. The local authority can in turn claim from my Department. Two parish councils have been in touch with my Department and were given the information they required.

 Local authorities are required to produce road safety plans that support the national casualty reduction targets. The full five-year local transport plans have already been assessed and allocations for 2001-02 were based on those assessments. Indicative allocations have

 The six East Lancashire authorities will receive a total of &#163;9,720 million in the coming year through the Housing Investment Programme. This resource can be used by the authorities concerned as they see fit.

 In total local authorities in England spend over &#163;440 million on concessionary travel on public transport each year. That includes travel by young and disabled people, as well as by pensioners. The Local Government Finance Settlement 2001-02 takes account of local authorities responsibilities in this area. It includes an extra &#163;54 million a year which has been made available to cover the costs of the statutory half-fare scheme for pensioners and disabled people on buses under the Transport Act 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what advice he has received over the past 10 years about rising asbestos liabilities; and what action he has taken to ensure that those suffering from asbestos-related diseases were covered by employers liability insurance.  [148915]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10212w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Under the Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969, employers carrying on a business in Great Britain have been required since 1972 to insure their liabilities to employees for bodily injury or disease arising from their employment. The Act is enforced by the Health and Safety Executive. Most public sector employers are exempt from this requirement because their liabilities can be met from public funds. My Department is not aware of any case in the last 10 years where a sufferer was not compensated because an insurer did not indemnify a policyholder in accordance with their policy after liability had been established.

<P>
<a name="10212w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 February 2001]:</i> No discharge consents for fish farms have been issued by the Environment Agency under the Control of Pollution Act 1974. The Environment Act 1995 established the Environment Agency as the regulatory body responsible, among other tasks, for the issuing of water pollution discharge consents. The legislation in force at the time of the Environment Agency's establishment was the Water Resources Act 1991, and it is under this legislation that the Environment Agency has issued discharge consents for fish farms. Information about how many discharge consents for fish farms have been issued by the Environment Agency is not held centrally and I will write to the hon. Member with this information as soon as it is available. The information that the hon.

 In the last three months we have received four representations on the policy of charging council tax on empty properties.
<P>

 Transport has a key role to play in supporting regeneration. The increased investment of &#163;180 billion set out in our 10 Year Plan for transport will, over the next 10 years, deliver significant improvements for our road, rail and local transport infrastructure. It will provide the funding to implement the transport priorities emerging from the new regional transport strategies, regional development strategies, local transport plans and community strategies. It will deliver significantly better public transport and reduced congestion on our roads, and provide better access to jobs and services. It will contribute to the vision set out in our Urban White Paper, published in November, which looks to make urban areas attractive places in which people want to live, with strong economies, better services and improved local environments.

 The Strategic Rail Authority has stated that all new franchises will be based on existing Passenger Service Requirements (PSRs), providing for a specified minimum service level. The existing PSRs are based on the level of services provided by British Rail at the time initial franchises were let.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10212w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Many local authority and large scale voluntary transfer (LSVT) landlords cross subsidise the costs of support services for their tenants, such as warden services in sheltered housing, from their general rent income. This practice will stop when the Supporting People policy is implemented in April 2003. However, I am pleased to say that the Government will be making additional provision available through the new Supporting People grant in 2003-04 to cover these costs in full.
<P>

<a name="10212w05.html_para2">In the light of this, there will be no need for local authority or LSVT landlords to increase charges to tenants, either now or in 2003-04 when Supporting People is introduced. Draft guidance will shortly be circulated to local authority and LSVT landlords setting out how these cross subsidies should be identified and recommending that these particular landlords freeze the amounts that sheltered housing tenants pay for their support services at 2000-01 levels in real terms.
<P>

<a name="10212w05.html_para3">When Supporting People starts funding these services in April 2003, the local authority and LSVT landlords concerned will retain the savings they make by ending cross subsidies. As a condition of paying the additional Supporting People grant, we will expect these landlords to demonstrate how they will make effective use of these resources to deliver the Government's housing policy objectives more fully and more quickly, for example by improving the condition of their housing stock and the quality of their housing management services.

The provisions of the Code in relation to live conversation services are underpinned by a condition in network operators' licences which is enforceable by Oftel. Following consultation in 1999-2000, Oftel drew up a statement proposing measures to strengthen the regulatory regime through statutory underpinning of a Code applying to most PRS, not just live services.

 Universal Banking Services has two elements. Under the first element the banks will make their basic bank accounts accessible at post offices. The second element of the proposition is a service for people who are unable or unwilling to open even a basic bank account. This account, available only through post offices will allow benefits claimants to access their benefits in cash at a post office using a Post Office based card instead of an order book or giro. Both basic bank accounts and the Post Office card accounts will be available to people with an existing bank account. The Post Office card account will, however, be available only to persons in receipt of pensions, benefits or tax credits. Beyond that there are no plans for there to be any other eligibility restrictions.

 According to the Government of India's most recent published data, in 1999 their official debt to the UK was 167.9 million rupees (&#163;2.5 million at the present exchange rate), while their official debt to the European Union was 212.53 billion rupees (&#163;3.16 billion).
<P>

<a name="10212w07.html_para2">The UK supports and advocates debt relief for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries which are undertaking pro-poor economic reforms. But India's external debt position is moderate, with a debt-service ratio of 16 per cent. (as of March 2000), and large-scale international reserves (estimated at US$ 40 billion). We are not therefore pressing for cancellation of India's debt. However our development assistance in India includes substantial support to help the Indian Government reform and improve their fiscal management, particularly at the State level where fiscal deficits are high.

 The opportunities for assisting Baghdad-controlled Iraq are greatly constrained by the regime's policies. We are spending some &#163;5 million this financial year to help rehabilitate water and sanitation systems which should reduce risks to children's health. In northern Iraq, through Save the Children's Fund and other non-governmental organisations, we are funding programmes to improve children's well-being. This financial year we expect to spend some &#163;1.25 million.

<a name="10212w07.html_para3">The UN's oil-for-food programme is contributing significantly to improved life opportunities and reduced infant and child mortality for children in the areas of Iraq not controlled from Baghdad.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10212w09.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We are improving maternity benefits as part of our drive to help women achieve a better balance between paid work and family life. Last year we extended Maternity Allowance (MA) to low-paid employed and self-employed working women and increased the rate of benefit for self-employed women. These improvements mean that around 16,000 low-paid working women will get MA for the first time and around 11,000 self-employed women will receive a higher rate of benefit.
<P>

<a name="10212w09.html_para13">On 7 December last year the Department of Trade and Industry published a consultation document "Work and Parents: Competitiveness or Choice" which sets out a wide range of options and invites views on what the priority measures are that will help working parents at the same time as helping business. The document contains options to extend maternity benefits, which include increasing the flat rate of maternity pay and extending the maternity pay period as well as improvements to parental leave.
<P>

<a name="10212w09.html_para14">The consultation period ends on 7 March 2001 and we will take account of the responses we receive when considering which options should be taken forward.

 There is no official poverty line defined by the Government. Poverty and social exclusion are complex multi-dimensional issues, affecting many aspects of people's lives--their income, health, housing, the quality of the environment, opportunities to work and to learn. There is no single measure which can capture the complex problems which need to be overcome.

 As set out in the White Paper, "Smoking Kills", the Government's tobacco control strategy involves a comprehensive health education programme backed up by local cessation services.
<P>

<a name="10212w10.html_para0">The education programme is supported by a national telephone helpline which, besides offering information, advice and support, can direct smokers to their local services.
<P>

<a name="10212w10.html_para1">A national network of National Health Service smoking cessation services provides expert help to smokers wanting to give up, and up to six weeks free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is available to smokers entitled to free prescriptions. The cessation aid Zyban (Buproprion) is already available on NHS prescription and we are considering the outcome of a recent consultation exercise on a proposal to provide all NRT products on this basis.

 In 2000, at least 442 residents from the Gateshead and South Tyneside health authority area died from smoking related diseases. This figure is based on percentages of lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease and cerebro-vascular disease deaths. The true figure is likely to be higher as other diseases have been excluded and smoking rates in the area are higher than the United Kingdom average.

 Parts of the Jarrow constituency have been classed as an area for special action within the Tyne and Wear Health Action Zone (HAZ). The HAZ co-ordinates a positive health campaign within the constituency which tackles areas such as smoking cessation, healthy eating, health promotion, accident prevention and physical activity.
<P>

<a name="10212w11.html_para0">Examples of projects within the Positive Health Campaign include the Jarrow Festival smoking cessation project; positive health campaigns at St Aloysius and Greenfields Schools; an aromatherapy project at the PHAB Club; Fitness Up North; a rehabilitation service at the Charles Palmer Centre, Palmer Community Hospital;

<a name="10212w11.html_para1">In addition to the above, the South Tyneside Health Care NHS Trust's Palmer Hospital is affiliated to the World Health Authority's health promoting hospital initiative and is involved in the provision of health related information for patients. The Community Learning Centre project uses the district hospital site as a computer and training access point for the South Tyneside College. The Food Education and Action in South Tyneside partnership with the local authority aims to revive the place of healthy eating among young people. Smoking cessation initiatives include specialist clinics and "smokefree schools awards". Finally, the trust gives seminars to local employers on health issues such as developing policies on stress, smoking and alcohol.

 Development of the cross- departmental teenage pregnancy strategy drew on a full analysis of United Kingdom and international research in the area. There is no direct evidence to suggest any relationship between levels of teenage conceptions and material or financial support for teenage parents. Research does, however, suggest that support offered by a young woman's parents may impact on her decision whether to continue with a pregnancy. Further information on this will become available as the impact of the strategy is evaluated.

 <i>[holding answer 9 February 2001]:</i> As sub-committees of health authorities, the management costs of a primary care group (PCG) fall to a health authority. Primary care trusts (PCTs) are, however, free standing National Health Service bodies and therefore their management costs are separate from a health authority. However, where PCTs are established, the local health authority will contribute management resources as part of their delegation of functions to a PCT. In addition, PCTs will also receive additional management resources from within that health system to reflect any provider responsibilities that they take on from local NHS trusts.
<P>

<a name="10212w12.html_para0">PCT management costs reflect their increased responsibilities compared to PCGs. The overall expenditure on the management and administration of the NHS is falling in real terms under this Government. The management cost savings achieved so far have included the additional costs of PCGs and the targeted continued reductions for current and future years will include the cost of PCTs.

<a name="10212w13.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 The National Child Care Strategy aims to ensure that affordable, accessible, quality child care is available in every neighbourhood. The Working Families Tax Credit offers help with child care costs to lower income families. &#163;170 million is also being made available until the end of 2003 through the New Opportunities Fund to help start up out of school hours care. By 2003-04, the Department's investment in child care will have trebled from &#163;66 million in this financial year to over &#163;200 million. The Government also intend to make a further &#163;155 million available over the next three years from the New Opportunities Fund. This extra investment will be largely targeted in disadvantaged areas and on childminders. Through the Neighbourhood Nurseries Initiative, we expect to create 45,000 child care places, in up to 900 new 50-place nurseries. Around 50,000 out of school hours clubs in disadvantaged areas are expected to achieve extra start-up support. The Morecambe and Lunesdale area is eligible for the new support being made available for disadvantaged areas. 145,000 childminder places and 450 childminder networks will have been started up by 2004.
<P>

<a name="10212w13.html_para2">New child care places for 546,000 children have been created between April 1997 and September 2000. Taking into account turnover, this has helped an extra 343,000 children. As part of the Strategy 150 Early Years and Child Care Development Partnerships (EYDCPs) have been set up across England <sup>1</sup>  to develop new child care places and maintain existing ones across the whole of their local area. Since April 1999 Lancashire EYDCP has created child care places for 487 children in the Morecambe and Lunesdale area and, taking into account turnover, this has helped an extra 125 children.

The project is based in the Morecambe and Lune Valley areas and focuses on establishing a partnership between early education providers and the voluntary and private sectors and childminders leading to a co-ordinated seamless child care and early education service for children and families. One of the aims of the project is to help meet the needs of families for whom lack of transport is a barrier to accessing child care, and will include the provision of a mobile nursery facility to operate in rural areas.

 We made a commitment, last October, to introduce age legislation within six years, by signing the European Employment directive on Equal Treatment. We have negotiated a long implementation period to give us the scope to consult closely with employers and expert groups to prepare workable and beneficial age legislation.
<P>

<a name="10212w13.html_para4">In the meantime we will continue to tackle age discrimination by promoting vigorously the non-statutory Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment, which was launched in June 1999. The Code has been promoted to employers through trade press, events and awards initiatives. It sets the standard for non-ageist practices and promotes the business benefits of age diversity in the work force. We must overcome ageist stereotypes and employers need to understand that younger and older workers can add value to their business. In the years leading up to legislation, we want to take employers with us, so that they work with the spirit, not just the letter of the law. In that way we will build up the real culture change we need to overcome discrimination.

As a result of the extension of the deadline 86 per cent. of appointed governors have now arranged or completed discussions with advisers.

<P>
<a name="10212w15.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We value the significant contribution which members of the reserve forces continue to make to operations in the Balkans. Reservists bring a wide range of specialist skills to the regular units they support in the combat, combat support and combat service support areas.

<a name="10212w15.html_para9">The reserves have consistently provided between 10 and 14 per cent. of the manpower for the UK's contribution to NATO operations in the former Yugoslavia since operations commenced in 1995. Currently, reservists represent about 10 per cent. of our forces in Bosnia and Kosovo.

 Over the three successive annual planning rounds since the inception of the Smart Procurement Initiative, we have identified cost reductions attributable to Smart Procurement which total &#163;2 billion over the ten-year period 1998 to 2008.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10212w15.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Over 60,000 new contracts are placed each year and the Ministry of Defence does not record the number of jobs created or sustained as a result of each individual procurement decision. However, it is estimated that the number of UK jobs dependent on defence expenditure and equipment exports was 355,000 in 1997-98 and 345,000 in 1998-99.

 I refer the hon. Member to the announcement I made in the House on 24 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 777-89, about our decision to proceed with the implementation of the Core Competence model for the DERA public-private partnership. Under Core Competence, around three-quarters of the current DERA organisation will be turned into a company, referred to as new DERA. For strategic reasons, the remainder will be retained within the Ministry of Defence to carry out functions that could not appropriately be transferred to the private sector.
<P>

<a name="10212w15.html_para12">At the present time no firm decision has been made as to exactly which assets currently held by DERA will be transferred to the new company. If, however, the equipment is RAF owned and on loan to DERA then it will retain that status and be issued to the new company under normal contractual arrangements.

 Multinational Defence Co-operation is a long established feature of Britain's defence. It brings a variety of benefits, including enhanced inter-operability, more efficient provision of capability and a fairer sharing of the defence burden. We are currently pursuing a number of new co-operative initiatives with a range of Allies and partners.

 Women already serve on the front line in ships and aircraft and in combat support roles in the Army. The remaining posts closed to women are mainly in the Royal Marines General Service Cadres, Household Cavalry and Royal Armoured Corps, Infantry and the RAF Regiment. In addition, for health reasons women do not serve in submarines or as clearance divers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10212w16.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 It is not feasible for the Ministry of Defence to make such an assessment as the numbers required depend on how contractors construct the ships, and we are encouraging them to be innovative in this to improve value for money. None the less, we keep under review a broad assessment of whether there is sufficient capacity in UK shipyards to undertake our forward Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary shipbuilding programme. From this we believe that there is sufficient capacity in UK shipyards to undertake our forward warship building programme.

 A contract was placed on 20 December with BAE Systems Electronics--the nominated prime contractor for the type 45 programme--for the Demonstration and First-of-Class Manufacture phase covering the completion of the design and build of the first three type 45 destroyers.

<a name="10212w16.html_para1">Our procurement strategy as announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence in the House on 11 July 2000 has not changed.

It is expected that the prime contractor will be in a position to place shipbuilding contracts later this year.

<a name="10212w16.html_para4">In addition to this direct employment, the MOD supports a significant number of defence-related jobs throughout the UK. While DASA (the Defence Analytical Services Agency) does not produce estimates of these

employment levels for local authority areas, their estimate <sup>1</sup>  of the defence-related employment for Scotland as a whole is set out in the table.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> <sup>1</sup>  The method used to provide national and regional employment estimates requires the combination of two elements. First, a breakdown of MOD equipment expenditure with UK industry (using the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)) and second, a measure of sales per employee for each of the industries receiving defence spending (derived from the ONS Business Enquiry and the Labour Market Survey). Dividing the first by the second gives an estimate of those employed directly on defence contracts. These estimates do not include indirect employment. The figures exclude MOD Civilian and Service Personnel. The full estimation methodology is outlined in Defence Statistics Bulletin No. 3). There is no internal method of isolating the amount of employment generated as a direct result of any one procurement decision. The sales per head data used in calculating the data do not distinguish between individual projects and is more an indiction of permanent or ongoing employment within a defence contractor. DASA rely for their information on a Defence Bills Agency (DBA) database--the Monthly Journal of Records (MJRECS), which is populated, in part by data from the DEFFORM 57. This form is completed by commercial staff each time a new MOD headquarters contract is placed (as opposed to Local Purchase Order). The DEFFORM gives quite a detailed picture of the type of contract placed e.g. on pricing, and information describing the region where a contract is placed. The form utilises a 'location of work code'. MOD expenditure on equipment in the UK is derived from the MOD Central Ledger (Return 5) and can be split by region using data from MJRECS--detailed. Each expenditure has a location code for the prime contractor in the transaction. The proportion of expenditure, which might be spent in the region, is determined by the location of the prime contractor and does not take account of those of sub-contractors. The proportions calculated from MJRECS are then applied to total expenditure on equipment in the UK to find the values in each region. Using sales per head data we are able to calculate estimates of employment dependent on equipment expenditure by applying them to regional breakdown derived from MJRECS.</FONT></UL>

 Retailers participating in the asylum voucher scheme are not required to keep records of the sums they retain as a result of the no change policy.

Some, including all minors, apply for registration, either as an entitlement or at the Home Secretary's discretion.

The Integrated Casework Directorate has reliable intake figures only for both types of application combined. Separate intake figures for naturalisation are not available.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the additional cost to each police force in England and Wales has been of administration associated with Best Value; and if he will make a statement.  [150042]<P>

<a name="10212w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The administration cost associated with Best Value is not collected centrally by the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="10212w19.html_para1">The Government are confident that Best Value will, over the five year period, save police authorities and forces more than they spend as well as improving police performance across the board.
