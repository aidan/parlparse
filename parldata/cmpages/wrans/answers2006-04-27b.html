 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what reasons underlay the Government&#039;s decision not to include community transport schemes within the definition of bus services eligible for the purposes of statutory concessionary travel schemes under the Travel Concessions (Eligible Services) Order 2002; and if he will make a statement.

 The Travel Concessions (Eligible Services) Order 2002 was made under the Transport Act 2000 and reflects the policy that the statutory entitlement to concessionary fares applies to local bus travel.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will instruct his officials to review the Local Transport Plan highway maintenance allocation to Peterborough city council for 2006&#150;07, with particular reference to the impact of the formulaic approach to capital allocation; and if he will make a statement.  [66751]</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60427w01.html_spnew3"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 In December 2004 Peterborough was given indicative allocations for highway maintenance in the Local Transport Plan settlement of &#163;2.409 million for 2005&#150;06 and &#163;2.209 million for 2006&#150;07.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60427w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">These sums were calculated by formula and included specific amounts for strengthening structures on the primary route network. The formula had a dampening mechanism that prevented maintenance allocations varying by more than 25 per cent. from the previous year, and in the case of Peterborough the sums given to them for primary route work had the effect of depressing the amount available to them for other maintenance work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60427w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">A consultation on the LTP maintenance formula took place in 2005, and it was decided that from 2007&#150;08 primary route network allocations will not be included when applying the 25 per cent. year on year dampening mechanism. This will rectify the problem experienced by Peterborough.

 DFID tracks its bilateral expenditure by monitoring expenditure against specific sector objectives, one of which is improved governance. This includes different aspects of state building such as support to improve popular participation in the decision making process, and building capacity to improve government&#039;s accountability to its citizens. It also covers the encouragement of more pluralist and democratic political systems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60427w03.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_10">Some funding decisions are still being taken, however, given the importance that DFID attaches to governance, I would expect the share of bilateral governance expenditure to be at least maintained at current levels, and probably increased. Based on figures for 2005&#150;06 this suggests somewhere in the order of &#163;347 million or 13.9 per cent. of the total bilateral spend.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60427w03.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_11">In addition, DFID provides funding to a number of multilateral institutions such as the European Development Fund, World Bank, United Nations Agencies and Regional Development Banks, and this is pooled with other donors. In many cases these institutions support a range of activities, including governance. The UK share of this is not tracked.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60427w04.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_17">CPET checked the PEFC scheme in February 2006 to see how the endorsed national schemes were implementing the new requirements introduced by the PEFC Council in 2004 and 2005. CPET examined 14 national schemes, one of which was the Australian Forest Certification Scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60427w04.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_18">CPET did not assess the performance outcomes of the Australian Forest Standard. Instead the focus was on whether the PEFC system had been adopted at the national scheme level. The Government have decided to give further consideration to the PEFC scheme as part of a wider review of all the forest certification schemes assessed by CPET in 2004. This was announced in Defra News release 144/06 on 30 March 2006, see: http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2006/060330g.htm

 The Central Point of Expertise on Timber (CPET) may assess a forest certification scheme as no longer meeting the Government&#039;s criteria for robust assurance of sustainable timber sources but it would be for the Government to decide what advice CPET should give to central departments as a result.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60427w04.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_19">The circumstances under which a forest certification scheme would fail the test for credible assurance are explained in the CPET document&#151;&quot;Criteria for Evaluating Certification Schemes&quot;&#151;see CPET website at http://www.proforest.net/cpet. In essence, if a scheme were assessed as scoring zero on any one of the relevant assessment criteria or scoring less than 75 per cent. of the total possible score on the relevant criteria then it would fail the test. Any such failure would cause the Government to consider changing the status of that scheme in respect of the level of assurance it would accept.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures the Government are taking to ensure that the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification scheme includes mandatory and enforceable minimum standards for all its national members.  [65246]</p>








<p><a name="st_28"><a name="60427w04.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Government currently accept certificates from the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) scheme as assurance of legal and sustainable timber sources. This acceptance is subject to the UK Government being satisfied that national forest certification schemes endorsed by PEFC are all applying the PEFC standard consistently in their own countries. A sample check has been undertaken to establish to position. The initial findings led the Government to conclude that further examination and consultation should be undertaken before reaching a decision and that the forthcoming review of PEFC and the other schemes assessed by the Central Point of Expertise on Timber would provide an appropriate opportunity to do that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60427w04.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_20">The Government cannot ensure that PEFC includes mandatory and enforceable minimum standards for all its national members. PEFC is an independent private sector organisation that sets its own standard and system requirements for implementation. However, the UK Government could choose not to accept PEFC certificates as assurance of responsible timber sources and that is why we are undertaking the assessments and reviews already mentioned.

<p><a name="st_30"><a name="60427w04.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The outstanding issues relate to the decision making process for forest management standard setting as adopted by the national schemes that have been endorsed by the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). The PEFC Council&#039;s new requirement for standard setting is that

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;The formal approval of standards shall be based on evidence of consensus&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60427w04.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_21">An initial examination of some of the national schemes showed that the various national decision making processes were not identical. Subsequent information supplied by the schemes indicated that the processes adopted may nevertheless result in compliance with the PEFC Council requirements but the situation was not at all clear-cut and called for more examination.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60427w04.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_22">Another factor considered was the impending review of all the forest certification schemes assessed by CPET in 2004. The Government has decided that this review will, in addition to examining published scheme requirements, consider evidence of failure to adopt scheme system requirements. A decision now on PEFC&#039;s probationary status may be overturned following the review. That would create significant confusion in the market place and loss of credibility for the CPET assessment process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60427w04.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_23">The UK Government was mindful of the implications any ill judged decision would have on all the stakeholders involved and was anxious to be as objective and fair as possible. Consequently, the decision was to postpone making a decision on PEFC&#039;s probationary status until after the review of schemes scheduled for late spring 2006.

 Failure to comply with an enforcement notice which has taken effect is an offence. A person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to a fine which shall be determined by the courts. The maximum penalty for an offence is &#163;30,000 on summary conviction in the magistrates court. If a person is convicted in a Crown court then the fine could be unlimited. In determining the amount of any fine to be imposed on a person, the legislation indicates that the court shall in particular have regard to any financial benefit which has accrued or appears likely to accrue in consequence of the offence.

The figure of 1,750 in the earlier answer (43079) was based on a whole year count of students, which counts students who were in attendance at any point in the academic year. It is not possible to give a time series back to 1997/98 using the whole year count for all years, so the snapshot count has been used for consistency. An additional column has been added to the table to show students split by subject in 2004/05 using the whole year count.<br>

<sup>(17)</sup> In 2002/03, a new subject classification, and a new method of allocating students to subjects, were introduced, which means that the figures for the years up to 2001/02 are not directly comparable with those for later years. The new allocation method takes account of all subjects studied by the student rather than just their main subject, and the main effect of this is to decrease the number of students who are allocated to the &quot;combined&quot; category, and increase the number of students who are allocated to specific named subjects.<br>

<p><a name="st_123"><a name="60427w13.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 There is no factual evidence to either support or discount an uncommanded flying control movement of 12 degree nose pitch down by RAF Chinook ZD576 prior to impact into the Mull of Kintyre. There is, however, the physical evidence at the crash site and wreckage characteristics which indicate that the aircraft first impacted the hillside while climbing at relatively high forward ground speed in an erect, steeply nose up attitude. The evidence for this is the alignment of the aircraft controls. The collective control, which controls power was set at or near full travel at impact, with the cyclic control, which controls pitch or elevation, at 25 per cent. aft and 23 per cent. left of neutral, all indicating a demand for high power and nose-up attitude prior to impact.

<p><a name="st_124"><a name="60427w13.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Autorotation is defined as the unpowered rotation of helicopter rotor blades that may occur during engine failure, thereby allowing the aircraft to effectively &#039;glide&#039; to a safe landing. The minimum height at which autorotation is considered safe for a Chinook HC2 is 100 ft above ground level. Weight has no significant impact on autorotation flight performance. However, practice autorotations for Chinooks are not allowed to be carried out above the regulatory maximum weight of 20,000 kg.

<p><a name="st_137"><a name="60427w14.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 The UK atmospheric nuclear tests took place in areas with high levels of tropical insect pests which presented a risk to health. To minimise this, aerial spraying of DDT was carried out. There is no reliable evidence that DDT causes adverse health effects in man and the Ministry of Defence has not undertaken any specific assessment of the risks associated with the use of DDT in nuclear testing.

<p><a name="st_138"><a name="60427w14.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 In 1983, the Ministry of Defence commissioned from the National Radiological Protection Board and Imperial Cancer Research Fund an independent epidemiological study of participants of the UK atmospheric nuclear tests, including those present at the 1958 Christmas Island tests. The study compared a representative group of over 20,000 participants with a control group of men who did not take part in the tests but were otherwise similar. Analyses of mortality and cancer incidence in the groups have been published in the peer-reviewed mainstream medical literature in 1988, 1993 and 2003. These studies showed that overall mortality and cancer incidence was similar both in the participant and control groups and lower than the UK national rate, The 1988 study suggested a slightly raised level of multiple myeloma in participants compared with controls. However, this was not confirmed in the 1993 and 2003 reports and is likely to have been due to chance. There does appear, from all three studies, to be a small increased risk of leukaemias in test participants, apart from chronic lymphatic leukaemia, especially in the early years after the test. The MOD has not formally assessed the health of offspring of UK atmospheric nuclear test participants and is unaware of any such studies in the international published peer-reviewed medical or scientific literature.
