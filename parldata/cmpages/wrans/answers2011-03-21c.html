 Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) programmes are available to assist those in the UK asylum system and those who are in the UK illegally who wish to return voluntarily and permanently to their country of origin (or, where permanently admissible, to a third country). There are currently three general AVR programmes which are co-funded with the European Return Fund:</p>

Returnees receive support in acquiring travel documentation, flight to country of origin and onward domestic transport, airport assistance at departure and arrival airports and up to £1,500 worth of reintegration assistance per person including a £500 relocation grant on departure for immediate resettlement needs, additional luggage allowance and, once home, a range of reintegration options.

Returnees receive support in acquiring travel documentation, flight to country of origin and onward domestic transport, airport assistance at departure and arrival airports and up to £2,000 worth of reintegration assistance per person, including a £500 relocation grant on departure for immediate resettlement needs, additional luggage allowance and, once home, a range of reintegration options. The scheme offers flexibility of reintegration for the whole family and increased emphasis is placed on the use of reintegration assistance for educational needs as well as income generation.</p>

There is generally no reintegration assistance for AVRIM applicants; however, there is discretionary reintegration assistance of up to £1,000, considered on a case by case basis, available for vulnerable applicants. In addition to the general AVR programmes, the Facilitated Return Scheme is designed to help non-EEA foreign national prisoners return and reintegrate back into their home country. The main aim of the scheme is to promote and assist the process of early removals by encouraging full compliance and cooperation of foreign national prisoners wishing to return voluntarily.</p>

<sup>(1)</sup> The cautions statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When an offender has been cautioned for two or more offences at the same time the principal offence is the more serious offence.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> From 1 June 2000 the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 came into force nationally and removed the use of cautions for persons under 18 and replaced them with reprimands and warnings. These figures have been included in the totals.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke), would only recommend exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy in relation to a criminal conviction if new evidence had come to light which had not been considered by the court and it was impractical to refer the case to an appellate court to hear the new evidence. This policy reflects the constitutional position that it is the courts, not the Government, which decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence and, if they are, the appropriate sentence.</p>

 If an increased discount for an early guilty plea had the desired effect of encouraging defendants to plead guilty at an earlier stage in the proceedings, it would potentially reduce burdens on the police (and the Crown Prosecution Service) to the extent that less effort would need to be devoted to assembling evidence, and on the probation service to the extent that where shorter sentences were imposed, a smaller percentage of offenders would be subject to post release supervision and these periods of supervision would also be shorter resulting in a reduction in probation workload, although it would also be possible for there to be greater demand on the service through a long community order rather than a short prison sentence. Victims and witnesses would benefit from a prompt resolution of the case, as they would no longer need to worry about having to go to court to give evidence. We would not anticipate that there would be any effect on businesses.</p>

 The first priority in DEFRA's business plan is to support British farming and encourage sustainable food production. Sustainable farming is essential to protect the natural resources on which future food production depends, and to protect biodiversity and the countryside. We are working closely with industry partners to achieve this: by backing the industry led Campaign for the Farmed Environment and Greenhouse Gas Action Plan. Specific support that DEFRA provides to farmers to help them undertake sustainable farming is funding via the Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) in the form of agri-environment schemes such as Entry Level Stewardship, Higher Level Stewardship and Uplands Entry Level Stewardship. We also provide advice and guidance on effective nutrient management of land to maximise efficiency whilst minimising environmental impacts.</p>

 As indicated in the 'Renewable Heat Incentive' report published by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) on 10 March, the Government recognise that at farm scale some energy crops may be required in combination with slurries and that such crops can be grown as part of the normal agricultural rotation. Furthermore, there is land available which is not suitable for the production of food crops but which may, therefore, be used to supply energy-crop only anaerobic digestion (AD) plants. However, it is not our policy to encourage energy crop-based AD, particularly where these crops are grown to the exclusion of food producing crops.</p>

 Two parties were directly involved in the seed contamination incident in the Somerton and Frome constituency in 2008. They were the farmer who grew some of the affected seed in part of a field on his holding, and the company who owned the seed. The latter was a subsidiary of Aardvark Investments SA. The GT73 trait is owned by the company Monsanto. The conventional seed variety is not being considered for inclusion on the UK National List.</p>

In this, the GM Freeze organisation appealed against a decision by the Information Commissioner that DEFRA was justified in not disclosing the precise location of the Somerset incident, in part because it would serve to reveal the identity of the farmer and could unfairly prejudice his interests. After considering the matter in detail, the tribunal has recently decided to dismiss the GM Freeze appeal, upholding the stance taken by the Information Commissioner and DEFRA.</p>

 In the past there has not been the political space in Egypt for a strong democratic opposition to be able to develop.

A key first step to this action will be a new law on political parties. We understand that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces will issue such a law shortly after the referendum on constitutional reforms. We will continue to urge the Egyptian Government to engage in meaningful dialogue with opposition and activist groups to build trust with them so as to enable the aspirations of the people to be realised.</p>

 According to International Monetary Fund figures, economic growth across the Palestinian Territories was 6.8% in 2009.

 The UK imports small quantities of oil from the Persian Gulf, so physical supplies are not directly affected by the problem of piracy off the Somali coast. However, the phenomenon is a concern because the undisrupted supply of Gulf oil to global markets helps to ensure stable oil prices, including for UK consumers. The UK imports increasing volumes of liquefied natural gas from the Gulf, which uses the same maritime routes, and UK-flagged vessels and their crews are vulnerable to the threat of piracy.</p>

<i> [holding answer 14 March 2011]:</i> The relocation of Government staff outside of London continues to be considered among other options to deliver the savings set out at the spending review and increase the efficiency of the Government's estate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="110321w0003.htm_para31"><a name="11032133000770">It is the Government's property strategy to implement and manage a system of national property controls across the central civil and operational estate as well as setting up property vehicles (PVs) that will make savings through a more co-ordinated approach to property asset management of the central civil office estate. As a first step, the Government Property Unit will set up pilot PVs for the central London and Bristol office estate from 2011-12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="110321w0003.htm_para32"><a name="11032133000771">The current spending controls on Government property will result in a reduction in both the cost and size of the estate. To date, the national property controls have produced estate cost reductions of around £50 million. As the estate reduces in size, retained buildings will be utilised more intensively wherever possible. This reduction of property in London and elsewhere could see posts being relocated to areas close to London, and where there is a strong business case, to other parts of the country.</p>

1. The information provided is management information. Our preference is to answer all parliamentary questions using Official/National Statistics but in this case, we only have management information available. It is not quality assured to the same extent as Official/National Statistics and there are some issues with the data, for example, figures given are estimates. Actuals are not available. Estimates for 2010-11 may be revised after the end of the cold weather payment season, but will still be estimates not actuals.<br>
2. A cold weather payment is made to an eligible customer when the average temperature has been recorded as, or is forecast to be, 0° C or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the customer's postcode. (When the temperature criterion is met, the weather station is said to trigger.)<br>
3. Each of Gravesend and Heathrow weather stations is linked both to an area within the London borough of Bexley and also to an area outside the London borough of Bexley. Estimated numbers given are for the weather station as a whole, not for the part of the London borough of Bexley linked to the weather station.<br>
4. Estimates of potential qualifiers for each weather station for 2010-11 were made at the beginning of the winter. Both Gravesend and Heathrow weather stations have already triggered this winter, so the estimated number of benefit units that received at least one cold weather payment in 2010-11 will not change during the rest of the winter. The estimates for 2010-11 may be revised once the national out-turn for the winter is known.<br>
5. Cold weather payments are made to benefit units. A benefit unit can be a single person or a couple and can include children.<br>
6. Some benefit units received more than one payment in a year.<br>
7. Estimated numbers have been rounded to the nearest 100.<br>

On further investigation the scale of the problem was far greater than originally anticipated, taking three weeks to be resolved. The Department did not intend to mislead Parliament, however given the eventual scale of the issue we accept that we should have informed Parliament of this situation. Since the House returned on 28 February the Department has answered over 600 questions.</p>

During the first three years of the contracts the Department will also be paying an attachment fee to providers.

 The European Commission has yet to announce the scope and nature of its proposed review of EU health and safety legislation. Consequently, it is not yet possible to provide a meaningful or accurate estimate of how much it would cost. The Government will work to ensure that any future proposals respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, and are accompanied by a full impact assessment. Provided these principles are respected, in principle, a review of EU legislation in this field could provide the opportunity and evidence for removing obsolete or inefficient laws. In particular it could be used to examine which EU health and safety rules for low risk businesses are overly prescriptive, which are disproportionate and which seek unnecessarily to eliminate risk instead of managing it. These aims would be consistent with the recommendations in "Common Sense, Common Safety", which the Government accepted in October 2010.</p>

 We are considering the delivery model for the personal independence payment assessment and no decisions have yet been taken. We recognise the importance of ensuring that the assessment process is appropriate to individual's circumstances, including individuals with autistic spectrum disorders. We are clear that if an individual is able to bring someone who knows them well with them to a face-to-face consultation, and wishes to do so, this will be welcomed. It will of course be essential to ensure that we get the processes right and we will be keen to work with disabled people and their organisations as we further develop these.</p>

 The Commission Communication "An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs" makes no specific proposals in relation to social security beyond calling for an awareness campaign on the EU social security coordination rules so that citizens understand their rights when moving within Europe. This campaign has been designed by the European Commission and does not involve any direct costs to the public purse or transfer of powers from the UK. Furthermore, the campaign does not change in any way conditions for receiving social security benefits, and the UK already has in place strict controls on access to non-contributory benefits for migrants.</p>

This was defined by Council Principles in December 2007. The term is applied to a range of measures within national competence under the long-running European Employment Strategy, now incorporated into Europe 2020, which allows for coordination between member states. Flexicurity seeks to improve the flexibility of labour markets while providing adequate security of employment. The UK is one of the leading models in this regard and we are promoting our approaches to welfare reform with other countries so that across the EU more people are in employment.</p>

 Under universal credit, couples living in the same household will make a joint claim for the benefit payment and we assume that ordinarily the payment will be made as a single sum to the household. In recognition of the fact that different households organise their finances and budget in different ways, we are allowing couples to decide between them whether the money goes to a joint bank account or to one or other of them.</p>

We are establishing a new framework, with increased responsibility on universities to widen participation. Universities wanting to charge more than a £6,000 annual graduate contribution will have to demonstrate what more they will do to attract more students from disadvantaged backgrounds through outreach activities, targeted scholarships and other financial support. The Director of the Office for Fair Access issued guidance to universities on 8 March setting out his expectations of what Access Agreements should cover. Universities wanting to charge more than a £6,000 graduate contribution will also have to participate in the new National Scholarships Programme, which will be worth £150 million by 2014-15.</p>

 Lord Browne's recommendations on a tariff were intended to introduce more competition into the system by allowing institutions with higher demand to expand in response to student choice. While we currently have no plans to introduce a minimum tariff score for entry to higher education, we are interested in exploring whether there could be some categories of students with higher UCAS scores for whom a tariff approach could work. But decisions about admission to university will remain a matter for individual universities, and not for Government. We will set out proposals in the forthcoming White Paper.</p>

As part of PMS, performance review meetings are held every six months between BIS and each of the Research Councils and Research Councils UK.
