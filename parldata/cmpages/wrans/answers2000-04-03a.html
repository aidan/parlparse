To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list the notional time commitment of each chair of the regional non-departmental public bodies.  [116360]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The time commitment for chairs of the Post Office Users Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is up to 50 days per annum. The average commitment for the chairs of the seven Regional Industrial Development Boards is of the order of one meeting a month lasting approximately two hours, plus the time required to read case papers beforehand.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 A list of non-departmental public bodies to which DTI Ministers make appointments, and information on the numbers of male and female board members each body has, can be found in the publication "Public Bodies 1999" (ISBN 0 11 430159 X), copies of which are available in the Library of the House.

<a name="00403w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when the French Government first publicly expressed a preference for the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory as the site for the diamond synchrotron.  [116945]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The preference was first stated publicly in a letter from the French Minister of National Education, Research and Technology to my noble Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Science on 14 March 2000. They had made clear to him in private discussions in October 1999 that this was their view.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to his answer of 24 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 781W, on the super jumbo aircraft, if he will place in the Library a copy of his Department's independent assessment of the likely demand for the A3XX.  [116950]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 No, because this assessment contains commercially confidential and market-sensitive information. It was prepared following discussions with manufacturers, suppliers and airlines of commercially sensitive issues, which were of considerable assistance 



<P>
<P><I>3 Apr 2000 : Column: 278W</I><P>
to my Department in drawing up the assessment. If such information were circulated more widely, the understanding on which it had been obtained would be breached, and in future my Department would be less able to serve the interests of taxpayers, since they would not be able to gain access to such a wide range of informed opinion when preparing market assessments.

<P>
<a name="00403w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Maclennan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list the expenditure incurred by his Department, agencies and non-departmental public bodies on <i>(a)</i> the setting up and <i>(b)</i> the operation of websites, indicating the cases in which the expenditure has been above that budgeted; and if he will list for each website (i) the topics which have been covered, (ii) the current average number of hits per month and (iii) the estimated expenditure on each website for each of the next three years.  [115844]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 March 2000]:</i> Management of the websites of my Department, agencies and non-departmental public bodies, and Government Offices for the Regions is devolved to those with responsibility for particular areas. The costs associated with setting up and on-going operation of sites are not held or collected centrally and therefore the information requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The same is true both for future expenditure plans and for information on final costs versus initial budget estimates.
<P>

<a name="00403w01.html_para0">In terms of topics covered, the DTI site and associated sites offer information on nearly every area of the Department's responsibilities. The central DTI site (those within the Web domain www.dti.gov.uk) received an average of just over 5,600,000 hits per month over the last six months. Again, hits for all the sites for which my Department is responsible could be calculated only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 None. There are two empty floors, which are currently being marketed, in Atholl House, Aberdeen.

 <i>[holding answer 20 March 2000]:</i> The rules on air travel by Ministers are set out in "Travel by Ministers", a copy of which is in the Library of the House. Decisions on which aircraft to use will be determined on cost, the number of people travelling with me, security and business considerations and the availability of aircraft. A list of Cabinet Ministers' visits overseas, and information on spend by all Ministers on travel overseas for the period 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000 are currently being assembled, and will be published as soon as possible after the end of the current financial year.

 To reiterate the point in my statement of 24 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1292-93, chlorine is a constituent of mustard gas which was used by Iraq in the attack on Halabja in 1988. It is therefore clearly important that we are sure that chlorine imported into Iraq under the "oil for food" programme is used for the purposes for which it was approved.

It is our understanding that visits by some family members have been allowed and that some of the defendants have appointed legal representatives. We are seeking clarification from the Iranian authorities on the latter point. The Iranian authorities are fully aware of the importance that we and our EU partners attach to this issue.

 It is reported that tens of thousands of hectares of natural forest have been razed by fires in the forest areas of Bale and Borana Administrative Zones. It is believed that the fires were started by local farmers burning land for local cultivation that escalated out of control. The Ethiopian Government sought donor help to combat the fires in February 2000. A number of donor countries who were well placed to address the problem helped form and deploy an International Fire Emergency Advisory Group. Donors, including DFID, maintain daily contact in Addis Ababa.

On 9 March, South Africa announced that it would provide a further 22 fire-fighters and other experts. We concluded that as the UK has

 <i>[holding answer 22 February 2000]:</i> We have set a target that all New Deal partnerships achieve parity of job outcomes between ethnic minority and white clients by the end of this Parliament. We recognise the additional disadvantages which can be faced by ethnic minority jobseekers and that is why the Employment Service is working so closely with key organisations such as the Commission for Racial Equality, Local Race Equality Councils and community groups in this important area of work.
<P>

<a name="00403w04.html_para0">At the end of November 1999, we know that nearly 20,000 young people from ethnic minorities had gone into work from the New Deal for young people. 13,700 had benefited from training and work experience under the New Deal options. At present, the New Deal appears to be doing less well in helping young people from ethnic minorities in obtaining jobs than young white people, although much of the discrepancy may be in part due to less complete destination data for ethnic minority leavers and from variation in performance between delivery areas. They are, however, leaving the Gateway more quickly and are slightly less likely to return to JSA after finding employment. We also assess the performance of different ethnic minority groups and are aware of the variations in outcomes between the groups. For example, we know that those of Indian, Bangladeshi and Chinese origin are closer to achieving equality of job outcomes with white participants than are Black-African participants.

<a name="00403w04.html_para8"><i>Educational benefits</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w04.html_para9">All participants have built and strengthened links with colleagues in other participating countries. Many institutions have gained access to, and developed, innovative training materials and methods. Individual participants have gained an appreciation of each others' cultures and working practices, have developed communication, new technology and other core skills and have improved their employability and confidence levels.

<a name="00403w04.html_para10"><i>Plans for the new programme</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w04.html_para11">The total budget for the second phase of the programme is 1.85 million euros for the seven years from 2000 to 2006. Priorities and budget allocations for the new programme for the year 2000 are currently under discussion in the Socrates programme management committee. During the course of these discussions the UK will use its best endeavours to ensure that the priorities set for the programme are compatible with the UK's domestic policy agenda for each of the education sectors the programme serves.

 <i>[holding answer 23 March 2000]:</i> The latest available January census information on three- year-olds educated in maintained schools is shown in the following table.
<P>

<a name="00403w04.html_para12">Places for 46,000 children have been created in 64 local authorities with the greatest social need, from the &#163;40 million Nursery Education Grant made available during 1999-2000. Expenditure of &#163;390 million is being made available over the three financial years 1999-2000 to 2001-02 to increase by 190,000 the number of new, free, good quality, early education places for three- year-olds. The priority is to reach those three-year-olds in social need who could most benefit from a free nursery place.
<P>

<a name="00403w04.html_para13">Information on three-year-olds educated in maintained schools for January 2000 is currently being collected as are the actual figures for three-year-old places created in the private and voluntary sector from September 1999 onwards. Provisional estimates of both sets of figures are expected to be published in a Statistical First Release in May.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on the performance by careers guidance services of the terms of their contracts over the last three years.  [116462]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 March 2000]:</i> For the financial years 1997-98 and 1998-99, Careers Service performance was based upon a range of activities including individual interviews, group sessions and personal action plans. During this period, most Careers Services achieved their agreed targets and many exceeded them.
<P>

<a name="00403w05.html_para0">More recently Careers Services have focused on those who need help most in support of social inclusion and achieving National learning targets. In the financial year 1999-2000, Careers Services made significant shifts in their activities, increasing their resources on work engaging 16 to 17-year-olds in learning by 37 per cent. compared with the previous year.
<P>

<a name="00403w05.html_para1">Despite the change in focus of Careers Services young people have, however, suffered from a lack of co- ordinated advice and guidance and gaps in provision. That is why we have launched the Connexions Service. It will take forward the provision of careers information, advice and guidance as part of a radical new approach to raising standards and ensuring coherent and co-ordinated support for all young people.

<P>
<a name="00403w06.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 We estimate that it would cost &#163;511 million to raise the per pupil funding of all Local Education Authorities to the level of that of the median authority and &#163;96 million to raise it to the level less 5 per cent. of that of the median authority.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment (1) what assessment he has made of the equity of the standard spending assessment for education as a method of allocation;  [117128]
<P>
<UL>(2) what recent representations he has received regarding measures being taken to reform received standard spending assessment for education, with particular reference to the <i>(a)</i> areas cost adjustment and <i>(b)</i> additional educational needs allowance.  [117134]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w06.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend has received a number of representations on the area cost adjustment and additional education needs elements of the standard spending assessment. We have already acknowledged that there are valid objections to the current SSA formula. The Government, in partnership with local government, have set up a review to see whether there is a better way of determining the distribution of funds which is simpler, more stable, more robust and fairer than the present arrangements.

 The Access to Work programme has been successful in helping an increasing number of disabled people to remain or move into employment year on year. Over the next financial year we expect to help more than 23,000 people through Access to Work at a cost of nearly &#163;26 million. This represents an increase of over 3,000 compared with the current year.

 It is the responsibility of schools and local education authorities (LEAs) to ensure that children with dyslexia receive appropriate tuition. Schools and LEAs must have regard to guidance in the Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of Special Educational Needs (SEN). This guidance recognises a continuum of special educational needs and advocates a staged approach to meeting such needs. The Code provides advice on the needs of children with specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia. A revised version of the Code is expected to be issued next year, which will place a stronger emphasis on the importance of early identification of SEN, so the appropriate help can be given as soon as possible. Under the National Literacy Strategy all children are being taught phonics, spelling and grammar. This has been shown to be particularly helpful for children with mild dyslexia. Children who demonstrate particular difficulties at word level, which are due to their SEN, can be identified much earlier and more focused support added. Such children have also been helped by the requirement, since September 1998, for newly qualified teachers to show that they can identify pupils who have special educational needs, including dyslexia, and know where to get help in order to give positive and targeted support to children.
<P>

<a name="00403w06.html_para1">My Department is also part funding a two year study programme by the Dyslexia Institute in partnership with the Centre for Reading and Language Studies at the University of York. The research has at its heart a controlled intervention study designed to evaluate the effects of structured programmes of intervention for seven-year-old pupils who are experiencing specific difficulties to read, write and spell.

<P>
<a name="00403w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 There are currently eight Departmental headquarters properties and 53 Employment Service (ES) properties that are either fully or partly vacant. Using the standard measure of square metreage, these figures represents 3.19 per cent. of vacant space against the total headquarters property for DfEE and 4.9 per cent. against the total for ES. Both ES and DfEE use the services of external estates surveyors, under contract, who advise on the best method of achieving a speedy and cost effective disposal. This will include assignment, sub-letting or surrender. The option pursued will depend upon, for example, the terms of the lease, the wishes of the landlord and market conditions. In line with usual practice, retained estates surveyors employ local estate agents who market vacant premises.

<a name="00403w07.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The actual numbers of external assessors to be deployed will depend on the number and distribution of teachers who apply to cross the threshold.

The maximum requirement in year one will be in the region of 520 full-time equivalents. The recruitment process for external assessors is nearly complete.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The Under-Secretary of State for Defence approves the visits of MPs to establishments. However, it is possible that MPs may have visited local establishments or cadet units on public open days and such visits are not included in the list.<P>

2. There is no requirement for the Department to keep records of such visits and some establishments only have records available since March 1998. The list should therefore not be viewed as exhaustive. <P>

<a name="00403w09.html_para0">Assessments published by the Department of Trade and Industry indicate that estimates of the UK's remaining proven, probable and possible oil reserves have been broadly unchanged since the 1980s, and estimated gas reserves have increased slightly over the same period, despite large increases in production.
<P>

<a name="00403w09.html_para1">In numerical terms UK reserves of oil and gas are currently estimated to be around 1,750 million tonnes and 1,750 billion cubic metres (about 1,450 million tonnes of oil equivalent), respectively. Work undertaken in 1998 for DTI by International Mining Consultants Ltd. estimates the reserves, resources and mineral potential at UK mines to be about 620 million tonnes of coal (about 370 million tonnes of oil equivalent). This estimate is on a more restricted basis than the oil and gas estimates because it takes no account of coal reserves other than those at mines that were operating at the time of the report. An alternative estimate contained in the BP Amoco Statistical Review of World Energy puts UK coal reserves at 1,500 million tonnes of coal.
<P>

<a name="00403w09.html_para2">According to the BP Amoco Statistical Review of World Energy, world reserves of oil, gas and coal are about 140 billion tonnes, 130 billion tonnes, 650 billion tonnes respectively, all converted to oil equivalent. These refer to quantities estimated with reasonable certainty to be present and recoverable under existing economic and operating conditions; the ultimately recoverable amounts could be much larger.
<P>

<a name="00403w09.html_para3">The UK is likely to start importing gas at some point between 2003 and 2010. Through access to world energy markets, the Government's assessment is that fossil fuel resource availability by itself will not constrain consumption for the foreseeable future and is correspondingly unlikely to be a factor in the international negotiations.
<P>

<a name="00403w09.html_para4">The most recent report from the Met Office's Hadley Centre estimated that, under the 'business as usual' scenario, the global temperature will be 2oC warmer than now by the 2050s. This temperature rise would be delayed by 50 years with stabilisation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at 750 parts per million and by over 100 years with stabilisation at 550 parts per million. About 70 per cent. of the climate change impact will be due to fossil fuel burning between now and 2100.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 14 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 118-19W, on London Underground, what is the nature of the plans that are in hand to bring the lifts at Westminster Underground Station into service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 This is an operational matter for London Underground. However, I understand that LUL will shortly invite the HMRI to inspect the lifts to ensure that they can be entered into public service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w11.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what additional resources have been <i>(a)</i> sought by and <i>(b)</i> provided to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate to cover the additional work needed to assess the new regulatory regime requirements for (i) British Nuclear Fuels in preparation for PPP and (ii) British Energy as a private company.  [115358]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Resources for the regulation of British Nuclear Fuels and British Energy are provided for within the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate's current staffing plans for 2000-01. HSE plans to recruit up to 30 additional inspectors to increase its cadre of nuclear inspectors in 2000-01 to deliver its programme of inspection which will include the regulation of British Nuclear Fuels and British Energy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w11.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many <i>(a)</i> buses and <i>(b)</i> passengers have used the M4 bus lane on each day since the ending of Reading Buses' services to and from London; and if he will make a statement.  [115267]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 March 2000]:</i> The bus lane continues to help provide a first-class service for passengers using buses, coaches and taxis and benefits all road users. Use of the bus lane has increased by over 20 per cent. from 3,000 vehicles in the last week of operation to 3,700 vehicles using the bus lane each day. Of these 600 are buses (including coaches), and each bus carries 15 passengers, an average of 9,000 bus passengers each day. Under normal traffic conditions, time savings of up to nine minutes are being obtained by users of the bus lane, and the reliability of their journey increases.
<P>

<a name="00403w11.html_para0">Reading Buses will withdraw their London service on Sunday 7 May 2000. Therefore data on changes to usage of the M4 bus lane will not be available until some time later Reading Buses use the lane 15 times per day. This accounts for only 2.5 per cent. of buses and coaches using the lane and is much less than the typical week by week variation in these vehicles.




<P>
<P><I>3 Apr 2000 : Column: 314W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00403w11.html_para1">I am disappointed Reading Buses are withdrawing their London service. I understand that this was on economic grounds, and that they say that the services would have stopped earlier but for the M4 bus lane. I am however pleased that another operator has increased use of this section of the M4 by 30 buses per day since the bus lane opened.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w11.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Kaufman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 16 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 328W, concerning the Jubilee line, what other recently completed railways <i>(a)</i> in the United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i> abroad have experienced delays at one point which resulted in delays and train cancellations throughout the line; and for what reason the doors designed to lead to trains on the westbound Jubilee line platform at Westminster station are not in use.

<a name="00403w11.html_para2">However, London Underground is a member of an international group of Metro operators. I understand that within this group over half have constructed new lines in recent years; of these new lines more than half have experienced "teething problems".
<P>

<a name="00403w11.html_para3">I understand from London Underground that the platforms at Westminster are designed to accommodate seven car trains (to allow for capacity increases in later years). Jubilee line trains presently consist of only six cars. The rear platform edge doors of the Westbound platform are therefore not currently in use and are kept closed for safety reasons. I am advised that information notices are posted on the relevant doors.

 The Department currently sponsors 31 executive NDPBs, 13 of which operate nationwide. The eight NDPBs that have a regional remit are the Regional Development Agencies. Two of the Department's NDPBs operate solely within the North-West region: the North West Development Agency and Liverpool Housing Action Trust.

<P>
<a name="00403w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 It would not be possible to recover pollen released from field trials. This is one of the reasons why no genetically modified crops may be released for field trials in the United Kingdom without a detailed risk assessment of the possible harm to human health and the

environment. This includes specific consideration of the possible effects of the dispersal of GM pollen. The risk assessments are reviewed critically by the scientific and technical experts on the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE). If ACRE had any concern that GM pollen would cause environmental harm, then the release would not be allowed.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to place conditions in the contracts for biodiversity research relating to farm-scale trials of GM crops to ensure there are no conflicts of interest among contractors which might undermine the credibility of research.  [116208]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have no plans to place conditions in the contracts. The research contractors involved in the evaluations are respected Government research institutions who have no corporate links to any vested interest. The research methodology and findings for the farm-scale evaluations are reviewed and agreed by an independent Scientific Steering Committee and the overall findings of the evaluations will be peer reviewed by other independent scientists, completely outside the research programme. This all guarantees that the findings of the farm-scale evaluations will be unbiased and science based.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the criteria used to assess the scientific independence of scientific contractors working on farm-scale evaluations of GM crops before contracts were awarded.  [116207]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Department invited 15 organisations to tender for the farm-scale evaluations. These were chosen to be Government funded bodies (such as research council institutes or universities) or independent research bodies. In the event, the contractors chosen were all Government funded institutes and had demonstrated that they had the capacity to carry out the work, as well as the required scientific expertise. As with all Government contracts of this nature, the researchers were asked to provide details of all personnel expected to carry out the work, along with their CVs.

 As executive NDPBs, the eight Regional Development Agencies are accountable to Ministers and Parliament. They are required, by the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998, to take account of the views of voluntary regional chambers in preparing their strategies, and to give an account of their activities to the chambers. Chambers are representative of the people in the regions that they serve: 70 per cent. of their members are elected members of the region's local authorities, with the remaining 30 per cent. drawn from the region's social, economic and environmental sectors.

This net increase is significantly less than that indicated by a comparison between 1993 figures published in PPG2, which have now been shown to be inaccurate, and the figures for 1997 calculated using digital (computerised) boundaries. Separately, we estimate that some 30,000 hectares have been added or proposed for addition to the Green Belt since May 1997.

 We welcome the publication of the Retirement Income Working Party's Report as a contribution to an important debate. We are assessing the implications of the Report's proposals for pension scheme members, for the Exchequer and for private pension provision generally.

 We have pledged to eradicate child poverty over the next 20 years and to halve it within 10 years. We are making good progress.

<a name="00403w16.html_para6">Poverty is multi-dimensional. It is characterised not just by low income, but also by factors such as poor educational attainment, poor housing and deprived communities. It is about the lack of opportunity and aspiration. That is why we are investing heavily in measures to provide children with a better start in life and to increase the opportunities to allow them to break out of the cycle of deprivation.
<P>

<a name="00403w16.html_para7">We are prepared to be judged on our results. We set out our indicators for tackling poverty in "Opportunity for all" (Cmd. 4445) and we will report progress against these in the autumn.

<P>
<a name="00403w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The measures flowing from the Green Paper "Partnership in Pensions", together with those announced in the last two Budgets, demonstrate the priority we have given to improving pensioners' incomes.
<P>

<a name="00403w17.html_para1">We have introduced a Minimum Income Guarantee for today's pensioners which is being increased in line with earnings each year during this Parliament. From April 2001, it will be increased to &#163;82 a week for a single pensioner and &#163;90 for a pensioner over 80. The lower capital limit for the Minimum Income Guarantee will be doubled from &#163;3,000 to &#163;6,000 while the upper limit will be raised from &#163;8,000 to &#163;12,000, benefiting around 500,000 pensioners who have modest savings.
<P>

<a name="00403w17.html_para2">In addition, we have recognised that pensioners have special needs. That is why the &#163;100 Winter Fuel Payment has been introduced and will be increased next winter from &#163;100 to &#163;150 per eligible household.

<a name="00403w17.html_para3">Other measures which impact favourably on pensioners' incomes include the reduction of VAT on fuel from 8 per cent. to 5 per cent., the introduction of free TV licences for people over 75 next Autumn, the restoration of free eye tests, and the minimum tax guarantee which will help take 200,000 pensioners out of tax completely.

 We expect all parents to meet their responsibilities to their children by providing information to the Child Support Agency.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w17.html_spnew10"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 In common with other Government Departments, the DSS and its Agencies have a discretionary compensation scheme to cover financial loss, suffering or distress caused by poor administration. The CSA also has the power to write off child support arrears and compensate the parent with care where substantial delays have occurred. Provisions in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill, currently before the House will put these arrangements on to a statutory basis.

 There are around 5 million people in the target group for stakeholder pensions, but some of those initially in that group will have personal pensions and may be unlikely to take up stakeholder pensions when they are introduced. Take up will depend on how stakeholder and other pensions are marketed by providers, and on individual choices by savers.

 The gross discretionary Social Fund budget for 2000-01 will be &#163;596 million. This represents an increase of &#163;60.8 million over the total gross budget for 1999-2000 made possible by improved loan recovery performance.
<P>

<a name="00403w18.html_para2">As part of this allocation we have increased the Community Care Grant budget by &#163;2 million to &#163;100 million. All Benefits Agency Districts will receive an increase. This will provide more help to grant applicants, in particular families with children and the disabled.
<P>

<a name="00403w18.html_para3">The loans budget will be &#163;494 million; an increase of &#163;57.3 million. To improve the fairness of the scheme this increase will be allocated to Benefits Agency Districts in a way that will, over time, achieve greater consistency of outcome for applicants wherever they live.
<P>

 In early 1998, all of the Department's properties were transferred to the private sector under two separate Private Finance Initiative contracts. We no longer hold or own any property.

On 1 April 1998, 134,991 sq m of vacant space transferred to Trillium so that there is now no continuing cost to the Department. The Department also has the flexibility to vacate and hand back further space over the period of the contract, at nil cost.

In addition, both the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and the Commission for Health Improvement have been set up specifically to help to reduce variations and ensure fair access to high quality treatment.

<P>

<a name="00403w19.html_para6">We have appointed Professor Mike Richards as the National Cancer Director to spearhead the drive to modernise all aspects of cancer care. He has indicated our intention to develop a national cancer programme building on the Calman/Hine Report to set out action to improve prevention of cancer and ensure patients from all social groups have access to faster better cancer care. The National Cancer Director will be developing the plan over the coming months and will engage with clinicians, managers and patients in the process.

 MRSA is the antibiotic-resistant form of <i>Staphylococcus aureus,</i> a bacterium which is carried harmlessly on the skin by at least a third of the population. About 80 per cent. of the population who acquire MRSA similarly carry it harmlessly on the skin and do not suffer from any infection. Neither the number of hospitals recording MRSA outbreaks nor the total number of patients in National Health Service hospitals who have MRSA are recorded centrally. The Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) compiles aggregate data on numbers of incidents of MRSA which are voluntarily reported by NHS trusts. The available data on MRSA for England and Wales show that there were 2,107 reported incidents in 1996. An incident is three or more patients infected or colonised by the same strain of MRSA in the same month from the same hospital. We are working with the PHLS on improving surveillance systems so as to provide more complete data on MRSA and so that we can consider what further action is required.

 <i>[holding answer 28 March 2000]:</i> There are no centrally held statistics on deaths caused by hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), including Methicillin resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA). Different doctors will have different views on the role of HAI in a patient's death.
<P>

<a name="00403w20.html_para0">MRSA infection can take the form of many different diseases from trivial skin infection to pneumonia or septicaemia. Often the causative micro-organism is not specified on the death certificate. MRSA does not have a distinct code within the revision of the International Classification of Diseases used for encoding death registration data at the Office for National Statistics.

 Successive guidance to health authorities has made clear their responsibilities for commissioning services that meet the assessed needs of their local communities. Health Service Circular 1998/99: "Palliative Care" states that commissioners, including primary health care groups need to work together with providers to develop a palliative care strategy which is right for their population, based on health needs assessment.

<a name="00403w20.html_para1">HSC 1998/198: "Commissioning in the new National Health Service" makes it explicit that full development of the new commissioning arrangements needs to involve partnership working both in and beyond the NHS.

<a name="00403w20.html_para2">Where services are commissioned from the non-NHS sector, commissioners should ensure the service provided is valuable, effective and offers value for money.

The funding of adult and children's hospices is a matter for local discussion and agreement and must be based on local health needs assessment. The Health Improvement Programme (HImP) is and will continue to be the funding mechanism for palliative care services. Voluntary healthcare providers are viewed as important players in the planning and provision of services and should be involved in the development of HImPs. From this should flow more detailed plans for commissioning services, including arrangements for palliative care.

 We recognise the importance of good nutrition throughout life for maintaining health. We are playing an active role in supporting the development of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Food and Nutrition Action Plan with a view to its adoption by the WHO's Regional Committee in September 2000. We agree that each member state should develop its own action plan in response, taking into account the remit of other key organisations, particularly the European Union. We have set out the role of diet in promoting health and preventing disease in "Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation", particularly in the key priority areas of coronary heart disease, stroke and cancer<i>.</i> The National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease requires local players, co-ordinated by the local health authority, to develop and implement a comprehensive programme of effective policies including promoting healthy eating by April 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w22.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Based on 1998-99 figures for charges collected by pharmacists and dispensing doctors in England, it is estimated that around &#163;50 million in prescription charge revenue would have been lost if the prescription charge had been paid for each chargeable form rather than each item. It is likely that there would also be additional costs to the drugs bill arising from the prescribing of items which can be purchased from pharmacies for less than the prescription charge. The current process of paying prescription charges is widely understood by the public and simple to administer. Introducing payment by instalments is impractical as it would unnecessarily complicate the current arrangements and require additional bureaucracy to keep track of instalment payments for each charge payable.

 The information is not available as requested.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w22.html_spnew11"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The recently quoted figure of &#163;1 billion is an estimate derived from a Department commissioned study of one hospital. It is not possible to accurately estimate the cost to the whole National Health Service from these findings. Infection control is a "must do" in current NHS National Priorities Guidance. New standards on infection control were issued in November 1999 and an action plan setting out specific objectives and targets was issued to the NHS on 11 February 2000. Costs of activity to prevent hospital acquired infections are impossible to assess because much of this activity is a fundamental part of the work of all health care staff.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Discrimination on the grounds of age within the National Health Service is completely unacceptable. Action is and will be taken to challenge and correct any such unfair practices. The task now is to get on with ensuring this delivers the improvements we intend, so that eliminating discrimination and promoting fair access are firmly embedded as mainstream business for the NHS.
<P>

<a name="00403w23.html_para2">The provision of first class care on the NHS is our priority and later this year we will be publishing the National Service Framework (NSF) for Older People. This, for the first time, will set national standards for the care of older people, driving up quality and reducing the variations. The NSF will include performance measures for monitoring progress. The development of the NSF has involved many groups, including service users and carers, and has included the issue of access to services.

 Although this Department cannot force local authorities to promote healthy food policies, there are a number of initiatives that we are undertaking with the co-operation of these agencies as part of our strategy for combating heart disease, stroke and cancer. For example, the Heartbeat Award Scheme, which promotes healthy eating in restaurants, cafes and other catering establishments, has been running for a decade with the support of local and health authorities. Furthermore, the recently published National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease set out several health milestones, one of which is the delivery by April 2001, of a wide-ranging healthy eating promotion in conjunction with local authorities. Co-operation also extends to local education authorities as part of the Department of Health and Department for Employment and Education-funded Healthy Schools Programme. This initiative requires schools to adopt consistent messages about healthy eating in order to meet the Healthy Schools Standard.

<a name="00403w23.html_para5">The diseases that non-human primates are known to carry are numerous and can be found in text books dealing with diseases of non-human primates. The hazards associated with simians are listed in the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens' publication "Working safely with simians: Management of infection risks". A copy has been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="00403w23.html_para6">All simians that are imported into the UK are required to undergo six months' quarantine against rabies in premises authorised by the Department.

<P>

<a name="00403w23.html_para7">During the early weeks of operation, fewer tickets were released for sale than the optimum number allowed under the operating licence. This was to ensure a high-quality visitor experience while the inevitable teething problems were being addressed, at a time when many visitors were staying inside the Dome to shelter from poor weather conditions. The number of schools participating in free Education Tours during the morning and afternoon sessions also has some bearing on the quantity of tickets released for sale.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In commissioning the design and construction of the play ship in the Diana, Princess of Wales playground in Kensington Gardens, the Agency followed the guidance in the "Guide to the Appointment of Consultants and Contractors" produced by Property Advisers to the Civil Estate. This guide promotes the procurement of services on the basis of best value for money. There is no requirement under this procedure to invite open tenders because the EC procurement rules do not apply in the case of this contract.</FONT></UL>

 Magistrates Courts Sentencing Guidelines shortly to be produced by the Magistrates' Association, with the support of the Lord Chancellor, are expected to remind magistrates that section 18 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 requires courts to look into the financial circumstances of the offender before fixing the amount of a fine. If magistrates are not satisfied with the information available, they are able to adjourn the case for further information to be given.

 The Court Service currently has six vacant properties and holds vacant space in another six Government buildings. In total this represents 3.1 per cent. of the Court Service estate. Of the six vacant buildings, five are being actively marketed and the Court Service is actively trying to negotiate early surrender of the sixth. Of the space held in the six other Government buildings, the Court Service is about to serve notice to terminate occupation in two. Attempts are being made to sub-let or negotiate early surrender of the remainder.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 9 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 820W, on jury trial, for what reasons he has assumed that eight per cent. of formerly electing defendants would be committed for sentence to the Crown Court under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill.  [115060]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 March 2000]:</i> Home Office Research suggests that the magistrates would be able to sentence in cases where the Crown Court currently imposes a custodial sentence of up to 15 months--since sentences are two and a half times longer for defendants who elect Crown Court trial than for equivalent cases sentenced in the magistrates courts. In 1996, 76 per cent. of defendants in either-way cases dealt with at the Crown Court fell into this category. However, only one third of these defendants would have elected jury trial, and since defendants who elect are four times less likely to receive such a sentence compared with directed defendants, this means that magistrates would be able to sentence 92 per cent. of such defendants. The remainder, eight per cent., would be committed for sentence.

<P>

<a name="00403w26.html_para0">For full national implementation, the estimated additional number of people who would be returned to prison every year is as follows:
<P>

<a name="00403w26.html_para1">between 200 and 600 people returned following breach of the electronic monitoring requirements of their licence, or following breach of other licence conditions identified through electronic monitoring; and

 All offers of accommodation for asylum seekers under the national asylum support scheme are assessed with regard to the suitability of the accommodation offered, including its quality and whether it is in a location where the support needs of the asylum seekers are capable of being met. We would also assess its cost and whether any necessary planning permission has been issued. The National Asylum Support Service has also undertaken to consult with local authorities before any contract for accommodation is signed.
Any offer of accommodation that includes facilities to accommodate people on floating accommodation will be considered in the same way and in accordance with the same criteria as any other offer of accommodation.

<a name="00403w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 All asylum applications are considered against the criteria specified in the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. In order to qualify for asylum, a person must be outside his/her country of nationality and have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. The spouse and minor children who accompany an asylum applicant to the United Kingdom will normally be recognised as refugees if the principal applicant's application is successful.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment his Department has made of relevant overseas practice in relation to income-related fines.  [116946]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w28.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 No research has been conducted recently into use of income-related fines overseas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w28.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Hood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what was the outcome of the Justice and Home Affairs Council held in Brussels on 27 March; and if he will make a statement.  [116833]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche), represented the United Kingdom at the Council. The main matters dealt with were as follows:
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para0"><i>'A points'</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para1">The list of 'A' points was agreed in full, including, among other things, the Europol Work Programme for 2000; the exchange of information in the evaluation of risks and control of new synthetic drugs; and the Council Decision concerning the better exchange of information in order to fight the use of counterfeit travel documents.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para2"><i>Open Debate on the protection of victims in the European Judicial Area</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para3">The priority being given to improving the position of victims in the European Union was welcomed wholeheartedly by the Council. The Commission's consultation paper was regarded as the basis for future work. All member states had domestic schemes to assist victims, but it was agreed that action was needed at Union level to ensure adequate protection for those who were victims abroad. The right to compensation was also discussed.




<P>
<P><I>3 Apr 2000 : Column: 374W</I><P>

<i>Adoption of the Agenda</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para4">In view of ongoing discussions between Spain and the United Kingdom, in consultation with the Government of Gibraltar, the Presidency dropped four items (Insolvency, Service of Documents, Eurodac Regulations, Mandate for a parallel Dublin Agreement with Norway and Iceland) from the meeting's agenda, since the outstanding issue on these dossiers was the question of application to Gibraltar.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para5"><i>Tampere Score-Board</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para6">There was a presentation by the Commission. The Council gave broad endorsement to the objectives, structure and deadlines set out in the Commission Score-Board, as a political, not legal, commitment. It was acknowledged that the document should be flexible, with deadlines and substance being kept under review. A revised version would be presented for review once per Presidency. Member states set out their priorities, with the next Presidency giving a detailed picture of its Presidency objectives.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para7"><i>Counterfeiting the euro</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para8">There was political agreement, subject to one member state's parliamentary scrutiny reserve. The Commission announced its intention to bring forward a supplementary instrument including provisions on co-operation, training and exchange of information.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para9"><i>Draft Mutual Legal Assistance Convention</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para10">Agreement was reached on outstanding issues except territorial scope and data protection. The draft Convention would be submitted for adoption at the May Council, following further consultation and consideration.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para11"><i>Framework Decision establishing Joint Teams to conduct criminal investigators in one or more member state</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para12">Member states remained divided as to the most appropriate means of implementing the paragraph of the Tampere conclusions calling for the establishment without delay of Joint Investigation Teams to conduct criminal investigations. The issue would be remitted back to the appropriate working group.




<P>
<P><I>3 Apr 2000 : Column: 375W</I><P>

<i>The prevention and control of organised crime: a European strategy for the beginning of the new Millennium</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para13">The text of the strategy was approved and would be published in the Official Journal in due course.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para14"><i>Collective Evaluation preliminary country reports on Czech Republic and Hungary</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para15">The Council noted the reports by the Collective Evaluation Working Group. The importance of Justice and Home Affairs matters in the enlargement exercise was stressed. Member states would assist applicant countries all they could, but it was considered important that pressure should continue to be placed on the applicant counties themselves. It was agreed that the Council Secretariat would prepare a document for the Enlargement Working Group setting out any areas of omission or weakness identified in the country reports.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para16"><i>Brussels II Regulation</i> <i>(proposal for a Council Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for joint children)</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para17">Substantial progress was made on this item, subject to the outstanding issue of territorial scope. The United Kingdom did not lift its parliamentary reserve and in that respect the reference in the press statement by the Council reporting on the outcome of the proceedings that "political agreement" has been reached on the draft instrument was incorrect.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para18"><i>Brussels I Regulation</i> <i>(proposal for a Council Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters)</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para19">The Presidency gave a 'state of play' report on discussion of the draft Regulation. It was noted that the European Parliament's opinion was awaited. The Commission announced its intention to propose an amendment to Article 15 of the Regulation to make clear that it applied to distance contract only.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para20"><i>Charter of Fundamental Rights</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para21">The Presidency gave a 'state of play' report on discussions. A final draft would be prepared by June and adopted by the end of October, for submission to the European Council. Major issues such as scope, legal status and relationship with the European Court of Human Rights would be considered once agreement had been reached on the body of the text. There was no discussion.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para22"><i>Commission's proposal for a European Refugee Fund</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para23">The Presidency gave the state of play, reporting on discussion in the Strategic Committee on Immigration, Frontiers and Asylum, noting the need for the proposal to be clearer on the aims and target of the fund, on future financing and on the allocation criteria. The Commission was invited to bring forward a proposal on temporary protection as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para24">Following discussion, the Commission expressed the hope that the proposal could be adopted during the current Presidency.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para25"><i>Revision of the Dublin Convention</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para26">The Commission paper (analysing the current problems with the operation of the Dublin Convention and considering alternatives for a replacement Title IV measure) was generally welcomed. The Commission planned to consult widely. A proposal would then be made at the turn of the year.




<P>
<P><I>3 Apr 2000 : Column: 376W</I><P>

<i>High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para27">The Presidency noted that the Action Plan on Albania and the neighbouring region had now been agreed by the High Level Working Group and would go to the General Affairs Council for adoption in June. New working methods had been established to take forward the implementation of all the Action Plans.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para28"><i>United Kingdom Drugs Initiative</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para29">We provided information on the United Kingdom Initiative for European Union action to tackle drugs with the aim of achieving a drug-free enlarged Union. The Presidency asked the Committee of Permanent Representatives to remit this to the Article 36 committee to take forward.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para30"><i>German Initiative on Public Contract Law</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para31">Germany introduced its initiative for a Framework Decision to establish uniform minimum standards under criminal law for unlawful/uncompetitive behaviour in the award of public contracts.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para32"><i>Relations with Mediterranean countries</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para33">An Israeli request to increase the dialogue on judicial co-operation between the European Union and Mediterranean countries through the Barcelona process was noted by the Council.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para34"><i>Asylum conference</i>
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para35">The Presidency confirmed that it would host a joint conference with the Commission in Portugal on 15-16 June, on asylum issues.

<a name="00403w28.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Government are taking account of the work in North America, including Canada, in reducing recidivism when developing their own policies to reduce reconvictions of offenders. In particular, when developing the accredited offender programmes for offenders in the prison and probation services.
<P>

<a name="00403w28.html_para36">Evidence on what works in reducing offending is summarised in the Home Office Research Series Number 187, 'Reducing Offending', published in 1998, in particular Chapter 8, which deals with effective interventions with offenders and references many United States of America and Canadian reports. Close contact is maintained with those working in Canada, and a recent Home Office seminar was given by Dr. James Bonta from the Canadian Department of Corrections.

As the process for consideration of the asylum claim will be very intensive, applicants will not be allowed to leave the site unless absolutely necessary, for example to attend a hospital out patient appointment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w31.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Burgon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what responses he has received to his consultation letter regarding proposals to extend the opening hours of casinos in England and Wales; and if he will make a statement.  [117693]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00403w31.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I published this consultation paper on 11 November 1999 and the consultation period ended on 31 January 2000. The Home Office received 2,820 responses, mostly from casino staff. 2,809 of the responses opposed the proposals. Six were neutral and five expressed support.
<P>

<a name="00403w31.html_para0">Many casino staff were concerned about the impact which the proposal would have on them and their families, about the difficulties in travelling home especially for female staff in the early hours, and about more exposure to passive smoking. Some also said that management had not consulted them about the proposed change. They wanted us to regulate these employment issues by using the law rather than through employee/employer negotiations.
<P>

<a name="00403w31.html_para1">The unions opposed the change. They drew attention to the lack of recognition for collective bargaining purposes in casinos and to the timing of the implementation of the union recognition provisions of the Employment Relations Act 1999.
<P>

<a name="00403w31.html_para2">Some residents' associations were also worried about increased noise early in the morning and additional traffic.




<P>
<P><I>3 Apr 2000 : Column: 384W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00403w31.html_para3">Having considered the responses very carefully, I have nevertheless concluded that we should proceed with the proposal. The issue is not the number of responses, but the strength of the argument for restricting commercial freedom. Casinos will not be obliged to adopt longer opening hours, but they will have more flexibility to meet consumer demand and increase their competitiveness. The changes will not so significantly affect the running of casinos as to require deferment pending the outcome of the independent gambling review, which is to start after Easter. The Gaming Board for Great Britain has no objections.
<P>

<a name="00403w31.html_para4">The Government understand the concerns about the impact of additional operating hours on casino staff and their families or on local residents. But the Gaming Act 1968 provides a regulatory framework for gambling in the public interest and is not designed to regulate normal employer/employee relations, which is subject to employment laws and the new provisions of the Employment Relations Act 1999. We agree with the view expressed by the unions that any changes to casino hours should not be made before the union recognition provision of the Act is in force. The longer hours will not, therefore, be available until the end of July this year. In addition, it will continue to give to licensing authorities power to impose restrictions on casino hours where necessary to prevent disturbance or annoyance to the occupiers of other premises in the vicinity so that the concerns of residents can be considered.
<P>

<a name="00403w31.html_para5">The Scottish Executive has consulted on a similar exercise in respect of casinos in Scotland and will report the outcome separately.
<P>

<a name="00403w31.html_para6">We will place a revised Regulatory Impact Assessment in the Library when the Order is laid.
