<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51011w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The cost of supplying UK coal is not directly affected by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Emissions trading impacts the costs of downstream industries which use coal as a primary fuel input and which are captured by the scheme. One of the most important users of coal is the electricity generation industry. The final report of an independent study by Ilex Energy Consulting in 2004 on the impact of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme on the price of electricity for consumers across Europe is available on the Department of Trade and Industry&#039;s website (www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/euets.shtml)

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51011w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The UK is participating in two greenhouse gas trading schemes: the national UK Emissions Trading Scheme and the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51011w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">The UK Emission Trading Scheme has been running since 2002, when 32 companies bid in voluntary emissions reduction targets for a share of Government incentive money. To date, the scheme has achieved emissions reductions of over 12 million tonnes of CO <sub>2</sub> . The scheme has proved a valuable experience for participants, brokers, verifiers and Government ahead of EU and international trading.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51011w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is a cost-effective and efficient way of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. On Tuesday 24 May 2005, the UK National Allocation Plan (NAP) was published, and the UK Registry went live allowing operators to begin trading.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51011w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The total number of allowances allocated to industry is based on progress beyond our Kyoto target and towards our national goal of a 20 per cent. cut in CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions on 1990 levels by 2010. In the first phase (2005&#150;08), the scheme is set to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the UK by around 65 million tonnes carbon dioxide (around 8 per cent.) below projected emissions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51011w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">For Phase II of the EU ETS a major UK priority is to address any gaps, anomalies, or competitive distortions that may have arisen during Phase I, and to look at whether there is scope to include further carbon dioxide emissions from existing sectors. Member states share a desire to move towards greater consistency in coverage and implementation across the EU25 in the second phase, and we are working with other member states and the Commission to discuss harmonisation on a range of key issues relating to the shape and scope of the scheme.

<p><a name="qn_4"><a name="51011w01.html_wqn4"><b> Bill Wiggin: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reasons there is no exemption from registration with the Environment Agency under the Hazardous Waste Regulations for construction sites that produce less than 200kg of hazardous waste a year.  [15084]</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51011w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The purpose of site registration is to enable the Environment Agency to better identify those premises producing hazardous waste to facilitate the appropriate inspection of such premises as required by Article 4(1) of the Hazardous Waste Directive, and is consistent with our risk-based approach to regulation. It is recognised that some premises will in general produce only small amounts of relatively lower risk hazardous wastes such as fluorescent tubes and computer monitors, and they are exempt from the requirement to notify where they produce less than 200kg of hazardous waste per year. These premises include shops, offices, pubs, restaurants and farms as well as any establishments producing household waste. Industrial sites, including construction sites, are outside the scope of the exemption since they may produce higher risk waste such as soil contaminated by asbestos, coal tar or oil (all of which are carcinogenic). Nevertheless, there is provision for mobile service operators&#151;such as painters and decorators&#151;to be able to notify the site from which they operate rather than each site they visit where at each of those sites they produce less than 200kg of hazardous waste.

It also excludes most UK expenditure on debt relief, although DFID&#039;s contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund is included. This is because most of our internationally agreed debt relief is provided on debts held by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). Debt relief that goes beyond what is required by international agreements is funded by DFID. DFID&#039;s bilateral and multilateral aid expenditure plans were not changed in light of the G8 Finance Ministers summit in June.

We pledged a total of $436 million to the Trust Fund ($221 million, plus $88 million of the European Commission contribution in 2000, and a further $95 million, plus $32 million of an EC contribution in 2002). In addition, the UK also contributed US$43 million to assist the International Monetary Fund with its costs of delivering HIPC debt relief. 18 countries have qualified for Completion Point of HIPC (Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Guyana, Ghana, Honduras, Mali, Mauritania, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia). Another 10 have reached Decision Point (Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Malawi, Sierra Leone and Sao Tome and Principe). A further 10 are eligible for debt relief under HIPC once they meet Decision Point criterion (Central African Republic, Comoros, Congo, Cote D&#039;Ivoire, Lao Pdr, Liberia, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Togo).

The cost of debt relief at the IMF ($6.1 billion) will be financed from internal resources, although the donors have committed to provide additional resources if needed to ensure that the IMF&#039;s ability to assist poor countries is not diminished. It is estimated that the annual resources freed up by the proposal will be around $1 billion in 2007, rising to around $1.7 billion in 2010&#151;resources that will enable countries to tackle poverty.

<a name="51011w04.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_29">The G8&#039;s proposal, when agreed, will supersede the MDRI for HIPCs. The precise costs to the UK are yet to finalised, but are likely to be in the region of $6 billion over the whole period of implementation. In addition, the UK will continue to meet its obligations under the MDRI to qualifying non-HIPC countries. This will cover IDA-only, low-income countries with a sufficiently robust public financial management system, the current proxy for this being budget support from the World Bank through a Poverty Reduction Support Credit. The value of this assistance will be $184 million until 2015 for currently eligible countries (Armenia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam), potentially rising to $463 million until 2015 for all potentially eligible countries.

<a name="stpa_30">G8 Finance Ministers also reiterated in June their continued commitment to the full implementation and financing of HIPC. The UK already meets and exceeds its commitments under HIPC. Our commitment to HIPC and other bilateral debt cancellation policies continue and were not altered by the G8 Finance Ministers&#039; decisions in June.

First line maintenance can range from simple tasks such as replacing a blown bulb to changing an entire engine. Tasks conducted at second line repair are generally more complicated and time consuming and may require specialist tools and facilities. Fourth line repair is provided by ABRO and is generally programmed in depth repair (base overhaul) or structural repairs such as repairs to battle damaged vehicles. Fourth line repair is the most complex and in depth repair often involving stripping the vehicle of its components and paint removal before the whole vehicle is repaired and reassembled.</p>

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister when his Department last issued supplementary advice on the correct application of Minerals Planning Guidance 3 to <i>(a)</i> minerals planning authorities and <i>(b)</i> the Government Offices of the Regions; what mechanisms are available to his Department to issue supplementary advice to minerals planning authorities on the correct application of Minerals Planning Guidance 3 when considering new applications for surface coal mines; and if he will make a statement.  [15970]</p>








<p><a name="st_58"><a name="51011w08.html_spnew1"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 It is not appropriate to issue supplementary public advice that would elaborate, gloss or qualify planning policy guidance documents to give a &quot;correct&quot; application. There can only be one statement of policy in force at any one time, and if this is to be changed a new text must be consulted on in the usual way. Minerals Planning Guidance 3 (MPG3) already provides sufficiently clear advice to mineral planning authorities and the coal industry in England on the tests to be applied when considering coal extraction proposals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51011w08.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_52">Planning applications for coal mining have to meet alternative tests. They must either be environmentally acceptable or, even if not, provide offsetting local or community benefits. The present policy clearly sets these considerations out as alternative tests, not cumulative ones. Paragraph 8 (i) and (ii) of MPG3 is clear in that respect. Staff in our Planning Directorate drew this to the attention of ODPM decision officers, planning Inspectors and Government Office staff in October 2004. Officials in the ODPM and the relevant Government Offices, will continue to examine and comment on draft regional and local planning documents dealing with coal mining development for conformity with national policy on this and other matters dealt with in MPG3, and will if necessary raise matters of non-conformity at the public examinations of plans.

 There is a presumption against open-cast mining unless the proposal is environmentally acceptable or can be made so through the use of planning conditions, but even if this is not possible community benefits that offset the likely impacts can remove that presumption and allow a successful application.

 The 1967 European Convention on the Adoption of Children aims to harmonise the laws in contracting states to promote the welfare of children who are adopted.

Since it is the case that this issue is not covered by any European convention, it remains a matter for each European Union member state which has ratified the convention to decide for itself whether to recognise adoptions made outside its jurisdiction.

<i>[holding answer 10 October 2005]:</i> I have had no discussions with the Healthcare Commission on the waiting times targets for prostate cancer. The national health service cancer plan sets out our strategy to reduce waiting times for cancer patients. There are two targets for cancer patients to be achieved from the end of December 2005, of a maximum 31 day wait from diagnosis of cancer to start of treatment and 62 days from urgent referral for suspected cancer to first treatment. Prostate cancer patients fall within these groups. Achievement of these targets will form part of the Healthcare Commission&#039;s assessment of existing targets for 2005&#150;06.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what percentage of paper for printed publications used by the Department in 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 was from recycled sources; and how much post-consumer waste this paper contained;  [15460]

<p><a name="qnpa_2">(2) what measures she has put in place to ensure that her Department meets the targets set by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to ensure that all copying paper for printed publications brought by the Department is 60 per cent. recycled, of which a minimum is 75 per cent. post-consumer waste.  [15462]</p>








<p><a name="st_112"><a name="51011w14.html_spnew6"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 For parliamentary work carried out by the Central Office of Information (COI), for example Command Papers, Acts and other departmental papers, the minimum recycled fibre content required is 75 per cent. for coated and 100 per cent. for uncoated papers, virgin fibre pulp being elemental chlorine free or preferably totally chlorine free. Mill broke is not included in the recycled fibre content. Applying the National Association of Paper Merchants definition for recycled content, the recycled fibre can include converter&#039;s waste, printer&#039;s waste and post consumer waste from homes and offices.

<a name="51011w14.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_98">For all other printed publications produced in 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05, the Department has no central record of paper source and content, and could not obtain these without incurring disproportionate cost. However, the selection of paper stock and its recycled and environmental properties currently rests with the COI.
