 The Government announced in December 2004 that they would seek the regions&#039; advice on their priorities for schemes for housing, regeneration and transport expenditure. Indicative allocations for the next 10 years were given to each region. The North East Interim Regional Transport Board has been established to determine each region&#039;s priorities. The four junction upgrade schemes on the A19 around Tyneside at Testos, Coast Road, Moor Farm and Seaton Burn junctions, are part of that process.

 Passenger interests are protected by ensuring that franchises specify an appropriate level of service, backed by punctuality and reliability targets and penalties for non-compliance.

 There are no plans to review the categories of persons who may object to, or make representations against, the issue of a goods vehicle operator&#039;s licence by a traffic commissioner. These persons include county, district and unitary authorities and individuals who own or occupy land in the vicinity of a proposed operating centre for goods vehicles. The existing arrangements provide adequate opportunity for persons who may be affected by the issuing of a licence to have their views considered.

 An updated Qualitative Risk Assessment covering outbreaks of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus in the period since the end of October 2005 was published on 17 January 2006. It takes account of outbreaks in village poultry in Turkey, Romania, Ukraine and South Federal district of Russia (European Russia), and also in the south west of China.

<a name="60125w03.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_6">This update and commentary does not alter our previous overall conclusion regarding the increased but still low likelihood of the introduction of the virus to the UK from the affected regions. Nevertheless, the increasing number of outbreaks in Eastern Europe raises concerns that the virus may be more widespread than previously anticipated in the affected region. Should the number of virus detections continue to increase in Eastern European countries, this may change the likelihood of introduction of the virus to the UK. Defra continues to monitor developments and assess the situation.

<a name="stpa_7">Defra is working closely with the Department of Health on all issues related to the protection of human health during an outbreak of avian influenza, both to ensure the protection of individuals who would be involved in the control of disease and possibly exposed to diseased birds, and to prevent the resortment of the virus and the development of human influenza.

 Responsibility for tackling bovine tuberculosis is a devolved matter and what happens in Wales is, of course, a matter for the Welsh Assembly.

 UK methane emissions have fallen every year since 1990 and by 2004 had dropped to about half of 1990 levels. The main sources of methane emissions in the UK are landfill sites, agriculture, coal mining, gas distribution, and oil and gas production.
</p>

Other Government measures to reduce the levels of biodegradable waste being sent to landfill include the landfill tax escalator, the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme (designed to meet the Landfill Directive targets), and public awareness campaigns. Together these measures have resulted in a decrease of about 63 per cent. in landfill methane emissions between 1990 and 2004.

<a name="stpa_22">The nature of emissions from agriculture make them a more difficult target for reduction than in other sectors. Nonetheless, improvement in animal diet and productivity has produced an 11 per cent. decrease in methane emissions from animals since 1990, and further reductions are expected. Recent research from the Rowett Research Institute, based in Aberdeen into anti-methane feed ingredients has yielded promising results, and in initial trials a reduction of up to 70 per cent. in emitted methane has been achieved. The UK Government remain committed to research into reducing methane emissions from ruminants. We are also committed to exploring techniques for methane recovery from agricultural waste and its use as a clean energy source.

With regard to methane from coal mining, UK Coal signed up to the UK Emissions Trading scheme in 2002, with the target of reducing methane emissions from their installations by 400,000 tonnes by 2006. Furthermore methane extracted from abandoned coal mines and used as fuel has been exempt from the climate change levy since 2003. This exemption encourages the owners of mining facilities and decommissioned mines to invest in systems that capture methane that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. In addition the Coal Authority and the Department of Trade and Industry are developing a scheme further to encourage the mitigation of methane from abandoned mines. Methane emissions from coal mining (including closed mines) fell by some 73 per cent. between 1990 and 2004.

 HMG had previously agreed to provide direct budget support to Ethiopia.

In my view, recent political events amount to a breach of trust, and so I have decided that, in the current circumstances, DFID will not provide budget support but will seek to find other means to support the poorest in Ethiopia. I have emphasised to Prime Minister Meles that the only way to resolve the current political crisis is through inclusive political dialogue and the continuation of the democratisation process which we are ready to support. Our future assistance to Ethiopia will be designed with increased monitoring and accountability so we can be sure that the aid reaches the poor people who need it.

 Monitoring of the use of aid to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is conducted in accordance with standard DFID procedures that apply across all of the Department&#039;s programmes. For our bilateral aid, organisations implementing projects on behalf of DFID are required to submit regular, usually quarterly, financial and narrative reports on their activities. In addition, projects over &#163;1 million require a full review to be undertaken by at least annually with recommendations for actions to maximise impact and a final completion report, including the lessons learned to inform future programming.

 Estimates of Iraq&#039;s infant mortality rate vary. The most detailed information we have on infant mortality rates in Iraq is the Iraq living Conditions Survey 2004&quot; (ILCS) conducted by the Iraqi Central Office for Statistics and Information Technology in April/May 2004. This survey can be found at http://www.iq.undp.org/ILCS/overview.htm This gives information about infant mortality for the period 1999&#150;2003. We do not have a breakdown of the data by year as requested.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60125w12.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_99">For the period 1999&#150;2003, the survey shows the infant mortality rate as 32 deaths per 1,000 births during the first year of life. The rate for girls was 29 per 1,000 for girls and 25 per 1,000 for boys. However, other estimates have reported significantly higher infant mortality rates, and the ILCS report acknowledges that their estimate may be too low because of under-reporting of child deaths.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60125w12.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_100">A 2003 report by Ali, Blacker and Jones (respectively of the World Health Organisation (WHO), the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and UNICEF), reported the 1998 infant mortality rate as 100.8 deaths per 1,000 births. The UN Population Database (2004 revision) estimated Iraq&#039;s infant mortality rate as 94.3 deaths per 1,000 births for the period 1995&#150;2000. They use the same estimate of 94.3 per 1,000 for the period 2000&#150;2005.

<p><a name="st_116"><a name="60125w12.html_spnew8"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Under Saddam Hussein&#039;s regime between 2001 and 2003, the economy shrank at an average rate of 9 per cent. per annum. After the 2003 conflict the economy recovered, with an initial economic growth rate of 46 per cent. in 2004. In 2005, the Iraqi authorities were successful in promoting macroeconomic stability despite the extremely difficult security environment, and economic growth was a modest 2.6 per cent. These are estimates which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has accepted, but it acknowledges the data quality as poor. In 2006, the IMF predicts an increase in economic growth to 10 per cent., a reduction in inflation, and an increase in net international reserves, advancing Iraq&#039;s transition towards a market economy.

 Iraq reached its highest production levels; 3.5 million barrels per day (mbd)&#151;just before its invasion of Kuwait in July 1990, before exports were halted by an international boycott. After the first Gulf War, oil production fell to about 500,000 barrels per day, enough for domestic consumption. (Figures taken 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 Jan 2006 : Column 2147W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
from the US Congressional Research Service&#039;s Report to Congress on Iraq Oil, April 2005.) When the United Nations Oil for Food Programme started in December 1996, oil exports increased, although export levels were sporadic as a result of various disagreements between Iraq, its customers and the United Nations. During 1999 to 2001, production averaged 2.49 mbd and in 2002 Iraq&#039;s crude oil production rate was an estimated 2.02 mbd (source: US Energy Information Administration). Since the Second Gulf War, output has varied considerably as security problems and sabotage have disrupted the flow of crude oil to terminals in Turkey and the Persian Gulf; however, prices have remained high.

My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development and I are regularly involved in discussions both internally and with external contacts on issues relevant to women&#039;s rights and empowerment. For example, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State raised issues relating to social exclusion and women&#039;s rights in a high-level panel discussion during the millennium review summit in September and subsequently discussed the issue of gender equality in education when he gave evidence to the International Development Committee at their session on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank meetings and the summit in October.

 It is encouraging that the African Commission on human and peoples&#039; rights, at its recent meeting in Banjul, The Gambia, issued a report which clearly condemned the human rights violations currently being perpetrated in Zimbabwe. This reflects the wide interest in Zimbabwe across Africa, and the growing impatience of its leaders with the poor governance under Robert Mugabe. I meet African leaders in my frequent travels to Africa (most recently to Kenya and Ethiopia), at international meetings and in the UK. Zimbabwe is frequently among the topics discussed.

 The no switching rule for leave to remain as a spouse came into force on 1 April 2003. This date precedes accurate data from the current casework database, and statistics are therefore not entirely reliable. Provisional management information suggests that about 70 spouse applications in General Group have been outstanding from before 1 April 2003. It is not known how many of these cases might be switching applications.

 The Accession Monitoring Report, published on a quarterly basis, provides detailed statistical data on Accession state nationals who have registered on the Worker Registration Scheme (WRS).

<p>
<a name="60125w19.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_145">However, apart from London, the report does not contain data relating to individual towns or cities. For reference, the latest version of the report is available on the Home Office website via:http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/ind/en/home/0/reports/accession&#095;monitoring.html. The following figures have therefore been obtained from local management information using the WRS database.

They have not been provided under National Statistics protocols and are therefore provisional and subject to change. The information covers the period one May 2004 to 30 September 2005, which corresponds with the period covered by the latest Accession Monitoring Report. The Birmingham postal area covers a large part of the West Midlands. Therefore the figures have been broken down into two parts (i) City of Birmingham covered by the area postcodes B1&#151;B5 inclusive; (ii) Birmingham area postcodes (codes starting with B&quot;) within the West Midlands (excluding those in Hereford and Worcestershire, Warwickshire and Staffordshire). The number of accession state nationals who registered with the scheme and gave an address in these respective areas during the period one May 2004&#151;30 September 2005 is as follows: (i) Birmingham (city)&#151;1,225 (ii) Birmingham (area)&#151;1,335 (excluding those in the Birmingham city area).
</p>


<p>
<a name="60125w19.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_146">This gives a total of 2,560 within the geographical area referred to. The figures show those applicants who have registered on the Scheme since one May 2004. The figures are not current; an individual who has registered to work and who leaves employment is not required to de-register, so some of those counted will have left the employment for which they have registered and some are likely to have left the UK. Thus the number currently residing in Birmingham or the West Midlands is unknown.

 Companies House has not increased the annual document registration fee payable with the annual return filed electronically. In November 2004 Parliament approved the increase of the fee payable with the paper annual return to &#163;30. There were two main reasons for the increase. First, Companies House is required to review its fees on a regular basis. The last full pricing review was completed in 2004 and confirmed that costs and prices were out of line in some areas and needed to be rebalanced. The fees are linked, as required by European Law and HM Treasury guidance, to the forecast cost of providing each service. Companies House is required to prevent the fees from one service subsidising the costs of another service. Secondly, the annual registration costs associated with filing in paper format has risen because handling paper is labour

Notes:<br>

Framework changes occurred in January 2000 and September 2003. Changes in the way groupings in lessons are recorded may mean that data are not directly comparable from one framework to another.<br>

From January 2000 to July 2003, the inspection arrangements included full and short inspections. The majority of lessons observed will have been in full inspections. The most effective schools had short inspections.<br>

The national minimum standards for residential special schools encourage smoke-free policies.

<p><a name="st_248"><a name="60125w28.html_spnew7"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 There has been no reduction in the amount of money paid to local authority music services for improving the teaching and learning of music; this will remain at just under &#163;60 million per annum until at least 2008. In addition, all music services will receive an additional &#163;10,000 in 2006&#150;07 to support further instrumental and vocal tuition at Key Stage 2. Over the next two years, they will receive a share of &#163;2 million for musical instruments and support for continuing professional development at a cost nationally of a further &#163;2 million. I would expect these increases to have a significant positive impact on music services&#039; ability to support teaching and learning at Key Stage 2.

<p>
<a name="60125w28.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_202">The further &#163;26 million allocated to primary schools may be used to buy in specialist support from a range of providers&#151;I believe it is right to allow schools this degree of choice. Given music services&#039; track record at KS2, and their positive relationship with schools (96 per cent. say they are satisfied with the service they receive), it is likely that a great deal of this specialist support will continue to be bought in from local music services.

<sup>(32)</sup> During 2003&#150;04 complaints sent directly to the chief executive were not recorded separately from those complaints, which were escalated to him as part of the three-stage process. Therefore, although 7,183 complaints in total were received during 2003&#150;04, it is not possible to separate out those complaints received by the chief executive directly (as opposed to those escalated via the complaints process), thus preventing meaningful comparison with data for other years.<br>

<sup>(33)</sup> Complaints to chief executive include complaints direct from customers and MP&#039;s. In April and May of 2004, the chief executive received a total of 1,435 complaints directly however they were not recorded separately from those received as part of the three stage process.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Treat-official letters are those received by a Minister from a member of the public, and referred to the CSA on behalf of the Minister.<br>

2. These figures do not include complaints received by the Independent Case Examiner as these were not made to the Child Support Agency, (your PQ9328 refers).<br>

<p><a name="st_308"><a name="60125w35.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 Deduction from Earnings Orders (DEOs) are a discretionary decision which means the Agency considers each case on merit and seeks to apply them if a non-resident parent (NRP) is employed but not compliant with maintenance payments. A DEO may not be appropriate for a limited number of reasons including, where the NRP&#039;s jobs are likely to be short term or if an NRP is employed outside of the UK.

Notes:<br>

1. Data is presented for calls made regarding cases on the new system (CS2) and the old system (CSCS) combined.<br>

2. &#151;&quot; indicates a figure less than 0.5 per cent.<br>

3. Total calls attempted exclude calls attempted outside working hours.<br>

4. &#039;Calls for which outcome not recorded&#039; are those which were received but for which, due to problems with the MI system, the eventual outcome was not recorded. Some of these calls would have been answered, and others would have been abandoned. The volume of such calls has decreased significantly in the last 3 years as management information systems have improved.<br>

5. &#039;Calls for which outcome recorded&#039; are those which were received and for which there is management information to track the eventual outcome.<br>

6. Other ineffective calls are those that resulted in a ring tone but no reply, fail due to network technical problems, or are answered by a BT message but do not connect to the CSA system.<br>

7. IVR denotes the automated touch tone part of the process where customers enter their details via the telephone key pad. Once callers have cleared this part of the process, they enter a queue to be answered by a member of CSA staff. There is no IVR process on the old system.<br>

8. The percentage of calls abandoned in the queue refers to the percentage of total calls received, for which the outcome is recorded, that were abandoned once in a queue to be answered by staff.<br>

9. The percentage of calls answered that were available to staff to answer refers to calls answered as a proportion of those that were connected to the queue for an agent (post IVR where appropriate).<br>

10. Numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand, and percentages to the nearest 1 per cent. Components may not sum to totals due to rounding.<br>

 The UK, along with other member states, supports the need for this successor EU-level spending programme for the period 2007&#150;13, which will provide financial support for the implementation of the Community&#039;s objectives for employment and social affairs and the achievement of the Lisbon goals. It will replace existing programmes to promote measures to combat direct or indirect discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation; promote gender equality; support analysis, research and cooperation between member states in employment and labour market matters; and encourage cooperation between member states to combat social exclusion. The new programme does not propose a range of specific projects, but rather provides a framework to support EU-level actions under the areas covered, such as developing statistical tools, sharing of best practice, awareness-raising campaigns and support for organisations operating in the relevant fields. This includes action in the three areas the hon. Member mentions where, for example, we would expect support to continue for the common legislative framework on gender equality, which provides a level playing field for the single European market in goods and services. But legislation is only part of the story&#151;practice has to change and PROGRESS will enable good practice to be developed and shared between member states. Similarly, PROGRESS is likely to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 Jan 2006 : Column 2232W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
maintain support for a range of intermediary groups from across the UK to increase knowledge and understanding by employers and individuals of new anti-discrimination law. It should also support a range of research projects, such as those looking at the provision of services for ethnic minority elders; the particular barriers faced by the most deprived children and families in gaining access to welfare provisions; and ways of improving links between local and central government in the field of social exclusion. Once agreed, the new unified programme will be publicised via the usual Commission and other European institute and news routes, including web and press, and through the existing management structures for those working under the current programmes.
