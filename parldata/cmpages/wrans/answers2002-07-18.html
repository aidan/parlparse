 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20718w01.html_para0">No date has yet been fixed for the next meeting of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products but we expect it to be held in Spring 2003. The UK representation at such meetings would depend on the subject(s) under consideration, and would normally consist of officials from the Health and Safety Executive. However, the legislation implementing the Biocidal Products Directive in Great Britain specifies the competent authorities in or as regards Scotland as the Secretary of State and the Scottish Ministers, acting jointly, and so my officials consult the Scottish Executive on agenda items in which it might have an interest.

 From July 1997 to April 1999 the unit comprised two members of staff. This was increased to three members of staff in May 1999. There are currently six members of staff in the better regulation team which now incorporates the regulatory impact unit.
<P>

<a name="20718w01.html_para8">It is the job of departmental regulatory impact units to establish and promote the principles of good regulation in their departments. The staff in each unit work closely with the officials responsible for developing policies within their department and the regulatory impact unit within the Cabinet Office. They focus on those regulations that impact on business, charities and the voluntary sector.

An estimated 900,000 SMEs benefiting from measures announced in Budget 2002, including 485,000 businesses whose corporation tax bill has been cut or abolished, and 700,000 small businesses who will be able to benefit from our flat rate VAT scheme.

The Small Business Service has produced clear guidance on a number of complex regulations.

 The Government are committed to the future of the post office network. As agreed following the Performance and Innovation Unit report "Counter Revolution: Modernising the Post Office Network", the Government are supporting an urban restructuring programme intended to provide improved facilities which meet customers' needs and expectations and are in the right location for the local community.

<a name="20718w02.html_para0">Banking will be a central part of post offices' strategy to move forward. Universal banking services, together with Post Office Limited's plans for an expansion of network banking&#151;the provision of counter services for ordinary current accounts&#151;should lead to substantial increases in the range and volume of banking at post offices, tapping into a very much larger customer base than benefit recipients alone. This should benefit subpostmasters both directly and through increased footfall, providing a major income stream offsetting the loss over time of the benefit book related revenue.

 Banking services should help ensure a viable future for many urban post offices which might otherwise struggle to keep and attract customers as banking will be a central part of post offices' strategy to move forward. Universal banking services, together with Post Office Limited's plans for an expansion of network banking&#151;the provision of counter services for ordinary current accounts&#151;should lead to substantial increases in the range and volume of banking at post offices, tapping into a very much larger customer base than benefit recipients alone.

<a name="20718w02.html_para1">The current value to Consignia of business from the Department of Work and Pensions is some &#163;400 million a year. The migration of benefit payment to ACT is scheduled to begin in 2003. How that migration affects the revenue of subpostmasters will depend on a number of factors, not least how benefit recipients and other post office customers respond to change.
<P>

Government are committed to ensuring that those who wish to do so will be able to continue to get their benefits in cash at post offices in full without charge.
<P>

<a name="20718w02.html_para3">In many urban areas, there are too many post offices in very close proximity to each other for them all to be viable, regardless of the migration to ACT. That is why the Performance and Innovation Unit recommended a programme of modernisation and restructuring designed to ensure that urban sub post offices can operate as viable businesses for their owners and offer improved services from the right locations to serve their communities. The Government are providing up to &#163;210 million of financial support for Post Office Limited's urban reinvention programme.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20718w02.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Trading Schemes Act 1996 does not contain powers of investigation. It extends certain provisions of Part XI of the Fair Trading Act 1973 which deals with pyramid selling and similar trading schemes. Schemes may be investigated under section 29 of the Fair Trading Act 1973 which is also used for other types of investigation. There have been 13 investigations under section 29.

 Applications for consent to a newspaper transfer under the Fair Trading Act 1973 address the effect the transaction would have on concentration of ownership in the relevant markets. In addition, the Department has access to the Joint Industry Committee for Regional Press Research (JICREG) and Newspaper Society databases, which provide information on local and regional newspaper circulation.

<a name="20718w02.html_para6">The minimum wage applies to all workers in all of the United Kingdom's power stations regardless of nationality. Similarly national minimum wage applies to all ferry service workers working within territorial waters. For mariners in general the right to receive at least the national minimum is extended to include any individual employed on a UK registered ship unless the employment is wholly outside the United Kingdom or the worker is not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="20718w02.html_para7">It is the role of the Inland Revenue to enforce the National Minimum Wage. They do that by responding to all complaints made about employers suspected of not paying the minimum wage and by visiting a sample of employers about whom no complaints have been made to check that all employers meet their obligations under National Minimum Wage Law. Checks are not made on the basis of worker nationality.

<a name="20718w03.html_wqn2"><B> Miss Begg: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to her answer of 16 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 323W, on petroleum licensing, what decisions she has made on licence awards in the 20th Offshore Licensing Round.  [72019]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20718w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 I have decided to award 25 production licences to licence groups made up of 33 different companies. They include six companies acquiring their first offshore licences as well as more familiar names, and range from the super-giants to small new niche players.
<P>

<a name="20718w03.html_para1">It is encouraging that so many companies see further opportunities for investment and development in the North sea's core areas, even after nearly 40 years of

intensive exploration there. It bodes well for future licensing rounds, which will cover a lot of acreage that, by contrast, is still under-explored and under-exploited. The DTI, with PILOT (formerly the Oil and Gas Industry Task Force), will seek to give every opportunity to small, innovative companies eager to exploit the UK's hydrocarbon resources with new technology. I am particularly delighted to see the response from newcomers who fully understand the potential rewards still to be made in the North sea.
<P>

<a name="20718w03.html_para2">In an effort to concentrate licensees' minds and prevent the appearance of fallow acreage in future, in pursuit of recommendations by PILOT I have made some significant changes to the licences compared with earlier versions. The first two terms will last for four years each instead of six and 12 years respectively, and there will be a mandatory relinquishment of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term. The Government will also be enabled to publish information three years after receiving it, instead of five (or at licence surrender, whichever is sooner). All this is part of the Government's strategy of bringing together acreage and the companies best fitted to exploit it.
<P>

<P>
<a name="20718w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2002]:</i> Consignia has not decided to impose a charge of &#163;20 per week to businesses for deliveries before 9 am. The company is currently running pilots of their new Tailored Delivery Service in 14 delivery offices across the country. Under the pilot, customers who receive 20 or more letters on a regular basis will get a delivery before 9 am. Other customers will receive their mail between 9 am and lunchtime. A new, additional service will allow customers who do not receive 20 or more items to choose to pay for a delivery before 9 am. The service will be trialled at &#163;5, &#163;10 and just over &#163;14 per week for the pilots but the Chairman of Consignia has said that the final proposed price will be part of the evaluation of the pilots in consultation with the regulator, the Postal Services Commission (Postcomm), and the consumer body, Postwatch.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what plans she has to modify the public procurement policy so public bodies have to buy local fresh food; what recent representations she has had on this subject; and if she will make a statement.  [69016]

<P>
<a name="20718w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 July 2002]:</i> I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20718w04.html_para2">The Government's public procurement policy requires all purchases of goods and services to be based on value for money, having due regard to propriety and regularity. Value for money is defined as "the optimum combination of whole life cost and quality (or fitness for purpose) to meet the customer's requirement". Public bodies are also required to comply with the EC Treaty, the EC procurement directives and the UK Regulations that implement them. These are designed to ensure that public procurement is fair, transparent and not used to discriminate by setting up barriers to free trade. Member States reached political agreement on a revised public procurement directive at the Internal Market Council on 21 May. This revised directive maintains the principles set out above.
<P>

<a name="20718w04.html_para3">This policy and legal framework for public procurement not only secures value for money for the taxpayer but also helps to improve the competitiveness of, and opportunities for, our suppliers. It does not, however, permit public sector buyers to restrict their purchases to specific locations or suppliers.
<P>

<a name="20718w04.html_para4">However, it is permitted to specify requirements that might provide the opportunity for local suppliers to make use of their proximity to customers. For example, a requirement for frequent delivery of fresh food would be acceptable provided it was reasonable and not contrived to create an artificial barrier to free trade. In principle a foreign supplier is not denied an opportunity to compete on equal terms by, for example, setting up an operation in Britain. Public bodies can also ensure that their contract specifications do not discriminate against local suppliers. For example, requiring the supply of mangetout throughout the year would necessitate purchases from overseas and deny local suppliers an opportunity to compete. To avoid such difficulties for local suppliers the buying authority can require seasonal vegetables instead.
<P>

<a name="20718w04.html_para5">Issues relating to public procurement policy have also been raised by several respondents, including the organic sector, to the Department's Sustainable Food and Farming Working Together consultation paper. These are also under consideration.

 The United Nations estimates that some half a million people are facing starvation in Angola, and that more than a million others are completely dependent on food aid for their survival. Thousands are reported to have died of hunger over the last few months and many more are dying every day.

<a name="20718w04.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Over the last 12 months DFID has contributed &#163;1.7 million to the 2002 United Nations appeal for Angola to ensure that critical humanitarian needs are met and to assist in the reception areas for ex-UNITA fighters.

<P>
<a name="20718w04.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The research undertaken on Strek Plots is of critical importance for the sustainable management and exploitation of Indonesia's forest resources.

 Each new deal investigated by CDC is given a risk rating for health and safety, environmental and social issues. A formal environmental impact assessment is carried out by independent consultants, and an environmental management plan is put in place, where there is perceived to be a high risk of the investment potentially having a significant environmental impact (as may be the case with mining, cement manufacture, and projects involving large construction sites). Otherwise the deal team will review the possible environment impact of investments as part of its due diligence exercise and, if any specific areas of concern are identified, external appropriate consultants may be brought in to advise on these specific issues. CDC reviews any environmental concerns arising from existing investments via a formal investment valuation review every six months and through its Business Principles Unit.

 CDC has developed a framework for assessing the human rights conditions in the countries in which it invests. This is informed by reference to international, governmental and NGO sources. CDC does not make investments in countries which are subject to UN sanctions. Specific issues may also be highlighted during due diligence into possible investments. The decision on whether to make a particular investment in a certain country will also be determined in part by whether acceptable labour practices will be able to be pursued and the investment will result in a positive benefit for the wider community.

 My Department commissioned last year a three-year research project into trends in tendered bus services including tender prices.

This is in line with the findings of the annual survey conducted by the Association of Transport Co-ordination Officers. There are however significant variations within this overall figure. Our research will be published in due course.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on his policy on annuities.  [68426]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20718w09.html_spnew0"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The consultation document, Modernising Annuities, published jointly with the Department for Work and Pensions in February, provoked considerable interest and strong feedback. I am today placing in the Library a summary of the responses.
<P>

<a name="20718w09.html_para0">The feedback confirmed that individuals need to be better informed about their annuity purchase. It is clear that many people could improve their retirement income if, at retirement, they were able to select the right annuity for their personal circumstances. It would be in their best interest to look for the best rate in the marketplace, which is not necessarily from the same financial institution that helped them save for retirement. The Government are working with the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and providers to ensure that people are able to make the right choices at the right time. One specific idea under consideration is encouraging the provision of information and advice through the work place.
<P>

<a name="20718w09.html_para1">As the consultation document explains, there is no case for abandoning the requirement that people should buy a lifetime annuity by age 75. This rule ensures that they can take advantage of insurance pooling to make efficient use of their pension savings.
<P>

<a name="20718w09.html_para2">Without prejudicing this rule and consistent with the principles outlined in the consultation document, the Government plan to bring forward powers to make it possible to offer people buying annuities more choice and flexibility. The aim will be to empower people approaching retirement to make the right choices for their circumstances by encouraging competition and transparency in the market for annuities. It will be important that this liberalisation dovetails with simplification and other reforms being considered in the pensions Green Paper this autumn.

 For those bodies classified by the Office for National Statistics to the appropriate sector in national accounts, the net cash requirement represents the sums borrowed by those bodies, in cash, from outside that sector, plus interest capitalising on certain of those borrowings. Full details of how the net cash requirement is measured and its relation to other measures of borrowing and debt are given in "Monthly statistics on public sector finances: a methodological guide" (No. 12 in the Government Statistical Service Methodology Series).

<a name="20718w10.html_spnew3"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Bank of England suspended issuance of the new Elizabeth Fry five pound note after it was discovered that, on some notes, it was possible to remove part or all of the serial numbers, when the note was rubbed vigorously. The problem was traced to unexpectedly slow drying of the numbering ink on some of the notes, when the numbers were printed over the new varnish coating. This varnish had been introduced to make the note more durable. In future the Bank will put the varnish over the numbering, as tests have shown that this solves the problem. The notes already printed will undergo extensive drying treatment to ensure that the numbering ink dries thoroughly.

<a name="20718w10.html_para2">The Bank plans to resume issuing the new note in the week commencing 19 August 2002 and is announcing this today.

 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> The principal asbestos constituent of water supply pipes has been white asbestos. No water supply in the UK is carried through pipes constructed in blue asbestos, although traces of blue and brown asbestos are likely to have been present in the white asbestos construction materials.
<P>

<a name="20718w11.html_para8">Regional use of asbestos cement water supply pipes varied considerably but approximately 10 per cent. of existing pipes in the UK are believed to consist of that material.
<P>

<a name="20718w11.html_para9">The World Health Organisation included an opinion on asbestos cement pipes in their 1993 edition of "Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality". The guidelines include the following statement "Although well studied, there has been little convincing evidence of the carcinogenicity of ingested asbestos in epidemiological studies of populations with drinking water supplies containing high concentrations of asbestos. Moreover in extensive studies in animal species, asbestos has not consistently increased the incidence of tumours of the gastrointestinal tract."

<P>
<a name="20718w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Air quality in the London Underground system is required to meet occupational exposure limits as required by Health and Safety legislation. Guidance notes, issued under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, prescribe maximum occupational exposure limits for a variety of pollutants, including all of the pollutants covered by the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, published in January 2000. Details of the limits for each pollutant are available from the Health and Safety Executive. London

Underground Limited (LUL) are responsible for ensuring that these limits are adhered to. LUL are in the process of developing an air quality monitoring standard, which would set out the monitoring arrangements and requirements in the Underground system. To date, all monitoring carried out during operational hours has indicated that levels of all pollutants are below the prescribed occupational exposure limits.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what progress has been made towards the goal of halving emissions of pollutants from road traffic from the 1997 levels by 2010.  [69374]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20718w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Emissions of air pollutants from road transport have fallen significantly since the beginning of the 1990s, despite traffic growth. This is largely the result of the progressively tighter new vehicle and fuel standards introduced over this period by the European Union. Our latest modelled estimates show that by 2001, total national emissions of oxides of nitrogen and particles from road transport (two of the air pollutants of most concern) had dropped to 77 per cent. and 74 per cent. respectively of their 1997 levels. By 2010, they are projected to fall to 41 per cent. and 44 per cent. respectively of their 1997 levels. These further reductions are forecast to come about partly because older, more polluting vehicles will be gradually phased out of the UK fleet, and partly because of the even more stringent EU emissions standards for new vehicles which will apply from 2005.

 Since 1997, concern about the increasingly unsustainable nature of the bushmeat trade and its effects on endangered species led to my Department raising the issue within the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). This resulted in the establishment of a Bushmeat Working Group to help Central and west African range states develop and implement their own solutions. We have contributed &#163;55,000 to the working group to help the range states participate and to support the recruitment of consultants to revise and harmonise their own wildlife policies and legislation. Work on this is currently under way and progress will be reported to the next conference of CITES parties, to be held in Chile in November.

 The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) set up a centralised database of seizures of illegal meat and animal products last year, receiving data from all the enforcement agencies. From 1 April 2001 until 12 July 2002, 797 seizures of consignments that included meat and animal products were reported to the database that had arrived on flights and ships from African countries. The volume of these seizures was approximately 1.58 tonnes.

 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2002]:</i> "Taking Water Responsibly" tasked the Environment Agency with developing plans, as part of its Catchment Abstraction Management Strategies (CAMS) programme, to convert existing permanent licences to time limited status on a prioritised basis, and also to consider establishing incentives in its Charges Scheme to encourage this. The first round of the agency's CAMS programme will take another seven years to be completed for the whole of England and Wales. It is intended to address the conversion of licences to time limited status as part of this process. The agency will also be consulting later this year on proposed revisions to its Charges Scheme, which are likely to include financial incentives to encourage voluntary conversion. "Taking Water Responsibly" (paragraph 7.12) acknowledged that "the process of conversion of existing licences to time limited status may be quite protracted".

 Interoperability is a broad subject and no single criterion determines the Ministry of Defence's requirements for interoperability. The issue includes interoperability between different equipment capabilities, between operational and business applications, as well as with allies and coalition partners. The ability to operate effectively alongside NATO partners, including the United States, in multinational operations is considered crucial. For each new equipment project, the Business Case through which the project is approved will consider explicit requirements for interoperability. This will also express, as a Key User Requirement, specific and affordable interoperability requirements for the system.

Furthermore, the recent Pension's Appeal Tribunal's decision is specific to that case and does not set a legal precedent. It would be wrong to interpret from the tribunal's finding that Gulf war syndrome does exist. However, the fact that there is, at present, no proper basis for recognising Gulf war syndrome as an appropriate diagnostic label does not prevent a Gulf veteran getting a war pension which is paid on a no-fault basis. Gulf veterans may also be eligible for no-fault pension benefits under the armed forces pension scheme.

<P>
<a name="20718w16.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 No-fault compensation for United Kingdom service personnel disabled as a result of their service is provided through the War Pension Scheme (WPS). The WPS applies to all those who have served in the UK forces. Veterans may also be eligible for an Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) occupational pension and, if they have been medically discharged, this is supplemented by attributable benefits linked to the degree of disability or non-attributable benefits linked to length of service, whichever is the greater. Both the WPS and AFPS provide benefits to the dependants of veterans who have died.
<P>

<a name="20718w16.html_para0">The Ministry of Defence has about 2,000 active notices from Gulf veterans and members of their families of their intention to claim common law compensation in respect of illness allegedly arising from the Gulf conflict. However, we have still yet to receive any writs or claims of sufficient detail to allow these cases to be taken forward. When compensation claims are submitted against the MOD, they are considered on the basis of whether or not the Department has a legal liability to pay compensation. Where there is a legal liability to pay compensation we do so.

 Nimrod MRA4 is a highly complex, software intensive and sophisticated product. The degree of technical challenge has led to a delay in delivery, with the in-service date re-set in 1999 to March 2005. BAE Systems are driving hard for this target and the key interim deliverable of first flight, expected by the end of this year. The Ministry of Defence and the company are also ensuring that Day 1 and whole life support are in place as required. The capability to be provided will be a step change from that currently available. Nimrod will be the leading class product, evidenced by US interest in MRA4 as a contender for their Multi-Mission Aircraft programme.

The A400M prime contractor, Airbus Military, is responsible for selecting the aircraft's engines. In December 2001 the company sought new tenders for the A400M engine after deciding not to proceed with its earlier choice of engine. The hon. Member will recall that the A400M contract is for the development and production of the complete aircraft, including its engines. Airbus Military is free, therefore, to select its suppliers on grounds of performance and cost, thereby ensuring that we obtain best value for money. No EU funding for research and development is available to either Pratt and Whitney or Rolls Royce in connection with the A400M engines. We understand that Airbus Military expect to announce their engine selection when the A400M prime contract becomes effective. Partner nations are working to bring the prime contract into effect at the earliest opportunity.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what action he will take to inform ex-servicemen demobbed in 1952 of entitlement to war benefit; and if he will make a statement.  [70560]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20718w17.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Veterans Agency already undertakes a significant amount of publicity to raise awareness about war pensions. It does not however target ex-servicemen demobbed in any particular year.
<P>

<a name="20718w17.html_para0">The Agency issues a range of information leaflets and posters to a number of different outlets such as post offices, regimental museums, GP surgeries and works closely with ex-service organisations. In addition the Veterans Agency website contains comprehensive information and the War Pensioners Welfare Service holds advice days and surgeries using a mobile advice unit to access more remote areas.

 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2002]:</i> The future offensive air system is currently in the concept phase with a planned in service date of around 2017. We are currently looking at a potential mix of platforms including long range cruise missiles, uninhabited air combat vehicles and manned aircraft. No final decisions have been taken on the solution.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20718w17.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2002]:</i> We are at the early stages of evaluating ways in which unmanned aircraft could contribute to our future offensive air system (FOAS) capability. As part of our continuing dialogue with United States colleagues, we have discussed the X-45 vehicle. But we have made no formal assessment of the X-45; and nor have we yet taken any decisions about developing or acquiring specific unmanned aircraft in relation to FOAS.

 Under the Watchkeeper programme we are considering how tactical unmanned aerial vehicles can enhance our reconnaissance and imagery intelligence capabilities. Four industry consortia have proposed a range of system solutions (both air vehicles and ground segment elements). The Predator air vehicle is a part of one of these solutions.
<P>

<a name="20718w17.html_para2">We intend later this year to select two potential solutions for more detailed assessment. Our aim is to select a single preferred solution by the end of 2003.

 I have not had discussions on this subject with my Turkish counterpart, although I did discuss the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) with its Commander, Major General Zorlu of the Turkish Army, when I met him recently in Kabul. UN Security Council Resolution 1413 authorised ISAF to continue operations in Kabul for another six months from 20 June 2002 under Turkey's leadership. It is too early to say what might happen after that.

 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2002]:</i> I will place a report on the studies carried out by officials in the Libraries of both Houses and will inform my right hon. Friend when I have done so. This material focuses on the licensing systems of countries rather than cities and on Europe rather than the United States. Published material on non-European countries was also considered in the development of the proposals set out in 'Time for Reform'.

<a name="20718w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Sport, particularly at local club level, would be unable to flourish without 1.5 million volunteers, who include administrators, mentors and officials, as well as coaches. The Government's Plan for Sport recognised the critical importance of volunteers and the need to invest in maintaining numbers through training. The Step into Sport project aims to meet this need by investing &#163;7 million over two years in training 60,000 young people and 8,000 adults to volunteer in sport, and by assisting the national governing bodies of sport to produce volunteer support strategies. A further initiative, Come into Coaching, will aim to attract volunteer coaches and administrators from March 2003.

 <i>[holding answer 10 June 2002]:</i> In 1999, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) introduced an adverse outcome analysis system. This provides CPS areas with a consistent means to identify reasons for adverse outcomes and also to allocate responsibility of any failure. This information is collated centrally.

<a name="20718w19.html_para5">For the last seven years, many areas of the CPS have had in place, with the police, a system of joint performance management that involves an appraisal of Crown court acquittals, including those ordered and 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jul 2002 : Column 504W</I><P>
directed by the judge. This process provides areas with information showing particular trends and a means by which improvements can be made.
<P>

<a name="20718w19.html_para6">The Crown Prosecution Service produces quarterly summaries of unsuccessful case outcomes from information drawn from its various case tracking systems. This year the CPS and the police have begun to develop a joint case outcome analysis which builds on these two processes and will focus on avoidable case failure. Under this system, the reasons for judge ordered and judge directed acquittals in individual cases will be jointly assessed for individual training needs and other joint strategies for performance improvement.
<P>

<a name="20718w19.html_para7">The process will be supported by more sophisticated management information following the introduction of the CPS' Compass Case Management System due to roll out between April and December 2003.
<P>

<a name="20718w19.html_para8">The figures in the table show a fall in judge directed acquittals from 1,777 in 1999 to 1,471 last year, a reduction of 17.2 per cent. Over the same period judge ordered acquittals rose from 9,616 to 11,825, an increase of 23 per cent. Much of this increase can be attributed to recent changes in procedures. Since January 2001, the prosecution, unlike before, have been able to discontinue cases in the Crown court. Although this is a prosecution decision, the current system records these as judge ordered acquittals.

 CCTV cameras in the Short Strand area are the sole responsibility of PSNI. However, I believe there is a great deal of potential with CCTV and have been monitoring their use. The Police Service has 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jul 2002 : Column 507W</I><P>

 The Police Service of Northern Ireland, following discussion with the Northern Ireland Policing Board and ACPO, will shortly place an order for six new vehicle-mounted water cannon. It is hoped that the water cannon will be delivered before the summer of 2003.

<a name="20718w20.html_para6">This decision reflects the particular circumstances of North Ireland.

 The Organised Crime Task Force, which I chair, recognises the lingering, significant influence of paramilitary groups in such organised crime activities and assesses that nearly half of the 76 organised crime groups identified in Northern Ireland are either controlled by, or linked with, republican or loyalist paramilitary organisations.
<P>

<a name="20718w20.html_para8">That said, it is very important that I confirm that the law enforcement agencies represented on the Task Force do not tackle organised criminals or crime groups on the basis of their paramilitary affiliations (or lack of them), but because of their involvement in criminal activities.

<a name="20718w20.html_para9">The Government believe that the most effective sanctions against those engaged in criminality is to disrupt the activity and bring those involved to justice.

 The Organised Crime Task Force, which I chair, has a clear strategy in place to tackle these two key areas of organised criminal activity, which are laid out in the "Confronting the Threat" threat assessment and strategy documents, published and laid in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament on 23 May 2002.
<P>

<a name="20718w20.html_para11">The threat assessment and strategy documents describe in detail the successes that the law enforcement agencies have had in tackling smuggling, counterfeiting and, indeed, other areas of organised criminality. In brief, the Task Force has identified 76 criminal networks involved in a range of organised criminality. It has been assessed that at 31 March 2002: 41 per cent. of the groups are involved in tobacco smuggling; 30 per cent. engaged in alcohol smuggling; 26 per cent. in hydrocarbon smuggling; and 34 per cent. of the group are involved in counterfeiting goods.
<P>

<a name="20718w20.html_para12">During the last financial year, 57 criminal networks were subject to detailed law enforcement investigation and 43 have had members arrested for a wider range of serious offences. As a direct result of such action, 42 organised crime networks have been disrupted or dismantled.

 Very substantial advances were made in the implementation of the Belfast Agreement in recent times. Since last autumn, the devolved institutions have been operating fully effectively; substantial reforms to the policing and justice systems have been carried forward in the last year and there have been acts of decommissioning by the IRA. Continued implementation of the agreement is essential to the political future of Northern Ireland.

In the financial year 2001&#150;02 the overall budget for this support was &#163;7.4 million. Funding is based on an average of course costs at the main maritime colleges. In broad terms this means that 50 per cent. of eligible costs are covered for each participant's course.

You have asked the following questions:
<BR>
"To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many existing cases need to be transferred to and how many new cases have been assessed under the new Child Support scheme".
<BR>
No cases have yet been assessed under the new Child Support scheme. We can only begin to assess cases under the new scheme when Ministers have decided to implement the new arrangements. When they do so they will have to lay a Commencement Order before Parliament. They will only do that when they are confident about when our new computer system, that is currently being tested, will be operational.

Based on current forecasts of the predicted Agency caseload, it is estimated that approximately one million existing cases would require to be transferred to the new child support scheme.

 Most existing services, and new services that are being set up, will generally be provided for the cost of a local call (0845 numbers) or, in some circumstances, free. Where different charges currently apply (e.g. 0870 numbers), services are expected to move to the local rate/free charging regime as opportunities arise to do so.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions for what reason the maximum backdating allowed for the retirement pension is three months; and if he will make a statement.  [66557]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20718w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The absolute time limit of three months for claiming retirement pension was introduced in April 1997 as part of the rationalisation of time limits for all benefits undertaken at that time. Before this date there were a large number of different rules and time periods for the backdating of the claims for different benefits. It was a confusing picture and it was widely recognised that there was a need to simplify the rules. It was considered appropriate for people to have three months in which to make a claim for one of the contributory benefits. Retirement pension is one of those benefits.

<a name="20718w24.html_para5">Many of these young people faced significant barriers to employment. The New Deal has given them the skills and motivation to help them move into work.

 The Employment Zone contracts are subject to qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The qualitative study of Zone operations between winter 2000 and summer 2001 was published on 17 July 2002 (Working Age Evaluation Series, Number 124). A copy has been placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20718w24.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Jobcentre Plus works with Employment Zone contractors to help long-term unemployed people in 15 deprived areas move off benefit and into work. By the end of February 2002, the zones had helped over 22,300 people into jobs.
<P>

<a name="20718w24.html_para12">People aged 25 and over, living in a zone area and claiming income-based jobseeker's allowance, become eligible for employment zone help after either 12 or 18 months' unemployment (depending on the employment zone area). Jobcentre Plus identifies and refers eligible people to the employment zone at the appropriate time. Eligible participants who fail to attend an employment zone are brought to the attention of Jobcentre Plus by their personal adviser and may have their benefit sanctioned if there is no good cause for their non-attendance.
<P>

<a name="20718w24.html_para13">Jobcentre Plus and employment zone contractors have developed a strong working relationship. One of the ways they have achieved this is through the secondment of Jobcentre Plus staff to employment zones. Employment zones also have access to Jobcentre Plus premises and labour market information systems. This strong partnership ensures that payments to clients are accurate, and the zones contribute to Jobcentre Plus' achievement of the best job outcomes for clients.

<a name="20718w26.html_para6">In Wales, responsibility for Children's Play issues rests with the National Assembly for Wales, who are in the process of producing a play policy for Wales, and not with Whitehall Departments, who are only responsible for play matters in England.
<P>

<a name="20718w26.html_para7">In December 2000, DCMS produced a guidance document for English local authorities entitled "Creating Opportunities", which encourages local authorities to develop and implement Local Cultural Strategies. The guidance explicitly lists play as something to be within the scope of cultural strategies, encompassing: children's play, playgrounds and play activities, parks and open spaces.
<P>

<a name="20718w26.html_para8">DCMS also funded "Play as Culture", researched and published by Playlink, a document which provides detailed guidance about incorporating play in cultural strategies. It was co-sponsored by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and the then Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, and was publicised and disseminated via the Local Government Association (LGA), the Institute of Leisure and Management and Early Years Partnerships. There is also soon to be a weblink directly to the document on the Playlink website from the DCMS website and a second round of distribution is about to begin.
<P>

<a name="20718w26.html_para9">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently revising "Planning Policy Guidance note 17: Sports, Recreation and Open Space" (PPG17) which will provide guidance on the provision of a full range of urban open spaces, including play space. The revision, along with associated good practice guidance, will provide guidance for improving local assessments of need for such spaces

and for carrying out audits of existing spaces. While these will encourage the setting of local standards for provision of new spaces, they will not give any specific guidance on the size of play spaces.

 In my oral statement to the House today I referred to our proposals for planning reform. I announced that I am publishing today our response to the recent Planning Green Paper consultation, copies of which are in the House Library. I am also making public a more detailed statement entitled "Compulsory Purchase Powers, Procedures and Compensation; the way forward", copies of which are available in the House Library and on the ODPM website. This summarises our policy in the light of the responses to the December 2001 consultation paper.
<P>

<a name="20718w27.html_para0">The paper sets out our plans for making compulsory purchase and compensation simpler, fairer and quicker through a change to the compulsory purchase power for planning purposes, and through changes to procedures and compensation arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20718w27.html_para1">The Law Commission is continuing its work on consolidation, codification and modernisation of the current legislation, and will consult on its initial conclusions shortly.

 At present organisations outside of the national health service do not contribute to the management of any NHS trusts, including acute hospital trusts and primary care trusts.
<P>

<a name="20718w27.html_para2">The Department is setting up a register of interest for organisations outside of the NHS which are interested in taking on the management franchise for poorly performing NHS trusts. The register may include not-for- profit organisations.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20718w27.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We currently allocate funding to health authorities, and they allocate funding to primary care trusts, on the basis of the relative needs of their populations.
<P>

<a name="20718w27.html_para3">It is for health authorities in partnership with primary care trusts and other local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling health inequalities and modernising services.
<P>

<a name="20718w27.html_para4">In future the intention is that allocations will be made direct to primary care trusts. Primary care trusts will then purchase appropriate services to meet the needs of their local populations, which may include services from rural hospitals.

 Guidance on maintaining privacy and dignity was first issued to the service in 1997 and since then the national health service has been working towards a clear target to provide single sex accommodation.
<P>

 Existing guidelines place nurses and other health care workers, who are or may be HIV infected, under ethical and legal duties to protect the health and safety of their patients by seeking counselling and HIV testing if they believe they have been at risk of infection.

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made a statement to the House on 3 July, announcing the publication of a consultation paper on Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud. The consultation period will last until 10 January 2003. The Government has made it clear that the introduction of an entitlement card would be a major step and that it would not proceed without consulting widely and considering all the views expressed very carefully.
<P>

<a name="20718w30.html_para0">The paper includes a number of estimates of what a scheme would cost, depending on the sophistication of the card. A reasonable estimate would be that a scheme would cost around &#163;1.5 billion over a 13 year period covering the three years it would take to set up the necessary Information Technology systems and the 10 year period for which the first cards would be valid.
<P>

<a name="20718w30.html_para1">This would include much more stringent identity checks than currently apply for passports and driving licences in response to increased levels of fraudulent applications.
<P>

<a name="20718w30.html_para2">It would also include the costs of using biometric information (fingerprints or iris images) which would uniquely link the card holder with a card.
<P>

<a name="20718w30.html_para3">This estimate does not include any savings to Government through more efficient administration and reductions in fraud. The paper also sets out how the costs might be recovered through increases in fees for driving licences and passports and charging a fee for entitlement cards issued to those who did not qualify for or who did not want to apply for a card in the form of a photocard

 The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill presently before Parliament contains provision for language and citizenship education for people seeking naturalisation. A group of experts is to be formed to advise my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, on how these proposals might be implemented in practice. Among other things, the group will be asked to advise on the practicality of a national voluntary scheme for mentors to assist naturalisation applicants in making contacts in their local community.

 The Government are committed to ensuring that stronger measures are in place to penalise people who traffic in human beings. We have signed the protocol on trafficking to the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime and have negotiated an European Union Framework Decision, which commits the United Kingdom to introducing offences of trafficking for the purposes of labour or sexual exploitation within two years of its adoption.
<P>

<a name="20718w31.html_para0">We have acted quickly to deal with the worst forms of exploitation by creating a new offence of trafficking for the purposes of controlling someone in prostitution within the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill currently before Parliament. It will carry a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment, as for drug trafficking offences. This is a stop gap offence pending more wide-ranging offences of trafficking for sexual and labour exploitation when parliamentary time permits, which will implement our international obligations.

 The latest available information on the number of persons detained solely under Immigration Act powers relates to 30 March 2002. As at that date, 30 Zimbabweans (to the nearest five) were being detained who are recorded as having claimed asylum at some stage, which excludes persons detained in police cells. Provisionally, 55 certified refusals were made on asylum applications lodged by nationals of Zimbabwe in January 2002, 35 in February and 45 in March.
<P>

<a name="20718w31.html_para10">I regret that information on the number of asylum seekers from Zimbabwe who have been detained since 15 January is not available.
<P>

<a name="20718w31.html_para11">The suspension of removals of asylum seekers to Zimbabwe is a temporary measure. We are monitoring events in the aftermath of the Zimbabwe presidential election in close liaison with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). There is no set time scale, but it would be unrealistic to be able to make any decision on a resumption of removals until the immediate post-election situation has calmed down and we have had time to assess properly the risks to returnees and gather and consider the views of FCO and others. Zimbabwean asylum seekers have continued, where appropriate, to be detained at Oakington Reception Centre as part of the fast-track asylum process. Aside from such individuals, there will be a very small number of people who are detained at present pending removal while outstanding applications, appeals and other matters are resolved. Once such issues have been resolved, the persons concerned will normally be granted bail or temporary admission as appropriate while the suspension of removals remains in place.
<P>

<a name="20718w31.html_para12">Information on Immigration Act detainees as at 29 June and refusals in the second quarter (April to June) of 2002 will be published on 30 August on the Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate website at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what account is taken of whether a child was conceived within a lawful marriage overseas in determining right of entry to the United Kingdom to join a parent who is a British national.  [69733]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20718w32.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Under the Immigration Rules, a child aged 18 or under can be granted entry to join one parent in the United Kingdom, provided that the other parent is dead or that the parent here had had sole responsibility for their upbringing. A parent is defined as the father as well as the mother of an illegitimate child (where he is proved to be the father).
<P>

<a name="20718w32.html_para2">Illegitimate birth overseas to a British citizen father and non-British citizen mother would usually mean that the child was not a British citizen. However, discretion within the British Nationality Act 1981 can be used to register as a British citizen the illegitimate child of a British citizen father. Also, if the parents of an illegitimate child subsequently marry, and the law of the country in which the father is domiciled legitimises a child of the relationship upon the parents' marriage, the child will be treated as having been born legitimate. The child would then be regarded as a British citizen from birth and would be entitled to enter and remain freely in this country.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the mandate of the Committee for the implementation of the Community action programme on preventive measures to fight violence against children, young persons and women (Daphne) is; how many times it has met over the last 12 months; what the UK representation on it is; what the annual cost of its work is to public funds; if he will list the items currently under its consideration; if he will take steps to increase its accountability and transparency to Parliament; and if he will make a statement.

 The Daphne Committee assists the European Commission in the management and implementation of a programme which co-funds projects to promote the protection of children, young persons and women from violence and abuse. It normally meets twice a year, initially to agree the annual work programme and criteria for evaluating the selecting bids for funding and subsequently to discuss the bids which have been received and to agree the allocation of funds to successful projects.
<P>

<a name="20718w35.html_para1">The United Kingdom is represented on the Committee by a Home Office official (for issues concerning domestic violence and violence against women), an official from the Department of Health (for child protection issues) and an official from the United Kingdom Permanent Representation in Brussels.
<P>

<a name="20718w35.html_para2">The Daphne programme is funded by the European Community budget and travel costs to attend Committee meetings are met by the European Commission. The Home Office pays a subsistence allowance to cover attendance at a Committee meeting.
<P>

<a name="20718w35.html_para3">The Commission is required to prepare reports on the implementation of the programme in its second and final years which will be submitted to the Council and European Parliament. The reports will also be published in the EUROPA internet website. I do not see a need for further measures to increase the Committee's accountability and transparency.

 57 statutory instruments have been made by Home Office Ministers since 1 January 2002. Three have been revoked. Information is not available about the costs and savings of implementation and repeal and could not be made available other than at disproportionate cost.

<a name="20718w35.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the procedure is relating to the production of documents at a police station within seven days of being stopped in a motor vehicle; and whether a receipt or NCR copy should be provided on production of an HORT2 form.  [59449]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20718w35.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 June 2002]:</i> Police officers are entitled under the Road Traffic Act 1988 to require motorists to produce a range of driver and vehicle related documents for inspection. A motorist failing to produce such documents on request is guilty of an offence, unless he produces them at a police station of his nomination within seven days.
<P>

<a name="20718w35.html_para7">If any of the required documents cannot be made available at the time of the police request, the motorist is issued with a form HORT 1. This formally notifies him that within the specified time he must present the documents at a police station of his choice, which is recorded on the form.
<P>

<a name="20718w35.html_para8">The HORT 1 is in two parts. The top copy is issued to the driver, the bottom is retained within the issuing force to monitor and control the subsequent presentation of the documents. Upon their presentation, staff at the nominated police station inspect them and record the necessary details on a two part document known as the HORT 2. One part of the HORT 2 is then retained by the nominated police station and the second part sent to the originating police force so that they can verify compliance with the original request.
<P>

<a name="20718w35.html_para9">The HORT system has no statutory basis. It is operated by the police for administrative convenience without any direct Government involvement. In 1996 an Association of Chief Police Officers Working Group considered whether the system should include the issue of a receipt for documents produced. The Group unanimously concluded that the costs incurred would far exceed any benefit.
