 The potential economic impact of the new A500 through Stoke on Trent was assessed as set out in the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR) document &#147;Guidance on the Methodology for Multi-Modal Studies&#148; (GOMMS, 2000).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="60621w0001.htm_para2"><a name="06062165000018">With regard to Transport Economy Efficiency, the quantitative economic modelling carried out before start of works in 2004 shows that the A500 Scheme has a Benefit to Cost Ratio of 4.0. The Benefit to Cost Ratio is a measure of the economic efficiency, and is calculated by dividing the benefits by the costs, and a BCR of 4 is considered &#147;High&#148; Value for Money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"><a name="60621w0001.htm_para3"><a name="06062165000019">With regard to Reliability, the qualitative assessment shows that the A500 Scheme has a positive &#147;Beneficial&#148; impact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="60621w0001.htm_para4"><a name="06062165000020">With regard to Wider Economic Impacts, the qualitative assessment shows that the A500 Scheme lies within and will directly serve the Stoke-on-Trent designated regeneration area, and that Development will depend upon the A500 Scheme.</p>

 Government are taking a number of measures to encourage the use of cleaner and more efficient sources of energy such as renewables, combined heat and power (CHP), and carbon abatement technologies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_438"><a name="60621w0004.htm_para6"><a name="06062186000084">The Government's key mechanism for encouraging renewable generation is the Renewables Obligation (RO) which places an obligation on electricity suppliers to source a specific and annually increasing percentage of their sales from eligible renewable sources. This is set at 6.7 per cent. for 2006-07 and will rise to 15.4 per cent. by 2015-16. The RO together with the Climate Change Levy will be worth up to &#163;l billion per year by 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_439"><a name="60621w0004.htm_para7"><a name="06062186000085">Since 2002 the Government have also made available around &#163;500 million of direct funding for emerging renewable and low carbon technologies in the form of capital grants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_440"><a name="60621w0004.htm_para8"><a name="06062186000086">This includes:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_441"><a name="60621w0004.htm_para9"><a name="06062186000087">With regard to Combined Heat and Power (CHP) the Government have added support measures for CHP in the new Climate Change Programme, including a commitment that CHP will be fully considered in the UK's Phase II National Allocation Plan of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Combined heat and power (CHP) can increase the overall efficiency of fuel utilisation to more than 75 per cent. compared with up to 50 per cent. from modern Combined Cycle Gas Turbines. We are also considering whether we can offer support for CHP under the current Energy Review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_442"><a name="60621w0004.htm_para10"><a name="06062186000088">In 2005 the Government launched the Carbon Abatement Technologies Strategy and the UK's Strategic Framework for Hydrogen Energy. Carbon Abatement Technologies (CATs) have the potential to significantly lower carbon dioxide emissions by 85 per cent. or more and will enable the cleaner use of coal and allow it to have a role in a sustainable world. The use of hydrogen as a transport fuel could provide significant cost-competitive CO2 reductions by 2030. These strategies include (as listed above) funding for demonstration of hydrogen, fuel cell and carbon abatement technologies (including Cleaner Coal and Carbon Capture and Storage).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_443"><a name="60621w0004.htm_para11"><a name="06062186000089">The EU Emissions Trading scheme covers electricity generation and energy intensive industry and requires an allowance to be produced for every tonne of carbon dioxide emitted. These allowances are tradeable across the EU and will effectively require companies to incorporate the cost of carbon into decision making. This scheme should therefore provide another incentive to invest in cleaner and more efficient sources of energy.</p>

<a name="60621w0006.htm_brev13"><a name="06062186001546"><ul><p class="tabletext">It should be noted that the number of people eligible to vote is not the same as the resident population aged 18 and over. There are numerous reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>

 DFID funds antiretroviral treatment in Burma through the joint-donor Fund for HIV/AIDS in Myanmar (FHAM), to which DFID is the largest contributor, providing &#163;10 million over five years. At 31 March 2006, the FHAM was providing antiretroviral treatment to 2,953 patients.

Those organisations funded by FHAM who provide antiretroviral treatment but do not use CD4 T-cell counts instead test patients' blood using a process of clinical staging, which is also regarded as a good practice means of monitoring treatment efficacy. In addition, the introduction of a further test for the effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment is planned for the near future, when HIV viral load testing will be made available at the central National Health Laboratory, with the support of UNICEF.</p>

 Neither Defra nor the Carbon Trust holds this information. Defra collects data on energy use by the food industry. However it is not possible to break down the data to the level needed to estimate the energy used to produce plastic or glass bottles for packaging spring or mineral waters. Energy use in producing bottles is, in any case, only one factor that needs to be taken into account&#151;along with others such as transport, and re-use or re-cycling of materials&#151;when assessing which type of packaging is the best sustainable option.</p>

 The Department has not conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the use of ESAT6 and CFP10 in combination with the standard purified protein derivative (PPD). Although the use of these more specific antigens may reduce the small numbers of false positive diagnoses, there is also some loss in sensitivity, that is, the chances of detecting truly infected animals.

 I have had no specific discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland about this issue. However, I am aware of the approach to water affordability being taken in Northern Ireland, in particular the new affordability tariff. This is being introduced in response to particular circumstances which do not apply in England and Wales. Northern Ireland has a public sector water service while in England and Wales the industry has been fully privatised since 1989. A parallel cannot be drawn between the positions in Northern Ireland and England.</p>

The UK Government, in common with those of a majority of International Whaling Commission (IWC) members, has regularly criticised Japanese scientific whaling programmes in both the North Pacific (JARPN) and the Southern ocean (JARPA) as being of little scientific value and urged Japan to terminate them forthwith.</p>

1. Caseload take-up compares the number of benefit recipients, averaged over the year, with the number who would be receiving if everyone took up their entitlement.<br>
2. Expenditure take-up compares the total amount of benefit received, in the course of the year, with the total amount that would be received if everyone took up their entitlement for the full period of their entitlement.<br>
3. The estimates exclude the full-time self-employed, and cover private households only.<br>
4. Estimates for 1988 to 1992 are sourced from the Family Expenditure Survey, and cover calendar years. These years have been combined due to small sample sizes in each of the years.<br>
5. Estimates for 1998 and 1999 are based on the calendar year 1989 and April to December 1988.<br>
6. Family credit was replaced with working families tax credit in October 1999; take-up statistics for the period April 1999 to October 1999 were not published.<br>
7. Due to small samples sizes on the FES for family credit, estimates are open to a significant margin of error.<br>
8. The source for estimates for 1993-94 to 1998-99 is the Family Resources Survey, and covers financial years.<br>
 9. Estimates up until 1995-96 were presented as point estimates. Thereafter, estimates were presented as ranges as the point estimate was adjusted to take account of sampling variation. Estimates were not adjusted to take account of possible bias, so the Department is less confident that the true level of take-up lies within the ranges given, than it is for other benefits.<br>
10. Estimates were published in "Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-up" series. Copies are available in the Library.<br>

1. Income-related benefits are pension credit (PC), minimum income guarantee/income support for the over 60s (MIG/IS), jobseeker's allowance (income based) (JSA(IB)), housing benefit (HB), community charge benefit/council tax benefit (CCB/CTB), family credit (FC) and disability working allowance (DWA).<br>
2. Overlaps between benefits have been removed.<br>
3. Figures have been rounded to the nearest ten thousand, due to the estimation procedure to produce the figures for housing benefit and/or council tax benefit.<br>
4. Beneficiaries is the sum of claimants aged 60 or over and claimants' partners aged 60 or over.<br>
5. Percentage for population has been calculated using the revised Office for National Statistics (ONS) mid-year population estimates for age group 60 and over, for 1990 to 2004, and Government Actuary's Department 2004-based mid-year population projections for 2005 to 2006.<br>
6. Figures based on one per cent and five per cent samples are subject to sampling variation. These include all JSA figures, information concerning partners of PC and MIG/IS claimants, and all other figures prior to 2000 except DWA which is derived from 100 per cent. sample data. HB/CTB (all years) and IS (1990 to 1993) are derived from one per cent samples. All other figures were obtained from the WPLS.<br>
7. CTB data excludes second adult rebate cases.<br>
8. HB data excludes any extended payment cases.<br>
9. Jobseeker's allowance replaced income support for the unemployed in October 1996.<br>
10. Some JSA(IB) claimants may also have entitlement to benefit via the contributory route.<br>
11. A consistent data series prior to 1990 cannot be provided due to a lack of HB/CTB data, and because overlapping cases cannot be identified.<br>
12. Estimates for 1990 to 2004 are based on past benefit data. The estimate for 2005 is based on projections for HB and CTB, and past benefit data for other benefits. The estimate for 2006 is based on projections for all benefits.<br>
13. The increase in beneficiaries from 2004 is due to the introduction of pension credit which is more generous than its predecessors. People aged 65 and over are rewarded for making provision for their retirement through the savings credit. In addition pension credit assumes &#163;1 of income for every &#163;500 of savings above &#163;6,000. This is half the assumed rate of income in the MIG. Pension credit has also been the subject of considerable take-up activity by The Pension Service.<br>

 The UK is fulfilling all its obligations under the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons (NPT), including those on disarmament under Article VI of the treaty. We continue to support the relevant disarmament measures contained in the Final Document from the NPT Review Conference (RevCon) in 2000, including the 13 practical steps towards disarmament, and we have a good record on meeting the priorities they set out. Not all the 13 steps are relevant to the UK, such as those relating to bilateral measures between the US and Russia. However, we have made progress on the majority of the other steps. For example, in 2000 the UK initiated a research programme to study techniques and technologies that could be used to verify nuclear disarmament. Conclusions of this programme were presented to the 2005 NPT RevCon. We continue to call for the entry into force of the comprehensive test ban treaty as soon as possible and, pending its entry into force, maintain a moratorium on nuclear weapons test explosions and any other nuclear explosions. The UK is also pressing for the immediate commencement of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty, without preconditions, at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.</p>

 For more than 70 years hospitals have been able to recover the costs of providing treatment to the victims of road traffic accidents where the injured person successfully claims personal injury compensation from the person responsible for the accident. The arrangements for this were streamlined and centralised through the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 which established a formal recovery scheme, operated on behalf of the Secretary of State by the Compensation Recovery Unit, part of the Department for Work and Pensions. Where a compensation payment is made to a road traffic accident victim by an insurer, the insurer is also obliged under the terms of the scheme to make a payment towards the cost of any hospital treatment the injured person needed, in accordance with a simple tariff system covering in-patient or out-patient treatment as appropriate. The injured person is not required to make any payment towards their own treatment costs under the scheme.</p>

Following a public consultation on draft regulations that will govern the operation of the ICR scheme, it was decided to widen the scope for the scheme to take into account contributory negligence where this has been a factor in the primary compensation claim. The necessary amendment to the 2003 Act is contained in the Health Bill. In order to allow adequate time for the Bill to complete its passage through Parliament and for the amending clause to be brought into effect from the outset of the ICR scheme, the scheme is now expected to be introduced from 29 January 2007.

 A list of names of all the organisations and individuals that responded at one or other stage of the consultation process on the national specification for integrated care records service is not held centrally. Some of the responses were provided by organisations which are no longer active.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_542"><a name="60621w0019.htm_para0"><a name="06062210000395">The original &#147;National Specification for Integrated Care Records Service (Consultation Draft)&#148; was issued in July 2002 by the NHS Information Authority. Some 190 responses to the document were received from suppliers, clinicians, chief information officers (CIOs), information technology (IT) departments of national health service bodies and others, commenting on such aspects as architecture, functional omissions and the realisation of benefits that such a system would produce. These comments were included and formed the base document for the early draft of the output based specification (OBS). This draft was then refined. The clinical input was provided by almost three hundred individuals, and the IT community (IT managers and CIOs) numbered a further one hundred. A broad spectrum of NHS stakeholders was then engaged to review the draft OBS. The review group encompassed leading clinicians, practitioners, policy advisors, health informaticians and managers and included representatives from the Department, the NHS Information Authority, strategic health authorities, NHS trusts, primary care trusts, general practitioners, academic groups and other Government Departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_544"><a name="60621w0019.htm_para2"><a name="06062210000397">A final list of 239 people was invited to review the OBS, from which a total of 105 formal review documents were received. From the 900 pages reviewed there were 1,175 comments of substance. These comments resulted in a further refined version of the OBS which was then distributed for any final comment. A response to every individual comment was returned to the reviewer in question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_545"><a name="60621w0019.htm_para3"><a name="06062210000398">Reflecting a level of transparency unprecedented for major projects within Government, the OBS was published to the public domain in July 2003 and is available on the Department&#146;s website at www.dh.gov .uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_546"><a name="60621w0019.htm_para4"><a name="06062210000399">In addition to many hundreds of internal meetings, there were 44 meetings held by the clinicians from the national programme with important stakeholders and stakeholder groups.

 Surpluses generated by primary care trusts (PCTs) are transferred and held by strategic health authorities (SHAs) to allow the SHA to balance the financial position across all the organisations they performance manage.

<i> [holding answer 19 June 2006]:</i> The Department makes allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs) based on the needs of their relevant populations. PCTs agree service level agreements with national health service providers to ensure the necessary healthcare is available for their populations. If activity is carried out by a NHS provider outside these agreements, for example when an individual is on holiday, then the NHS provider is expected to invoice the individual's PCT for the cost of that activity. No allocations are made to cover the cost of this activity as the cost is already funded from within PCTs' allocations.</p>

 The &#147;Investing in Your Health&#148; strategic outline case (SOC) for a reconfiguration of acute services in Hertfordshire was received by the Department in 2004. This covered developments to be taken forward by both East and North Hertfordshire national health service trust and the West Hertfordshire NHS trust.

Roads Service intends to commence drainage improvement works on this section during 2006-07, however, given the overall length of this section of road, it is likely that this work will continue over the next few years, with a longer-term aim to resurface the road.

The procurement routes for the schools announced for capital funding in March are being announced today and this will enable planning of new schools for Foyle and Londonderry college and Ebrington primary school to go forward.</p>

 European Union legislation requires that all new non-urban buses (such as those in education and library board fleets) must be fitted with seatbelts as standard. Boards have, since 2000, been purchasing all new vehicles fully fitted with seatbelts. At present 65 per cent. of all board fleet vehicles have seat belts fitted. That figure should rise to 70 per cent. of the fleet once the latest order for new buses has been met. In addition, all new vehicles purchased by the boards have a recorded safety announcement fitted as standard, which reminds pupils of the need to wear their seatbelts.</p>

The affordability tariff is a capped tariff which has been calculated by reference to the single person&#146;s pension credit guarantee, which is updated by Parliament each year. In 2007-08 this means there will be a maximum water and sewerage bill, for properties valued at &#163;100,000 of approx &#163;180 (which is 3 per cent. of the estimated pension credit guarantee in that year&#151;around &#163;6,000) with additional protection in the form of lower levels of capped charges set for those with properties valued at less than &#163;100,000.</p>

As the charges will be phased in over three years this will mean that the maximum bill for eligible low-income customers in 2007-08 will be &#163;30, &#163;45 or &#163;60, linked to the value of the property, rising to around &#163;95, &#163;145 and &#163;190 in 2009-10, depending on the pension credit guarantee income level at that time.</p>

However it is estimated that around 200,000, close to 30 per cent. of all households will benefit from the affordability tariff and that this number will not change significantly each year. The implementation of the affordability tariff will be closely monitored and reviewed when charges are fully phased in by 2009-10 and the Department will collate all relevant data to assess the scheme against income levels at that time.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 June 2006]:</i> The Government recognises the importance of personal finance education for all young people. The National Curriculum for Citizenship, which is compulsory at key stages 3 and 4 (11 to 16 year olds), includes teaching pupils about how the economy functions, including the role of business and financial services. Pupils are also taught about how public services are financed. In addition, the DfES has asked the QCA, as part of the wider review of GCSE maths and the emphasis on improving functional skills, to consider including financial capability more explicitly in the maths curriculum. In September 2004 we made work-related learning a statutory element of the curriculum, and from September 2005 are funding schools to develop a new focus on enterprise education, defined as enterprise capability supported by better financial capability and economic and business understanding.</p>

Ofsted encourages heads to share their performance and assessment (PANDA) report with their governors.

across all sectors: public, voluntary, businesses and charities. In schools, our intention is that the Simplification Plan will cover reduced communications from the centre; the New Relationships with Schools programme; funding rationalisation; simplified inspection; less data requests and simplification arising from the Education Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_641"><a name="60621w0031.htm_para7"><a name="06062222002129">As a Department, we remain determined to make sure our policies have the maximum impact on standards with the minimum burden on schools. That is why we set up the Implementation Review Unit in April 2003 to review the implementation of existing and new policy initiatives, covering all organisations that impact on schools in England. The panel provides feedback on policy implementation, challenges existing systems, and is a sounding board on innovation.</p>

We have also developed a data protocol with many external partners, to ensure that only essential data is collected, that they are collected by sample wherever possible and that they are collected only once and then used many times.</p>

These offences relate to a wide range of identity documents, including passports, driving licences, ID cards and immigration documents.
