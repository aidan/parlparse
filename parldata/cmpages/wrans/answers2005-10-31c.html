 The Department has put in place a considerable programme of improvements across a wide range of transport policy areas since 1997. I am confident that the Gateshead East and Washington West constituency will have benefited from these. For example, the injury totals for all road casualties in Great Britain fell from 327,803 in 1997 to 280,840 in 2004, and the numbers of children aged less than 16 years killed or seriously injured on our roads fell from 6,452 in 1997 to 3,905 in 2004. On our railways, passenger kilometres have increased from 32.1 billion in 1996&#150;67 to 42.4 billion in 2004&#150;05, a rise of 32 per cent. In terms of improvements to air quality, emissions of the UK&#039;s two main pollutants, nitrous oxides and particles, fell by 38 per cent. and 21 per cent. respectively between 1997 and 2003.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what assessment he has made of the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>31 Oct 2005 : Column 669W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
process by which power was transferred from the police to local authorities following the decriminalisation of parking offences; what steps he took to ensure that this was a smooth transition of authority; and if he will make a statement;  [22882]

<p><a name="qnpa_2">(3) what assessment he has made of the management of parking offences by local authorities since decriminalisation of parking offences; and if he will make a statement.  [23078]</p>








<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51031w02.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 The Road Traffic Act 1991 provides for the decriminalisation of most non-endorseable on-street parking offences in London and allows similar arrangements to be introduced elsewhere. Research for the Department by the Transport Research Laboratory (Special Parking Areas in London&quot;; The Special Parking Area in the District of Winchester&quot;; and The Special Parking Area in Oxford&quot;) showed that decriminalised parking enforcement provides local authorities with greater control over their enforcement activity and an enhanced ability to deliver their parking strategies. The Department partly funded the British Parking Association&#039;s recent review of decriminalised parking enforcement, which concluded that the existing system works well but that it would benefit from some modifications.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51031w02.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_7">In 1995, the Secretary of State issued detailed guidance for local authorities in England outside of London on applying for, introducing and operating decriminalised parking enforcement. The guidance&#151;local authority circular 1/95&#151;makes clear that local authorities should liaise with the police to ensure a smooth and orderly transfer of responsibilities and that they should, therefore, continue to liaise with the police so that the two systems can operate effectively side-by-side. When applying for the power to enforce parking regulations, authorities have to submit detailed applications to the Department for Transport which need to confirm, among other things, that the authority will review its existing Traffic Regulation Orders, signs and road markings and use suitable documentation&#151;including an appropriate penalty charge notice (PCN)&#151;when enforcing contraventions. The appropriate police authority is asked whether it supports the application.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51031w02.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_8">Circular 1/95 also makes it clear that the Government expect authorities to have regard to the minimum or common standards set out in that guidance. The information that must appear on a penalty charge notice is set out in the Road Traffic Act 1991. The Secretary of State&#039;s 1/95 guidance provides further suggestions about information that should be provided on penalty charge notices.

 The Government regards responsible business behaviour as very important and that corporate social responsibility can help companies to become more efficient, more profitable and more sustainable. The Company Law Reform Bill will address one aspect of corporate social responsibility through its introduction of a statutory statement of directors general duties. This will provide greater clarity to directors on how they are expected to behave. The basic goal of directors is the success of the company in the collective best interests of shareholders, but in fulfilling this duty directors will be required, to have regard to factors such as the impact of the company&#039;s operations on the community and the environment. This approach will give directors the clarity they need, while recognising that business prosperity and responsible business behaviour are two sides of the same coin. It complements the requirement on quoted companies to report on matters such as social and community issues and the environment in the operating and financial review where these are necessary for an understanding of the nature of the business.

 The best opportunity for increasing the accessibility of the EU market to trade with developing countries is a successful and ambitious result from the Doha Development Agenda in the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

1. The figure for the United Kingdom is derived from estimates in the ONS Public Sector Employment Quarter 2 First Release (published 30 September 2005).<br>

2. Northern Ireland data are based on information from the Quarterly Employment Survey and relate to the number of public sector jobs not the number of people working in the public sector. Data are expressed as a percentage of the total workplace employment level from the LFS in Northern Ireland. HM forces data are not included.<br>

3. Figures for the regions and countries within Great Britain have been produced using estimates from the Labour Force Survey. These have been constrained to the total UK public sector employment total so that estimates are in-line with National Accounts definitions of the public sector.<br>

 Information on the number of applications that have been made by licensees for converting their existing licence or for new licences is not held centrally but can be obtained from local authority licensing departments. From our latest survey of a sample of licensing authorities we estimate that 98 per cent. of all premises that will need to be licensed under the 2003 Act have made an application. We believe that, by 24 November, only 1 or 2 per cent. of premises who want a licence will not have applied in time for the new regime coming in effect, and this will include many who do not need a licence such as takeaways that do not open after 11.30 or operators whose activities are seasonal and who will not, therefore, require a licence in November.

The guidance also refers to guidance issued by the Health and Safety Executive and other bodies covering risk assessment, the safe management of crowds, event safety, and related issues.

We continue to believe that it is essential for the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) to enter into a genuine constructive dialogue with all legitimate representative bodies including Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy, and the ethnic groups to promote a peaceful, lasting and democratic outcome.

Activity such as nuclear safety is carried out under the euratom treaty.

 DFID provides most of its health-related assistance to Africa in support of building comprehensive health services, often through non-earmarked Poverty Reduction Budgetary Support (PRBS) or ear-marked health sector support.

<p><a name="st_302"><a name="51031w30.html_spnew4"><b> Fiona Mactaggart  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 24 October 2005]:</i> The key performance target for overcrowding in public sector prisons for 2005&#150;06 is for no more than 24 per cent. of the population, and for the private sector 34.5 per cent. of the population held in accommodation units intended for fewer prisoners. The difference in the targets between the public and private sector prisons reflects their different circumstances. Private sector prisons are generally of a comparatively newer design and construction than their public sector equivalents and better able to safely accommodate higher levels of overcrowding than the public sector estate. At present, there are 23.5 per cent. of prisoners sharing accommodation in crowded conditions in the public sector and 24.9 per cent. in the private sector. This is kept under review.

<a name="51031w30.html_para2">

These rates are very good in comparison with other cancers but the fact that survival is already high makes it more difficult to measure improvements over time.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">Firstly, I should explain that a Blue Badge is issued to a disabled person for their personal use. It does not limit the disabled person to a particular vehicle and can legitimately be used in any vehicle in which the disabled person in question is travelling.

The scheme only applies to on-street car parking. A Blue Badge does not entitle the holder to free parking within a Roads Service off-street fee paying public car park. Therefore, there is no monetary benefit to be gained from the improper use of a Blue Badge within a fee paying public car park. For other off-street private car parks, such as shopping centres and multi-storey car parks, badge holders must check the concessions offered, as these can vary widely.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50">Responsibility for the enforcement of off-street disabled parking spaces in public car parks currently rests with Roads Service. Article 6 of the Off-Street Parking (NI) Order 2000 prohibits the driver of a vehicle, other than a disabled person&#039;s vehicle, to park in a disabled parking space. Contravention of this Article is an offence, and in such circumstances, Roads Service has the power to remove the vehicle or instigate proceedings to prosecute the individual involved.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51">However, our experience is that there is not a major difficulty with the misuse of off-street disabled parking spaces. This may be explained by the considerable concessions for Blue Badge holders at on- street parking facilities, including free unlimited parking at on-street &#039;pay and display&#039; equipment. Other on-street parking concessions also permit a Blue Badge holder to leave their vehicle without time limit in a street where waiting is normally allowed only for limited periods. Blue Badge holders may also, in some areas, leave their vehicle for up to 3 hours on many yellow lines.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">It is therefore our policy to discourage potential offenders and where disabled persons&#039; interests can be protected by persuasion, rather that prosecution, so much the better. To this end when car park attendants discover a vehicle parked in a disabled parking space without having a Blue Badge on display, they place a notice on the vehicle advising the driver that he/she is parked in a space reserved for disabled people. The notice also advises that such parking is an offence that may result in a fine or the vehicle being removed.</p>
</ul>
<p>





<br>&nbsp;<br><i>31 Oct 2005 : Column 788W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53">I should also advise that following the PSNI&#039;s decision to withdraw from the enforcement of on-street parking restrictions, to enable policing resources to be focused on areas of greater policing priority, DRD has introduced new primary legislation, the Traffic Management (NI) Order 2005. This legislation provides the necessary legislative power to introduce civil enforcement of certain road traffic offences, initially enforcement of parking and waiting prohibitions and restrictions. Decriminalised Parking Enforcement (DPE) is likely to become effective in late September/early October 2006.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54">Under DPE, traffic attendants will be able to inspect Blue Badges to check for abuse of the system and may issue a Penalty Charge Notice if misuse is suspected. If this happens, Roads Service will write to the holder of the badge and inform them that it has been used inappropriately. Should this happen on a number of occasions Roads Service may withdraw the disabled persons&#039; badge. Vehicles not displaying a Blue Badge, but parked in an on-street disabled parking space, will be issued with a Penalty Charge Notice.</p>

<p>


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64">Unfortunately, we have no journey time information that relates to the specific journey between Sandyknowes and Belfast City Centre. However, a comparison of journey times between Sandyknowes and the Divis Street junction on Westlink would suggest that the average journey time in the morning peak over this section has increased by 2 to 3 minutes between 1996 and 2003.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65">This excludes the significant delays experienced by southbound traffic approaching Sandyknowes on the M2. Roads Service acknowledges that these delays are a direct result of capacity restrictions downstream of Sandyknowes where only 2 traffic lanes are available to cater for both mainline M2 traffic and the considerable flow joining the motorway from Sandyknowes roundabout. Consequently we plan to widen the Belfast-bound carriageway of the M2 motorway to create an additional southbound lane between the Sandyknowes and Greencastle junctions. This will make it easier for traffic to join the M2 from the Sandyknowes junction, particularly during the morning peak traffic, and also provide greater capacity on the Belfast-bound section of the M2 towards Greencastle. Construction of these improvements on the M2 is expected to start during 2008.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67">I can also advise that the Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan proposes modifications to the Sandyknowes roundabout to minimise conflicts between different traffic movements and afford greater priority to the strategic M2 and A8 movements.

The Chancellor&#039;s Budget statement also strengthened the government&#039;s commitment to the further education sector by announcing new capital funding of &#163;100 million for the sector in 2008&#150;08, rising to &#163;250 million in 2009&#150;10.

 My Department does not directly monitor the progress of universities and colleges in making reasonable adaptations. Universities are autonomous bodies and it is for them to ensure that they are complying with the Act. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) assists HEIs to meet legislative requirements, spreads good practice and helps institutions to improve access and provision for disabled people. It has distributed project capital funding specifically to help institutions meet their duties under the Act, amounting to &#163;173 million, and all institutions have submitted plans to HEFCE concerning their use of this funding. HEFCE has also provided funding to widen access and improve provision for disabled students in HEIs and directly funded FECs. In 2004&#150;05 over &#163;12 million was distributed.

 Further Education allocations to colleges are an important part of the Learning and Skills Council&#039;s (LSC) business cycle. This process starts with my Department&#039;s annual grant letter to the LSC in November which enables the LSC to plan regional priorities and budgets. Local LSCs begin their planning dialogue with colleges and providers in December and in January colleges are provided with indicative (provisional) allocations for the following funding year beginning 1 August. Local, regional and national plans have to be reconciled and the LSC expect to sign off individual college plans in April. Final allocations for colleges are then confirmed in May. This timetable was followed for the 2005/06 funding year.

This also confirms the allocations timetable for next year.

 Prior to October 1998, there was no regulation of the sale of school playing fields at local authority controlled schools. If a local authority wanted to sell a school playing field there was nothing to stop it and it could spend the proceeds as it wished.

Local authorities and governing bodies of all maintained schools now need the Secretary of State&#039;s consent before they can dispose of a playing field or any part of a playing field. Section 77 defines playing field as land in the open air which is provided for the purposes of physical education or recreation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51031w43.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_303">Since 1997, 166 applications to sell an area of school playing field capable of being used for at least a small sports pitch have been approved. Of these approvals, 70 have been at closed school sites. Of the 96 disposals at operating schools, the proceeds of sale have been used to improve on-site sports facilities at 69 of these schools. In the other 27 cases the sale proceeds have been used to improve educational facilities.

<a name="51031w43.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_304">Under the Education Act 1996, local authorities are under a duty to secure sufficient schools for pupils in their area and in doing so must have particular regard to the need to secure special educational provision. Ofsted inspects the quality of educational provision for children with SEN, including specialist provision. Within this framework how provision is organised is a matter for local decision, and for that reason, Government plays no role in relation to local authority school reorganisations or in respect of decisions to close schools.

 From 2006/07 all EU nationals, and this includes British nationals living abroad, will be entitled to tuition fee loans provided they have resided in the European Economic Area or Switzerland throughout the three years immediately preceding the start of the academic year in which their course commences. However, these students are not entitled to loans for living costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51031w43.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_310">Apart from closely defined exceptions, to be eligible for student loans for living costs in addition to student loans for fees (from 2006/07), a British national must have been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands (the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man) throughout the three years immediately preceding the first day of the first academic year of the course and ordinarily resident in England on this date. A British national whose residence in the UK and Islands during the three year period was wholly or mainly for the purpose of receiving full time education is not considered to have satisfied the ordinary residence requirement&#151;unless they have exercised a right of free movement within the European Economic Area and were ordinarily resident in the European Economic Area (including the UK) immediately prior to the three year period.

<a name="stpa_311">An exception is made where the three year residence requirement cannot be satisfied because the applicant or their parents have been temporarily employed or absent abroad.

<p>
<a name="51031w43.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_312">British nationals may indeed meet the temporary absence provisions, dependent upon their individual circumstances and they and their families would then be eligible for the full range of student support, including, student loans for fees and maintenance. The term temporary is not defined in regulations. A statutory definition of the term could not reflect the range of circumstances under which students and their families may find themselves temporarily abroad. We believe the fairest approach is to allow local authorities to judge each case on its individual merits.

We believe this remains a fair requirement which clearly demonstrates a substantial residential connection with the UK and recognises an economic contribution to the country. If a person lives abroad on a long term basis, it is not reasonable they should expect support for higher education, through subsidised loans, from public funds in the same way as students who reside in this country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51031w43.html_para15">
<a name="stpa_315">There are also a number of other carefully defined exceptions where a student may receive support without satisfying the normal residence requirement. In order to comply with European Union legislation, designed to ensure the free movement of workers throughout the European Economic Area, UK nationals, their spouses, civil partner, children and stepchildren, who have been working elsewhere in the European Economic Area or Switzerland and have returned to take up employment in the UK are generally eligible for support as is they had not left the UK. In order to benefit from this provision they must have been ordinarily resident in the European Economic Area or Switzerland throughout the three years immediately preceding the start of their course.

 The Student Finance Direct website was launched by the Student Loans Company in January 2003. The cost of the website alone cannot be given since it is an integral part of a much larger IT project. No specific targets were set for the use of the website, but it receives an estimated 1.5 million visits annually. Students and their sponsors can use the website to make on-line applications for student loans. No special activities were undertaken to promote the website or the on-line system, but references were included in our usual student finance promotional material. It is not possible to separate out the costs associated with adding these references but these would have been small.

Three month vacancy notes:<br>

1. Three month vacancy information is as at 31 March 2005<br>

2. Three month vacancies are vacancies which Trusts are actively trying to fill, which had lasted for three months or more (whole time equivalents)<br>

3. Three month Vacancy Rates are three month vacancies expressed as a percentage of three month vacancies plus staff in post<br>

4. Three month Vacancy Rates are calculated using staff in post from the Non-Medical Workforce Census September 2004<br>

5. Percentages are rounded to one decimal place<br>

6 * figures where sum of staff in post (as at 30 September 2004) and vacancies (as at 31 March 2005) is less than 10<br>

Staff in post notes:<br>

1. Staff in post data is from the Non-Medical Workforce Census September 2004<br>

General notes:<br>

1. Vacancy and staff in post numbers are rounded to the nearest whole number<br>

2. Calculating the vacancy rates using the above data may not equal the actual vacancy rates<br>

3. Due to rounding, totals may not equal the sum of component parts<br>

4. Strategic Health Authority figures are based on Trusts, and do not necessarily reflect the geographical provision of healthcare<br>

5. The London Ambulance Service NHS Trust cannot be assigned to a particular Strategic Health Authority<br>

6. The 2005 Vacancy survey did not receive a valid return from the Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Trust. Figures for this Trust have been excluded from all applicable vacancy totals and calculations. Staff in post figures for this Trust are included in the England, Yorkshire and the Humber GOR and North and East Yorkshire and Northern Lincolnshire SHA totals so as to be consistent with other Health and Social Care Information Centre publications.<br>
