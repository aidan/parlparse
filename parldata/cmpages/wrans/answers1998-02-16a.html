 It is very important that children are introduced to the wealth of information available in libraries at an early age. This is primarily the responsibility of local library authorities, but the Government have role in establishing the framework for the delivery of public library services. My Department therefore requires all library authorities to report on their services to children in their Annual Library Plans.

<P>
<a name="80216w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 In our White Paper, "The People's Lottery" we made it clear that we wish to see Lottery funds allocated fairly and equitably in the light of need across all regions and parts of the United Kingdom. I am pursuing this through measures in our Lottery Bill and through changes to the Policy Directions which I issue to distributors.

 On 25 September 1997 I welcomed Lord Wakeham's proposals for strengthening the newspaper industry's code of practice, and added that I intended to discuss further protection for people in all walks of life with him. I propose to do so in due course.

<P>
<a name="80216w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The Lottery Bill will require distributors to produce strategic plans for their funding activities, which reflect their assessment of needs. The plans will be drawn up after wide consultation, which will include local authorities and other local and regional interests.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80216w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 Securing access to the benefits of the Lottery for everyone is a fundamental aspect of our policy on Lottery distribution. Among our proposals which I expect to benefit women particularly are funding for out of school child care and healthy living centres, and distributors' plans for a one-stop shop service for community grants.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80216w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Fisher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 February 1998]:</i> Entitlement to the concessionary television licence is determined by the accommodation occupied and the way it is provided or managed. Details of the qualifying criteria are set out in a leaflet prepared by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="80216w01.html_para0">The Government's Agreement with the BBC provides for a review of future funding arrangements prior to March 2002. We shall conduct that review in good time to allow decisions to be taken before then. It will include a detailed consideration of licence fee concessions. However, there are no plans for changes to the concessionary scheme in advance of that review.

 I am currently co-chairing with Stewart Till of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment a Film Policy Review which, amongst other things, is looking at further ways of promoting inward investment into the UK.
<P>

<a name="80216w01.html_para1">The British Film Commission and the network of regional film commissions already undertake work to encourage overseas film production to this country.
<P>

<a name="80216w01.html_para2">In addition, the introduction in the Budget of accelerated 100 per cent. write-off on film production and acquisition has been widely welcomed as an incentive to increase investment. The British Screen Advisory Council has estimated that the new tax relief will generate a 31 per cent. increase in investment in film production over the next three years.

 Data on the number of radioactive packages transported into, from and within the UK are not collected by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions or by the Environment Agency. However, it can be estimated that of the order of 500,000 packages of radioactive material are carried by road annually in the United Kingdom (source: <i>Radiation Exposure from the Normal Transport of Radioactive Materials within the UK 1991 Review,</i> by R. Gelder, NRPB Report NRPB-R255, a copy of which is held in the Library).
<P>

<a name="80216w01.html_para3">Requirements for notification in advance of shipment are given in paragraph 456 of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material 1985 Edition (As Amended 1990), a copy of which is held in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80216w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 1,724 Million tonnes of freight was loaded for transport by road, water and pipeline in England and Wales in 1996. Information for rail freight is available only for GB as a whole. In 1996 a total of 100 million tonnes was loaded for transport by rail for delivery within GB. There will be an element of double counting in these figures as some freight shipments will be transported by more than one mode in a single journey.

 I appreciate my hon. Friend's concern about the sale of alcohol at garages and petrol stations. At present there are few outlets of this kind and it would be difficult to mount a representative survey. We are not aware of any significant problem of drivers who consume alcohol purchased at off-licences during journeys. Driving after drinking at public houses and similar establishments is a far more widespread problem.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80216w02.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Classification of shellfish production areas, as required by the Shellfish Hygiene Directive, lays down health conditions for the production and marketing of live bivalve molluscs (such as oysters, mussels, clams). Under this system, shellfish harvesting waters at the northern end of Langstone harbour were downgraded in 1994 from category B to category C (which meant that shellfish products required a longer period of cleansing or heat treatment, before being offered for sale). Waters elsewhere in the Harbour remained category B. This reflects a monitored deterioration in water quality which may have been due to increased pollution from one or more sources such as a sewage treatment works, riverine inputs or run-off from agricultural land. There has been no further reclassification of shellfish waters in Langstone Harbour.

<a name="80216w02.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We do not place restrictions on capital investment by the private sector water companies in England and Wales.

 The regulation and enforcement of water quality is principally the responsibility of the Environment Agency, in respect of the water environment, and the Drinking Water Inspectorate, in respect of drinking water quality. Water companies themselves have the responsibility to ensure that they meet the quality standards set by legislation and enforced by those regulators. The Director General of Water Services has a primary statutory duty to secure that water companies properly carry out, and are able to finance, their functions. He also has general duties including one to further conservation of, among other things, flora and fauna, and one to take account of the effect of proposals on flora and fauna, but he is not responsible for improving water quality.

In preparing submissions for approval by local planning authorities under the Act, the nominated undertaker must take into account various objectives and measures set out in the Code. The Code also requires the preparation and implementation of several Environmental Management Plans, including ones for Traffic, Dust and Noise and Vibration.

<a name="80216w03.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 There are no current plans to introduce a limit. The charge manufacturers may make for issuing a Certificate of Conformity in relation to a vehicle Type Approval is effectively part of the cost of the vehicle and is not prescribed. To assist the movement of vehicles between member states in the EU, the European Commission has issued guidance which says that charges should be reasonable and not exceed about &#163;67.

<a name="80216w03.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 There has been no change in the classification of goods vehicles between 3.5 and 7.5 tonnes, which remain "light goods vehicles". The only recent change relating to such vehicles concerns driving licences. Since 1 January 1997 higher health standards and a separate driving test have applied to new drivers. The higher health requirements have also applied since 1 January 1998 to pre-1997 car licence holders with automatic entitlement to drive such vehicles wishing to renew that entitlement group when their car licence expires. These requirements also apply to minibuses with 9-16 passenger seats. This change was publicised in a Department of Transport Press Notice (No. 129) of 12 June 1997. The driver and Vehicle Licencing Agency also notify drivers before their existing licences expire.

<a name="80216w03.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 February 1998]:</i> Representations from local authorities have been received on this matter and in liaison with those authorities we have carried out studies to determine to what extent one-way or two-way tolling can lead to traffic diversion. These studies have not provided evidence that the benefits of a change to two-way tolling would justify the costs involved.

 <i>[holding answer 10 February 1998]:</i> I am aware that a number of parish councils favour a statutory right of objection to applications for goods vehicle operator licences. This would require primary legislation and there would first need to be full consultation. We are currently reviewing this issue, but I would encourage local authorities to take the views of parish councils into account when considering whether to use their statutory right of objection.

<P>
<a name="80216w03.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 In 1996, a total of 15,500 people were killed or injured in accidents involving a driver over the legal limit of 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood. Of those, an estimated 540 were fatalities. Records of the blood or breath alcohol reading of a driver involved in an accident are not normally kept in cases where the level is below the legal limit.
<P>

<a name="80216w03.html_para1">The consultation paper "Combating drink driving: next steps" reviews the available data on drink-drive accidents and estimates the likely effect of a reduction in the legal blood alcohol limit. Copies have been placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80216w03.html_spnew13"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Comprehensive information is not collected on causation factors in road accidents. It is not therefore possible to supply the specific information requested. The Department is, however, undertaking a number of research projects in order to improve its knowledge of accident causation generally. We are also planning research into the relationship between driving and working hours and fatigue related accidents.

<a name="80216w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Yes, the guidance in "Policy Appraisal and the Environment" still applies, though further guidance is being prepared in the light of the July 1997 KPMG report. This report was commissioned by the last Administration to gauge how far they were meeting their commitment to assess the potential environmental impact of new policy proposals; it showed that more needed to be done to ensure that policies were systematically considered.
<P>

<a name="80216w04.html_para0">The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions will shortly be issuing Policy Guidance for non-specialist staff across Government, explaining in relatively simple terms when and how to carry out an environmental appraisal.
<P>

<a name="80216w04.html_para1">The Department is also working on further technical guidance for appraisal specialists, in co-operation with the Government Group on Environmental Costs and Benefits. A contract for a scoping study has been awarded to Dr. David Pearce, who is due to report in the Spring. This work will inform decisions on the nature and format of new guidance scheduled for the Autumn.

 My Department is working extensively to increase the amount of beneficial trade and investment flowing to the developing world, particularly the poorer countries. The best way to increase such trade and investment is likely to be through efforts to secure a more open and transparent international trading regime. Apart from engaging in the international policy debate over fairer trade policy, we are working with our partner governments to encourage growth of the private sector within poorer countries. The Department's support for economic reform packages assists countries achieve macro-economic stability. Our good governance agenda

 This information is not available since data are not routinely collected on whether a particular caution is the first or a subsequent one given by the police to an individual. However, special exercises were carried out for the 1991 and 1994 Criminal Statistics using information from the Home Office Offenders Index. These indicate that in 1994, of those cautioned, 15 per cent. had a previous caution, compared with 20 per cent. in 1991. The later sample was drawn after Home Office circular 18/1994 had been issued. This circular specifically discouraged repeat cautioning and cautioning for the most serious offences.

This is to ensure a co-ordinated approach to maximise the safety and security of supporters en route to and from France and whilst attending matches during the tournament.

This research, and also research sponsored by the Scottish Office on a CCTV scheme in Aidrie, revealed no evidence of displacement of crime from areas which had CCTV coverage to neighbouring areas which did not. The Department keeps under review the research literature on CCTV and we will be assessing the evaluations of effectiveness produced by the schemes which have received funding under the CCTV Challenge competition.

</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The DREAM rig is located at the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) range at Shoeburyness in Essex, not at Pendine. It was designed and constructed by Hunting Engineering in 1988-89 for research on the behaviour of small scale 'model' warheads against a variety of horizontal and vertical surfaces at a cost of &#163;68,000 (about &#163;100,200 at 1997 prices).
</FONT></UL><P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Last year the rig underwent a major modification at a cost of &#163;58,000. The DREAM rig is now used to conduct research on the attack of high value fixed land targets.

 I cannot provide a complete answer to this question since some information could, if disclosed, cause harm to defence, security and international relations. I am therefore withholding certain details under exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. Furthermore, exercises vary considerably in scale and full central records of all activity in which our forces have been engaged are not available. However, we do not have records of the more significant exercises, and details of British participation in exercises is given, by area, in the table. This table also includes details of the participating UK service and, where information is available, any overseas participants other than the host country. Where we have records that the host nation did not participate, this is indicated:

<a name="80216w10.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 We have no plans at present to amend the regulations relating to military and civil personnel being accompanied by their spouses on overseas tours of duty, although the situation is kept under review. Separately, consideration is being given to a revision of current rules relating to short-term visits by spouses who accompany senior officers on official duties.

 <i>[holding answer 9 February 1998]:</i> The cost of the construction of the NATO certified test centre for small calibre ammunition at Pendine at 1997 prices was &#163;1,008,563. Inflation figures for 1998 are not yet available, so it is not possible to calculate the cost at 1998 prices.

<a name="80216w10.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Ainger: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what conclusions were reached by the study produced in 1993 on moving the NATO small arms test centre in respect of the Eskmeals range; and if he will place a copy of that study in the Library.  [28040]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80216w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 February 1998]:</i> The decision to move the small arms test centre from Cold Meece to Pendine was taken when the ranges were part of the Directorate of Proof and Experimental Establishments. Records of meetings held during July 1992 indicate that a working group considered three options for the relocation: to Pendine, to Shoeburyness, or to split the centre between Pendine and Shoeburyness. For strategic reasons, Pendine was chosen as the small arms test centre in January 1993. No consideration appears to have been given to the possibility of moving the centre to the Eskmeals range. Subsequently, the DGT&E Land Systems Asset Study was published, D/DTE (Land)9/24 dated 23 March 1993, which discusses two possibilities for the facility: Kirkcudbright and Shoeburyness. Both Eskmeals and Pendine were recommended for closure in this report. The report was, at the time, deemed to contain confidential information; I have asked for it to be reviewed to determine whether it can be placed in the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what requirements govern the permissible noise levels for low-level RAF flight training; and if he will make a statement;  [29477]
<P>
<UL>(2) what measures his Department takes to monitor the noise pollution generated by low-level flight training; and if he will make a statement;  [29478]
<P>
(3) what plans he has to introduce restrictions on the level of noise that flight training may create at ground level; and if he will make a statement.  [29479]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80216w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 My Department already places restrictions on the heights, speeds and operating procedures of military aircraft in the UK, which are designed to ensure that noise levels experienced on the ground represent a sensible balance between our essential training requirements and environmental considerations. The restrictions are kept under continuous review to reflect medical and scientific advice and experience of noise measurement surveys carried out by, or on behalf of, my Department.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the principal export markets for British military sales; and what is the Government's strategy for promoting exports to them. [29196]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80216w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The principal markets for UK defence exports are in The Gulf, Asia Pacific and North America. The Defence Export Services Organisation (DESO) of my Department has developed, with industry, a five year Strategic Plan which identifies within these regions the top 22 markets and also the major prospects and sets out how Government and industry will work together to win business. This Plan is fully consistent with our foreign and security policy our international obligations and with Government Commitment to a strong defence manufacturing industry. It has helped DESO and companies to organise their resources more effectively and is improving our national performance in winning export orders which increased by 10 per cent. in 1997 compared with 1996.

To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster if he will list the models of cars which <i>(a)</i> Government Ministers can choose from and <i>(b)</i> are currently used by all Government Ministers.  [23581]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80216w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 Cabinet Ministers are provided with an appropriate car, normally a Rover Sterling or another car from the Rover 800 series. Ministers of State and Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State are provided with a choice of cars normally within the Rover 400 series or equivalent cars such as the Ford Mondeo, Vauxhall Vectra or Nissan Primera with a comfortable but not extravagant level of fit.
<P>

<a name="80216w11.html_para0">The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister currently have the use of a Daimler 4.0 litre and a Jaguar respectively. Other Ministers use cars in the above categories. The main exceptions are where a difference model is used for security reasons or where cars of a different model were used by Ministers of the previous administration and to replace them would not be an efficient use of public resources.

A private patient operator will lease an area of the new building at High Wycombe from the trust's consortium (United Healthcare) and will pay for the construction of a private patients unit.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will estimate the gross cost to public expenditure in Wales if all local authority rents were to be reduced by 10 per cent.; and what would be the net savings in housing benefits.  [28860]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80216w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 The effects on public expenditure of a 10 per cent. reduction in council rents depend on what assumptions are made about the consequential adjustments to Housing Revenue Account Subsidy. If the reduction had applied in the current financial year and other elements within the subsidy calculation remained unchanged, the Welsh Office estimates that there would be a reduction of &#163;26.6 million in rent rebates but an overall subsidy cost of &#163;10.6 million. Because the rent reduction would marginally reduce the rate of increase in the RPI, there would also be a saving in benefits in the UK as a whole of about &#163;1.6 million this year, rising to &#163;6.1 million in the following year.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80216w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 The Welsh Office does not provide authorities with specific resources to subsidise bus services. Authorities have discretionary powers which--subject to available resources--enable them to subsidise local public transport services which they consider are essential to meet a social need.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80216w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The areas which need the most help are those which have the highest levels of unemployment and those areas which have been less successful in terms of industrial and economic development and in attracting inward investment. Classic examples which display some or all of these problems are in our priority areas of the south Wales valleys, mid Wales and south and north west Wales. But, while we focus and encourage, it is the companies with which we deal which must take the final decision on location, decisions which are based on a wide range of commercial considerations.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80216w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend met Commissioner Wulf Mathies on 12 December and underlined the importance the UK attach to the continued receipt of Structural Funds support after 1999. The eligibility of the poorer UK regions will, of course, be dependent on criteria laid out in the Structural Funds Regulations which are due to be published next month. We are already seeking to influence these and my right hon. Friend specifically asked the Commissioner to consider the inclusion of GDP within the new Objective 2 criteria, as a more appropriate measure of prosperity. Indeed this would be more consistent with the approach taken with Structural Funds more generally and with the criteria applied to Objective 1.

<a name="80216w15.html_para0">The response elsewhere in Wales, where the New Deal will commence on 6 April, has been equally encouraging. Even before our advertising campaign commenced on 15 February, a considerable degree of employer interest has been evident.

Where the processing of an application results in a payment being due to a student, a Payable Order is generated automatically and is normally received by the student within seven days of processing. Apart from that delivery period, the only applications processed but unpaid were those which did not generate any payment due to the student.

 <i>[holding answer 12 February 1998]:</i> The Scottish Office is already a major funder of voluntary organisations in Scotland, including those whose work contributes to combating social exclusion. Forty per cent. of the &#163;1.4 million recently allocated to voluntary sector organisations for housing purposes will support work on homelessness. Voluntary sector organisations will also benefit from the &#163;11 million allocated under the Rough Sleepers Initiative in September last year. At least 60 per cent. of the Urban Programme funding of &#163;67.6 million in 1998-99 is expected to be allocated to voluntary organisations. Also in 1998-99, under section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, grants totalling &#163;6.9 million will be made to national voluntary organisations working in the field of social welfare to support their day to day work with children and families, people with disabilities or addictions, offender services and the homeless.

A particular example is an advanced engineering centre being developed at Sutton Coldfield College in conjunction with local employers including LDV.

 By this summer, all domestic gas consumers in Great Britain should have a choice of supplier. Competition exerts a downward pressure on prices, and in the areas of the country which have already been opened to competition, consumers are able to benefit from prices which are up to 20 per cent. lower than those available from the former monopoly supplier. I am concerned that pre-payment meter users should also be able to benefit fully from the introduction of competition.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment his Department has made of the relative standards achieved at Level 4 in <i>(a)</i> Key Stage 2 and <i>(b)</i> Key Stage 3 National Curriculum English Tests; and what research underlies this assessment.  [28789]

<a name="80216w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The Qualification and Curriculum Authority (QCA) is responsible for the standards demanded in statutory tests and takes a number of measures to ensure comparability of standards between Key Stages. These include cross-Key Stage pre-tests before the tests are finalised and script scrutiny to compare pupil performance across the Key Stage tests. QCA has published details of the test development process in its leaflet "Key Stages 1-3 National Curriculum Tests: Setting and Maintaining the Standards" and in its annual Standards Reports. I have placed copies of these publications in the Library.

 The Government acknowledge the need for top class scientists and engineers and the important role that Universities play in helping to bring that about. The Development Unit for Women in Science, Engineering and Technology, which operates within the Office of Science and Technology, was established to encourage the increased participation of women in science, engineering and technology (SET) at all levels. It has produced various materials to encourage girls to consider engineering and technology as career options.
<P>

<a name="80216w20.html_para0">WISE (Women in Science and Engineering), started in 1984 with support from the former Manpower Services Commission. It has a remit to raise the number of women studying these subjects and, since then, women's representation on these courses in HE has doubled. It continues to receive support from the Department of Trade and Industry.
<P>

<a name="80216w20.html_para1">It is important that industry itself plays a full role in attracting girls to study engineering and technology subjects and that this will lead to satisfying career opportunities. It was unfortunate, for example, that the Women into Technology Foundation was not sustainable without public support. The Government continue to encourage industry to consider what further steps it might take, and to offer appropriate support.

 We will be introducing the New Deal for those aged 25 and over, and unemployed for two years or more, in June. As we announced on 5 January, we have been considering a number of options for extending provision for those aged 25 or more who have been unemployed for 1 year or 18 months, and whether pilots could be introduced later this year.

<a name="80216w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Employment measures are not based on overall per capita cost. They offer a wide range of opportunities based on length of unemployment and individual need. Someone unemployed for over six months, for example, could attend a Jobclub at an average cost of &#163;200 or undertake work based training for adults at an average cost of &#163;2,510, including allowances. Similarly, the New Deal for 18-24 year olds could help one young person to find work during the Gateway at a cost of less than &#163;100 to New Deal funds, and another to improve employability and then find work at a cost of over &#163;5,000 to New Deal funds. The New Deal is in general resourced to make a real difference to the employability of young people and to contribute to reducing structural unemployment.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 27 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>188</i>.
<P>

<a name="80216w20.html_para2">By convention, the Government do not publish forecasts of unemployment. In January 1998, 118,000 18-24 year olds were recorded as having claimed Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) for six months or more; each month about 15,000-20,000 18-24 year olds reach six months' claimant unemployment. In January 1998 some 216,000 people aged 25 or over were recorded as having claimed JSA for more than two years; each month between 5,000 and 10,000 people who are 25 or over reach two years' claimant unemployment. It is not possible to break these data down to provide accurate estimates by travel to work areas.

The evaluation will compare the outcomes for lone parents in the New Deal for Lone Parents areas with those in the control areas where the service is not yet available, and will be published in 1999.
