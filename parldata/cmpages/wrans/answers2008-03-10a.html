<i> [holding answer 31 January 2008]: </i>All single living accommodation (SLA) at RM Condor has been subject to a Grading Review in accordance with this Department&#146;s 4-Tier Grading system, which provides the means of determining accommodation charges for differing standards of SLA. In this system, Grade 1 for Charge (GlfC) is the highest and G4fC the lowest. The grading system assesses 14 different criteria relating to accommodation such as condition (including decoration), scaling, provision of local amenities and environmental factors. All the different factors are taken into account, and when targets are not met a graduated number of points are deducted from the overall score. The more deductions there are, the lower the grade allocated to the SLA.</p>

SLA bedspaces at RM Condor, while not new, are generally in a reasonable standard of condition and the main reasons for the number of G3fC and G4fC bedspaces is due to either Scaling (e.g. size of rooms) or Location (e.g. proximity to local amenities). Given the number of bed-spaces assessed as G3fC and G4fC, details of individual assessments could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

<i> [holding answer 6 March 2008]:</i> Regional Cultural Consortia (RCCs) were established in 1999. Since then, RDAs have engaged in varying degrees of partnership with RCCs and contributed funding accordingly. There is no formal obligation for RDAs to fund RCCs. However, some RDAs make a regular financial contribution to RCCs and some only channel funding through RCCs in relation to specific projects and do not make regular annual contributions.</p>

We want to help local authorities to revitalise their leisure facilities and to ensure that the right sports facilities are in the right places. Sport England has already developed a range of strategic planning tools to assist them. These include, among others: the Active Places database, which provides a comprehensive picture of sports facilities across the country; the National Benchmarking Service; a Facilities Planning Model; and a Sports Facilities Demand Estimator. In addition, Sport England's Facilities Improvement Service is working closely with local authorities to improve the quality of their sports facilities and service delivery.</p>

 Treating and pumping wastewater consumes energy and releases greenhouse gas emissions. The greenhouse gas emissions from the water sector were mapped for the first time in &#147;Future Water&#151;The Government's Water Strategy for England&#148;, which was published in February 2008. Over 2.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gases, as carbon dioxide equivalents, are emitted from the treatment of wastewater every year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="80310w0010.htm_para13"><a name="08031028000450">The use of urine separation systems has the potential to help reduce emissions, save water and reduce wastewater treatment costs. However, while urine-separation toilets would be relatively easy to install, it would also be necessary to adapt associated domestic pipe work and fit on-site storage facilities. Existing public sewerage systems have been developed to carry away all foul water from premises. To alter these systems in order to separate waste streams would be costly and impractical, but could be considered in new developments with discrete sewerage infrastructure.</p>

Funds are awarded to a number of regional and national BREW delivery bodies. Allocations for 2005 to 2007 are set out in the following table.</p>

 In November 2007 the Government published their responses to consultations on permitted development rights for householders, including householder micro-generation. In general, forthcoming changes will extend permitted development rights. Householders will have more scope to extend their homes under permitted development up to maximum dimensions designed to ensure no adverse impact on neighbours. There will also be a separate allowance for loft extensions. Local authorities will be able to introduce local variations using Local Development Orders to provide greater freedom for development and Article 4 Directions to restrict permitted development where greater protection is needed.</p>

They have helped ensure that the development and delivery of Government policy takes account of the key issues facing their regions, both by engaging with a wide range of regional partners in meetings and dedicated visits and by representing their regions within Government. Regional Ministers have also been involved in the appointment of Regional Development Agency chairs and boards, while their relation to forthcoming regional committees will be determined over the coming months following the Modernisation Committee's inquiry into regional accountability.</p>

 When I met the leaders of the Beijing Organising Committee last year I impressed on them the importance of the free movement of journalists for the 2008 Games, and I discussed China&#146;s progress with British journalists based in China. I am very pleased that new regulations to this effect were introduced in China in January. This is very positive, but more needs to be done and we are encouraging China to extend this freedom beyond 2008 and to China's domestic media too, so that it is a real legacy from the Games.

<i> Lancashire Providers</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) has supplied provider data using:<br>
Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS FT<br>
East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust<br>
Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust<br>
University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust<br>
Calderstones NHS Trust<br>
Lancashire Care NHS Trust<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes (FAE)</i><br>
A FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Data Quality</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS, there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> All Diagnoses count of Mentions</i><br>
These figures represent a count of all mentions of a diagnosis in any of the 14 diagnosis fields in the HES data set. Therefore, if a diagnosis is mentioned in more than one diagnosis field during an episode, all diagnoses are counted.<br>
<i> ICD-10 Diagnosis Codes Used:</i><br>
T51: Toxic effect of Alcohol<br>
<i> Ungrossed Data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

 In line with European Commission Regulations, the national health service treats a large number of European Economic Area (EEA) patients every year, either as temporary visitors requiring treatment while visiting the United Kingdom or as clinical referrals from their home member state. This, coupled with the lag between the provision of treatment, the collation of the claim data and the often lengthy process of reviewing and then accepting or rejecting a claim by another member state, means it is normal practice for EEA countries (including the UK) to have outstanding claims. The UK regularly liaises with the authorities of other member states to resolve matters around outstanding claims.</p>

<i> Lancashire Providers</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) has supplied provider data using:<br>
Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS FT<br>
East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust<br>
Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust<br>
University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust<br>
Calderstones NHS Trust<br>
Lancashire Care NHS Trust<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes (FAE)</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Data Quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS, there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> All diagnoses count of mentions</i><br>
These figures represent a count of all mentions of a diagnosis in any of the 14 diagnosis fields in the HES data set. Therefore, if a diagnosis is mentioned in more than one diagnosis field during an episode, all diagnoses are counted.<br>
<i> ICD-10 Diagnosis Codes Used:</i><br>
K70: Alcohol liver disease<br>
<i> Low numbers</i><br>
Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &#147;*&#148; (an asterisk).<br>
<i> Ungrossed Data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

<i> [holding answer 6 March 2008]:</i> In our regular contacts with the Indian authorities we have continued to offer the assistance of UK police in the investigation of the tragic deaths of two members of the Dawood family in the inter-communal riots in Gujurat in 2002. We have also asked to be kept updated on the progress of the case against those who have been arrested in connection with the incident. My hon. Friend the Minister for the Middle East, Kim Howells, raised both of these issues directly with the Indian authorities during his visit to India in May 2007. My noble Friend, the Minister for Africa, Asia and the UN, the right hon. Lord Malloch-Brown, subsequently wrote to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs in July 2007. Our deputy high commissioner in New Delhi followed this up during a call on the Ministry of External Affairs in August 2007 and wrote a further letter in November 2007. We have yet to receive any response from the Indian authorities to any of these letters but we will continue to press for one.</p>

If there is a risk in a host country (e.g. from civil disorder or a natural disaster) that could lead to an evacuation of British nationals, the FCO mission there will hold a civil contingency plan.

In compiling civil contingency plans, the FCO's objective is to protect British nationals from a situation that poses a serious threat to their safety and, in a worst case scenario, to assist their departure to a place of safety.

 Entitlement to child benefit is generally reliant on the child in the award being present in the UK. There are a number of circumstances where child benefit is payable when the child is not resident. For example where the child is receiving medical treatment anywhere abroad for an illness that began before the child left the UK or where the person claiming child benefit is working in the UK and paying UK national insurance contributions and their family is living in another EEA country.</p>

 Academies receive capital funding determined by Partnerships for Schools in accordance with the agreed phasing of milestone payments during the construction of the school, and following the award of the contract.

that apprenticeship starts will increase to over 250,000 per year. As we grow the programme, taking up an apprenticeship may become attractive to even more young people. We will maintain our commitment to meeting the demand from suitably qualified young people, so that if more come forward we will work with employers to expand further. On this basis, we anticipate that around one in five of all young people will be undertaking an apprenticeship within the next decade.</p>

The following figures are from matched administrative data which links together participation and attainment data at an individual level from several administrative data sources. The table shows participation in apprenticeships by achievement of GGSE (or equivalent) in English and mathematics at grades A* to C. We do not have data for modern languages or science.

The participation data has coverage limitations in the dataset, and information is not available for certain groups of learners, such as those in independent schools and higher education institutes (although we do have their attainment data). It is not used for published participation statistics, but can be used for indicative purposes (albeit with caveats applied on coverage). Figures for the &#145;19 in 2008 cohort&#146; refer to those learners who turn 19 in 2007/08. This is the latest cohort of learners in the matched dataset for whom we have data for 16 and 17-year-olds (academic ages, from 2005/06 and 2006/07, respectively).

No exact figures are available, but the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) estimate that an average of 6,000 papers a year were lost. In 2004, through the exams modernisation programme, a courier service was introduced across England to collect completed papers from schools and colleges. The number of papers lost through this service each year is as follows. There are arrangements in place to ensure that candidates whose papers are lost are not disadvantaged.</p>

 The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) is statutorily obliged to investigate any matter brought to its attention relating to the accuracy or correctness of the results of any pupil in respect of the key stage 2 and key stage 3 national curriculum tests. Such matters are referred to as allegations of maladministration. The term &#145;maladministration&#146; refers to any act, accidental or intentional, that could jeopardise the integrity, security of confidentiality of the tests. For example, the opening of test papers at the wrong time by accident would lead to an investigation.</p>

The NAA's remit in investigating cases of alleged maladministration is to determine whether there is doubt over the correctness or accuracy of pupil results. The sanction applied where a case of maladministration is proven is the annulment or change of results for individual pupils or for the whole school.</p>

 The Special Educational Needs Code of Practice is statutory guidance to which local authorities and others must have regard. It sets out parents' right under the Education Act 1996 to request an assessment of their children&#146;s special educational needs (SEN) and local authorities&#146; duties, where necessary, to assess and to draw up SEN statements. The code includes guidance, and the regulations, setting out the form the statement must take. It advises local authorities of their duty to send parents draft statements with the name of the school left blank and invite the parents to request a maintained mainstream or special school or to make representations for a non-maintained school. The code makes clear that where parents request a maintained school the local authority must name that school on the final statement unless the school is unsuitable for the child's age, ability, aptitude or SEN or naming the school would be incompatible with the efficient education of other children there or the efficient use of resources, A maintained school named on a final statement must admit the child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_426"><a name="80310w0043.htm_para0"><a name="08031110003083">Parents have the right to obtain an independent assessment of their child's SEN if they are in dispute with their local authority. If parents include the report of such an assessment in the advice they give to the local authority as part of the statutory assessment process then the local authority must take it into account when deciding whether to draw up a statement. If the parents appeal to the SEN and Disability Tribunal and include the report of the independent assessment in their statement of case then the tribunal panel must take it into account when considering the appeal.</p>

 The Government are committed to every child having access to personalised learning support, which could include small group tuition, to ensure that every child achieves their potential. As part of personalising learning for children and young people, the Government are encouraging schools to consider the opportunities for children beyond the school day, and in particular through extended schools. The extended school core offer includes a varied menu of activities for children and young people, with study support as part of this. The Government have committed over &#163;13 billion over the next three years to support the development of extended schools, and included in this is funding to support small group academic focused study support in some secondary schools, with funding for this becoming available in 2009/10.</p>

 The Government do not have a specific policy about summer internships by school children, or school leavers.

From September 2008 we are also introducing new Diplomas for 14-19s which cover a wide range of business sectors. Work related learning includes work experience placements which can be organised flexibly and which prepare young people for adult and working life. Additionally, many young people have access to summer schools as part of the Aimhigher and City Challenge programmes.</p>
