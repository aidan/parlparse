<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, the improved road between Fore Street and Hall Lane now means that traffic on the A406 is able to run much more freely.

 I am advised by the Environment Protection Agency that the estimated cost of running its website is projected to increase from &#163;25,000 in 1998-99 to &#163;100,000 in 2000-01. This estimate is based on current growth rates, comparisons with the US Environmental Protection Agency and costs of other internet services. 



<P>
<P><I>8 Mar 1999 : Column: 6</I><P>
The figure of &#163;1,000,000+ is a rough and untested estimate of the cost in 2000-01 were the Agency to develop its information systems and businesses processes to provide a range of electronic services including electronic handling of 25% of licence applications and access to public registers. It is being considered alongside competing priorities but has not yet been subject to critical business assessment and does not feature in the Agency's current financial plans.

<a name="90308w02.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Since May 1997 planning permission has been granted, as a result of a planning inquiry or appeal, in respect of ten supermarkets. Of these, none were out-of-town or on green-field sites, six were in town or district centres and the remaining four were out-of- centre, but within the urban area on brown-field sites.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he plans to consider <i>(a)</i> the order application for the link from London Underground's East London Line to Railtrack's South London Line and <i>(b)</i> the funding application for the southern link and the northern extension to the North London Line; and if he will assess the benefits of creating an orbital rail network for London.  [74624]<P>

<P>
<a name="90308w03.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Deputy Prime Minister gave permission for London Underground last August to do preparatory work for securing the legal powers necessary to build the southern extension to the East London Line. This work would need to be completed before an order application could be lodged.
<P>

<a name="90308w03.htm_para0">London Transport and the Department are considering a number of ways in which both the Northern and Southern Extensions might be funded. Any appraisal of the extensions will take into account the benefit of establishing orbital railway links.

 In the last three years my Department has received a large number of applications for extra credit approvals for a wide range of purposes, including for Trading Credit Approvals (TCAs) for self-financing schemes.

 Local authority applications for Trading Credit Approvals (TCAs) can be made at any time of the year and therefore it would not be possible to estimate the amount of requests for TCAs my Department might receive in 1999-2000 or future years.

 Actuarial assessments of the impact on local authority pension funds as a result of changes to advance corporation tax are not yet available for all funds. The Local Government Association, following a national survey last year, estimated the impact at &#163;130 million. This was taken into account in the Revenue Support Grant Settlement for 1999-2000. It is not possible to say how these changes will impact on council tax. Local authorities will need to take into account all the relevant local circumstances in deciding on budgets and hence council taxes.

 Local authorities do not have the power to waive or reduce business rates to attract businesses to their areas. However, we have proposed in the White Paper "Modern Local Government: In Touch with the People" (July 1998) a measure of local discretion over the business rate, which would allow an authority to grant a rebate to all of its ratepayers, though the cost of that rebate would have to be met by the authority. We shall shortly be issuing a public consultation paper on the details of implementing the White Paper proposals on rates.

 Our plans for the modernisation of local government are set out in the White Paper "Modern Local Government: In Touch with the People" published in July 1998. This is a programme for change stretching for ten years or more. The Local Government Bill (which provides for the replacement of Compulsory Competitive Tendering with the new duty to achieve best value in providing local services, and also abolishes crude and universal capping) completed its Committee stage in the House of Commons on 25 February. Our proposals to transform the political management and ethical framework of councils will be published soon in a draft Bill, and other measures will follow.

<P>
<a name="90308w04.htm_wqn4"><B> Dr. Starkey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will announce the results of the consultation exercise on the proposed incentive for local authorities to buy back ex-council flats and houses.  [75707]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w04.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Around 200,000 people in England have bought a council flat, mainly under the Right to Buy. Research shows that the great majority consider it good value for money. But some, especially in system-built flats, cannot afford the costs of maintenance. Some cannot re-sell their home--either because they cannot find a buyer, or because mortgage lenders refuse to give a loan.
<P>

<a name="90308w04.htm_para0">The Government already provide financial help to councils to reduce high repair bills in flats. But some people--including some older people on low incomes--can no longer cope with the cost and strain of home ownership. Local authorities have powers to buy back housing, but their resources are limited, and they have other pressures. Last July we published a consultation paper offering to cover 25 per cent. of councils' costs.
<P>

<a name="90308w04.htm_para1">Many respondents were concerned that the incentive offered was too small. We have therefore increased it to 35 per cent. of all costs incurred by a council above a threshold of &#163;50,000 per council per year. This will target help on those areas with the greatest problems. We have also extended it in other ways--for example, to cover homes already bought back during 1998-99, and to include former New Town housing.
<P>

<a name="90308w04.htm_para2">In addition to this incentive, when a council buys back a property it regains a capital asset which, sooner or later, it can re-let. It also reduces the costs of managing its leasehold property including, for example, trying to recover arrears of service charges. And in some cases, such as buying from an elderly or vulnerable person in arrears, the council will be helping someone whom it might otherwise have to re-house.
<P>

<a name="90308w04.htm_para3">Local authorities are best placed to decide who needs their help. They will be free to decide whom to assist and on what terms. there are just two restrictions: the incentive only applies where they are buying from an individual, and where they are not using compulsory purchase powers. This limits the incentive to cases there occupants wish to sell their home.
<P>

<a name="90308w04.htm_para4">We have today laid an Order before Parliament amending regulation 104 of the Local Authorities (Capital Finance) Regulations 1997. Subject to Parliamentary approval, this will come into force on 1 April and councils will then be able to use the financial incentive. A copy of the consultation paper, and a list of the responses, is in the Library of the House, and copies of the responses are available in the Library of the Department.

<P>
<a name="90308w06.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 March 1999]:</i> Local library authorities have a statutory duty to provide comprehensive and efficient services and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has recently reminded them of his own statutory obligation to ensure that they do so. The Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 does not specify the number, location, distribution or opening hours of local libraries. These detailed decisions are for local library authorities to make, based on the precise nature of their areas and their local resources and priorities. However, through their Annual Library Plans, library authorities are required by my right hon. Friend to report on the availability and accessibility of local libraries, which is a key element in ensuring that a comprehensive and efficient service is being provided, and he subsequently provides both individual and general feedback to each authority.

<P>
<a name="90308w06.htm_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The World Trade Organisation Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) are complementary. They both seek to establish common international frameworks and obligations within which individual countries may develop legislative regimes appropriate to their circumstances.
<P>

<a name="90308w06.htm_para5">There are concerns about the way in which the two instruments can be implemented in a mutually supportive way. Given the interests of developing countries, many of which have indigenous and local communities which depend on local biodiversity for their livelihoods and welfare, we have funded an independent assessment of the implementation issues. This has been published and is being placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="90308w06.htm_para6">Articles 8, 15 and 16 of the CBD refer to the rights of indigenous people, access to genetic material and transfer of technology respectively. Article 27 of the TRIPS agreement deals with the application of intellectual property rights to plant and animal material. Regarding compatibility with Article 8 of the CBD on the rights of indigenous people, patents can protect only new technical contributions. Rights cannot be obtained which cover existing knowledge. Regarding Article 15 of the CBD on access to genetic material, it is for individual contracting States to the CBD to set the conditions for access and it is not a matter for TRIPS or intellectual property regimes. Regarding Article 16 of the CBD, both the CBD and the TRIPs agreement encourage the transfer of technology.

<P>
<a name="90308w07.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 In the UK, the Civil Aircraft Research and Technology Demonstration (CARAD) Programme supports long-term research in key aeronautics technologies by providing grants for industry and for funding work undertaken at the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) or placed by DERA in industry and universities. In 1997-8, funding totalled &#163;24.6 million. Additionally, in the three years ending 1997-98, &#163;12 million was targeted through the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's (EPSRC) industrially led Innovative Manufacture Initiative (IMI) Aerospace Programme. For further information about the EPSRC programme, I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to the hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w07.htm_spnew10"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Consumers have the same rights in UK law when they buy secondhand goods as when they buy new ones. The Sale of Goods Act 1979 requires goods sold by traders to be of satisfactory quality. The test of quality is what a reasonable person would find satisfactory, taking into account the price, how the goods are described and other relevant factors such as age. If, taking account of these considerations, a buyer finds the goods are not of satisfactory quality when he initially examines or tries them out, he can reject them and seek a refund. If a fault, of which the buyer could not reasonably be unaware when he bought the goods, manifests itself after he has accepted the goods he is entitled to claim compensation (such as the cost of repair or money back). The buyer can claim compensation for up to six years after purchase in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and up to five years after the goods have caused loss in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="90308w07.htm_para8">Traders selling new or second hand goods must also comply with general consumer protection legislation, such as the Trade Descriptions Act 1968.

The Directive gives additional remedies of price reduction or rescission of the contract when repair or replacement of faulty goods is not possible.

 <i>[holding answer 5 March 1999]:</i> Statistical information about the number of "au pairs" who registered with the police because of the imposition of such a requirement by an immigration officer on entry is not available. However, the table showing the number of "au pairs" given leave to enter the United Kingdom in the specified months gives a strong indication of the number who might have been expected to have a registration requirement imposed.
<P>

<a name="90308w08.htm_para5">As a result of the changes to the scope of the Police Registration Scheme which came into effect on 11 May 1998, only those foreign nationals from the countries or territories listed in Appendix 2 of the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules will normally be required to register with the police from that date. This means that it is only "au pairs" from Turkey who will normally have been required to register with the police since then.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will estimate the costs saved since August 1998, following the relaxation of the rules requiring au pairs to register with the police after being in the United Kingdom for six months.  [74489]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w08.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 March 1999]:</i> The Police Registration Scheme is administered by the police on a cost recovery basis, with the current fee standing at &#163;34. Until the scope of the Police Registration Scheme was amended on 11 May 1998 "au pairs" given leave to enter the United Kingdom for a period of over six months were required, as a condition of that leave, to register with the police within seven days of arrival. Since that date only foreign nationals from the countries or territories listed in Appendix 2 to the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules should normally be required to register. The changes to the scope of the registration scheme in respect of "au pairs" have not resulted in any cost saving to the police or central Home Office.

<P>
<a name="90308w09.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how the Government plan to take forward their programme of reform of juvenile secure accommodation; and if he will make a statement.  [75814]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w09.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Government set out their programme of reform of the current arrangements for the provision of juvenile secure accommodation on 29 July 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>255-56</i>. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 provided the courts with more appropriate remand and sentencing powers to deal with the most serious and persistent young offenders, as well as giving the police and the courts new powers to deal with other young offenders more effectively in the community. To complement these provisions, the Government are seeking to establish a range of secure accommodation appropriate to the age and maturity of young people and with regimes which address offending behaviour, and to develop intervention programmes which will support the new multi-agency youth offending teams under the 1998 Act in working with young offenders in the community.
<P>

<a name="90308w09.htm_para0">Since July 1998, the Government have set up an 18-month pilot project in ten areas to pave the way for introducing youth offending teams across England and Wales in April 2000 and the final warning scheme and new court orders in 2000-2001. The Youth Justice Board for England and Wales was established in September and is responsible for administering a development fund of &#163;85 million over three years from April 1999, which is being used to develop bail support initiatives and other community-based intervention programmes to support the final warning scheme and new court orders.
<P>

<a name="90308w09.htm_para1">The Government have also taken forward the necessary arrangements for implementing on 1 June 1999 the provisions in the 1998 Act for court-ordered remands to local authority secure accommodation of 12, 13 and 14-year-old boys and girls, 15 and 16-year-old girls and, where a place has been identified in advance, vulnerable 15 and 16-year-old boys. This will ensure that the courts have the powers they need in dealing with those young people the seriousness of whose alleged offending means that they cannot be dealt with safely in the community.




<P>
<P><I>8 Mar 1999 : Column: 29</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90308w09.htm_para2">The Prison Service is finalising its plans for a distinct estate within its accommodation for 15 to 17-year-old boys remanded or sentenced to custody, with improved levels of care and regimes delivered within it. The Prison Service has also reviewed its arrangements for accommodating 15 to 17-year-old girls.
<P>

<a name="90308w09.htm_para3">The Youth Justice Board has provided initial advice on a range of youth custody issues and a copy of this has been placed in the Library. It will help to inform the Government's longer-term thinking about the provision of juvenile secure accommodation. The Board is now preparing more detailed advice on regime standards which, together with work being undertaken by the Prison Service, will help in preparing for the detention and training order under the 1998 Act.
<P>

<a name="90308w09.htm_para4">A key element in improved regimes and in the operation of the detention and training order will be better links between custodial facilities, where the first half of the sentence will be served, and the community, where the second half will be served. The new youth offending teams will have a vital role in managing these links--a member of the team will be expected to be involved in sentence planning and throughcare whilst the young offender is in custody and then supervise them when they return to the community. Given this connection, the Government have decided to accept the recommendation in the Youth Justice Board's advice that the detention and training order should be implemented at the same time as the local structure of youth offending teams, that is April 2000. Ahead of this, the Prison Service will put in place arrangements for the distinct estate for boys in its accommodation and for improved regimes.
<P>

<a name="90308w09.htm_para5">The Government have concluded that establishing distinct units for the very small number of 15 to 17-year-old girls held in Prison Service accommodation is not the best way forward, or in their best interests. The introduction of the detention and training order will allow for greater flexibility in the placement of sentenced young people. It is our intention to make use of this flexibility by placing sentenced 15 and 16-year-old girls in available non-Prison Service accommodation, when the detention and training order is in force. The first priority will be to place the youngest and most vulnerable young women outside the Prison Service. In the short term, arrangements within the Prison Service for holding 17-year-old women, and other young women for whom other accommodation is not available, will be improved by establishing discrete units for young women under the age of 21, with enhanced regimes within these.
<P>

<a name="90308w09.htm_para6">The Government are also taking forward detailed work on the proposed extension of the role of the Youth Justice Board to act as the commissioning and purchasing body for all forms of secure accommodation for children and young people on remand and under sentence. This should help to achieve the appropriate volume, type and spread of accommodation in the longer term, so that individual needs can be met more effectively.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the health effects of service on a submarine.  [74950]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w12.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Royal Navy has a comprehensive strategy to monitor for the health effects of submarine service. It is based on a programme of selective and rigorous medical screening and regular occupational health surveillance of individual submariners including monitoring for radiation exposure. This is backed up by epidemiological studies performed by independent authorities and a comprehensive system of scientific evaluation conducted in collaboration with other nations operating submarines.
<P>

<a name="90308w12.htm_para49">As my hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces announced in his written answer on 24 February 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>300-01,</i> medical studies have shown that some contaminants, which are present in the atmosphere of a submarine, exceed the levels which are considered safe for the foetus of a pregnant women. These contaminants pose no risk to adults.
<P>

<a name="90308w12.htm_para50">The results of an independent mortality study undertaken for the Royal Navy by the Medical Research Council and published in the Occupational and Environmental Medicine Journal in 1997 concluded that submariners are an occupational health group with an overall lower rate of mortality among workers than in the general population.

<a name="90308w12.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The total acreage of land that is held by the Ministry of Defence (both freehold and leasehold) stands at almost 593,000 acres (240,000 hectares). My Department recognises its responsibility to use and manage its estate effectively and our policy is to ensure that no more land is used than is needed to meet operational requirements.

<a name="90308w12.htm_para51">There are currently some 32,000 acres (13,000 hectares) of surplus property scheduled for disposal, while the Strategic Defence Review set an ambitious target of &#163;700 million in disposal receipts over four years. The Review also concluded that there should be more effective central strategic management of the estate. The Defence Estate Organisation and others are striving to ensure that the necessary processes are put in place to achieve this and we fully anticipate that further estate rationalisation will occur as a result.

<P>
<a name="90308w13.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is the basis of the methodologies used by <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> consultants contracted by his Department to assess the effects of radiation exposure from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests upon servicemen and medical auxiliaries; what assessment he has made of their sensitivity to the available data; and what representation he has received in respect of them.  [74960]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w13.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Radiation exposure of servicemen who participated in the UK's atmospheric nuclear tests was subject to pre-set standards which were directly based upon the contemporary guidance issued by the International Commission for Radiation Protection. There were two basic regimes. First, those who were known to be at risk were issued with personal dosimeters (film badges) and, if necessary, protective clothing. Secondly, and for the majority, the protective arrangement was to ensure that all personnel were accounted for and located at safe distances from the detonations. Additionally, there were programmes of general environmental monitoring covering the range and domestic areas including the muster locations. Of the 22,000 veterans included in the studies, some 5,000 were issued with film badges. Only 1,716 of these had non-zero recorded radiation doses; of these only 483 received total doses of more than 5 mSv and only 80 received more than 50 mSv. These figures and the results of the environmental monitoring are strong evidence that the majority of test veterans had no radiation exposure as a result of their participation.
<P>

<a name="90308w13.htm_para0">The health of the test veteran population has been the subject of two epidemiological studies carried out by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB). The reports were published in 1988 and 1993. These studies made statistically based comparisons of the mortality and cancer experiences of the test veterans, regardless of the cause of the illness, with levels seen in both a matched control group and in the general population. The studies concluded that participation in the tests programme had not had a detectable effect on the participants' expectation of life or on their total risk of developing cancer.
<P>

<a name="90308w13.htm_para1">Further and more detailed information about the methodologies used is given in the study reports copies of which are in the Library of the House. As regards representation, the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association (BNTVA) and their supporters have made clear their views on many occasions in recent years. However, the reports of these studies were peer reviewed,

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many cases involving soldiers sentenced by non- military courts to terms of imprisonment have been disposed of under the provisions of section 70 of the Army Act 1955 for each year between 1988 and 1998 indicating <i>(a)</i> the court which dealt with the offence, <i>(b)</i> the nature of the offence, <i>(c)</i> the sentence and <i>(d)</i> whether the convicted person was discharged from the Army.  [74428]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w13.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 March 1999]:</i> No Army personnel have been convicted by civil courts under Section 70 of the Army Act 1955, as this provides for soldiers to be dealt with by military court-martial or summary dealing only. A number of soldiers have, however, been convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment by the civil courts but detailed information relating to such cases is not held centrally and could only be provided at a disproportionate cost. Section 134(1) of the Army Act prohibits a soldier from being tried by a court-martial or dealt summarily by his Commanding Officer for an offence, or substantially the same offence, of which he has been convicted in a civil court.

 The measures proposed in the Green Paper, A new contract for welfare: Partnership in Pensions are intended to ensure that people who have worked throughout their working life on a low income will still be able to retire on an income above the level of the Minimum Income Guarantee. For the poorest households, the Minimum Income Guarantee will provide a secure income, which we intend over time and as resources allow, to increase in line with average earnings so that all pensioners, including the poorest, can share in the rising prosperity of the nation.

 The impact of time spent writing material for publication on entitlement to benefit depends on the claimant's circumstances and the benefit being claimed. For example, provided other conditions are satisfied Jobseeker's Allowance can be paid where work done for payment or in expectation is undertaken for less than 16 hours per week.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what action the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate is taking to deal with organised fraud in housing benefit; what action is proposed following the closure of the London organised fraud investigation team; and if he will make a statement.  [74281]<P>

<P>
<a name="90308w15.htm_spnew13"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate (BFI) was launched in November 1997 to examine and report to the Secretary of State on the administration of Social Security benefits by central Government agencies and local authorities with a particular emphasis on standards of counter-fraud and security performance. It examines and reports on local authority performance in administering Housing Benefit/Council Tax Benefit and countering fraud.
<P>

<a name="90308w15.htm_para3">Local authorities in London now refer cases of suspected organised Housing Benefit fraud to Benefits Agency organised fraud investigation teams.
<P>

<a name="90308w15.htm_para4">We are carrying out a review of how organised fraud within Social Security benefits, including fraud in those benefits that are administered by local authorities, can be countered.

<P>
<a name="90308w15.htm_spnew15"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Draft child support regulations have today been placed in both Houses. These will, from October 1999, allow self-employed parents to provide the figures, which they use for self assessment of their earnings for tax purposes, for use in calculating child maintenance. These provisions together with measures in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill currently before the House which will enable Inland Revenue to provide earnings information for the self-employed where the parent fails to supply the information to the Child Support Agency, and other operational improvements being introduced by the Agency, will lead to a simpler and more effective basis for getting maintenance flowing. The draft regulations also contain provisions to extend the suspension of fees for the Agency's assessment and collection services until April 2001.

<a name="90308w16.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Over 380,000 British pensioners living overseas in around 30 countries are paid the up-rated UK State Pensions to which they are entitled. These are paid under European Community regulations, and certain long standing social security agreements which allow for the payment of upratings.

<P>
34. <a name="90308w16.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what estimate he has made of the total amount of benefits administered by his Department unclaimed by those entitled to them; and what measures he proposes to encourage take-up.  [73071]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w16.htm_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Information relating to the total amount of unclaimed Social Security benefit is not available, because for most benefits, these data are not routinely collected. Estimates of take-up of income-related benefits published for the year 1993-94 (covering Income Support, Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit and Family Credit) indicate that the total amount unclaimed was in the region of &#163;2.5 billion. More recent data are currently being reviewed following an error discovered in the data relating to take-up among pensioners, which suggests that the level of take-up is likely to be somewhat higher than previously thought.
<P>

<a name="90308w16.htm_para0">Recent initiatives to encourage take-up include a major publicity campaign to promote in-work benefits which was launched on 1 June last year. This campaign comprised TV and radio advertisements and a direct mailshot to lone parents. A special help line was established to handle telephone enquiries arising from the campaign.
<P>

<a name="90308w16.htm_para1">We are also planning measures to encourage take-up of the Minimum Income Guarantee by pensioners. These measures will build on the findings from research into the reasons why pensioners do not take up their Income Support entitlement, and the nine pilot projects which the Department undertook last year to test different methods of encouraging pensioners to claim. We expect to publish the results of the research and the pilots later this year.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what proposals he has to tackle the problem of child poverty.  [73072]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w16.htm_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Since November last year an extra &#163;2.50 a week has been made available to less well off families with children under age 11, through the income- related benefits. From April this year we will implement the largest ever increase in Child Benefit, an extra &#163;2.95 a week for the first or eldest child. A similar increase in the family premium will ensure that those on income-related benefits also gain.
<P>

<a name="90308w16.htm_para2">We consider that helping parents to work is the best form of assistance. The New Deal for Lone Parents and National Childcare Strategy will together make it possible for more parents to start work or increase their hours. Around two million children will be better off as a result of the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit and Childcare Tax Credit and, along with the National Minimum Wage, will help to ensure that work pays for more families with children.

<P>
<a name="90308w16.htm_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 All the computer systems used to assess and pay benefits were made compliant during 1998 (the majority before the end of August 1998). In addition, by the end of last year, we had successfully tested all these systems using dates before and after the Year 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w16.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Together with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment we have introduced the New Deal for Disabled People to help disabled people and those with long term illness move into, or remain in, work: piloting a voluntary personal adviser service in 12 areas throughout Great Britain, for claimants of incapacity benefits; and funding a number of innovative schemes to test different approaches. From June we will also be piloting the Single Work Focused Gateway in twelve areas. In these areas, where appropriate, people of working age who claim benefits will be given a Personal Adviser who will be able to access information and the opportunities for employment, training and rehabilitation, and will help them plan a route back to independence.
<P>

<a name="90308w16.htm_para3">In October 1998 we introduced a new 52 week linking rule for incapacity benefits and abolished the 16 hour limit for voluntary work. We have increased the therapeutic earnings limit from April 1999 and plan to pilot further changes to benefits from April. In addition the disabled persons tax credit, will be more generous than the Disability Working Allowance it will replace. We will also reform the All Work Test so that, as well as establishing the level of incapacity for benefit purposes, it will also provide information which will be potentially helpful to disabled people and their personal advisers when planning a return to work. The Department for Education and Employment has an extensive range of measures aimed at helping disabled people into employment.

Increased expenditure by The Scottish Office mainly relates to refurbishment of St. Andrew's House, and the buildings associated with the interim Parliament accommodation. The greater part of the expenditure under Agencies relates to the refurbishment of court buildings.

 CS incapacitant spray is not in general use by the police service in Scotland. The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) conducted a trial into the effectiveness of CS incapacitant spray as an item of police defence equipment during the period 1 October 1997 to 30 September 1998. The trial areas encompassed the City of Dundee in the Tayside Police area and a Division in the Strathclyde Police area. In total, 803 officers were trained to use the equipment in these pilot areas. An evaluation of the trial has been completed but ACPOS have deferred a decision on extending the use of the spray pending an independent assessment on the safety of the spray commissioned by the Department of Health. The spray continues to be used by officers in the 2 trial areas.

 The available information is given in the table. It relates to the number of individuals who were convicted in Scottish courts at least once in a given year for conduct classified as a crime or for breach of the peace or simple assault, which are classified as offences. It therefore excludes convictions for motor vehicle and some minor common law and statutory offences. In addition to cases dealt with in court, children in Scotland who are suspected of committing offences are generally referred to the Reporter to a children's hearing. Each year an average of around 4,500 children aged 15 and over are referred to Reporters on offence grounds, equivalent to 7 per cent. of the 15-year-old population.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland (1) what instruction he has given the Deer Commission concerning the use of deer fences within areas known to support the capercaillie; and what actions are proposed to remove existing fences where they are dangerous to black grouse and capercaillie;  [72893]

 The Deer Commission for Scotland has no powers either to erect or remove fences itself. However, the prevention of strikes on deer fencing by birds such as black grouse and capercaillie is always 



<P>
<P><I>8 Mar 1999 : Column: 67</I><P>
considered by the Deer Commission for Scotland when advice is given to woodland managers, including the Forestry Commission, on forest protection and deer control. Where new planing is considered under the Forestry Commission's Woodland Grant Scheme, wide consultation takes place to ensure that any fences which are considered necessary are sited to minimise negative effects. In some cases, fences are marked in areas known to be used by birds and removed as soon as the trees are established. The Forestry Commission is removing about 200 km of existing fencing on its own land, and is contributing towards the cost of removing over 100 km of deer fencing on private land.
<P>

<a name="90308w20.htm_para0">My right hon. Friend has at present no plans to add the capercaillie to Schedule 1 part II of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Additional protection for the capercaillie, under the 1981 Act, is one of a number of issues currently under consideration by the Scottish Biodiversity Group's Capercaillie Species Action Plan Steering Group.

 Education Action Zones are not allocated according to political constituencies, but reflect the groups of schools involved. The current 25 Education Action Zones occur mainly in urban areas; in two zones--Norfolk and North Somerset, the zone covers both urban and rural; and one--Hereford--covers a rural area. The associated political constituencies are as follows:

 The minimum requirement now, and also 10 years ago, for employment as a teacher in a maintained school is the holding of Qualified Teacher Status awarded by the Secretary of State after successful completion of an approved course of initial teacher training (ITT). Decisions about the suitability of a candidate to be employed to teach a particular subject or age range are a matter for the employer.
<P>

<a name="90308w21.htm_para1">All entrants to ITT courses since 1979 have been required to have attained at least a grade C in GCSE mathematics or a recognised equivalent. All current trainees on primary ITT courses must follow the national curriculum for primary mathematics. From this September, secondary trainees specialising in mathematics must follow the national curriculum for secondary mathematics.
<P>

<a name="90308w21.htm_para2">Our Green Paper on the modernisation of the teaching profession, published in December, made clear our determination to ensure that all new teachers have a thorough grounding in numeracy, literacy and information and communication technology. As a first step, we propose to pilot this summer a numeracy test which we intend all trainees would have to pass, from summer 2000, before they could be qualified as teachers.

 It is for individual colleges to decide the conditions of service and what pay increases they will offer their staff, within the resources available to each college and within the framework of the Government's policy on public sector pay. Ministers, however, have consistently emphasised the importance of partnership between employers and staff in delivering the vital contribution of Further Education to our lifelong learning vision. We have been encouraging the national representative bodies to collaborate in the interests of that agenda, and we warmly welcome the announcement by National Association for Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) and the Association of Colleges (AoC) of the end of their dispute.

I am pleased to say that, since then, we have been informed by the county council that they do intend to reflect their full education SSA increase of &#163;9.4 million (5.0 per cent.) in their 1999-2000 education budget.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if he will establish an appropriate body, with a remit equivalent to the Advisory Committee on Advertising, to check the competence and propriety of polling organisations bidding for Government work.  [75209]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w22.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 No. Decisions on awarding Government contracts to polling organisations are subject to the same strict requirements of value for money as any other category of Government procurement. In particular, the process of evaluating tenders includes an assessment of the competence of the tenderers to deliver the work required.

 The Government are not aware that there are distinct private and legally aided mediation sectors. Individual family mediators, however, undertake both private and publicly funded work. The standards of practice required for publicly funded family mediation work are set out in the contracts individual family mediators have with the Legal Aid Board.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w23.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The first phase of civil justice reforms will be introduced on 26 April. Those reforms represent a modernisation of the civil justice system, which is aimed at making it quicker, simpler and less costly to its users. Judicial case management will control the conduct of litigation, directing the work to be done in preparing a case for trial. This will ensure the time is in proportion to the complexity of that case and the issues at stake.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w23.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The discussions I and my officials have had with the insurance industry have clearly shown us that the provision of legal expenses insurance, both before the event and after the event, is diverse and considerable. Insurance aimed specifically at conditional fee agreements is almost exclusively after-the-event insurance, and the principal providers of insurance to underpin conditional fee agreements are well known. There is an increasing interest for insurance to underpin conditional fee agreements for proceedings other than personal injury cases. There are several well-known products in relation to personal injury cases, including the product developed jointly with the Law Society. All the indications are that good cases have no difficulty in obtaining insurance and that the market is maturing with the experience of nearly three and half years of operation. My officials keep in regular contact with the industry.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what is the average cost per week of prescriptions for sufferers from diabetes;  [73317]
<P>
<UL>(2) for what reasons diabetes sufferers are eligible for free prescriptions.  [73315]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w24.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 In 1997 the net ingredient cost of drugs used in the treatment of diabetes and dispensed in the community in England was &#163;142.6 million, an average of &#163;2.7 million a week. The net ingredient cost is the basic cost of a drug and does not take account of discounts, dispensing costs, fees or any prescription charge income.
<P>

<a name="90308w24.htm_para0">Diabetes sufferers are eligible for free prescriptions, except where treatment is by diet alone, as diabetes was identified in 1968 as one of a number of readily identifiable, permanent, life long conditions requiring regular or extensive medication.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what percentage of dental contract holders in each health authority area have had <i>(a)</i> an increase in the number of registrations and <i>(b)</i> a decrease in the number of registrations in the most recent year for which figures are available.  [74262]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w24.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Information on the percentage of dental contract holders having a National Health Service list which increased or decreased between January 1998 and January 1999 (the latest date for which information is available) has been placed in the Library. The percentage increases and decreases may not add to 100 because some dentists will have an unchanged list size. The comparisons are for dentists with contracts open at both January 1998 and January 1999 and exclude dentists with no registrations on both dates. Dentists with contracts in several health authorities are counted in each health authority in which they have a contract but only once in the England total. The comparisons between January 1998 and January 1999 are affected by the reduction in the registration period to 15 months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w24.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Each investing in dentistry funding request is dealt with as quickly as possible. The time taken to process a grant application depends on many factors, including the number of proposals received, the complexity of the request, and whether further information is required before a decision can be made.
<P>

<a name="90308w24.htm_para2">To date, just over &#163;7.5 million of investing in dentistry grants have been approved to enable over 600,000 patients to register with an National Health Service dentist, giving rise to treatment costs estimated to be around &#163;2.5 million in 1998-99.

 In 1995 the Department funded a pilot project on child protection mediation. The report highlighted the advantages of effective dispute resolution as well as the difficulties of ensuring full inter-agency co-operation. The small number of cases involved suggest that further developmental work will be needed if advance dispute resolution is to make a major contribution in the handling of public law cases.

<P>
<a name="90308w24.htm_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90308w24.htm_para3">The DTI's annual census of fireworks injuries is conducted over a four week period taking in the run-up to 5 November and a few days afterwards. Details of injuries recorded at each NHS Trust are available only for the years 1996 and 1997. Information for the years 1992 to 1995 is recorded by regional and district health authorities but no information on a regional basis is recorded for 1991. Copies of the annual reports of firework injuries for each of these years were placed in the Library as soon as they were published. A breakdown of the injuries recorded by each A&E unit for the years 1992 to 1995 could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="90308w24.htm_para4">No reliable estimates of fireworks injuries outside the census period can be made because the numbers are too small to be extrapolated from data in the Home Accident Surveillance System.

<P>
<a name="90308w24.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Vaccines licensed for use in the United Kingdom do not contain, in the finished product, bovine materials prohibited for use in the human food chain. However, bovine material is used in the early stage of manufacture of some vaccines which are subject to rigorously controlled purification processes.
<P>

<a name="90308w24.htm_para7">In March 1989, the Committee of the Safety of Medicines issued guidelines regarding the controls on the sourcing of bovine material used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. These were superseded by 'Guidelines for Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Agents causing Spongiform Encephalopathies via Medicinal Products' from the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products in 1992. The guidelines have been updated to reflect developments in scientific knowledge and require animal-derived materials to be sourced from countries with no reported cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

<a name="90308w25.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 As announced in the Response to the Children's Safeguards Review on 5 November 1998, the Government intend legislating to replace the current power to assist under Section 24 of the Children Act 1989 with a duty to assess and meet the needs of care leavers up to the age of 18 and will study the costs, limitations and affordability of extending this duty until the young person reaches the age of 21.

Management Action Plans submitted to the Department by local authorities are currently being evaluated, and progress in implementation will be monitored by the Government. The Government have also stated in the White Paper "Modernising Social Services" their intention to place a duty on the local authority as a whole in planning children's services and for all parties to participate in and take responsibility for their delivery.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w25.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Corporal punishment is not permitted by law, with the exception that a parent or someone acting in loco parentis is entitled to administer corporal punishment that is reasonable in all the circumstances. Legislation prohibits corporal punishment in children's homes, foster care and registered care homes.
<P>

<a name="90308w25.htm_para0">Current legislation does not prevent the use of corporal punishment by private foster carers. Children Act guidance on assessing the suitability of private foster carers states that social workers should explore the (private) foster carers' views on discipline, including their preparedness to accept that corporal punishment is inappropriate for children who are privately fostered. A consultation document will be issued shortly on how the law can be improved in order to better protect children.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w25.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 There is no centrally held record of suspected adverse reactions to medicines and the incidence is not therefore known. However, the Yellow Card Scheme exists for health professionals to report suspected adverse reactions to the Medicines Control Agency and Committee on Safety of Medicines on a voluntary basis. This scheme has been successful in identifying new hazards to medicines so that prescribers may be informed about the safe use of medicines. In addition, a pilot scheme has been set up in the Trent Region, with funding from the Medicines Control Agency, to monitor the safety of medicines in children. This includes suspected adverse reaction reports associated with unlicensed and off-label usage of medicines in children.

support of the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicine is evaluated. The side-effects occurring during the paediatric clinical trials are assessed as part of this evaluation. A final decision regarding the grant of a licence for use in children is made after weighing the potential benefits of the proposed treatment against the potential risks.
<P>

<a name="90308w25.htm_para2">Currently in the United Kingdom the decision to undertake appropriate trials to support an application for a licence for use of a medicine in the treatment of children rests with pharmaceutical companies. A recently adopted European guideline encourages the pharmaceutical industry to undertake appropriate clinical trials on products with anticipated therapeutic benefits in children. However, if the guidance does not have the effect of increasing the availability of appropriate medicinal products for children, there is scope for the UK and other Member States to raise with the European Commission the question of whether legislation similar to that in operation in the United States should be introduced to strengthen the European regulatory framework.

 Pre-registration nurse education programmes consist of a minimum of 4,600 hours theoretical and practical instruction of which no less than 50 per cent., or 2,300 hours, are spent in clinical placements dealing directly with patients. The large majority of placements will take place in hospital wards although community, primary care and other clinical settings are also used.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w25.htm_spnew10"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Cofinancing of the CAP would not affect overall support to agriculture, in the UK or other member states. It would increase support provided directly by member states, but reduce the support provided by the EC.
<P>

<a name="90308w25.htm_para3">Any increase in agricultural support from UK domestic funds would, of itself, have no effect on the UK rebate. Any such increase which resulted from cofinancing would be more than matched--even after the abatement--by a reduction in UK contributions to the EU. The Commission has estimated (in its report on Own Resources) that cofinancing of 25 per cent. of CAP direct aids would reduce the UK net contribution by &#163;146 million in 2006.

 Under the current EU scheme provided for in Council Regulation 3699/93, 547 vessels have been decommissioned in the UK at public expense. In recognition of their historical significance, a small number of these were placed in the care of registered museums rather than scrapped. My Department does not have this information for other member states, although information on changes in the tonnage and power of all member states' fleets up to the end of 1996 was published in the European Commission's report on the outcome of the third Multi-Annual Guidance Programme.

 Details of licensed slaughterhouses in England and Wales are published in the Meat Hygiene Enforcement Report, which is placed in the Library of the House each month. Information is not held on those adopting religious methods of slaughter or the average number of times these methods are used. A member of the Meat Hygiene Service inspection team is present every day during operating periods.

number of animals religiously slaughtered in the UK for the last year for which figures are available.  [73484]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w27.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Information is not kept separately for the numbers of animals slaughtered by the religious or by other approved methods. The next biennial review of welfare at slaughter standards by the Meat Hygiene Service, which will take place later this year, has been designed to provide information on slaughter practices.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will list <i>(a)</i> the breaches of the approved killing methods his inspectors have discovered over the last two years in slaughterhouses undertaking religious slaughter and <i>(b)</i> the penalties imposed on the operators in each case.  [73498]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w27.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Official Veterinary Surgeons of the Meat Hygiene Service monitor compliance with welfare at slaughter legislation in licensed slaughterhouses daily during operation and take on-the-spot action to put right any problems found. Figures that are available relate to prosecutions, and none of the prosecutions taken under the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 relates to breaches of approved killing methods for religious slaughter.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will list the approved killing method for each species undergoing religious slaughter.  [73320]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w27.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 When slaughter is by the Jewish or Muslim method the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 provide an exemption from the general requirement for animals to be stunned. Slaughter must be carried out without inflicting unnecessary suffering: in the case of cattle, sheep and goats by the severance of both carotid arteries and both jugular veins by rapid, uninterrupted movements of a knife and, in the case of turkeys, domestic fowl, guinea-fowl, ducks, geese or quail by the severance of both carotid arteries by rapid and uninterrupted movements of a knife.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimate he has made of the proportion of an animal carcase religiously slaughtered which is consumed by adherents of the religion concerned; and what use is made of remaining edible parts of the carcase.  [73483]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w27.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The acceptability for consumption of carcases and parts of carcases is a matter for the religious authorities.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to the letter from the Parliamentary Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley), ref 123733, on Japanese whaling, if he will make a statement on the bilateral meeting with Japanese officials held on 8 February.  [72895]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90308w27.htm_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Whaling was only one of the issues discussed at the meeting in question; a large number of other environmental issues were discussed. The UK delegation made clear the UK's opposition to Japan's whaling activities, stressing in particular, our disappointment that Japan continues to whale under special permit and to ignore all IWC calls to halt scientific whaling in the Southern Ocean Sanctuary. We emphasised that the UK view does not consider that there is any scientific justification for Japanese scientific whaling and called upon Japan to restructure its research programmes so that its objectives could be achieved by non-lethal means. We also drew attention to the fact that the UK was not alone in expressing these views; a large majority of IWC members have also made clear their opposition to Japanese scientific whaling. Japan reiterated its formal position on this issue. I can assure my hon. Friend that we shall continue to raise this issue with Japan at every appropriate opportunity.
