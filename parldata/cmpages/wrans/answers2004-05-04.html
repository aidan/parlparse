<p><a name="40504w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Hood: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the outcome was of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 21&nbsp;April; what the Government&#039;s stance was on the issues discussed, including its voting record; and if she will make a statement.  [168714]</p>








<p><a name="40504w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State and I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 21&#150;22&nbsp;April 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w01.html_para0">
The Council concluded its consideration of proposals to reform four CAP regimes: those for cotton, olive oil, tobacco and hops. Agreement on all four was eventually reached by qualified majority. This was a difficult negotiation but the outcome is highly satisfactory from a UK point of view. Overall, the agreement followed the main principles of last June&#039;s reforms with decoupling in hops from 2005 (with the option to delay this until 2006) and partial decoupling in the other three sectors from 2006. The rates vary but that for cotton is 65&nbsp;per cent., a small increase over the 60&nbsp;per cent. originally proposed; and in the case of tobacco, the rate will be 100&nbsp;per cent. in 2010 and thereafter. Although the UK would have supported higher rates in all sectors and an earlier move to full decoupling, this agreement sends positive signals to our trading partners by marking a further step towards a more liberalised and market focused agriculture in the EU.

<p><a name="40504w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
<i>[holding answer 30&nbsp;April 2004]:</i> At the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 26&nbsp;April the UK sought shorter journey times, more space for animals during transport and better ventilation. Unfortunately, in this area which we see as vital to ensuring improved welfare, the gap between countries was too great to be bridged.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w01.html_para1">
As a result the proposal, which would have improved animal welfare in many areas, has been effectively withdrawn from discussion for the foreseeable future.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 May 2004 : Column 1382W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40504w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Government are committed to improving welfare across the EU and was disappointed and frustrated by EU Ministers&#039; failure on 26&nbsp;April to agree a new regulation on the welfare of animals during transport. The UK, consulting farming, horse and welfare interests, had worked hard to improve the draft proposals but unfortunately it is clear that there are no plans to return to them in the foreseeable future. We will continue to ensure that animals that leave the UK are transported in full accordance with the law. We shall also take every opportunity to press the European Commission and other member states to ensure that the current rules are strictly enforced throughout the expanded EU.

<p>
<a name="40504w01.html_para2">
In January 2002, the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB set up a Vaccine Scoping Study Sub-Committee (VSSSC) to advise Defra Ministers on whether a TB vaccination strategy for either cattle or wildlife would be feasible. The VSSSC reported to Ministers in July 2003 (published December 2003). This advised on research requirements, but cautioned that a vaccine (for cattle or badgers) remains a long-term policy option. Many obstacles still have to be overcome.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w01.html_para3">
An Inter-Departmental Vaccine Steering Group is working to identify administrative and legal procedures to allow a potential vaccine to be authorised for use.

 The Secretary of State and her ministerial team have used every opportunity to stress to the European Commission and to the Secretary of State&#039;s counterparts in the EU Accession Countries the importance of complying with the EU <i>acquis communautaire</i> (the rules and regulations laid down by the European Union), and in particular the veterinary and phytosanitary <i>acquis</i> which covers areas such as food hygiene and animal slaughter.

 The severely disadvantaged areas in the uplands (then termed less favoured areas) were first designated following the physical, economic and demographic assessment laid down in Article 3(4) of Council Directive 75/268. In 1999, this Article was replaced by Article 19 of Council Regulation 1257/1999 (the so-called rural development Regulation). They are characterised by land of poor productivity which is difficult to cultivate and mainly suitable for extensive livestock farming; and by a risk of land abandonment, which could impair the conservation of the countryside and the viability of communities in the area.

 There have been numerous discussions between Departments at ministerial and official level in regard to the obstruction of shipping. The safety of shipping is of paramount importance.

The franchise secures investment of around &#163;260m, which will include the introduction of a new fleet of 100 mph diesel trains leading to increased capacity, improved service quality and performance across the region. A new northern franchise, which will include local and regional services through Preston, is out for tender. Work continues on the West Coast Main Line upgrade, which will see reduction in journey times along the route and increases in service frequency.

Around a third of DFID&#039;s total expenditure is allocated to specific sectors.

In large part, this is because DFID believes that investment in these sectors will have a greater impact on achieving the MDGs. In 2002, the latest year for which these data are available, there was a large jump in expenditure for the first group, which was not matched for scale in the second one. This was mainly due to a number of large contributions to global health funds.

<p><a name="40504w07.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 CCLRC seeks actively to develop exploitation routes for its research via its totally owned commercial exploitation company, CLIK, which was established in April 2002. Five new CLIK-generated high technology companies are already in the final stages of formation, three of which are based on research and associated technologies developed at the CCLRC Daresbury Laboratory. The CLIK business plan is based on the formation of three new CCLRC spin-out companies per year for each of the next five years.

<a name="40504w07.html_para5">
CCLRC has interacted closely with the activities of the North West Science Council (NWSC) since its inception. The Director of the Daresbury Laboratory has been a member throughout this period, and he and his staff also maintain close relations with the NWDA. This has led already to the construction of two new NWDA-supported high technology buildings immediately adjacent to the DL site, on land previously owned by CCLRC, in order to provide easily accessible space for new high technology, spin-out companies and associated business support advisers. The CCLRC/NWDA interaction has also already led to the successful implementation of a number of major new joint-funded projects, which are or will be based at the DL/NWDA Campus including SUPERSTEM, the Energy Recovery Linac project and the new Cockcroft Accelerator Science Centre. Opportunities for new nanotechnology/nanoscience activities and also a new Centre for Instrumentation are also currently being explored.

<p><a name="40504w08.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s renewable energy target is that renewable energy sources will supply 10&nbsp;per cent. of our electricity by 2010. The target is challenging as we are starting from a low base; provisional figures suggest that in 2003, 2&nbsp;per cent. of electricity was generated from sources eligible for the Renewables Obligation. However, the target is achievable. As the SEPN annual report published earlier this week indicates, we have made an encouraging start.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w08.html_para7">
We have received many representations from stakeholders regarding the targets, and we have listened to them. An example of this is our plan to increase the level of the Renewables Obligation (RO) in the period after 2010, so that it reaches 15.4&nbsp;per cent. by 2015&#150;16. By increasing the Obligation in these years, this will greatly assist investor confidence and in particular help with the financing of new projects needed to deliver output by 2010.

<p><a name="40504w10.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 The Chief Executive of Water Service (Mrs. Katharine Bryan) has written to the hon. Lady in response to this question.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w10.html_para1">
<i>Letter from Mrs. Katherine Bryan to Lady Hermon, dated 30&nbsp;April 2004:</i>

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question (No. 168642) concerning his support for pilot schemes to promote water conservation amongst low-income households and vulnerable people in order to reduce the impact of water charging.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">In recognising that there is a relationship between water conservation and water consumption it is equally important to recognise that they are not synonymous. Water Service&#039;s second Water Efficiency Plan, which I launched in January 2004, sets out a wide range of measures aimed at reducing demand from water. In addition to Water Service&#039;s leakage reduction strategy, it involves a proactive approach to water conservation by all customers, including raising awareness and the further promotion of water saving devices such as Hippo Bags. The combination of conservation measures taken by Water Service and reduced consumption by customers should help to reduce projected water demand. This will ultimately reduce the charge to customers.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Changes to water consumption patterns could have a more direct impact on individual&#039;s water bills under a metered water regime. In some circumstances, lower consumption could result in a reduced bill. However, no decision has yet been taken on the form of water charging to be introduced. Research and analysis into the consequences of different approaches is currently being undertaken and the impact of charges on low-income households and vulnerable groups is one of the issues being considered.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The Government is fully committed to measures that encourage water conservation. I am advised that in June 2002 and November 2003, Water Service officials met with Eaga-partnership Ltd., which is promoting a water conservation programme known as Watersmart and is interested in undertaking a pilot study in Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, the results of pilot study undertaken by Eaga-Partnership Ltd. in the Essex and Suffolk Water Company indicated that the costs of the programme are considerably in excess of the cost of comparable leakage reduction measures currently being undertaken by Water Service and would not therefore represent good value for money The company was informed of the position and agreed to provide additional information on the economic benefits of the programme. To date, Water Service has received no further communication from the company.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Water Service continually keeps its activities and procedures under review in order to improve effectiveness and deliver improved value for money to customers and taxpayers. It will continue to consider any proposals, including other pilot schemes, which would contribute to improved water conservation.</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p class "tabletext">Water Service&#039;s second Water Efficiency Plan was formally launched in January 2004. The Plan sets out how Water Service proposes to extend its information and awareness campaign and to provide advice to all of the community including low income households, domestic premises, small businesses and public sector offices. Water Service will continue to extend its programme of exhibitions at major events, presentations to local groups as well as displays at local shopping centres across Northern Ireland. In addition the successful Water Bus mobile exhibition will continue to deliver the water conservation message to schools, with all children who attend being provided with a home copy of water efficiency information to give to their parent or guardian. All public sector offices have received a full water conservation pack containing Hippo bags, posters, etc and Water Service will continue to work with the public sector to promote water efficiency. Water Service has also sent small businesses and Government offices further information on how to improve water efficiency when it issued metered water accounts in 2003.</p>

<p class "tabletext">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question (No 168931) about what further research has been undertaken following the Northern Ireland Audit Office report into water efficiency in 2001, and water efficiency targets in Northern Ireland.

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Water Service is committed to addressing the issues raised by the Northern Ireland Audit Office and has carried out a comprehensive review of its Water Efficiency Plan. A revised Water Efficiency Plan was formally launched in January 2004 which aims to reduce the demand for water through effective leakage management and other water conservation measures. The Plan promotes a more proactive approach to leakage reduction, water conservation including raising awareness, and the further promotion of water saving devices such as Hippo Bags. It also includes a new Leakline number for customers to report leakage incidents.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">A major element of the Water Efficiency Plan is to reduce leakage from the water distribution system and Water Service has an annual water efficiency target which aims towards achieving a reduction in leakage to an economic level of 172&nbsp;million litres per day in March 2007. Provisional outturn for 2003/2004 indicates that Water Service has achieved its leakage reduction targets for the past two years, resulting in total leakage being reduced by almost 60&nbsp;million litres per day. The water efficiency target for 2004/2005 is to reduce leakage from the water distribution system by a further 28 mi8llion litres per day, to a level of 205&nbsp;million litres per day by 31&nbsp;March 2005. Water Service is committed to meeting this leakage target through upgrading the water infrastructure and by targeting resources to detect and repair leaks.</p>

 The following table provides the total education funding for 1997&#150;98 to 2004&#150;05. There have been changes to the structure of Standard Spending Assessments and their successor from 2003&#150;04, Education Formula Spending, which make them incomparable over time: for example, several large transfers from SSA/EFS to grant funding. Only total funding per pupil (including SSA/EFS and grants) is comparable between years. Also, for 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05, pension transfers to EFS and the Learning and Skills Council are excluded from EFS and total funding figures to enable comparison between years.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many new computers the Department plans to put in schools in the next five years; and how many of those will be put in schools in Havering.  [169949]</p>








<p><a name="40504w13.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> 
 Our targets for 2004 were to achieve computer: pupil ratios of 1:8 in primary schools and 1:5 in secondary schools. We have already reached the primary school target and confidently expect to reach the secondary target this year. Funding for ICT in schools is currently available through the Standards Fund and the Devolved Capital Grant and it is for schools to decide how to spend their allocations to best meet their local need and circumstances.

 The effective use of electronic on-screen assessment will have an important role to play in supporting learners in schools and colleges in the future. Both Ministers and officials in this Department have discussed with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority ways in which electronic assessment can be introduced, while maintaining standards; ensuring access for all learners; and guaranteeing high security levels. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is developing more detailed plans for electronic on-screen assessment, and we look forward to further discussions with it as we seek to promote greater use of such techniques in the learning process.

 In 2003, the summer examinations ran smoothly, and students received their results on time. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, as regulator, is in close contact with the examination awarding bodies to achieve the same outcomes in summer 2004.

Last November the Secretary of State announced that &#163;100&nbsp;million would be available over the next two years to help modernise the examination system and ensure its safe delivery. I am glad to say that investment is already delivering improvements. More examiners are being recruited, and training is being provided for examination officers in schools and colleges. Further investment is planned to improve the system for transfer of examination information between schools; colleges and awarding bodies, and streamlining and making more secure the movement of examination papers and scripts. We look forward to close co-operation between the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and examination awarding bodies to ensure our investment creates an examinations system which fully meets the needs of students, both this year and in the future.

<p><a name="40504w14.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 Positive Activities for Young People is a targeted programme that aims to provide diversionary and developmental activities for young people aged eight to 19 years who are at risk of social exclusion or committing crime. There was no one organisation at the local level which covered the whole age group or range of activities. In order to meet the above objectives and to ensure that regional needs and priorities were met, Government Offices were chosen to administer the programme. It is also the role of Government Offices to work with local partners such as Youth Offending Teams and Behaviour Improvement Programme schools to ensure that the target group of young people is reached.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w14.html_para0">
52 Lead Delivery Agents (LDAs) have been appointed across England to manage the delivery of the programme and the performance of the providers delivering the activities. In eight of the 52 areas the LDA role is performed by the Local Authority Youth Service.

 The trial started in September 2003 and will cover the 2004 Key Stage 1 assessments, which are not due to be completed until the second half of the summer term. It is therefore too early to have made an assessment of the trial at this stage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w14.html_para1">
QCA has commissioned an independent evaluation from Leeds university which will focus on a representative sample of 150 of the 5,000 schools taking part in the trial. The evaluation will look at workload and whether the new arrangements ensure really robust and comparable results that can be used as a basis for calculating value-added. We expect a full report to be ready at the beginning of September.

<p><a name="40504w14.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 The information is not held in the format requested. Within the context of the statutory National Curriculum, where Physical Education (PE) is compulsory for pupils aged 5&#150;16, it is for individual schools to use their budgets as they judge appropriate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w14.html_para2">
The Government are investing more than &#163;1 billion in England to transform PE, school sport and club links. The funding will help deliver an ambitious Public Service Agreement target, shared with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, to increase the percentage of 5&#150;16 year olds who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75&nbsp;per cent. by 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w14.html_para3">
The Department is providing just over &#163;830,000.00 to support the delivery of a School Sport Partnership in the Wigan LEA area. The partnership includes 14 secondary and 40 primary schools and provides enhanced sports opportunities for all young people to ensure that their pupils spend a minimum of two hours a week on high quality PE and School Sport. A key objective for all School Sport Partnerships is to ensure that the improvements and enhanced opportunities that they deliver are sustainable and embedded within schools to ensure a lasting legacy. The New Opportunities Fund has provided schools in the Wigan LEA area with over &#163;4.3&nbsp;million specifically to enhance PE and school sport facilities.

 We do not hold information at constituency level. The majority of capital funding is now allocated to schools and authorities by needs-related formulae. This enables them to decide how to target the rapidly increasing resources to address their highest priority needs in line with local asset management plans. I would direct my hon. Friend to the answer I gave to his question 168497, which lists capital allocations made to Rochdale local education authority since 1997. Rochdale also received &#163;2,873,000 in November 2001 under the New Opportunities PE and Sports Programme, which is administered by the New Opportunities Fund.

<p><a name="40504w14.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. National Curriculum testing provides an objective means of testing all children in the country on a consistent basis. It is an important part of

the overall drive to raise standards in the core subjects at the primary and secondary stages and lays firm foundations for future learning.

<p>
<a name="40504w14.html_para4">
The information from testing helps teachers to identify strengths and weaknesses, which can then be used to inform teaching and learning. It allows us to compare the progress of children in different schools and provides parents with clear feedback against national standards.

 The results from the 2003 National Curriculum tests showed that 75&nbsp;per cent. of 11-year-olds in England reached Level 4 in English and 73&nbsp;per cent. in mathematics. These results represent a significant improvement in standards&#151;of 12 percentage points in English and 11 percentage points in mathematics&#151;since 1997, reflecting the impact of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies on primary schools.

<a name="40504w16.html_sbhd5"><h3 align=center>Traffic and Community Wardens</h3>





<p><a name="40504w16.html_wqn5"><b> Mrs. Dunwoody: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the responsibilities of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;traffic wardens and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;community wardens are.  [168255]</p>








<p><a name="40504w16.html_spnew5"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 Traffic wardens are civilian employees of police authorities, but act under the direction of chief officers of police. Section 95 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 makes provision for them to discharge duties, including law enforcement, normally undertaken by the police in connection with the control and regulation of traffic and stationary vehicles. These 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 May 2004 : Column 1436W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
functions relate to the control and regulation of, and enforcement of the law relating to, traffic, including pedestrians and stationery vehicles. Traffic wardens can also require vehicles to stop for specific purposes. The powers conferred on traffic wardens and the duties they may undertake are prescribed very precisely by the Home Secretary in the Functions of Traffic Wardens Order 1970, as amended.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w16.html_para2">
Part 1 of the Traffic Management Bill empowers the Secretary of State for Transport as the traffic authority for trunk roads in England, and the National Assembly for Wales as the traffic authority for trunk roads in Wales, to establish a uniformed on-road traffic officer service to manage the traffic consequences of random incidents such as breakdowns, obstructions, debris and accidents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w16.html_para3">
The Bill enables traffic officers to carry out certain traffic management functions currently carried out on trunk roads by the police in order to deal with incidents and keep traffic moving. Specifically the Bill would provide traffic officers with powers to stop and direct traffic and to place and operate traffic signs. These powers are similar to those of the police and may only be exercised in order to:

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">assist the movement of traffic;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">prevent or reduce congestion;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">avoid danger to persons or traffic; or</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">prevent damage to anything on or near the road.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w16.html_para4">
The traffic officer service will comprise uniformed officials patrolling motorways and trunk roads in England around the clock. They will be appointed by the Highways Agency directly, although the Bill allows flexibility for the service to be contracted out should it ever be decided that this is in the public interest.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w16.html_para5">
Responsibilities for community wardens vary according to local priorities. Wardens and warden schemes do however need to fulfil the four broad categories of environmental improvements, community safety and crime prevention, community development and housing regeneration. They provide a link between local residents and key agencies such as local authorities and the police. And they encourage neighbourhoods to develop innovative ways to tackle their environmental problems and the behaviours that create an atmosphere of neglect and encourage crime.

[165088]</p>








<p><a name="40504w18.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 The Civil Defence Grant is paid as a contribution to the cost of civil protection at the local level. The level of funding available for counter terrorism and civil protection has substantially increased in recent years, including &#163;330&nbsp;million for counter terrorism work in the 2003 Budget.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 May 2004 : Column 1445W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w18.html_para3">
179 local authorities are eligible for the Civil Defence Grant. These are the authorities with a statutory duty for civil defence, namely county councils, metropolitan districts and London boroughs, unitary authorities, and Fire and Civil Defence Authorities. Shire districts, such as Hambleton and Harrogate, have no statutory duty for civil defence and therefore receive no direct funding from central Government. Shire counties carry out emergency planning on behalf of their districts and for this work they receive an additional amount included in their grant allocation, currently set at &#163;12,000 per district.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w18.html_para4">
The allocations of Civil Defence Grant to the authorities of North Yorkshire county council and the City of York council since the financial year 2000&#150;01 are set out in the table. The increase in 2001&#150;02 was due to the suspension of the process of allocating funding by use of a formula. Following negotiations with the local Government Association, the Civil Defence (Grant) Act 2002 re-established a formula, which led to the stabilisation of grant levels in 2002&#150;03.

<p><a name="40504w19.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 These questions have been answered with respect to the Defence Information Infrastructure (DII) programme. The Ministry of Defence is currently in negotiations with two potential commercial Delivery Partners (DP) for the provision of information systems services for Ministry of Defence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w19.html_para5">
It should be noted that the DII programme is not a privatisation of IT infrastructure. Under the terms of the Public-Private Partnership arrangement, the MOD will continue to own the infrastructure but the delivery of the service will be the responsibility of the commercial Delivery Partner.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w19.html_para6">
The DII programme is crucial to the delivery of the Defence Change Programme and has the potential to support delivery of significant benefits across Defence. The DII programme will enable Defence to realise a greatly increased capability at reduced cost. The three main benefits of DII are:

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">the reduced cost of providing computing facilities due to the economy of scale;</p>
</ul>
<p>





<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 May 2004 : Column 1450W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">the ability to integrate more closely our battlefield systems with our support systems, leading to improved decision making and intelligence collection and analysis.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>

No disadvantages to the implementation of the DII programme have been identified.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w19.html_para8">
The DII programme will not increase threats to national security. Deployed operations will continue to be supported by Service personnel. Increment One of the programme currently consists of 72,000 workstations. Only 10,000 of these are currently supported by in-house staff. The remainder are already supported by commercial service providers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w19.html_para9">
As a key part of providing a Network Enabled Capability, DII will improve national security both on deployed operations and in the United Kingdom. As a pan-defence service, it will greatly improve the ability to exchange operational information within the MOD, between the three Services, and between fixed locations and deployed elements of the Services.

 As I said in my reply of 3&nbsp;November 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 427W, value for money is a fundamental factor in all our procurement decisions. In assessing value for money we take account of the long-term implications of decisions, including their industrial and wider economic impact.

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net cost includes all savings except for additional Income tax revenue, (see note 3). Figures are for Great Britain in 2004&#150;05 price terms, using the GDP deflator index, rounded to the nearest &#163;100&nbsp;million.<br>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic State Pension costs are estimated by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department and are consistent with Budget 2004 assumptions and use 2002 based population projections. Basic State Pension costs refer to the additional costs after allowing for consequential changes to National Insurance Fund benefits and non-means tested vote benefits.<br>

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional income tax revenue is estimated by the Inland Revenue using current tax rates. The Income tax estimate for 2006&#150;07 is based on the 2001&#150;02 Survey of Personal Incomes and is projected in line with March 2004 Budget assumptions. The cost net of income tax revenue in 2006&#150;07 is &#163;2.6 billion. For illustrative purposes, we have assumed income tax revenue to be a fixed percentage of the gross cost for this option in 2007&#150;08 and 2008&#150;09. Therefore, the illustrative total net cost in 2007&#150;08 is &#163;2.6 billion and in 2008&#150;09 is &#163;3.1 billion. Estimates for later years would be subject to a greater degree of uncertainty.<br>

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Second Pension is assumed to be unchanged.<br>





5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savings credit is abolished for those aged 75 from April 2006 with no payments to existing pensioners and no new recipients after 2006.<br>

6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savings from savings credit and other income related benefits (guarantee credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit) are calculated using the Department&#039;s policy simulation model for 2006&#150;07. It is assumed that the proportion of savings calculated for the first year is constant for subsequent years.<br>

We estimate that there are approximately 100,000 people in Great Britain paid via late payment runs (0.8&nbsp;per cent. of all payments). However, since late payment runs are mainly in respect of non-system cases whose claim had not been received by Qualifying Week, they are heavily skewed towards men aged 60.<br>

<p><a name="40504w24.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The safety of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been closely monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Government&#039;s independent expert advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) since first authorisation.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 May 2004 : Column 1465W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w24.html_para0">
The CSM has considered the question of suicidal behaviour in association with adult use of SSRIs on a number of occasions and has advised that it is general clinical experience that patients taking any anti-depressant may develop an increase in suicidal behaviour in the first few weeks of treatment. Prescribers were informed of this advice in an article in the drug safety bulletin, &quot;Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance&quot;, in 2000 and advised that patients thought to be at risk should be monitored carefully, especially in the early stages of treatment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w24.html_para1">
Product information for patients for all SSRIs contains warnings that suicidal behaviour may increase in the early stages of treatment with any anti-depressant and that any patient who has suicidal thoughts should seek urgent medical attention.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w24.html_para2">
In December 2003, CSM advised that four SSRIs (paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) and the related anti-depressant, venlafaxine, should not be used in treating children and adolescents under 18 years with depressive illness because clinical trials had not demonstrated efficacy in this population and there was evidence of an increased risk of adverse effects, including suicidal behaviour and self-harm compared to placebo. The product information (summary of product characteristics and patient information leaflets) for these SSRIs contains appropriate warnings.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w24.html_para3">
A Europe-wide review of the safety of paroxetine led by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands was completed on 22&nbsp;April 2004. The European scientific advisory committee, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal products (CPMP) recommended that paroxetine should not be used in children and adolescents and that there should be careful monitoring during paroxetine treatment of patients at risk of suicidal behaviour, including those with a history of suicidal behaviour and young adults. The CPMP recommendations are now subject to consideration by the European Commission.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w24.html_para4">
The CSM&#039;s expert working group on the safety of SSRIs is continuing to review the available evidence relating to the safety of all SSRIs, with particular reference to behavioural disorders, including, suicidality to ensure that the advice in the product information is optimal for safe use of these medicines.

Funding for this work amounts to &#163;1,814,000 in 2003&#150;04 and &#163;2,127,000 for 2004&#150;05. Funding for the third year will be agreed in early 2005.

<a name="40504w26.html_para3">
Following the publication of the strategy document in September 2001, &quot;The Expert Patient: A new approach to chronic disease management for the 21st century&quot;, the Department has funded and supported a community based pilot, from April 2002 to 2004 for each primary care trust (PCT) to provide training for people in the self management of long term conditions. Nearly all 300 PCTs in England have piloted the &quot;Expert Patients&quot; programme and data at the end of the pilot in April 2004 showed that almost 10,000 people had taken part. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 May 2004 : Column 1474W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Funding has been allocated by the Department to support the mainstreaming of the programme across the national health service from 2004 to 2007.

<p><a name="40504w27.html_wqn0"><b> Dr. Tonge: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the link between Thimerosal in vaccines and autism.  [163554]</p>








<p><a name="40504w27.html_spnew0"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 As with all medicinal products, vaccine safety is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and its independent expert advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w27.html_para0">
The only vaccines currently used in the routine childhood immunisation programme that contain thiomersal (also known as thimerosal) are the combined diphtheria/tetanus/wholecell pertussis/Haemophilus influenzae type B and the diphtheria/tetanus vaccines. Measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine does not contain thiomersal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w27.html_para1">
The MHRA and CSM have thoroughly reviewed the safety of thiomersal-containing vaccines, including alleged links with autism, on a number of occasions. In 2001, CSM conducted a major review of the available evidence and has considered new data as it has emerged. Following a review of further studies in 2003, including two United Kingdom studies involving more than 100,000 children, CSM advice was placed on the MHRA website at http://medicines.mhra.gov.uk. Further studies from Denmark involving almost half a million children have also specifically investigated the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 May 2004 : Column 1475W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
suggested link between thiomersal-containing vaccines and autism. None of these studies found any evidence of a causal association.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40504w27.html_para2">
On the basis of the available data, the advice of CSM remains that there is no evidence of harm from thiomersal contained in vaccines, with the exception of possible hypersensitivity reactions (typically skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection). The CSM advises that the benefits of immunisation with such vaccines outweigh any potential risks of vaccination. This view concurs with that of the World Health Organisation.

<p><a name="40504w28.html_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Implementation and administration of the single farm payment scheme is the responsibility of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, in England, and the devolved administrations. Under general taxation principles, the tax treatment of any single farm payment to which an individual is entitled will depend upon the precise nature of the payment. However, from the information currently available, the Inland Revenue considers that the disposal of an entitlement to receive a single farm payment will normally be the disposal of a chargeable asset for capital gains tax purposes, and that the extinguishing of an entitlement to receive agricultural subsidies will also be a disposal for capital gains tax purposes.

<p class "tabletext">Technical issues such as hedonic methodology fall within the remit of the National Statistician.

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has examined the possible use of hedonic methods for a number of items in the RPI, but has made the decision to implement the method only in those cases where it represents a significant improvement in methodology. This was the case for personal computers and digital cameras, where hedonic methodology has been implemented. However, for other goods, such as televisions, DVD players, still cameras and washing machines, the method has not shown conclusively to be an improvement and so has not been implemented.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">In the future, ONS will continue to examine the use of hedonic methods on a case by case basis and intend to investigate their use for laptop computers and digital camcorders. We are not planning a blanket implementation of hedonic methods, but intend to use them only where they are proven to give a real improvement in methodology. This is likely to be mainly for high technology, fast-developing goods newly entering the RPI basket. Such goods are the most common subjects of hedonic methods in the consumer price indices of other developed countries.</p>

 All income taxpayers benefit from the 10 pence starting rate.

<p><a name="40504w30.html_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The inflation indices used to uprate social security benefits, tax allowances and debt interest payments are rounded to one decimal place prior to publication, and the impact of such a small reduction in inflation would depend on its effect on the recorded inflation index rounded to this level. Moreover, for social security benefits and some tax allowances the actual benefit and allowance levels are also affected by statutory rules on rounding. Therefore it is not possible to give accurate estimates for the effect of a 0.05&nbsp;per cent. reduction in the rate of inflation. It might not have any effect at all.

Families who had been receiving additional tax credit payments in 2003&#150;04 are receiving provisional payments in the usual way, so that there is no need for continuing additional payments to them.
