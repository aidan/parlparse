 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the Eurofighter.  [31907]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Eurofighter is a highly capable, multi-role aircraft, that will replace our Tornado F3s and Jaguars. We expect the RAF to take delivery of its first Eurofighter later this year. This four nation collaborative project is an excellent example of what can be achieved by European nations working together with a common purpose.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I regularly discuss missile defence and related issues with the United States Administration. The future of the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty is essentially a bilateral issue for the United States and Russia. We welcome the fact that they are continuing to work together to establish a new strategic framework based on openness and mutual trust.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 As at 1 January 2002, there was a shortfall of 6,059 personnel against the currently assessed in-year requirement for whole Army strength.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has regular discussions with his United States counterpart on a wide range of subjects of mutual interest. Recent discussions have not specifically addressed the joint command of military facilities.

<a name="20211w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 At the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency Bicester there are three sites (A, B and G) which are surplus to the long-term requirements of the agency and will no longer be required by them after 2004 or earlier. Current plans foresee the continued requirement for the remaining DSDA sites at Bicester.

<P>
23. <a name="20211w01.html_wqn6"><B> Ms Coffey: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps he is taking to improve morale and retention in the armed forces.  [31916]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 High morale, as well as being important in its own right, is a vital factor in retaining personnel, which in turn improves manning levels and helps to obtain the optimum return on investment in training. Our aim is to maintain excellent levels of retention and morale through policies that reflect the priorities of our people and their families. For example, we are implementing in full the outcome of the Armed Forces Pay Review, including the proposals for aircrew remuneration.
<P>

<a name="20211w01.html_para0">A key outcome of the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) was the "Policy for People" which addresses terms and conditions; pay and allowances; quality of training; family life; equality of opportunity and provision of better accommodation. All of these are being taken forward as part of all overarching personnel strategy that was introduced in April 2000 to place personnel issues at the centre of our policy making.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the future needs of the Royal Navy in order to sustain amphibious operations.  [31917]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Strategic Defence Review concluded that we should maintain strong and well balanced maritime forces including a full Commando brigade and specialist shipping.
<P>

<a name="20211w01.html_para1">The Royal Navy's new landing platform docks, Albion and Bulwark, are both due to enter service in 2003. We are also building four Bay Class Alternative Landing Ship Logistics (ALSLs), which will be operated by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. The ALSLs are substantially larger and more capable than the vessels they replace and on current plans will all have entered service by the end of 2005. In conjunction with the new landing platform docks and the helicopter landing platform, HMS Ocean, the ALSLs will bring a substantial increase in the UK's overall capability to conduct amphibious operations and contribute to increased global reach and flexibility.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the role of British forces in <i>(a)</i> Bosnia and <i>(b)</i> Kosovo.  [31918]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 UK forces continue to make a vital contribution to all of the tasks undertaken by SFOR and KFOR in building peace and stability in Bosnia and Kosovo. The UK currently contributes some 1,900 personnel to SFOR operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina as the co-ordinating nation in Multinational Division (South-West). As the framework nation of Multinational Brigade (Centre) in Kosovo, the UK currently contributes some 3,000 personnel to KFOR operations.

<P>
26. <a name="20211w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on progress on veterans' affairs.  [31919]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Since the announcement of the veterans' initiative and my appointment as Veterans Minister in March of last year, we have been working closely with representatives of the veterans' community to improve the services we offer them. As an early step, we transferred the War Pensions Agency to the Ministry of Defence to deliver a more coherent service to war pensioners. We are committed to maintaining the agency's programme of continuous improvement to the services it provides to its customers, recognised recently in the award of the UNISYS Management Today Excellence Award. In particular, we are working closely with interested veterans' organisations to identify areas where we can bring further improvements in service through closer co-operation with their own activities in support of veterans.
<P>

<a name="20211w01.html_para2">We have also recognised the concern of many veterans and of people more widely that the final resting places of our war dead should be properly respected. In particular, we have moved to address the desecration of maritime war graves by some divers. We have designated 16 wrecks in UK waters as controlled sites and five in international waters as protected places. All military vessels lost in the Falklands conflict will be designated. We have made clear that we will prosecute where we have jurisdiction and are pressing for greater international protection of such wrecks.
<P>

<a name="20211w01.html_para3">The objective of seeking improvements in the support offered to those who have left the services, through closer partnership with the veterans' organisations, has been a key theme of the work of the ministerial task force and the forum of veterans' representatives. There have been two meetings of the Veterans Forum and, as a result, nine working groups have been formed to give practical expression to the initiative's core themes of partnership, identify recognition and care. These working groups are looking at improvements in areas such as resettlement of the most vulnerable service-leavers, communication with veterans, and the educational material available in schools with regard to the achievements of our veterans. The working groups include representatives from the veterans' organisations, as well as from other interested Government 



<P>
<P><I>11 Feb 2002 : Column 4W</I><P>
Departments and the devolved Administrations. Initial meetings have been held to agree the objectives for each working group and they will report back to me on their progress in time to give an up-date to representatives of the veterans' community at the second Plenary Forum on 17 April 2002.
<P>

<a name="20211w01.html_para4">Subsequently, the Veterans Forum, which includes the executive of the Confederation of British Service and Ex-Service Organisations (COBSSEO) and senior officials from across government, is due to consider the progress of the working groups when it meets on 1 May 2002. The ministerial task force will then consider the way forward, taking account of the views expressed by the veterans community, at our meeting on 15 May and, in July, I will provide a progress report through the Defence Secretary to the Prime Minister.

<P>
27. <a name="20211w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Luff: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on recruitment to the Royal Navy.  [31920]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Recruitment to the Naval Service is satisfactory. We aim to recruit about 5,000 officers, ratings and Royal Marines this year and, although we still face challenges in the recruitment of engineers, submarine operator mechanics, chefs and some medical specialisations, we are within 5 per cent. of our target in most areas.
<P>

<a name="20211w01.html_para5">We continue to initiate spotlight campaigns in areas of high recruitment potential throughout the UK, with a particular interest in those districts where there is the potential to increase this representation of the ethnic minority population. Our initiatives include multi-media advertising campaigns such as the new cinema advert for the Royal Marines, and attendance at multi-cultural events and exhibitions, presentation and display teams. It is important that we attract the attention and interest of young people still in full-time education and our Royal Naval and Royal Marine display and presentation teams regularly tour the UK, visiting schools and colleges, attending careers fairs and conventions and promoting EU financial assistance schemes to sixth-formers and undergraduates.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w02.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 This Government are undertaking the largest programme of new warship building in this country for decades. In the last 20 months the Ministry of Defence has placed orders or announced its intention to place orders for 15 new warships. The Clyde has already benefited from this programme. BAE Systems Marine recently signed a contract, with the MOD, for the build of two new Alternative Landing Ships Logistics at the Govan yard on the Clyde, the Clyde shipyards of BAE Systems Marine will also benefit from the Ministry of Defence's planned extension of its commitment from three to six Type 45 Destroyers, the Build of which will be shared between BAE Systems Marine and Vosper Thornycroft with the first of class assembled and launched from the Scotstoun yard.
<P>

<a name="20211w02.html_para1">Our future plans include two new aircraft carriers; further Astute Class submarines and Type 45 Destroyers; the new surface combatant and a number of support vessels. It is expected that this programme of warship building will create or secure several thousand jobs in UK shipyards and their ancillary industries throughout this country. We fully expect shipyards on the Clyde to have opportunities to participate in future orders.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Physical Selection Standards (Recruits) (PSS(R)) system of testing potential recruits to the Army has been in place since 1998. It consists of a series of tests designed to assess the level of fitness of an individual related to the specific demands of a particular trade, irrespective of gender, and aims to predict the likely

<P><I>11 Feb 2002 : Column 6W</I><P>
chance of an individual successfully completing initial military training. The system is currently undergoing re-validation. The study reported in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine compared data associated with medical discharges among recruits trained under the policy in existence in 1997&#150;98 with data for those trained under the PSS(R) regime in 1998&#150;99. The results showed an increase in medical discharges of female recruits due to certain types of injury, such as stress fractures and back pain. Modifications have since been made to the selection and training process for new recruits and the position is being kept under constant review.

<P>
<a name="20211w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I have had a number of discussions with my United States counterpart about the situation in Afghanistan and related issues. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has a permanent presence at Camp X-ray at Guantanamo Bay. The three British prisoners have been seen by British officials and have made no complaints about their conditions or treatment.
<P>

<a name="20211w03.html_para0">The ICRC is also being allowed access to detainees in Afghanistan. However, our extremely limited consular capacity in Afghanistan and continuing security risks to our staff travelling outside Kabul place a practical limit on what we are able to achieve there.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what action he has taken to address the number of injuries sustained by women under Army training since the introduction of the gender-free policy.  [31477R]<P>

<P>
<a name="20211w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 This issue has been kept under close review since the introduction of "gender-free" physical testing in 1998. A number of changes have been made to both the selection and initial training process. In May 2000, a one and a half mile run was introduced at Recruit Selection Centres, to act as a "risk reducer" by identifying

<P><I>11 Feb 2002 : Column 9W</I><P>
those individuals who would be unlikely to be able to complete training. Remedial treatment and physiotherapy services at the Army Training Regiments have been expanded and doctors there have been given better training in sports medicine.
<P>

<a name="20211w03.html_para1">During 2001, a complete reprofiling of the common military syllabus for recruits at the Army Training Regiments (ATRs) was undertaken. The programming and physical development profile was reviewed and refined to provide a graduated curve of increasing physical intensity to minimise the risk of early traumatic injury. The programme is focused on the average 16 to 18-year-old physical fitness start state, and it is specifically designed to minimise lower limb traumas and soft tissue injuries in the first six weeks of training. Heart rate monitors have been introduced to optimise individual physical development profiles. Lower limb strength training and certain limitations on basic drill have been introduced. The changes were instituted in October 2001 and will be formally assessed in April 2002; first indications are that injury rates in the first nine weeks of training have fallen overall.

<a name="20211w03.html_para2">The Army Training and Recruiting Agency has continued to sponsor studies in injury prevention and management, remedial training, ergonomics and nutritional areas; currently there are 10 studies in progress, with the overall aim of reducing injuries and medical discharges during training, for both male and females recruits, to the lowest practicable levels while meeting standards and complying with legislation.

<a name="20211w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Two British soldiers, Corporal Michael Phillips and Rifleman James Coman sustained fatal injuries when the Army Land Rover in which they were travelling was involved in a road traffic accident during the late evening of 27 January. Two other soldiers travelling in the vehicle sustained relatively minor injuries. All four soldiers were admitted to the United

Nations hospital in Freetown but, sadly, Corporal Phillips and Rifleman Coman were pronounced dead on arrival. All the soldiers were from lst Battalion, Royal Green Jackets. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence and I extend our deep condolences to the families of the dead soldiers.
<P>

<a name="20211w04.html_para0">The accident occurred about 10 kilometres east of Waterloo near the Benguema Training Centre. The soldiers were on duty at the time. No other vehicle is believed to have been involved. The accident is being investigated by the Special Investigation Branch of the Royal Military Police. A Board of Inquiry is also to be convened.

 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2002]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave to the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) on 16 July 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 5W. We are re-addressing the options for the location of the 4th Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment and I will therefore write to both Members as soon as the position is clear. A copy of my letter will be placed in the Library of the House.

<a name="20211w04.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 10 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 961W, on the Warship Support Modernisation Project, whether an economic appraisal is being used to assess the value for money implication of the proposals; if value for money will be the overriding factor when he makes his decision; if the practice of comparing proposals on the basis of commercial implications is a new policy; and if he will make a statement.  [33368]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I confirm that an economic appraisal of the options has been carried out and that the decision on the way ahead will be made on the basis of best value for money. As part of that assessment, it is normal for all the implications of a decision, including the commercial implications, to be considered.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 10 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 961W, on the Warship Support Modernisation Project, if he will clarify what is meant by essential terms and conditions of service; whether it includes access to traditional shore-based benefits; and if he will make a statement.  [33371]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Royal Naval personnel involved in the partnering arrangements would remain Crown servants under their full current terms of service, without detriment to any applicable benefits. They would remain subject to the Naval Discipline Act and liable for operational duties, military training and other military tasks that may arise from time to time.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 10 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 961W, on the Warship Support Modernisation Project, what level of premium, on an annualised hours basis, the Warship Support Agency expects to pay the companies in return for the work undertaken by the naval personnel seconded to them; and if he will make a statement.  [33369]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Warship Support Agency would not pay any specific premium in respect of the naval service personnel annualised hours arrangements. The companies would pay for the hours at a rate commensurate with the local market rate.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w04.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 10 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 961W, on the Warship Support Modernisation Project, whether the normal process of post tender clarification includes the Warship Support Agency officials providing the sole bidder with details of the historical expenditure on contracts with other contractors; if the companies providing contract services were informed that this information had been provided to a third party; and if he will make a statement.

 It is normal for the nature of current outsourced work and composite historical spend to form part of the disclosure of information to bidders. Disclosure was under signed confidentiality agreements and the information was released in a manner that protects third party interests.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence to what extent RFA Wave Knight has been damaged in dry dock; what the estimated cost is of repairs; when she will enter service; and if he will make a statement.  [33190]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 RFA Wave Knight has recently sustained minor damage in two separate incidents while in a flooded dry dock at Inchgreen, Greenock preparing for Contractor's Sea Trials. On the first occasion, on 19 January 2002, the ship listed to starboard, sustaining minor damage to her paint work in the area of the bilge keel. On the second occasion, in the gales of 28 January, the stern of the vessel made contact with the dock wall, causing scratches to the paint work and minor damage to fittings caused by movement of a gangway.
<P>

<a name="20211w05.html_para0">The cost of repair has not yet been determined. An indemnity scheme exists, under the contract with the shipbuilder, and it is not expected that any costs borne by the defence budget will be significant.
<P>

<a name="20211w05.html_para1">Wave Knight's in-service date of summer 2002 is unlikely to be affected.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There are at present no indications that United Kingdom personnel serving in Afghanistan are exposed to a hazard from depleted uranium. It has not been used by coalition forces in recent operations. In the event that we assess that there is a risk of exposure that 



<P>
<P><I>11 Feb 2002 : Column 18W</I><P>
might be hazardous to health, guidance will be issued on measures to protect health, and if necessary we will introduce biological monitoring on a voluntary basis for individuals who are exposed to such a risk. Short-term monitoring of individuals' health is undertaken as a matter of course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 19 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 337W, on submarine officers, how long the training period for general naval duties is; and if he will make a statement.  [33858]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In my previous answer to the hon. Member, I explained that all Royal Navy officers undergo a period of general naval training prior to discipline- specific training.
<P>

<a name="20211w05.html_para2">Naval general training is undertaken at Britannia Royal Naval College Dartmouth over a period of 27 weeks and includes six weeks of initial sea training. It is followed by a four month period of common fleet training and specialist fleet training of between two and six months, depending on specialisation. Officers then proceed to the appropriate professional training for periods between three and 28 months, before commencing their first complement appointment on the Royal Navy's trained strength.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the deployment of <i>(a)</i> soldiers from the Ninth Special Chemical Weapons Unit of the Czech Republic to Kuwait over the next two months and <i>(b)</i> German chemical warfare specialists to the area at the request of the United States; whether the United Kingdom Government have responded to related requests from the US; what assessment he has made of the purpose of such requests; and if he will make a statement.  [34467]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the deployment of forces by our NATO allies overseas since this is a matter for the Governments of the nations concerned.
<P>

<a name="20211w05.html_para3">However, I can confirm that we have received no request from our US allies to make similar deployments to Kuwait. Any such request would be considered on its merits and in the light of available resources.

 Railtrack Group plc's interim report and accounts for the six months to 30 September 2001 reported an accounting pre-tax profit of &#163;292 million. Nevertheless, it is entirely possible for a company to make a profit and yet be unable to pay its debts. The evidence presented to, and accepted by, the High Court on 7 October showed that Railtrack plc was, or was likely to soon be, unable to pay its debts. It was open to Railtrack to oppose administration. They chose not to do so.

 "Rent to Mortgage" is one of a number of Government low-cost home ownership schemes available to a range of people, including public sector workers.
<P>

<a name="20211w07.html_para2">"Rent to Mortgage" allows qualifying tenants to purchase a share of their home, at a discount, with mortgage payments similar to the rent they are currently paying. The landlord retains a share in the property, but the purchaser can pay this off at a later date. Further information is contained in our free booklet "Your right to buy your home", which is available from local authorities or from my Department.
<P>

<a name="20211w07.html_para3">Our Starter Home initiative is helping around 4,600 key public sector workers, such as teachers, health workers and police, into home ownership in London. Most of these schemes involve equity loans or shared ownership.

If a decision cannot be made within this timescale, the applicant is advised of the reason. In this financial year, over 60 per cent. of medical applications have been completed within five weeks. Cases where eyesight tests are required will generally take longer than five weeks to complete because of the dependency on third parties to carry out the tests.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w08.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The list of authorities eligible for the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund has been determined by taking those authorities that are among the 50 most deprived on any of the six measures in the Indices of Deprivation 2000 (ID2000). On this basis 81 authorities are eligible. The Government also decided that there should be transitional arrangements for those authorities that were within the 50 most deprived areas on any of the four measures under the old Index of Local Deprivation, but are not in the list of 81 authorities that qualify using the ID2000. Due to this, a further seven local authority areas are eligible for the fund, making a total of 88 eligible authorities.
<P>

<a name="20211w08.html_para2">The sum to be allocated to each authority is based on a standard amount per head of population in those wards in the authority that are in the most deprived 10 per cent. of all wards nationally, with a minimum allocation of &#163;200,000 for any eligible authority in 2001&#150;02.

 Although local authorities borrow to fund specific projects, the outstanding debt is held and managed centrally within an authority.

 Transport 2010: The 10-year plan includes as one of the Department's Public Service Agreement targets doubling light rail patronage over the decade to 2010. Our assessment is that the funding included in the plan will enable provision of up to 25 new light rail lines in major cities around the country, providing each scheme satisfies the Department's appraisal and obtains the necessary powers.

 I required the Sussex Police Authority to report under section 43 of the Police Act 1996 on the events surrounding the shooting and the action taken by Sussex police to ensure that they have responded appropriately. I have now received that report. I am placing a copy in the Library. The report gives an account of the circumstances leading up to the shooting, the subsequent investigations, and the action which has been taken in Sussex to improve policing and to restore public confidence. Three officers are currently facing disciplinary proceedings in connection with the shooting. The Police Authority have informed me that they have not included any material which in their view could be prejudicial to the proceedings.

 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2002]:</i> There is no single set retirement age from the police service. All officers may retire upon completion of 30 years service or upon completion of 25 years service after the age of 50. Officers may continue to serve up to the age of 55, or until 60 for ranks above sergeant. Chief officers, or the Police Authority in the case of the chief officer, have discretion to extend the compulsory retirement age for any officer by up to five years.

<a name="20211w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 On 30 September Sussex police had 2,837 police officers. On 31 March 1997 the force had 3,085 officers. I understand that the former Chief Constable allowed police numbers to fall because he civilianised a substantial number of operational support jobs that could more effectively be undertaken by civilian support staff. The reduction was not in front-line officers.

 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2002]:</i> Under the 1996 Victim's Charter the police have responsibility for ensuring that victims are put in contact with the voluntary organisation Victim Support. Once a crime has been reported, the Victim's Charter outlines the standards of service that victims can expect to receive from the criminal justice agencies. The police are responsible for keeping victims informed of subsequent developments in the case, and the outcome of any court proceedings. Guidance about this was issued in Home Office Circular 55/1998.
<P>

<a name="20211w13.html_para0">The police are also required to conduct user satisfaction surveys on a range of service responses, including the quality of response to a report of a burglary or of a violent crime.

<a name="20211w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2002]:</i> Antisocial Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) are community- based civil orders, which can be applied for by the police or local authority, in consultation with each other against an individual or several individuals whose behaviour is antisocial. Applications are to the magistrates court acting in its civil capacity.
<P>

<a name="20211w13.html_para1">From 1 April 1999 to 31 May 2000 data on the number of ASBOs issued were collected by police force area. No information on applications refused is available for this period.
<P>

<a name="20211w13.html_para2">From 1 June 2000 official statistics on the number of ASBOs issued are based on quarterly returns from magistrates courts committees (MCCs) which from 1 April 2001 were all aligned with police force areas. These returns are not presently designed to give figures below MCC level. A review of these statistics identified an undercount and the Home Department therefore undertook an exercise with the police to obtain more reliable figures. As a result of this reconciliation exercise the total number of ASBOs issued within England and Wales up to the end of September 2001 was 466, 184 more than previously reported. The information available by police force area/magistrates courts committees is given in the table.

<P>
<a name="20211w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2002]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary recently announced important proposals to increase the effectiveness of antisocial behaviour orders, (ASBOs) which include extending the power to apply for ASBOs to the British Transport police and registered social landlords. We would very much encourage parish and town councils governing bodies of schools, and indeed all other bodies representing the community to work for the reduction of antisocial behaviour, but we believe that where an application for an ASBO may be appropriate they should continue to work through the police and/or the local authority.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answers of 18 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 232W and 28 June 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 120W, on police numbers, what proportion of the change in the number of police officers in the Metropolitan police area is attributable to the transfer of responsibility of policing some areas to the surrounding forces of Surrey, Hertfordshire and Essex in April 2000.  [29506]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The effects of the Metropolitan police boundary changes on 1 April 2000 were incorporated into the police funding formula and the overall transfer between the forces was in terms of financial resources, not of officers. Where data on police numbers are used in the formula, a notional transfer of 887 from the 



<P>
<P><I>11 Feb 2002 : Column 50W</I><P>
Metropolitan police to the three county forces was applied. Because it is for police authorities and Chief Constables to decide how resources are utilised, it is not appropriate to convert the notional transfer directly into a full-time equivalent strength for the Metropolitan police as a consequence of the changes.
<P>

<a name="20211w13.html_para3">Between 31 March 2000 and 31 March 2001 the strength of the Metropolitan police fell by 607, to 24,878. This will have been due to a combination of boundary change resources and the temporary secondments to Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey. By 30 September 2001, the numbers of officers in the Metropolitan police had increased to 25,374&#151;496 more than on 31 March 2000.

<P>
<a name="20211w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 requires that crime and disorder reduction strategies are kept under review to monitor their effectiveness. Proposals currently in the Police Reform Bill will require responsible authorities to publish such reviews on an annual basis. A performance template is currently under development to assist partnerships in assessing and monitoring progress. Crime reduction directors located in the Government offices in the regions and the National Assembly for Wales monitor the performance of the partnerships and the effectiveness of projects in their area under the crime reduction programme. In addition, annual recorded crime figures are published twice yearly at crime and disorder reduction partnerships' level. The crime reduction toolkits provide comprehensive web-based guidance dealing with the key areas of crime and criminality for partnerships and provide a problem- solving approach with details on research, evaluation and examples of good practice. The toolkits are available on http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/toolkits.

 This Government accept that children involved in prostitution need to be recognised primarily as victims of abuse and has issued guidance that emphasises this.
<P>

<a name="20211w14.html_para3">In May 2000, the Home Office, together with the Department of Health, issued guidance entitled "Safeguarding Children Involved in Prostitution". This guidance flowed from the original Association for Chief Police Officers (ACPO) guidelines on child prostitution, published in 1998. The guidance was drawn up in consultation with the Associations of Directors of Social Services and Chief Probation Officers, other Government Departments and other relevant agencies. It reflected both best practice and a multi- agency approach.
<P>

<a name="20211w14.html_para4">A key message of the guidance was that wherever possible criminal justice action should be pursued against those who abuse children through prostitution or seek to exploit them as prostitutes. It also gave guidance about how to support children and young people and help them to leave prostitution.

 The Government abhor the sexual abuse of children, whether in a commercial or domestic context, whether committed by British citizens in the United Kingdom or abroad or by visitors to the United Kingdom and other countries. Officials attended on my behalf the second World Congress on the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children held in Yokohama, Japan, in late December 2001. Reducing the incidence of sexual abuse of children is central to the aims of the congress.
<P>

<a name="20211w14.html_para5">Domestically, part two of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 provides the jurisdiction for the prosecution here of British residents or citizens who commit sex offences against children abroad. We have also implemented legislation introduced by the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 requiring sex offenders subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 (the register) to notify the police if they intend to travel abroad for a period of eight days or longer. In relevant cases, the police will share this information with the authorities in other countries.
<P>

<a name="20211w14.html_para6">The United Kingdom is one of the strongest supporters of the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) Convention 182, on the elimination of the worst forms of child labour, such as prostitution. In ratifying this instrument, the United Kingdom committed itself to assisting other members of the ILO through "enhanced international co-operation and/or assistance including support for social and economic development, poverty eradication programmes and universal education". This commitment is being taken forward through the work of the Department for International Development. We have also ratified the key international instruments such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, and the United Nations (UN) Slavery Convention. We are promoting their widest possible ratification and supporting their practical implementation to achieve real change.

<a name="20211w14.html_para7">We are supporting the Centre for Europe's Children to maintain the ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting) Child Welfare Initiative Resource Centre.

This involves a number of inter-linked interventions to raise awareness and prevent the trafficking of women and children, including those trafficked for sexual exploitation, and to withdraw women and children from labour exploitation and reintegrate them back into their own or new communities. And we are supporting non- governmental organisations (NGOs) working with tour operators to develop a code of practice for the travel industry to eliminate child sex tourism.
<P>

<a name="20211w14.html_para9">More details of the United Kingdom's extensive portfolio of action to tackle the sexual abuse of children can be found in our "National Plan for Safeguarding Children from Commercial Sexual Exploitation", which was published in September 2001.

<a name="20211w15.html_para0">No evaluation results for these particular schemes are yet available, but Home Office research and other evaluations show CCTV can be effective in reducing crime and helping the police detect crime and convict offenders.

 The normal retirement age for non-industrial staff is 60, and for industrial staff 65. However, the Home Office's age retirement policy has recently been reviewed and from 1 April 2002 non- industrial staff up to Grade six will have the option to remain beyond the age of 60 and to retire at any point between the ages of 60 and 65. A temporary relaxation to the normal retirement age of 60 is currently in force until 31 March 2002 for grades between Administrative Assistant and Executive Officer (including equivalent grades, except certain Prison Service specific grades). Staff at Higher Executive Officer and above can also apply for extensions of service subject to business needs.
<P>

<a name="20211w15.html_para3">A variation to this policy is applied in the Prison Service where pre "fresh-start" Prison Officers employed before 1987 retire at 55, and Operational Support Grades retire at 65. A formal review of age retirement policy is now taking place within the Prison Service.

 I understand from the Commissioner that staff absences accounted for the inability of police in Brixton to accept reports of minor crime over the telephone for the period concerned. A decision was made to use the available staff to ensure continuity of service in the Crime Management Unit. Leaving the Crime Management Unit inadequately staffed would have had a greater adverse effect on the investigation of crime. Throughout this period members of the public were able to report minor crime in writing or in person at police stations.

[34414]<P>

<P>
<a name="20211w19.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 This information is not held centrally in the Department of Trade and Industry and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Responsibility for the provision of mobile telephones for official purposes and for payment of the associated call charges was devolved to individual directorates, agencies and NDPBs at the end of March 1993. Since August 1997, the DTI has increasingly made use of the central Mobile Telecommunications contract managed by the Office for Government Commerce. Vodafone are the latest suppliers of this contract, which provides a call-off arrangement for DTI users at advantageous prices ensuring that the Department obtains good value for money.

 The Department entered into a contract for the provision of accounts with CSL Group Ltd., effective from 1 April 1995. The contract, which covered an initial period of five years, was extended for a further two years. The cost of services is in part dependent upon volume of transactions. The average cost is approximately &#163;2 million per annum.
<P>

<a name="20211w19.html_para1">The Department has also entered into a PFI agreement for the development of a new financial accounting system. Under the terms of the agreement, the costs of development (approx &#163;10 million) are recoverable over the (10-year) life of the system.

<a name="20211w20.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Women</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w20.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Minister for Women if she will make a statement on the benefits to the economy of flexible working for women.  [33981]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w20.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The economy needs a high rate of labour participation and both women and men want opportunities for productive paid employment. Flexible working is often the key to women's participation. Employers who adopt flexible working policies report that: staff are easier to attract and recruitment costs are less; skilled staff are retained and better returns are gained from training; staff turnover decreases; staff morale improves and absenteeism decreases; and changing market conditions are dealt with more effectively. In addition to the economic advantages the opportunity to work flexible hours can make a real difference to the lives of women, whether it is the woman or her partner who works flexibly; their families; and, their children.
<P>

<a name="20211w20.html_para2">Retention of staff is key to the stability of an organisation. The typical recruitment costs of replacing an individual have been estimated at &#163;3,900. And these costs do not take account of the investment made in training which is lost if skilled employees have to change jobs. Skills are lost to the economy, for example, when women take lower skilled jobs and less well paid jobs on return from maternity leave. A survey of parents carried out in 2000 found that 10 per cent. of non-employed mothers with dependent children under 16 said that the lack of flexible working opportunities was the main barrier to their finding employment. The continuing pay gap is an indicator of the skills lost to the economy: women's hourly earnings are 81.6 per cent. of men's earnings.
<P>

<a name="20211w20.html_para3">This is why the Government are looking to improve the opportunities to work flexible hours. The Government's Work-Life Balance campaign encourages all employers to introduce ways of working which meet the needs of the business and its customers while simultaneously improving the work-life balance of their employees. In addition, for working mothers and fathers who juggle their work responsibilities with caring for their children, the Government through their Employment Bill are introducing a right to apply to work flexibly for parents 



<P>
<P><I>11 Feb 2002 : Column 75W</I><P>
with children aged under six (or 18 for parents of disabled children). If the new right encourages the participation of just 5 per cent. of mothers alone who are currently economically inactive it will increase the labour supply of women by 55,000.

<P>
<a name="20211w20.html_wqn5"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Minister for Women when she last met ministerial colleagues in the Department of Health to discuss health issues relating to women.  [34015]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w20.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Ministers for Women, supported by the Women and Equality Unit, have worked closely with our colleagues in the Department of Health and Department for Education and Skills in the production of a report entitled "Better Services&#151;Better Working Lives" which was published in December 2001.
<P>

<a name="20211w20.html_para4">The report was published as part of the Government's drive to deliver first class public services that are accessible to everyone. Women are the key users of health and education services, whether accessing the services themselves or for their children, and they are also in the forefront of delivering these services. The report which is based on the experiences of women as deliverers and users of these services will help inform future policy- making.

To ask the Prime Minister what the objectives of his forthcoming visit to Africa are; and if he will make a statement.  [33781]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w20.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 I visited Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone and Senegal from 7&#150;10 February. I was accompanied by the Secretary of State for International Development and my noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
<P>

<a name="20211w20.html_para5">The main purpose of my visit was to discuss with African leaders how to take forward the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NePAD) and the G8 Action Plan for Africa. I had fruitful discussions with Presidents Obasanjo, Kufuor, Kabbah and Wade. In an address to the National Assembly in Nigeria I was able to set out the need for a true partnership of shared responsibility and mutual interest between the developed world and Africa. I focused on peace and conflict resolution, good government, trade, growth, health and education&#151;themes we were able to develop further during the visit. I also discussed with President Obasanjo the need for free and fair presidential elections in March in Zimbabwe.
<P>

<a name="20211w20.html_para6">I also addressed the National Parliament in Ghana and outlined the argument for a conception of aid as an investment in the future of Africa and the developed world. I visited the Ghana Armed Forces Staff College, where I met a number of African officers with experience of conflict resolution in Africa. At the Ghanaian Cocoa Research Institute in Tafo and at Suhun Co-operative I saw how Ghanaian farmers are seeking to improve cocoa production and increase the value they can add to their raw product in Ghana and discussed with them the consequences of globalisation.




<P>
<P><I>11 Feb 2002 : Column 76W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20211w20.html_para7">In Sierra Leone I saw the real and beneficial impact the UK's commitment to conflict resolution has had and how peace has been restored to a country whose democracy and stability were threatened by armed rebels. It was heartening to see the preparations for democratic elections this May. There is a long way to go, but the healing process is under way in Sierra Leone, in large part thanks to the role played by British and United Nations forces.
<P>

<a name="20211w20.html_para8">In Senegal I attended a seminar hosted by President Wade on the conditions necessary to achieve growth in Africa, with President Kufuor, Vice President Zuma of South Africa, and a number of experts on regional integration President Chirac's personal representative on Africa also participated. On Sunday I visited Ouakam Centre near Dakar for people infected with HIV. HIV/AIDS is having a devastating effect in Africa. But Senegal, which has succeeded in keeping prevalence low, is a beacon of hope. I expressed our continued support for the Global Health Fund.
<P>

<a name="20211w20.html_para9">This visit, as well as being an important expression of UK commitment to Africa, was important in deepening the dialogue with African leaders in the run-up to June's G8 Summit to be held in Canada where the partnership between the developed world and Africa would be a key issue.

The surveyor also recommends the appropriate insulation and heating measures to be installed. The advice centres use EAGA's publicity materials to promote the scheme. EAGA is working to further strengthen its partnership links with EEACs to assist in the delivery of the scheme.
<P>

<a name="20211w22.html_para5">HEES installers are appointed by the scheme managers through open competition following UK Public Procurement Rules and Regulations. Appointments are made on the basis of ability to meet the technical and quality requirements of the scheme and the price tendered. Installers' catchment areas may include areas covered by The Warm Zones pilot initiatives. A number of installers work with EAGA in these areas to refer potential clients to the scheme and are required to follow a code of practice on customer care.

<a name="20211w23.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Breed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to her answer of 22 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 781W, if the improved ELISA test was used to diagnose those animals slaughtered after the last case of foot and mouth; and if she will make a statement.  [35268]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w23.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The improved ELISA test was used as a screening test in the extensive serological testing programme that took place. Sera which gave positive ELISA tests were subject to a virus neutralisation test before any decision to cull animals was taken.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w23.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when MAFF <i>(a)</i> started and <i>(b)</i> concluded its investigation into whether pigs identified as suffering from foot and mouth disease on 19 February 2001 had been fed on illegally imported meat; and what their conclusion was.  [33712]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w23.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 February 2002]:</i> The State Veterinary Service started an epidemiological inquiry into the origins of the foot and mouth outbreak immediately the first case was confirmed. These investigations are still ongoing. There are related criminal proceedings currently under way and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w23.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Peter Duncan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what moneys are outstanding to Dumfries and Galloway council in respect of that region's foot and mouth disease containment activities in 2001.  [34437]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w23.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 February 2002]:</i> The Department has already paid the bulk of Dumfries and Galloway council's claim in respect of their disease control costs incurred during the foot and mouth outbreak. On 24 January 2002, my officials met with representatives of the council and SEERAD officials to resolve a number of outstanding issues relating to their claim. Agreement was reached on the payment process for the remaining &#163;2,183,428.09. This should be paid in the next few weeks.
<P>

<a name="20211w23.html_para1">A claim for damages to roads has been submitted by the council and is being considered by the Department.

<P>
<a name="20211w24.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Breed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the <i>(a)</i> farmgate and <i>(b)</i> market price was of (i) sheep, (ii) pigs, (iii) beef cattle, (iv) dairy cattle, (v) broiler chickens, (vi) free range chickens, (vii) sugar beet and (viii) cereals in each year since 1990.  [34868]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w24.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The following tables show the farm gate output values, variable production costs, gross margins, fixed production costs and net margins for lowland sheep, pigs, beef cattle, dairy cattle, cereals and sugar beet for those years since 1990 for which data are available. These data are based on results from DEFRA commissioned surveys into the economics of farm enterprises. Data for broiler chickens and free range chickens are not available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to set targets to reduce the number of residential properties not connected to mains sewerage.  [32264]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 February 2002]:</i> It would not be practicable to set targets as it is largely a matter between householders and sewerage undertakers which has to be considered on a case-by-case basis. If their existing non mains drainage system is causing an environmental or amenity problem, householders can apply to the sewerage undertaker to provide mains sewerage, the cost of which would be met by customers generally if the specified criteria are met. Alternatively, a householder not on mains sewerage can requisition a sewer from the sewerage undertaker with the householder meeting the cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 February 2002]:</i> Ofwat does not collect information on how many residential properties in each region are connected to mains sewerage each year. It collects estimates from sewerage companies each year of the number of households served by those companies. Estimates for the year 2001&#150;02 are published by Ofwat in "Tariff structure and charges 2001&#150;02 report". Copies are in the Library. The figures for 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 are as follows.

 Badgers and their setts are protected under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992. For the purposes of preventing serious damage to property there is provision within the legislation for action to be taken under a licence from the Department. This is assessed on a case-by-case basis. Where relocation is the only feasible option the Department provides technical advice.

 The Government's policy is to increase participation so that by the end of the decade, 50 per cent. of 18 to 30 year olds have the opportunity to experience higher education. As part of this objective, the Government intend to widen participation to those groups traditionally under-represented in higher education. We have taken a number of steps to support our policy. They include the Excellence Challenge programme, targeted at raising the aspirations of young people from our cities, educational maintenance allowances introduced in pilot areas to encourage greater staying-on and attainment rates post-16; policy to raise levels at 16 and 18, by driving up standards in secondary schools; the Connexions Service, to ensure that young people get the advice and support they need to achieve; and new qualifications in school, college and university to expand choices of study.

 <i>[holding answer 1 February 2002]:</i> The starting point for assessment of student support is the parents' gross taxable income. This is reduced by certain allowances, largely pension contributions that qualify for tax relief, to produce a residual income. In the case of divorced or separated parents, local education authorities will normally base the assessment on the parent's residual income with whom the student lives.

<P>

<a name="20211w26.html_para6">A student with the same circumstances but whose parents are married and have a combined residual income of &#163;40,000 would be liable to meet the full cost of tuition fees of &#163;1,075 but would be eligible to receive a student loan of &#163;2,860.

<a name="20211w28.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills on what date her Department received notification from Surrey police of their concerns about Miss Amy Gehring; what action was taken to consider her inclusion on list 99 before the conclusion of recent criminal proceedings; and when Ministers were informed of the communication from Surrey police.  [35222]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w28.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Department received a letter on 20 November 2000 from Surrey police which contained factual information about allegations made against Miss Gehring, and stated that no further police action would be taken. The letter did not express concern about the risk that Miss Gehring might pose to children. By this time Timeplan had already placed Miss Gehring in the school where more alleged assaults took place, having failed to inform the LEA, DfES or the school of a Surrey child protection unit warning that she was a serious risk to children. After receiving information from the police my officials initiated their list 99 procedures, making a criminal background check and writing to Timeplan seeking copies of all the documents relating to the case. On 8 January 2001 my officials were informed by Surrey police that Miss Gehring's conduct was the subject of a fresh police investigation and they followed our normal practice of suspending further inquiries until documents, witness statements and other evidence from the police investigation and trial became available. Ministers were informed of the initial letter from Surrey police on 24 January 2002.

National and regional press releases were issued to highlight the winter fuel payment campaign to the press.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Figures to 2000&#150;01 relate to contracts awarded by the ex-Department of Social Security.<P>

2. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC)&#151;was formed on 1 July 1998 as the result of a merger of the Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand organisations. PWC spend for the 1997&#150;98 was split with Price Waterhouse accounting for just over &#163;1 million and Coopers & Lybrand, &#163;685,000. Figures from 1 September 2000 may not show the full value of DSS/DWP business to PWC as payment for any work it has done, via its membership of the EDS-led Affinity consortium under the ACCORD contract, is made direct to EDS. Of the total shown so far for 2001&#150;02, &#163;54,000 is in respect of work done for the Employment Service part of DWP and &#163;268,000 for the former DSS part.<P>

3. Ernst & Young/CGEY&#151;The consulting arm of Ernst & Young was purchased by Cap Gemini in 2000 to form Cap Gemini Ernst & Young (CGEY). The figure for 2000&#150;01 is made up of &#163;620,000 paid to Ernst & Young and &#163;357,000 to CGEY. All of the 2001&#150;02 spend is with CGEY, &#163;63,000 of this being in respect of work for the former ES part of DWP and &#163;911,000 with the ex-DSS part.<P>

4. Andersen Consulting&#151;The figures in the table relate to Andersen Consulting&#151;rather than its former sister organisation within Andersen Worldwide, Arthur Andersen (AA). Andersen Consulting split from the Andersen Worldwide organisation in 1999 and has been known as Accenture since January 2000. The figures shown for 1997&#150;8 to 1999&#150;2000 largely reflect business which moved to Inland Revenue with the transfer of the Contributions Agency in April 2000. <P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has asked me to respond to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what steps he is taking to improve standards of decision making at the Benefits Agency (BA) in response to the President of the Appeals Service Report on Standards of Decision Making by the Secretary of State 2000&#150;01.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The BA Board receives regular reports on Decision Making and Appeals standards at its monthly meeting and monitors the situation closely. The President's quarterly reports are seen by the BA Standards Committee who consider the Judge's observations when framing recommendations for BA Board for future improvement activities. In addition the BA has reviewed its procedures and has introduced measures to more closely align the consideration of the President's conclusions alongside its processes for handling recommendations from other groups, such as Internal Audit.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Early evaluation following the introduction of Decision Making and Appeals, and research undertaken by the Standards Committee, confirmed the need to review the training available to support Decision Makers. Refresher training on Decision Making and Appeals principles has therefore been delivered and Training Services have re-designed two of their packages to support staff, Appeals presentation and Appeals preparation. Both packages reinforce the need to reconsider a decision where new evidence has come to light or errors have been found. The training builds on products developed locally by trainers and has undergone extensive quality assurance by a range of key stakeholders and is one of a series of products designed to support Decision Makers in the BA. The resulting new products were distributed to delivery staff in October; others are planned for introduction later in the year.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An internal review covering the quality of decision making, guidance and training available following the introduction of these measures is currently underway. The BA Board will consider any further recommendations for improvement as a result of the review.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In conclusion, many decision errors are purely procedural and do not effect the correct level of payment being made to the customer. However, the BA takes all decision making errors seriously and is taking positive action to address the issues raised.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the creation of a Commonwealth Education Fund; who will be in charge of it; and whether the &#163;10 million funding will be for 2002 only.  [34761]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Under Clare Short's leadership, DFID have committed over &#163;600 million since 1997 to achieving universal primary education. The Commonwealth Education Fund will complement this effort by supporting civil society to help Commonwealth Governments to ensure that the poorest and most marginalised children are able to enrol in and complete good quality primary education. The fund will support innovative ways of working with the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children (including street children, former child soldiers and nomadic children). It will also help promote public participation in education planning and delivery in the Commonwealth.
<P>

<a name="20211w32.html_para2">The Government have pledged an initial &#163;10 million to kick-start the fund. They will also match contributions by business, pound for pound including tax relief. Money raised by this year's Comic Relief "Sports Day" earmarked for education in Commonwealth countries will also be matched pound for pound, including tax relief, by the Government.
<P>

<a name="20211w32.html_para3">Work in preparing the details of the Commonwealth Education Fund is on-going and we hope to make a further announcement on 26 February.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make it his policy to promote a bankruptcy process for nations burdened with unpayable debts.  [34760]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20211w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Over the past three years, the Government have been working with our G7 partners to reform the international financial architecture and to deliver an international financial system that is less prone to crises and better able to withstand them when they occur. A key component of this reform effort has been the development of a new framework for private sector involvement in crisis prevention and resolution which ensures that all parties who benefit form the international financial system play their part in maintaining stability.




<P>
<P><I>11 Feb 2002 : Column 119W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20211w32.html_para4">Recent experience has highlighted some of the legal and practical obstacles that may prevent countries with unsustainable private debt burdens from restructuring those debts in a timely and orderly manner. An international bankruptcy procedure has the potential to address some of these obstacles and thereby improve the overall operability of the crisis resolution framework. The Government therefore welcome the recent proposal by the IMF to explore options for establishing a new Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism.
<P>

<a name="20211w32.html_para5">Separately, the UK continues to work hard to ensure that the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative delivers a sustainable relief from debt for eligible countries. We also call on other countries to follow our leads on bilateral policies, such as 100 per cent. relief at Decision Point, and in holding payments in trust for those countries yet to receive debt relief. Already 24 countries have qualified for debt relief, and they will benefit from over $56 billion in debt reduction, which will bring their debts to below the average of developing countries.

In addition, on 26 November last year, the National AIDS Trust, funded by the Department, launched a new pilot campaign, "Are You HIV Prejudiced?", aimed at raising awareness of HIV and AIDS and the negative effect of stigma and discrimination which can act as a barrier to people accessing testing and treatment and care services. The first ever national sexual health and HIV strategy highlighted the importance of reducing stigma associated with HIV. We are currently considering responses to the extensive consultation on the strategy, including replies specifically on addressing stigma.

 <i>[holding answer 19 December 2002]:</i> The National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Bill currently before Parliament will devolve responsibility for developing a local health improvement and modernisation plan to local primary care trusts. They will also receive a statutory duty to work in partnership with local authorities to assess local care needs and ensure the delivery of appropriate services. PCTs will also be responsible for improving the health status of the local population; including working in partnership with local authorities to address issues such as homelessness.
<P>

<a name="20211w34.html_para1">The Rough Sleepers Unit published a good practice handbook, "Preventing Tomorrow's Rough Sleepers", in 2001. This contains examples of action that can be taken by various service providers, including health practitioners and social services, to prevent people from becoming homeless. The Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions will also publish guidance to local authorities on developing homelessness strategies with local partners including health service providers.

 The Department does not manage any schemes specifically targeting urban regeneration.

Specifically there are 26 health action zones set up in 1998 and 1999 to tackle health inequalities. They have been taking forward a range of activity that impacts on the determinants of health through their programmes which have included action in areas such as housing, education, crime, employment and transport, and working with ex-drug users.

 The most recent health survey for England, in 1999, showed that one in five adults suffers from obesity. The National Audit Office report: Tackling Obesity in England, published in February 2001, provides a comprehensive assessment on the levels of obesity in England. It found that obesity had nearly trebled in the last 20 years, and is responsible for 9,000 deaths each year, before the age of retirement. It also states that obesity is a risk factor for heart disease, cancer, stroke and type 2 diabetes. The most likely causes of obesity are identified as an increasingly sedentary lifestyle combined with changes in eating patterns.
<P>

<a name="20211w36.html_para6">Obesity is a complex condition, but is largely preventable through addressing diet and physical activity. We have therefore put in place major cross-Government programmes of work to address these factors. The NHS Plan, Cancer Plan and National Service Frameworks all prioritise action to improve diet and increase physical activity.

<a name="20211w36.html_para7">Also the National Service Framework for Diabetes, published in December 2001, recognises obesity as a modifiable risk factor for type 2 diabetes and that it will need to be the focus of prevention strategies for diabetes.

 The available information is based on figures published in the third annual report of the United Kingdom Renal Registry, copies of which are available in the Library. In 1998 there were 516 patients in England using a haemodialysis machine at home. In addition, it is estimated that 1,150 adult patients and 83 children were using home automated cycling machines for peritoneal dialysis. Information for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales is a matter for the devolved administrations. Equivalent information is not available at health authority level.

 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2002]:</i> The performance against waiting list targets by the Royal Devon and Exeter healthcare national health service trust will be one of a number of criteria used to assess the trust in the annual performance ratings. There are no financial penalties if the trust does not reach key targets on waiting times; however, the trust's performance rating will determine how the trust can use additional monies from the performance fund. The best performing trusts gain additional freedoms in recognition of their success.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the waiting list was for infertility treatment, broken down by health authority; how much each health authority spent on infertility treatment in each year since 1997; what action will be taken to address the differences according to area in infertility treatment; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>

 The information requested on the waiting list and the amounts spent by health authorities is not available centrally. The Department undertook a baseline survey of infertility provision in the national health service in 1999. A report on this "Survey of NHS Infertility Services 1997&#150;98" has been published and copies are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20211w36.html_para10">We have listened carefully to the representations we have received from couples seeking infertility treatment, and from hon. Members and interested bodies working in the field. We have asked the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to consider and update the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' existing guidelines on the management of infertility treatment in order to ensure that clinical guidance based on the latest knowledge and best practice are available for use throughout the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20211w36.html_para11">We want to see an improved service and greater efficiency for the benefit of all patients. We see the referral of these guidelines to NICE as a major step forward in infertility treatment by which we can act positively to improve services and reduce the postcode lottery in this area of health care.

 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2002]:</i> It will be for the National Care Standards Commission to decide in the particular circumstances of each individual home whether the home conforms to the standards necessary to meet the assessed needs of its residents. The standards were extensively consulted on and the Department has no evidence to suggest that large numbers of care homes will be unable to meet them. The Commission will form a more detailed picture of care homes' compliance with the national standards as it completes its first cycle of inspections of providers in England during 2002&#150;03.

 We have received advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathies Advisory Committee that a key factor in reducing the risk of person-to-person spread of vCJD during surgery is a high standard of decontamination of surgical instruments. This is confirmed by the Risk Assessment that we published on 16 March 2001.
