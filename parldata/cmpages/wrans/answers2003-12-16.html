 Section 4(3) of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 provides that the council of a county, district, London borough or the Common Council of the City of London may institute proceedings for offences under section 35A of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (contravention of an order as to the use of a parking place). It is an established legal principle that a power delegated to one body may not be further delegated in the absence of express provision or necessary implication. This does not, however, prevent a local authority lawfully exercising its prosecution functions under section 4(3) with the assistance of service providers. In any given case, it is for the local authority to ensure that any arrangements it makes with a service provider are lawful and in accordance with its statutory functions.

 Her Majesty's Government continue to fully implement EU measures against Zimbabwe. These comprise an arms embargo, including for equipment that might be used for internal repression, and an assets freeze and travel ban on President Mugabe and 78 of his associates.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31216w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The UK maintains diplomatic relations with Zimbabwe. Following the Commonwealth decision to maintain Zimbabwe's suspension, some of Mugabe's supporters have called for the breaking of diplomatic relations with the UK and the expulsion of the British High Commission. This would only serve to damage further Zimbabwe's reputation and the Zimbabwean people.

 <i>[holding answer on 15 December 2003]</i>: Government rules governing the acceptance of foreign awards by British Nationals preclude the acceptance of medals for services more than five years before consideration. In addition, the Defence of the Soviet Arctic Region Medal (DSARM) is a campaign medal and it was agreed at the end of the Second World War, by the then allied countries, not to exchange campaign medals.

 A number of countries including Burma, France, Germany and ASEAN members met on 15 December in Bangkok at the invitation of the Thai Government. We understand that Burma objected to Britain attending because we were strongly critical of the regime. The aim of the meeting was to see if there was a realistic prospect of a roadmap toward democracy and reconciliation.
<P>

<a name="31216w02.html_para2">We have regularly discussed Burma with our international partners, including what possible further measures we may take if the regime continues to thwart the democratic rights of the Burmese people. I hope to meet Thai Foreign Minister Surakiart Sathirathai on 18 December to discuss the 15 December meeting and how we can take matters forward. We will also continue to work with our EU partners through the UN, ILO and other international fora to put pressure on the Burmese regime to fully release Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy colleagues and, together with the ethnic groups, begin a genuine dialogue leading to democratic change and national reconciliation.

 We do not expect the references to "territorial cohesion" to have any impact on existing arrangements for the structural funds and regional aid.

The UK is in a strong position relative to other countries to face the challenges ahead.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31216w03.html_spnew11"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The planning for the ASPIRE project began in January 2001. John Yard, the Inland Revenue's Director of Business Services, took responsibility for this planning.

<P>
<a name="31216w03.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the purpose was of the market making exercise run by Inland Revenue as part of Project ASPIRE; what objectives were set to judge its success; and whether these objectives were achieved.  [144693]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31216w03.html_spnew12"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Competitions are generally accepted as the best way to deliver value for money. The market-making exercise was designed to encourage the major IT industry players to enter the ASPIRE competition. This objective was achieved and the competition has been genuinely tough and fair. In a written statement to the House on 11 December 2003 (column 107WS) I announced that the result of the competition was that Cap Gemini Ernst and Young had been named as the Inland Revenue's preferred supplier for the ASPIRE contract replacing the incumbent suppliers EDS and Accenture.

<P>
<a name="31216w03.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the potential suppliers who engaged in the market making exercise in support of project ASPIRE were made aware by Inland Revenue at the outset of the exercise of the identities of the other potential suppliers; whether the methodology adopted by Inland Revenue for the market making exercise provided for discussions 



<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 2003 : Column 804W</I><P>
between Inland Revenue and each of the potential suppliers engaging in the market making exercise; and whether the potential suppliers who responded to the Official Journal of the European Communities Notice placed by Inland Revenue with regard to Project ASPIRE were required in their submissions to provide indicative pricing information.  [144694]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31216w03.html_spnew13"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 I cannot comment on whether the potential suppliers who engaged in the market making exercise were aware of the identities of the other potential suppliers. However, there were ongoing discussions between the Department and potential suppliers, at their request, throughout the market-making exercise. In addition, as I stated in my reply of 18 September, an open meeting was held for all interested suppliers on 7 March 2002, which was attended by 42 potential suppliers. The potential suppliers were not required to provide indicative pricing information in their response to the Official Journal of the European Communities notice that was placed by the Inland Revenue.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the Inland Revenue and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise inform other Government Departments when a potential supplier has poor compliance in tax affairs.  [143885]

<P>
<a name="31216w05.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 HM Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue only inform other Government Departments when a potential supplier has poor compliance in tax affairs in very exceptional circumstances. Such disclosures will only be made where statute permits, or otherwise, is justifiable on public interest grounds and will be confined to a general description of the potential supplier's compliance status and will not contain any detail.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what steps have been taken to ensure that high income earners pay the 40 per cent. income tax rate and not the standard one on the basis that a company is being run by them; and if he will make a statement.  [144649]<P>

<P>
<a name="31216w05.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to the statement made in this House on 10 December 2003 by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and to paragraph 5.91 of the Pre-Budget Report published the same day.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31216w05.html_wqn2"><B> David Winnick: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many individuals in the last three tax years were informed by the Inland Revenue that, though claiming to be eligible to pay the standard income tax rate because of running a company, the amount they would have to pay was 40 per cent.; and if he will make a statement.  [144651]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31216w05.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 None. There is no direct correlation between the amount of income tax an individual would pay on profits if self employed and the amount of income tax payable on salary and dividends received from a limited company.

 The market has responded to concerns about a possible shortfall by returning plant to service so that margins are at a similar level to the mid 1990s. However no system can be guaranteed and in the event of a possible power shortage there are a number of steps that NGT could take in order to maintain supplies and avoid rota cuts.

<a name="31216w05.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 This aspect of the Employment Directive is implemented by the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003. The regulations define "religion or belief" as "any religion, religious belief, or similar philosophical belief". It will be for the courts and tribunals to determine, in accordance with the Directive's requirements, whether a religion or belief falls within this definition. However, guidance to help employers put the new legislation into effect is available from Acas, and on the website acas.org.uk. In addition the Acas national helpline (08457 47 47 47) is able to offer advice on employment related issues.
<P>

<a name="31216w05.html_para3">The reference to "religion" includes religions such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Rastafarianism, Baha'is, Zoroastrians and Jains. Branches or sects within a religion can be considered as a religion or religious belief, such as Catholics or Protestants within the Christian church.
<P>

<a name="31216w05.html_para4">The reference to "similar philosophical belief" includes philosophical belief which is similar to a religious belief in that it is a profound belief affecting a person's way of life, or perception of the world. The belief should occupy a place in the person's life parallel to that filled by the God or Gods of those holding a particular religious belief.

 The 2001 Government White Paper "Managing the Nuclear Legacy&#151;a strategy for action" stated that THORP and the Sellafield MOX plant at Sellafield would pass to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority when it is established in April 2005. For this reason it was not appropriate for them to be considered as part of the review.

 UK steel exports to the US fell by 14 per cent. in 2002 compared with the figure for 2001.

At the point when the safeguard was lifted, 74 per cent. of UK steel exports to the US were free of safeguard tariffs. The Government also supported the EU steel safeguard, which prevented any surge into the EU of steel from third countries diverted from the US market.

 This Department does not collect data on feed usage and composition from the limited number of enterprises engaged in cod farming in the UK. However, we estimate that between 1.2kg and 1.4kg of feed is needed to produce 1kg of farmed cod of a marketable size.
<P>

<a name="31216w08.html_para1">We do not have information on the weight of the raw marine resource used in feed for farmed cod. The quantity involved will vary depending on the proportion of fishmeal used in the different grades of dry fish feed produced for cod at various stages of growth. Cod, like other farmed piscivorous species are unlikely to consume more natural marine resources through feed than their wild counterparts would consume in the natural environment.
<P>

I will be making an announcement early in the New Year on the results of consultation on the UK strategy following discussion with the Devolved Administrations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on trends in populations of invertebrates in the River Nene following the pollution incident earlier this year; what evidence is publicly available of population levels; what evidence she has collated on whether species that are restricted to the affected section of the river are now extinct; whether there has been a survey for the Red Data Book of the riffle beetle <i>Stenelimis canaliculata</i>; whether a survey is planned; and what plans the Environment Agency has to repair damage to biodiversity as a result of the incident.

<P>
<a name="31216w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The results of the routine biological monitoring of the River Nene in spring 2003 showed that biological water quality at Cogenhoe (NGR SP 831 615) (mid reaches of the River Nene) and sites as far downstream as Orton Staunch (NGR TL 167 973) were uncharacteristically poor. In particular, there was a general absence of water hog louse, mayflies and freshwater shrimp, normally commonly occurring freshwater invertebrate species in the River Nene. In contrast, the invertebrate community at Duston Mill (NGR SP 730 597), the routine monitoring site further upstream of Cogenhoe, suggested good water quality with these taxa found in abundance.
<P>

<a name="31216w08.html_para8">Results of a survey undertaken in September 2003 from sites along the River Nene show that biological water quality at Billing Road Bridge and Cogenhoe (mid reaches of the River Nene) is improving (although water hog louse and freshwater shrimp is still absent). In contrast, the invertebrate community at sites in the lower reaches of the River Nene has largely recovered, and these sites achieved their water quality target rating.
<P>

<a name="31216w08.html_para9">Recently an additional survey has been undertaken at the same sites. Although sample processing is not yet completed, initial observations suggest that mid reaches of the River Nene are still impacted by the pollution incident that occurred earlier in the year. Of particular concern is the continuing absence of water hog louse and freshwater shrimp.
<P>

<a name="31216w08.html_para10">The Environment Agency undertakes routine freshwater invertebrate surveys in spring and autumn seasons each year at specific sites along the River Nene. This information is available to members of the public upon application to the Environment Agency Customer Services Department in Lincoln (Tel. 01522 513100). Additional surveying of the River Nene and Hardingstone Dyke was undertaken to locate the source of the pollution. Data arising from these surveys is not currently available pending the outcome of the Environment Agency Special Enforcement team review of this case. Monitoring undertaken to record recovery of the River Nene and Hardingstone Dyke, is also available to members of the public, on application to the customer services department.

<a name="31216w08.html_para11">Surveys have been undertaken at three-monthly intervals at important sites along the River Nene using standard methods which sample the accessible margins of the watercourse using a pond net. Key species (water hog louse and freshwater shrimp) which were absent at sites along the mid reaches of the River Nene remain absent. The Red Data Book riffle beetle <i>Stenelimis canaliculata</i> was not found in any samples taken in 2003, although it has been recorded very infrequently in the lower reaches of the River Nene in the past. It is difficult to say whether its absence is related to the pollution incident, as it is a deep-water species and unlikely to be sampled using Environment Agency standard methodology.
<P>

<a name="31216w08.html_para12">The Environment Agency have not carried out a specific survey for the Red Data Book riffle beetle <i>Stenelimis canaliculata</i> and have no plans to conduct such a survey. To do so would disturb the habitat, which could be damaging to this and other deep water species.

<a name="31216w08.html_para14">Fish were not affected directly by the pollution incident, so fish re-stocking is not necessary. However, the longer term health of fish populations in the mid reaches of the River Nene may be affected because their food source remains depleted.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the impact of the pollution incident on the River Nene earlier in the year was on the invertebrate populations of Morton's Leam Special Area of Conservation; and whether the site has favourable conservation status.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31216w08.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Environment Agency monitoring of the Morton's Leam SAC shows no impact of this pollution incident on the Morton's Leam, which was surveyed in July 2003. The results showed a diverse and abundant invertebrate community and the biological data suggested excellent water quality. The key species impacted by the pollution on the River Nene, water hog louse (<i>Asellus aquaticus</i>) and freshwater shrimp (in this instance, <i>Crangonyx pseudogracilis</i>) were abundant in Morton's Leam. The results compare favourably with earlier surveys, which date back to 1985.

<P>
<a name="31216w08.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The River Nene normally supports an invertebrate community consistent with that type of river. Reductions in invertebrate biodiversity occurred after the 2003 pollution incident at sites as far downstream as Orton Staunch, near Peterborough. Components of the invertebrate community remain absent at some impacted sites.

<P>
<a name="31216w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 A restrictive licensing scheme for shellfish (crabs and lobsters) will take effect from 1 January 2004 for vessels over 10 metres and from 1 April 2004 for vessels under 10 metres. Shellfish entitlements are being granted to existing fishing vessels which, with their current licences, have taken more than 200 kg of lobsters or 750 kg of crabs in any 12 month period between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002. The scheme will apply to vessels under eight metres which will account for more than 40 per cent. of the vessels qualifying under the scheme. Anyone wishing to take up shellfishing will need to acquire an appropriate fishing vessel licence carrying a shellfish entitlement from an existing vessel. Licensed fishing vessels without a shellfish entitlement will be permitted to land up to five lobsters and 25 crabs per day.

The government, with the help of ISAF and the international coalition forces has taken measures to ensure security of the teams carrying out the registrations. Voter intimidation however, as well as the reluctance in rural areas to allow women to register, continues to be a major concern.

 At least 5.5 million Zimbabweans will require food assistance in the run up to the next harvest in April 2004. This year DFID is providing support worth &#163;21 million for emergency feeding programmes. This is being channelled both through the World Food Programme's Emergency Appeal and directly to international and Zimbabwean NGOs. This direct DFID support reached 1.2 million people in October 2003, 80 per cent. of whom are children.
<P>

<a name="31216w10.html_para0"><P>

<a name="31216w10.html_para1">HIV/AIDS remains a key challenge for Zimbabwe and kills over 2,500 people each week, while 25 per cent. of the adult population are infected. DFID has committed &#163;27 million for longer term HIV/AIDS programming. This includes the supply of condoms through clinics and private sector outlets, promoting behavioural change and home-based care for the chronically sick.

<a name="31216w10.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 There is a significant population of Internally Displaced People (IDPs) in Zimbabwe, mainly due to growing food shortages and the continued farm seizures. This has resulted in the displacement of an estimated one hundred thousand people, predominantly farm workers. However, exact numbers are difficult to assess. The Government of Zimbabwe's reluctance to acknowledge the disastrous effects of the fast-track land reform programme has prevented the humanitarian community from carrying out a comprehensive assessment or establishing recognised IDP camps.
<P>

<a name="31216w10.html_para2"><P>

<a name="31216w10.html_para3">Numbers of documented Zimbabwean refugees are negligible&#151;the vast majority of Zimbabweans fleeing the crisis are classed as migrants. Again, exact numbers of this transient population are difficult to assess, as many are illegal migrants in the sub-region. However, there are believed to be 2.35 million Zimbabwean migrants in the Southern Africa region. The vast majority of these, approximately two million, are in South Africa.

<P>
<a name="31216w10.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The UN World Food Programme (WFP), who are the principal coordinators for general food distributions in Zimbabwe, have to date secured over 50 per cent. of the funding requested for this year's Emergency Operation (EMOP) in Zimbabwe. This follows recent pledges of US$8 million from the European Union, and &#163;5 million from DFID. This means that food will be available for distribution until mid-February 2004, when there will be a shortage of cereals if further contributions are not forthcoming. A substantial additional pledge is anticipated shortly from the United States.
<P>

<a name="31216w10.html_para5"><P>

<a name="31216w10.html_para6">Despite this funding, the WFP have reduced monthly ration levels in order to accommodate the growing number of vulnerable people, above the level anticipated when the EMOP appeal was originally prepared. This increase in beneficiary numbers is partly due to increased urban vulnerability, as spiralling inflation (now over 500 per cent.) has affected food prices in shops. There is also emerging evidence of up to several hundred thousand people facing crisis in the former commercial farming areas, most of whom are former farm workers displaced by the Government's disastrous land reform programme. Additionally, the state-controlled Grain Marketing Board has proved erratic and unreliable in contributing to food supply and distribution in the country. Donors are monitoring the situation closely, in close consultation with the WFP.

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2003]:</i> NHS provision of emergency contraception is always by a health professional under medical supervision. Health professionals can provide contraception to young people under 16 provided they are satisfied that the young person is competent to understand fully the implications of any treatment and to make a choice of the treatment involved. Health professionals work within an established legal framework which involves assessing the young person's competence to understand the choices they are making and encouraging them to talk to their parents. All professionals are bound by their professional code of confidentiality. A young person's request for confidentiality is respected unless there are serious child protection issues.

<a name="31216w10.html_para8">Providing emergency contraception through a range of community outlets aim to increase early access. All health professionals providing emergency contraception are trained to ensure that young women are informed about and encouraged to visit local services that provide regular forms of contraception and condoms to protect against sexually transmitted infections.

 The National Healthy Schools programme, jointly sponsored by Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and the Department of Health (DoH), through funding of &#163;5.7 million since 2000, promotes healthy eating and healthy lifestyles. The National Healthy School Standard (NHSS) promotes a whole school approach to health. Healthy eating is one of the eight themes of the NHSS. Schools demonstrate that the taught curriculum complements informed messages about healthy eating, for example, food on offer in vending machines and tuck shops. Schools will supply, promote and monitor healthier food at lunch and break times and in any breakfast clubs where they are provided. Over 14,000 schools are taking part in the healthy schools programme and over 8,000 schools are working 'intensively' to achieve the NHSS.

The same information is reproduced in the School Governors' Guides to the Law, which are revised and re-issued annually. In March 2003 we sent out a letter to all Chief Education Officers and Directors of Education explaining how remission of charges for school trips would work once child tax credits were introduced. This letter is posted on The Parent Centre website.
<P>

<a name="31216w11.html_para4">All LEAs and schools must have a charging policy in place, which is readily available to parents. In addition, when schools make charges, or request money, they must explain whether parents are being asked to pay for a specific activity or make a general contribution to school funds. Schools must also be clear whether or not contributions are voluntary.




<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 2003 : Column 837W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31216w11.html_para5">We do not provide guidance to LEAs on the assistance they may provide to parents on meeting the cost of school uniforms. LEAs may delegate this work to schools, but must ensure that all their schools adopt a consistent approach.

<sup>(15)</sup> A cancelled loan is one where the borrower no longer has any liability to repay as set out by legislation. A borrower's liability to repay a mortgage style loan shall be cancelled: on death of the borrower; after 25 years or when the borrower reaches the age of 50 (60 if the borrower was aged over 40 when he/she last borrowed), whichever is the earlier, provided the borrower is not in arrears of any loan agreement; and if the borrower is in receipt of a disability related benefit and permanently unfit for work. Income contingent loans are cancelled because of death or permanent disability in the same way, but are cancelled on the grounds of age when the borrower reaches the age of 65. A written off loan is one where the borrower remains liable to repay but recovery is deemed unlikely by the loan administrator or not possible by legal judgment.<P>

<a name="31216w11.html_para10">The introduction of the income contingent loan based system of student support from 1998&#150;99 meant that the amount of student loans paid out each year has increased. The amount of loan advanced in 1993&#150;94 was &#163;292.3 million (all mortgage style); in 2002&#150;03 it was &#163;2,618.0 million (of which &#163;2,599.2 million was income contingent loans). A consequence of this increase is a higher level of write-off or cancellation.

 Where the student withdraws from their course and is assessed to make a private contribution towards their fees, it is for the student and the institution to determine the amount that should be paid. It is also for the institution to determine any repayment that may be due. Guidance is provided to institutions by Universities UK. There is no liability on the student to repay the tuition fee grant once it has been paid to the institution.

Lancaster University placed advertisements for the public meeting at Whitehaven in three local weekly newspapers during the week before the meeting, to reduce the risk of it being poorly attended. The first advertisement appeared in the North West Evening Mail on 24 November 2003, one week before the meeting on 1 December 2003. This strategy was also aimed at ensuring that the advertisements would appear at about the same time as any articles published in advance of the meeting, thereby setting the event in context. Information on public meetings, at Whitehaven and elsewhere in England and Scotland, was also published on the Lancaster University website around two to four weeks in advance of the confirmed date for the meetings.

<a name="31216w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Department for Regional Development continues to support 16 rural community transport partnerships, which offer a range of transport services for their members that complement conventional public transport networks and which in particular provide transport opportunities for people with reduced mobility in rural areas. These partnerships cover most of rural Northern Ireland and the Department is encouraging local interests to establish partnerships in areas currently not covered. The Department also provides revenue support to Translink to maintain a network of 44 rural routes across Northern Ireland, which would otherwise be uneconomic to run. Recently the Department introduced the Bus Challenge

Scheme to support new stage carriage bus services in both rural and urban areas. This scheme is open to both Translink and private bus operators and is aimed at addressing gaps in the provision of bus services. So far the Department has agreed to support eight new routes which go through rural areas.

Affordable housing can be secured through planning obligations and we consulted on 6 November on our proposed new policy to improve negotiated planning obligations and legislation for an optional planning charge.

 District and unitary local authorities in England and Wales are responsible for administering and enforcing the Building Regulations.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recognises the important contribution that shared ownership schemes can play in making home ownership affordable for people on modest incomes. The Home Ownership Task Force, which reported on 13 November, has proposed 45 recommendations to assist in the delivery of affordable housing, including improvements to the operation of the shared ownership scheme. We are considering the recommendations and will respond in the new year.

Around 13 per cent. of the Corporation's Approved Development Programme in 2003&#150;04 (total programme &#163;1.2 billion) will be spent on home ownership initiatives, including shared ownership and the Homebuy equity loan scheme. In 2002&#150;03 over 4,000 affordable homes were provided through the shared ownership and Homebuy schemes.

 Each local planning authority would be required, under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill, to prepare an Annual Monitoring Report. Regulations would specify that the report has to be prepared by 31 December in each year to cover the period from 1 April to 31 March immediately preceding. The authority would need to report on their performance against the published local development scheme and on the impact of their policies on the ground. The authority and stakeholders would need to know what effect its policies and proposals were having in order to decide whether they are achieving the desired

These were provided for in the second CSO bidding round (2003&#150;04). West Midlands Police did not put forward a bid in the first round (2002&#150;03).
<P>

<a name="31216w18.html_para1">Across England and Wales, a further 454 CSOs have been funded from other sources, including 21 in the West Midlands.
<P>

<a name="31216w18.html_para2">In 2004&#150;05 the West Midlands Police, along with other forces in England and Wales, will be invited to bid in a third CSO funding round. This round will provide 50 per cent of funding for salary and direct on costs.
<P>

<a name="31216w18.html_para3">Final decisions about funding for future years, beyond 2004&#150;05, have yet to be taken.

 The Government believes that Crimestoppers is a highly effective organisation that gathers vital intelligence for the Police and other law enforcement agencies. As laid out in the 1998 Compact on relations with the Voluntary and Community Sector, the Government recognises that continuity of funding is important to voluntary organisations and takes this into account where possible.

 We announced on 1 December that the fee charged by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) for a Standard Disclosure will rise from &#163;24 to &#163;28 and that for an Enhanced Disclosure from &#163;29 to &#163;33. These increases will take effect from 1 April 2004.
<P>

<a name="31216w18.html_para9">We have always made it clear that the CRB would be self-financed through the fees charged for providing the Disclosure service, and that the fee levels would be regularly reviewed. When the last fee increase was announced in June 2003, we re-affirmed the requirement that the CRB should be self-financing in the medium term&#151;that is, from 2005&#150;06 onwards. The CRB continues to make efficiency savings. However, as the CRB moves towards full cost recovery, it is necessary to reduce the substantial subsidy that the CRB currently receives from the general taxpayer and to make a compensating increase in the Disclosure fee.

In other cases, responsibility for paying the fee rests primarily with individual applicants, although it is open to the employer to reimburse the cost. Since 1 July 2003, the fees for an Enhanced and Standard Disclosure have been &#163;29 and &#163;24 respectively; I announced on 1 December 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 51&#150;52WS the fees to apply from 1 April 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what resources have been made available to Gwent Police since 1997; how many police officers there were in the Gwent Force in each year since 1997; and what the expected number of police officers in the Gwent Force is in each of the next two years.  [142820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31216w19.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The information requested is set out in the table. Gwent Police had record police strength at the end of August 2003. The balance between police officers and police staff and other resources, such as IT systems, in the Gwent Police is a matter for the Chief Constable. It is not therefore possible to estimate the number of police officers that Gwent Police will have Over the next two years. I understand that Gwent Police has forecast strength for 31 March 2004 at 1,357.
<P>

<a name="31216w19.html_para6">The provisional police funding settlement for 2004&#150;05 will give Gwent Police Authority a Government funding allocation of &#163;71.8 million, an increase of 3.25 per cent over 2003&#150;04. It is for the Police Authority to set the budget.

<a name="31216w20.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Security Industry Authority (SIA) anticipates that some 2,500 door supervisors will apply to be licensed during the course of the pilot in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, commencing in March 2004. This figure is necessarily a best estimate as not all local authorities in the pilot area have existing local registration schemes, and those that do, do not always include all door supervisors working in the local authority's area.
<P>

<a name="31216w20.html_para0">There are no overall complement levels set, as the demand for door supervisors is to a large extent market led. However, it is anticipated that some local authorities may set minimum complement levels for individual premises as a condition of their licence to operate under the Licensing Act 2003, and this will have an impact on the number of SIA licence applications.

<P>
<a name="31216w21.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many pensioners receiving housing and council tax benefit became entitled to pension credit in October; and of that number how many received an increase in their housing and council tax benefit entitlement to reflect the increased thresholds for these benefits.  [144652]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31216w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 The information is not available. However, we estimate that some 1.9 million pensioner households stand to get more help, or help for the first time, through housing benefit and council tax benefit as a result of the introduction of pension credit.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions whether pension credit counts as income when assessing housing and council tax benefit. [144653]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31216w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 Whether pension credit is taken into account when assessing housing benefit and council tax benefit depends on which elements of pension credit are in payment.
<P>

<a name="31216w21.html_para2">A person in receipt of the guarantee element of pension credit, or both the guarantee and the savings credit elements of pension credit, has all of their income and capital disregarded for the purposes of housing benefit and council tax benefit. If a person is in receipt of the savings credit element only, then the amount of the savings credit is taken into account as income in the housing benefit or council tax benefit assessment.
<P>

<a name="31216w21.html_para3">However, in October 2003, the applicable amounts in housing benefit and council tax benefit, for people aged 65 and over (or who have partners aged 65 and over) were increased to reflect the maximum savings credit people could get. This ensures that, although the savings credit is taken into account as income, the resulting reduction in their housing benefit or council tax is less than their gains due to receipt of the savings credit.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31216w21.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 There are already a number of measures in place to help lower earners build up their entitlement to state pension.
<P>

<a name="31216w21.html_para5">Employees who earn above the lower earnings limit (LEL) but less than the lower earnings threshold (LET) are treated as having earnings at the LET. Certain carers and people who are disabled or long-term ill who earn less than the LET, including those with no earnings at all, are also treated as having earnings at the LET. Because the LET is set at a higher amount than the LEL, some employees do not have to pay national insurance 



<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 2003 : Column 875W</I><P>
contributions (NICs) but are treated as if they have paid them. This means that they continue to build up entitlement to contributory benefits such as state pension and incapacity benefit even though they are not paying NICs.
<P>

<a name="31216w21.html_para6">In addition, people with earnings below the level at which they are treated as paying NICs or no earnings can have their state pension entitlement protected by home responsibilities protection (HRP). HRP helps to protect the basic state pension position of people whose opportunities to work are limited because of caring responsibilities at home. It is available to eligible people for complete tax years and reduces the number of qualifying years they would otherwise need for a basic state pension.
<P>

<a name="31216w21.html_para7">Also, recipients of working tax credit whose earnings are below the level at which they are treated as paying NICs can be credited with contributions for state pension purposes.
<P>

<a name="31216w21.html_para8">Further, the state second pension focuses help on those with low to moderate earnings and on qualifying carers and long term-disabled people who have broken work records. 20 million people have started to benefit from the reform of state earnings-related pension scheme (SERPS) through the state second pension, introduced in April 2002. Low earners will get at least double what they would have got from SERPS, while carers and disabled people with broken work records will be entitled to an additional state pension for the first time.

 Nearly 25,000 children have been conceived in licensed assisted conception units as a result of treatment using donated gametes and embryos since August 1991, when the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority's register of such births began. After a public consultation exercise in 2002, we announced in January 2003 that we would carry out a further programme of work on the possibility of providing of identifying information about future sperm, egg and embryo donors, and make a further announcement after that.

 The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) published guidance on the organisation and delivery of services for people with urological cancers, including prostate cancer, in September 2002. The guidance states that the option of brachytherapy should be discussed with men with early prostate cancer.
<P>

<a name="31216w22.html_para1">However, the NICE guidance also acknowledges that, the place of brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer is uncertain and notes the importance of research to evaluate the effectiveness of brachytherapy for prostate cancer. The guidance refers to a randomised intergroup trial comparing brachytherapy with radical surgery that is being organised by the National Cancer Institute of Canada and the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group, and strongly encourages UK participation in this study. As a result, the Department of Health has made available &#163;900,000 through the National Cancer Research Network (NCRN) to enable national health service patients to enter this trial. The National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) prostate cancer clinical studies group and the NCRN are working closely together to take this trial forward in the NHS.
<P>

<a name="31216w22.html_para2">As more evidence on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of brachytherapy becomes available, the Department will consider whether this treatment is a suitable topic for referral to NICE as a technology appraisal. The Government are devolving power from the centre to enable primary care trusts to use the extra resources for the NHS to deliver on both national and local priorities for their communities, accounting publicly for how they have used them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31216w22.html_spnew3"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 4 December 2003]:</i> Comparable statistics on cancer survival in the United Kingdom and most other European Union countries have been produced in three studies funded by the European Commission (the EUROCARE studies). Cancer registries in the UK, including staff from the National Registry at the Office for National Statistics, have been involved in these studies since they began in 1989.
<P>

<a name="31216w22.html_para3">The recently published findings of the EUROCARE 3 study, covering patients diagnosed in 1990&#150;94, showed that cancer survival rates in England, in general, lag behind those in Europe. However, the study also shows that the gap in survival rates between England and other comparable countries is now beginning to diminish. For patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the early 1990s, differences in the stage at diagnosis were a key explanation for the differences in survival between Western European countries.




<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 2003 : Column 878W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31216w22.html_para4">It is important to note that these studies predate the introduction of the NHS Cancer Plan by more than five years. The improvements in waiting times, treatment and the introduction of specialist teams for breast cancer patients now being delivered by the NHS Cancer Plan will help to ensure survival rates for breast cancer patients continue to improve. Indeed, Cancer Research UK have noted that in the past decade British women have had the worlds biggest decrease in deaths from breast cancer thanks to better diagnosis and treatment. Indeed, deaths from breast cancer among the under 70s have decreased more sharply in Britain than anywhere in the world, by 30 per cent., in the last 10 years.

Separate information on the number of training places for medical physicists has only been collected sine 2002&#150;03; latest plans show that work force development confederations (WDCs) expect to increase the number of training places by around 16 per cent.

 The Government have made clear its position on the use of genetic test results for underwriting life and health insurance in the October 2001 Government response to the report from the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee: Genetics and Insurance.
<P>

<a name="31216w24.html_para7">The Genetics and Insurance Committee (GAIC) is responsible for the evaluation of specific genetic tests and their relevance to particular types of insurance. GAIC also provides independent scrutiny of compliance with the terms of the moratorium on the use of genetic test results by insurance companies, which runs until November 2006. If there is evidence of non-compliance with the moratorium by the insurance industry, then the Government is prepared to enforce it through legislation, if necessary.
<P>

<a name="31216w24.html_para8">The Human Genetics Commission (HGC) has been asked to work closely with GAIC to provide Government with further advice in developing a longer-term policy on the use of genetic information by insurance companies. GAIC and HGC will also monitor the effectiveness of the Association of British Insurers (ABI) Code of practice on Genetics which is mandatory for all ABI members.
<P>

<a name="31216w24.html_para9">HGC and GAIC held a well-received joint public meeting in September 2003. A number of interested groups, members of the public, attended this meeting, including representatives from organisations concerned with genetic disorders, as well as from insurance and re-insurance companies, and non-Governmental organisations with an interest in this area. HGC and GAIC are planning a further such meeting in 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the number of products currently on the market that will require a full marketing authorisation under the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive.  [143660]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31216w25.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 One of the main reasons why we have supported the development of the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products is the difficulty companies sometimes experience at present in providing evidence that their products fully satisfy all the criteria for a marketing authorisation, and in particular the requirements relating to efficacy.




<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 2003 : Column 889W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31216w25.html_para6">The current text of the proposed Directive provides that, where the competent authorities judge that a traditional herbal medicinal product fulfils the criteria for a marketing authorisation, the product will not be eligible for a traditional use registration. Our view is that it is likely that only a very small proportion of unlicensed herbal remedies currently on the United Kingdom market would be affected by this provision in a situation where an applicant was seeking a traditional use registration. However, it is not practicable for the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency to give a more specific estimate in advance of the launch of the proposed traditional use registration scheme or to conduct a detailed survey that would be burdensome to the industry.

All 34 cancer networks have submitted investment plans for the use of their allocation to the National Partnership Group (NPG) for palliative care (a joint NHS/voluntary sector group). The NPG has assessed the investment plans.

The &#163;50 million represents a significant increase of nearly 40 per cent. in NHS funding for specialist palliative care over 2000 levels.

 The long term conditions care group work force team (LTCCGWT) is responsible for increasing the capacity of the work force supporting the delivery of neurology, diabetes, renal and dermatology services. The LTCCGWT is a multi-disciplinary advisory body working in support of the National Workforce Development Board and the Workforce Numbers Advisory Board in drawing up national workforce strategies. It takes a national view of the health and social care workforce pressures and priorities for the long-term conditions client group. Each year the LTCCGWT produces a report setting out its recommendations on work force issues, such as the need for increased numbers of staff and also new ways of working, including skill mix, role extensions and multi-disciplinary working, based around patient needs. This report, along with those from the other six CGWTs forms the overall report to the June meeting of the Workforce Numbers Advisory Board. The 2003 reports from the CGWTs will be published shortly for distribution to strategic health authorities and workforce development confederations. The reports will also be available on the CGWT website, together with details of the group's membership and terms of reference. The website address is: http://www. doh.gov.uk/cgwt/.
