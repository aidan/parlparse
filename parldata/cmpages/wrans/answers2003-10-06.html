<P>
<a name="31006w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. David Stewart: </B> 
To ask the Minister for Women what measures have been taken to address the pay gap between men and women; and if she will make a statement.  [131312]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government are taking action to tackle the complex factors behind the pay gap, including promoting voluntary pay reviews and good practice on equal pay. We have set a target for pay reviews and are working in partnership with businesses and trade unions, the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) and Opportunity Now towards ensuring that 35 per cent. of large companies have done pay reviews by 2006. We provided the EOC with &#163;100,000 to produce a toolkit to help employers conduct pay reviews and provided trade unions with additional funding to train over 400 representatives in equal pay issues. The Government have committed all civil service Departments and agencies to review their pay systems and produce action plans to close any equal pay gaps, 83 action plans have been submitted, representing 98 per cent. of the civil service. We are also taking steps to widen women's opportunities in the labour market. The Employment Act 2002 introduced measures to help parents maintain links with the world of work and better balance their work and home lives. These will help women return to the labour market and have a positive impact on the pay gap. The Act also introduced an equal pay questionnaire that will make it easier to tackle pay discrimination in the workplace.

<P>
<a name="31006w01.html_wqn1"><B> Linda Perham: </B> 
To ask the Minister for Women what assessment she has made of progress in tackling the illegal trafficking of women.  [127787]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w01.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="31006w01.html_para0">We have set out a comprehensive approach to tackle trafficking in women and other forms of organised crime in the "White Paper Secure Borders, Safe Haven" published in 2002. The United Kingdom was one of the first countries to sign the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, and its Optional Protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children. The Government also supports action to combat trafficking, in both European Union and international fora and has supported information campaigns aimed at alerting women to the risks involved in such illegal immigration.

<P>

<a name="31006w01.html_para1">The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 introduced a new offence of trafficking for the purpose of controlling prostitution with a maximum penalty of 14 years, and comprehensive offences covering trafficking into, out of and within the UK for purposes of sexual exploitation are included in the Sexual Offences Bill.
<P>

<a name="31006w01.html_para2">The Government have also recently published a trafficking toolkit, which will be a best practice guide for immigration officers, police and others potentially dealing with trafficking. A pilot scheme to support victims of trafficking to help them give evidence against their exploiters has been running since March 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what role the EU will play in civil contingencies planning.  [130796]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The EU is taking a leading role in facilitating multilateral emergency planning. Through the Committee for the Action Programme and for the Mechanism in the field of Civil Protection, the EU is establishing a Community mechanism to facilitate reinforced co-operation in civil protection assistance interventions.
<P>

<a name="31006w01.html_para4">While the UK continues to retain national responsibility for its own contingency planning, there may be cases where the resources of one nation are unable to cope with the scale of a particular incident.
<P>

<a name="31006w01.html_para5">In such exceptional circumstances we would expect the full co-operation of the member states and institutions of the European Union, including the Health and Safety Committee, in containing and resolving the situation. To this end the European Union's civil protection Monitoring and Information Centre would facilitate and co-ordinate any request for assistance from Member States.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Cabinet Office has undertaken asbestos surveys for the London and Basingstoke Estate, the GCDA buildings, HMSO (Norwich), Emergency Planning College (York), the COI and the CMPS Residential Training Centre (Sunningdale). This has identified risk areas and how this can best be managed.
<P>

No specific budget has been identified for the removal of asbestos, as there are no high-risk areas unless areas are disturbed due to building works. Costs of required measures will be identified and incorporated into any budgeted project costs at the time of the works.
<P>

<a name="31006w01.html_para24"><i>Basingstoke Estate</i>
<P>

<a name="31006w01.html_para25">No further risks have been identified and therefore no specific budget allocated.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what IT projects with a value in excess of &#163;10,000 the Cabinet Office authorised in each of the last three financial years.  [124424]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 I have today placed in the Libraries of the House a summary of IT projects with a value in excess of &#163;10,000 that my Department authorised in the last three financial years.
<P>

<a name="31006w01.html_para33">It has been compiled from centrally held records and those maintained by existing business units, but, due to changes in my Department over the last three years, will not capture all projects that were managed by units that no longer exist.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what the Cabinet Office's policy is on employing secondees from the private sector; how many secondees from the <i>(a)</i> private and <i>(b)</i> public sector the Cabinet Office were employed in each year since 1997; from which companies and organisations they were seconded; at what level they were employed; and if he will make a statement.  [127066]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Government are committed to developing a modern, flexible, outward-focused civil service that works in partnership with all sectors of society. Interchange is a key tool in meeting that commitment. Secondments are encouraged as part of the interchange programme, which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the civil service and other organisations. Before an interchange can occur all parties must be satisfied that no conflict of interest arises. In all cases agreement is reached with the parent organisation on the salary reimbursed by the Cabinet Office to ensure it falls in the civil service pay range appropriate to the post.
<P>

<a name="31006w02.html_para0">There are no records available prior to April 1999. The following table gives the number of secondees within the Cabinet Office by Pay Band within each year from 1999&#150;2000. The figures for secondees from the private and public sectors are aggregated. Separate figures are not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate costs.

 In 2002&#150;03, the Crown Prosecution Service set two targets in order to deal with prosecution cases in a timely and efficient manner in partnership with other agencies.
<P>

<a name="31006w02.html_para3">The first target was to send 80 per cent. of committal papers to the defence within 14 days (10 days in custody cases) of receipt from the police of a full file for committal certified as trial ready. The target was achieved in 86.7 per cent. of cases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w02.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The CPS handles about 13,000 cases of domestic violence each year. The revised policy on prosecution of cases of domestic violence launched in November 2001 focuses on the safety of the victim and children and on conducting cases, wherever possible, 



<P>
<P><I>6 Oct 2003 : Column 1000W</I><P>
on the basis of evidence other than that of the victim. The work done by the CPS at operational level is complemented by the strategic contribution of the network of CPS Domestic Violence Co-ordinators across England and Wales who share information and good practice and issue guidance to prosecutors to help them identify and address difficult and sensitive issues that are regularly raised in domestic violence cases.
<P>

<a name="31006w02.html_para5">The CPS also contributes to the Government's strategy by consulting and working closely at a local level with criminal justice partners and the voluntary sector by participating in local domestic violence fora. At national level the CPS Policy lead on domestic violence attends the Home Office Virtual Unit and made a significant input into the Government White Papers, "Justice for All" and "Safety and Justice", addressing issues of prevention, protection and support.

<P>
<a name="31006w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 The UK recognises that improving stockpile security is a key component of efforts to prevent the proliferation of illegal armaments. The UK provides limited assistance to countries on security for legally held stockpiles of small arms. Through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool Small Arms Strategy, the UK provides support to the work of UNDP's South Eastern Europe Small Arms Clearing House, which has provided training and assistance to states in that region on stockpile security. In Sierra Leone, the UK provided training to the military and security forces on weapons management and security systems as part of a wider package of support for restructuring the military forces after the conflict.
<P>

<a name="31006w03.html_para1">The UK was a key contributor to the development of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Best Practice Guidelines on Stockpile Management, published earlier this year, and is currently working with the OSCE to devise ways to support the operationalisation of these Guidelines.

[129808]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 The UK believes that stronger export control legislation is an important way of tackling the proliferation of small arms in developing countries, and is committed to working with our international partners to strengthen existing legislation at the national, regional and international levels. However, legislation also requires effective and sustained enforcement, and the UK government provides support to ensure effective implementation and enforcement of that legislation.
<P>

<a name="31006w03.html_para3">The UK Government made export control legislation one of its priorities for the UN Biennial Meeting of States, and made a strong statement on the need to strengthen and enforce export controls during the plenary session. The UK also co-sponsored a side meeting for interested states to consider ways of achieving this. This meeting established a considerable degree of support, particularly for regional processes as an interim stage to securing greater international agreement. The UK is now discussing options for taking this process forward with possible co-partners, including UK support for regional processes, and remains committed to working with our partners internationally to secure stronger export controls on transfers of small arms.

effective use of aid means moving away from donors allocating funding to selected sectors and donor-led projects to providing support that is consistent with poverty reduction strategies drawn up by the developing countries themselves.

Policies to tackle food insecurity need to be based on a clear understanding of who is hungry and why.

 DFID has been providing support for health care and sanitation for Iraqi Marsh Arabs and refugees in Iran through the NGO AMAR (&#163;2.45 million over the last four years). We are in the process of considering a further year's support for AMAR. DFID has also granted &#163;522,000 to the International Medical Corps for its work in Iraq, which includes providing clean and sustainable water supplies in Marsh Arab areas.

[130291]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w05.html_spnew9"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Most of DFID's expenditure on Iraq is channelled through the United Nations, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and non-governmental organisations, each of which report to DFID on their expenditure and activities separately and at different times. It would not therefore be possible, other than at disproportionate cost to DFID and to the agencies concerned, to provide details of our total spending in Iraq, sector by sector, at any particular point of time.
<P>

<a name="31006w05.html_para2">DFID has so far committed &#163;198 million to humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Iraq. This includes &#163;15.8 million to water and sanitation, &#163;12.2 million to power and fuel, and &#163;8.5 million to health and nutrition. A further &#163;35 million has been allocated to humanitarian agencies without being earmarked to specific sectors, a proportion of which is being spent in the water, power and health sectors according to priorities identified on the ground. DFID has also recently agreed a &#163;20 million project to help restore essential infrastructure in southern Iraq, which is expected to improve service delivery of power, water and fuel to over 5 million people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w05.html_spnew10"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Recent assessments by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Iraqi Ministry of Health indicate that there are no major shortages of essential medical supplies in Iraq. There are, however, still reported shortages of specialist supplies such as laboratory reagents, TB antibiotics, oxygen and drugs for some chronic diseases. A number of agencies, including WHO, have helped refurbish drug warehouses in Baghdad, and the transport of drugs to the regions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w05.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 Recent assessments suggest that the Baghdad water system is working at approximately 80 per cent. of its pre-war capacity, and that 75 per cent. of the population of Baghdad has access to sewage networks. The supply of clean water and access to sanitation in other areas is difficult to assess accurately. UNICEF and the General Corporation for Water Supply are compiling a database on progress in the water and sanitation sector in order to provide better assessments of the current level of services.
<P>

<a name="31006w05.html_para3">Electricity supply throughout Iraq has improved over the last month. On 8 September, power generation had reached 3550 megawatts, approximately 81 per cent. of the pre-war level of 4400 megawatts. The Coalition Provisional Administration has set a target for reaching 



<P>
<P><I>6 Oct 2003 : Column 1011W</I><P>
this pre-war level by the end of September. Work is also taking place to restore the transmission grid, which has suffered particularly badly from looting and sabotage. This will allow the additional power to be used effectively throughout the country to improve the reliability of service and to provide additional power to the less well served areas. In July and August Baghdad had power on a 3 hours on and 3 hours off basis while Basrah had up to 20 hours per day.

 The Middle East and North Africa compares badly with other regions of similar incomes and characteristics in terms of public accountability and inclusiveness. A number of reports have been published recently which highlight the relationship between accountable governance and economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa. The 2002 "Arab Human Development Report" concluded that social and economic development was being hampered by deeply rooted shortcomings in the structures of governance in the region. More recently, a World Bank's report, "Better Governance in the Middle East and North Africa", noted that income growth per head averaged just 0.5 per cent. across the region in the period 1985&#150;2000, and at the heart of this poor record was a noticeable "governance gap". Taken together, these reports provide a substantial body of evidence to support the view that improving accountable governance, strengthening political and economic freedoms, and enhancing public participation are prerequisites for lasting economic, social and human development in the region.
<P>

<a name="31006w06.html_para5">Promoting better governance is a key feature of DFID's bilateral programme to the region: this is set out as a central theme of our soon-to-be-published Regional Assistance Plan. Examples include support to public administration and civil service reform in both Jordan and the Palestinian Territory. We are also working to help ensure that the European Commission's development programme takes proper account of the need to improve governance and respect for human rights, and reduce poverty, in partner countries in the Middle East and North Africa.

<a name="31006w06.html_para9">DFID support for reproductive health is wide ranging. It covers HIV/AIDS programmes, prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and maternal and adolescent health. Reproductive health also encompasses the services for family planning, contraception and childbearing that make an important contribution to increasing women's choice and opportunity and to preventing unplanned or unwanted pregnancy. Family planning services also provide an important opportunity to improve sexual health and in particular to increase women's access to methods that help prevent HIV infection. The &#163;31 million expenditure for 2003&#150;03 cannot therefore be apportioned between HIV/AIDS and Family Planning, as many reproductive health programmes and projects contribute to both objectives (for example through the provision of information on family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention or the provision of condoms).
<P>

<a name="31006w06.html_para10">The figures above include only the DFID contributions to SWAPS. If our other expenditure on Reproductive Health and HIV/AIDS (for example through multilateral organisations) were included the amounts would be considerably higher.

 The UK's development programme for Russia aims, through its work with Federal Government, to benefit all regions of the country. However we consider that the North Caucasus is a medium term emergency. The security environment doesn't lend itself to developmental programmes. Therefore, the UK's assistance is focused only on humanitarian programmes. The UN agencies and the ICRC do work with the Russian Authorities to try and build capacity in certain areas, which we support.

 The overall humanitarian situation in North Ossetia-Alania and Ingushetia remains acute. People affected by the instability in Chechnya are facing their fifth extremely difficult winter amid rising tensions in the region.
<P>

<a name="31006w07.html_para3">Four years after the resumption of hostilities in the Republic of Chechnya, more than 80,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Chechnya still live in tents or unsuitable shelters in the neighbouring Republic of Ingushetia. In North Ossetia, there are 30,000 Georgian refugees living in poor conditions. In Chechnya, the situation is worse. According to a recent UN report, more than 100,000 of the about 800,000 people living there are still displaced from their homes and surviving indoor conditions.
<P>

<a name="31006w07.html_para4">The UK travel restriction to the North Caucasus prevents DFID from making direct assessments of the humanitarian situation.

 The UN Ferghana Valley Development Programme dates back to early 2000, and since then there has been no British involvement.

 We do not have direct discussions with or provide support to countries in this area, but work through the World Health Organisation (WHO) and also support the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. This convention was adopted at the World Health Assembly in May 2003 and has been signed by 56 countries so far, including many developing countries. The convention requires countries that have signed it to implement comprehensive tobacco control programmes and strategies at the national, regional and local levels. These include promoting treatment programmes to help people stop smoking, education to prevent people from starting and measures to prohibit sales of tobacco products to minors. The convention recognises that tax and price measures are an important way of reducing tobacco consumption, particularly in young people, and requires signatories to consider public health objectives when implementing tax and price policies on tobacco products.

 DFID's country programme in India is governed by the Country Strategy Paper published in 2000. We run a nationwide programme, which covers the whole of India, and we also have state-level programmes in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal. Our main partners are the Indian Government; focus state governments and non-governmental organisations. The principal objectives of DFID's work in India under the current strategy are to have partnerships with selected state governments, to support economic reform, services, empowerment of poor, especially minority groups, and better management of the natural and physical environment. We are currently revising our country strategy in India.
<P>

<a name="31006w08.html_para0">In Pakistan we support priorities agreed following reengagement with the Government in 2000. The programme has three objectives: creating economic conditions for poverty reduction; improving health outcomes; and improving education outcomes. In Pakistan too we are preparing a new Country Assistance Plan to support the Government of Pakistan's own Poverty Reduction Strategy due for publication in October 2003. DFID works in Pakistan with a wide range of partners including Government departments and non-government organisations, and closely coordinates its activities with those of other multilateral and bilateral development agencies.

<a name="31006w08.html_para1">In Bangladesh we work in accordance with our Country Strategy published in 1998.

The new Country Plan supports the Government of Bangladesh's own national poverty strategy and focuses DFID activity around seven areas of importance: support to the private sector, land transport, maternal mortality, primary education, access to food and water and Governance. DFID works in Bangladesh Government departments and non-government organisations and closely coordinates its activities with those of other multi-lateral and development agencies.

 Since September 2001, DFID has provided approximately &#163;120 million in emergency assistance to the six countries in Southern Africa (Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe) that have been most affected by the humanitarian crisis over the past two years. Most of this assistance (approximately &#163;90 million) has been provided to Zimbabwe and Malawi, where needs have been greatest. In addition, we estimate that our contribution to commitments by the European Commission to date is around &#163;26 million.

Zambia, Malawi, Swaziland and Mozambique. We intend to programme a further &#163;40 million of emergency aid to Zimbabwe this year, building on our existing programme commitments, in response to the serious humanitarian needs there. We, along with the UN and other donors, will ensure that our humanitarian assistance continues to be distributed according to need and without political interference.
<P>

<a name="31006w08.html_para4">Where immediate humanitarian needs have reduced, as we have seen this year in Zambia and Malawi, we have shifted our support to programmes that support recovery from the crisis, including through provision of seeds and fertilisers. In Malawi, some &#163;9.3 million has been committed for these activities&#151;again with the objective of improving food security at the household level and ensuring that safety nets that cover an appropriate mix of cash, food and subsidised inputs, are available for the most vulnerable. We have also provided seeds and fertilisers in Mozambique and Swaziland and responded to UN calls for support to seed fairs in those countries.
<P>

<a name="31006w08.html_para5">Emergency assistance is still needed this year in areas of southern Mozambique, and in Lesotho where the failure of the winter harvest has put more people at risk. We are working to identify where the greatest needs are in these countries and will provide emergency aid to help cover the greatest gaps.

<a name="31006w08.html_para6">DFID is also supporting the work of the UN Regional Inter-Agency Co-ordination and Support team in Johannesburg, which works to co-ordinate and harmonise UN and NGO efforts across the region.

<P>

<a name="31006w08.html_para9">One of the WTO trade and environment negotiating mandates is to clarify the relationship between WTO rules and specific trade obligations in Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs). The EU's overall aim is to ensure that these two bodies of international law are mutually supportive. With a view to better informing the WTO debate, at Cancun, the EU proposed that agreement be reached to formalise the observer role of MEAs, UNEP and UNCTAD in the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment Special Sessions. The text under discussion when the Conference collapsed had taken on board the EU view by making clear that MEAs and UN agencies should be given observer status in the Committee on Trade and Environment Special Sessions.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what guidance he has given local authorities to ensure the consistent application of Part M of the Building Regulations by building control officers.  [130982]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w08.html_spnew5"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 Each Part of the Building Regulations consists of a, usually small, number of functional requirements. Guidance on the application of the requirements is provided by a statutory 'Approved Document'. Each such document states that it is intended to provide guidance for some of the more common building situations, but recognises that there may well be alternative ways of achieving compliance with the requirements, and advises builders and developers that ". . . there is no obligation to adopt any particular solution contained in an Approved Document if you prefer to meet the relevant requirement in some other way."
<P>

<a name="31006w08.html_para11">Every building in its site context is different and there must therefore be room for discretion and adaptation to local circumstances. Nor is it possible in a usable guidance document to illustrate an acceptable solution for the almost infinite variety of building situations. Absolute consistency of application of any part of the Building Regulations is thus neither achievable nor desirable, and reliance must be placed on the professionalism and competence of the building control community.

The amendments will extend the application of Part M to work to existing buildings, reflect the contents where appropriate of British Standard BS 8300:2001 'Design of buildings and their approaches to meet the needs of disabled people&#151;Code of Practice', and complement the objectives of Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 relating to accessibility of goods, facilities, services and premises.

 I have been asked to reply.

<a name="31006w08.html_para12">The period within which a civil action must be commenced against a builder for poor workmanship is subject to the Limitation Act 1980 (unless the terms of 



<P>
<P><I>6 Oct 2003 : Column 1023W</I><P>
an individual contract specify otherwise). In July 2002, the Government announced its acceptance in principle of the recommendations for reform of the 1980 Act contained in the Law Commission report "Limitation of Actions", subject to further consideration of certain aspects. Legislation will be introduced when an opportunity arises.
<P>

<a name="31006w08.html_para13">The Commission proposed a core limitation regime that would apply to the majority of claims for a remedy for a wrong or the enforcement of a right. In broad terms, a claim would have to be brought within a primary limitation period of three years from the date on which the claimant knows (or ought reasonably to know) the facts giving rise to the claim, the identity of the defendant, and that any injury, loss or damage was significant. No claim could be brought after the expiry of a 10-year "longstop" period, which normally would run from the date on which the cause of action arose. At present in a simple contract claim the limitation period is six years from the date the cause of action arose.

<P>
<a name="31006w08.html_spnew9"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 Over the last 12 months, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has received about 50 letters from hon. Members and from members of the public raising points about the Buildmark warranty scheme. This is a non-statutory scheme ran by the National House Building Council (NHBC), which is an independent company, limited by guarantee. Officials from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister inform NHBC senior management of the key points raised in correspondence, to assist them in their monitoring of the scheme.

 Tackling domestic violence, and supporting those who are victims of domestic violence, is taken very seriously across Government.
<P>

<a name="31006w09.html_para1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced at the end of last year a &#163;7 million capital investment programme through the Housing Corporation to extend and renovate the national network of women's refuges in England. Initial allocations for 2003&#150;04 were agreed in conjunction with the Housing Corporation in March this year and it is hoped that further schemes will be supported in the next two years.
<P>

<a name="31006w09.html_para2">The Supporting People programme, which begins on 1 April, will put in place a new integrated policy and funding framework for housing-related support services, including those for people experiencing domestic violence. Current annual expenditure is &#163;34 million for a total of 5,000 places. Local authorities have now submitted their shadow Supporting People strategies. These are currently being analysed and will provide valuable data on the supply of refuge and support services for people experiencing domestic violence, so helping to inform and direct future action.
<P>

<a name="31006w09.html_para3">Supporting People guides have also been issued on addressing the accommodation and support needs of households experiencing domestic violence; and two dedicated co-ordinators are working with providers and local authorities to ensure that the sector is prepared for the new programme.
<P>

<a name="31006w09.html_para4">In July 2002, the main homelessness provisions of the Homelessness Act 2002 and the Homelessness (Priority Need for Accommodation) (England) Order 2002 were brought into force. These required local housing authorities to take a more strategic approach to preventing and tackling homelessness, placed stronger duties on authorities to help homeless people, and extended the groups of homeless applicants who have a priority need for accommodation, including, among others, people vulnerable as a result of fleeing their home because of violence. The Homelessness Directorate has allocated &#163;70 million in 2003&#150;04 to local authorities and other agencies to help them address

<P>

<a name="31006w09.html_para6">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects no significant costs to local authorities at this stage and there are no plans for additional allocation of funds. The guidance to local authorities, which was released on 17 June, advises them to undertake sensible risk management and business planning for the possibility of a euro changeover. All the evidence from the euro area suggests that such early planning can significantly reduce costs of any changeover.
<P>

<a name="31006w09.html_para7">In the event of any changeover, the total cost to local authorities will depend upon the circumstances and approach taken by individual councils. The Government would look with local authorities at the pressures they face.

 In his Budget statement, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the Government would be giving increased emphasis to the regional and local elements of public sector pay. As a first and immediate step, the terms of reference or remit letters of the Pay Review Bodies have been modified to require them to have regard to regional/local labour markets and their effects on recruitment and retention. The ability to recruit and retain staff in every location is crucial to high quality public services. Staff shortages, resulting from an inability to recruit and retain staff with the requisite skills in the right numbers in specific locations, are currently concentrated in certain areas, mainly but not exclusively in parts of London and the south-east. A stronger local and regional element to pay is one important tool to address these issues.

<P>

<a name="31006w10.html_para2">The area cost adjustment already directs grant to areas with higher wages in recognition of the increased recruitment and retention cost experienced there. Any effect of regional public service pay will be reflected in the pay cost evidence that we use in calculating the area cost adjustment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Elected regional assemblies will be strategic bodies with an efficient and focused membership of between 25 and 35 elected members. They will have a similar role to that of the Greater London Authority, which has a Mayor and 25 assembly Members.
<P>

<a name="31006w10.html_para8">The Government expects that elected regional assemblies will have an executive of at least three members and a maximum of six, including the leader. The Government believes that this leaves a sufficient number of members to exercise the scrutiny function.
<P>

<a name="31006w10.html_para9">Approximately two thirds of elected members will be constituency members, the other third will be regional members elected from a regional list. This form of proportional representation will ensure that the assembly is representative of the region. Fewer than 25 members would make it difficult to reflect the vote proportionately. Membership will be larger where population is greater up to a maximum of 35. Any larger size would risk compromising the strategic role of Elected Regional Assemblies and could cause confusion between this and the separate representative and service delivery role of local authorities. Elected regional assemblies will also be expected to involve regional stakeholders in their work, which will help ensure that different views are taken into account.

 The Courts Bill, which is currently before Parliament, makes provisions that will allow the Government to replace the existing 42 magistrates courts committees and the Court Service with a single executive agency, responsible for the administration of all the courts below the House of Lords. No date has yet been set for the establishment of the new unified courts agency although it will not be before April 2005.
<P>

<a name="31006w11.html_para4">The unified courts agency will be an entirely new organisation, twice the size of either of the two services that will be subsumed within it. The Secretary of State and I have given close consideration to the regional management structure for the agency and what the boundaries of those regions should be. In this context, we paid careful attention to the "Modernising Government" White Paper of March 1999. This sets out the Government's policy that, wherever possible, the boundaries of government departments and public bodies at regional level should coincide with those of the Government Offices for the Regions. This commitment was repeated in the White Paper "Your Region, Your Choice" in May 2002.

The boundaries of these regions will be coterminous with those of the Government Offices for the Regions, with two exceptions. The Secretary of State and I have decided that the Cheshire management unit should be linked with the Wales region for the time being but that we want to review this in 2006&#150;07 as part of a general post implementation review of the agency's working arrangements. We have asked for further work to be undertaken before deciding whether to align the Hampshire unit with the South East or South West regions. This work will cover what the impact of including Hampshire within the South East region would be on the administration of justice throughout the current Western Circuit and in particular whether there would be a need to change the way in which cases are handled in Wiltshire, Dorset and Hampshire. This will inform our decision, which we intend to take by 31 October 2003. I would be happy to discuss this matter with hon. Members representing constituencies in those counties.

<a name="31006w12.html_para3">The court may attach supervisory conditions to an order for contact that may be for indirect rather than direct contact. We are providing &#163;2.5 million over the next three years from the Children's Fund to extend the provision of supervised contact.

<a name="31006w12.html_para4">Section 120 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 amended the Children Act 1989 to make it clear that when a court is considering whether a child has suffered or is likely to suffer harm, this harm includes harm a child may suffer as a result of witnessing the ill-treatment of another person. In addition the Safety Stakeholder Group has suggested revisions to the court forms used in applications for residence, contact, specific issues and prohibited steps to highlight allegations of domestic violence. This would enable domestic violence to be raised right at the beginning of proceedings and enable the judge more effectively to determine whether, and in what terms, any order should be made on the basis of all the available facts. The revised definition of harm and the changes to the court forms to highlight domestic violence will be implemented as soon as the necessary resources are identified.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs for what reason his powers of appointment to ecclesiastical livings referred to in paragraph 37 of the Consultation Paper on Reforming the Office of Lord Chancellor are described as the appointment of priests, but not to the appointment of clerks in holy orders, including deacons.

 A "Clerk in Holy Orders" is a generic designation, which covers those orders recognised by the Church of England, of which priests are one. The Lord Chancellor only appoints priests to those posts under his patronage.

<i>[holding answer 2 July 2003]:</i> No re-imbursement was made in relation to High Court judges' overnight accommodation. The average cost per night in each of the last four years is set out in the table. These figures are based on the total annual expenditure of the lodgings network and therefore not only include the costs of providing accommodation, travel and subsistence for High Court judiciary and their clerks, but also the accommodation overheads (i.e. rent, rates, capital charge) of the lodgings themselves.

To ask the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs what action the Government is taking to make access to legal advice more readily available to poor people.  [131658]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The key aim of the Community Legal Service (CLS) is to provide greater access to advice services to everyone within England and Wales. Financial eligibility limits apply to the provision of publicly funded Legal Help, ensuring that public funding is targeted to assist those on low incomes. In addition, through the work of over 200 CLS Partnerships, and supported by initiatives such as the Partnership Initiative Budget and the Legal Services Commission's Methods of Delivery Pilots, we are devising new ways of delivering frontline legal advice services to local communities. Regional Legal Service Committees and CLS Partnerships are responsible for co-ordinating the delivery of legal and advice services in their area and through an analysis of local legal needs, can ensure that resources are more effectively targeted to help the socially excluded and other vulnerable groups.

 Legal aid expenditure for immigration and asylum forms part of a single asylum fund jointly owned by the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Home Office.

 The Cheshire Advisory Committee is responsible for the recruitment of lay magistrates in Warrington.

 There are no proposals to change the relationship between the Crown Dependencies, the Crown and the UK.

<P>
<a name="31006w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Supreme Courts Act 1981 established the Court of Appeal, the High Court and the Crown Court, collectively, as the Supreme Court of England and Wales. The Court of Appeal is divided into Criminal Division, which hears appeals from the Crown Court, and the Court Martial and Civil Division, which hears appeals mainly against decisions in the High Court and county court. The High Court has three divisions: Chancery Division, Queens Bench Division and Family Division, each of which exercises appellate jurisdiction and handles different types of civil work. The Crown Court is responsible for trials of indictable offences, appeals from magistrates courts and cases for sentence.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not made any recent assessment of lottery funding specifically for projects in seaside towns. However, since the introduction of the National Lottery Act 1998, and changes to policy directions, distributors have increasingly focussed on areas of social and economic deprivation, including seaside resorts. The Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of the country should have access to lottery funds. Many areas, suffering wider social and economic deprivation, need extra support to develop and put in applications of a quality that will succeed. The National

This Department is expected to be fully compliant with the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations by the required date of 21 May 2004. No estimate has been made of the cost of these actions so far or of the likely future cost. However, the majority of the Estate occupied by this Department was transferred, for value, to Land Securities Trillium in 1998. Under the terms of the contract they are responsible for arranging and funding the surveys and risk assessments and also taking necessary action for the removal or management of any asbestos found.

Jobcentre Plus employs temporary workers for a number of reasons, for example, to help manage peaks of work and to aid release of permanent staff for training and preparation for major business change.
<BR>
All Jobcentre Plus permanent staff are recruited through procedures and criteria which meet the Civil Service Commissioners' rigorous fair and open competition criteria. However, to support flexibility and responsiveness Jobcentre Plus generally does not recruit temporary staff through such procedures, as they are only being recruited to meet a short-term need. All temporary staff are recruited through a procedure that includes an initial application form, a sift, an interview, and the completion of pre-appointment checks. The Department recommends that at least three applicants are interviewed for each post. Equality of opportunity is central to all the Department's personnel and recruitment policies.




<P>
<P><I>6 Oct 2003 : Column 1053W</I><P>

<BR>
Jobcentre Plus informs temporary staff of the length of time they are likely to work for us by specifying the duration of their temporary contracts. This situation is then kept under review in relation to any changing business needs. Temporary contracts can be extended, up to a maximum of 51 weeks.
<BR>
Managers at all levels of the business discuss with their trade union representatives Jobcentre Plus overall staffing requirements on an ongoing basis. In particular, these discussions cover the need for recruitment or promotion exercises, redeployment of staff, or the need to manage staff reductions. Discussions take into account the established policies within the Department for Work and Pensions for dealing with these issues&#151;policies which have been subject to consultation with the trade unions at Departmental level.
<BR>
In the case of managing staff reductions Jobcentre Plus has agreed principles for redundancy avoidance and handling with the trade unions which set out a number of measures to avoid redundancies of permanent staff. These measures make specific reference to reducing or eliminating the use of casual/temporary staff and contract employees.
<BR>
Between April 2002 and February 2003, Jobcentre Plus London region reduced its permanent staffing through a combination of staff moving to The Pension Service, other parts of the Department for Work and Pensions, other Government Departments and through natural wastage. In reaching the reduction in staffing figures, no permanent members of staff were dismissed or made redundant.
<BR>
A number of meetings, at both Regional and District level, have taken place with trade union representatives since last summer about the deployment of staff across London region. These meetings have also been supplemented by correspondence. Headcount target figures were shared with trade union regional colleagues in September 2002, and a discussion on measures required to manage towards those workforce numbers took place at a meeting on 25 September 2002.
<BR>
Subsequently, specific plans for releasing temporary workers were discussed with union representatives in January 2003. Detailed letters followed this meeting together with a further meeting, which took place in February 2003.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

<i>[holding answer 18 September 2003]:</i> In very exceptional circumstances the effect of applying the normal formula will be that some pensioners will receive a reward of &#163;1.20 instead of 60 pence for each extra pound of qualifying income. This may happen if the Pension Credit recipient is also receiving a working tax credit, spousal maintenance, or a social security benefit which does not count as rewardable income. It will only occur if their total income brought to account is greater than their appropriate guarantee level but the income which counts for the savings credit is less than the guarantee level. If this happens the pensioner will be able to ask the Pension Service for an explanation.

 The Government's Powering Future Vehicles Strategy, published in July 2002 and available via the Department's website, sets out our plans for promoting the development, introduction and take-up of clean, low carbon vehicle technologies and fuels in the UK. We will be publishing a first progress report on the implementation of this Strategy very shortly. Emissions of key air pollutants from motor vehicles are set to fall by about 30 per cent. over the next decade as progressively tighter European regulations come into effect for new vehicles, and as older, more polluting vehicles drop out of circulation. The Government is also playing a constructive role in discussions in Europe on future vehicle emission standards for the period from 2010 onwards.

 The Government is always prepared to consider supporting the introduction and use of clean fuels where these offer proven environmental benefits. We have an excellent track record of incentivising cleaner fuels by means of fuel duty incentives. Decisions on fuel duty levels are a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. My Department also runs a number of grant programmes which can help support the introduction of clean, low-carbon vehicles and fuels. Details of these are available via the Transport Energy website at http://www.fransportenergv.org.uk .

<P>
<a name="31006w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 There are no international airworthiness standards in respect of tethered balloons for passenger transport.
<P>

<a name="31006w17.html_para6">In the UK, the Air Navigation Order 2000 exempts such aircraft, described as captive balloons, from the requirement to be registered and thus from any airworthiness certification requirement. Tethered balloons carrying passengers are treated as fairground rides and their safety standards have been regulated by the Health and Safety Executive, rather than the Civil Aviation Authority. The Department for Transport accordingly has had no duties relating to the airworthiness of tethered balloons.
<P>

<a name="31006w17.html_para7">Some other European countries have required tethered balloons to be registered and established national airworthiness certification requirements. Such requirements have been the responsibility of the states concerned and the Government has had no reason to research their safety regimes. UK produced tethered balloons sold into these countries have been required to meet national requirements which has caused some practical difficulties due to those states' unfamiliarity with UK Health and Safety Executive regulations.
<P>

<a name="31006w17.html_para8">EC Regulation 1592/2002 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency came into force in September 2002. Its primary objective is to establish and maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation in Europe and an additional objective is to facilitate the free movement of goods, persons and services. The regulation lays down safety essential airworthiness requirements for aircraft and aviation products within its scope, which includes tethered balloons, and empowers the agency to establish the type certification basis for each aircraft, to issue the appropriate type certificates and to conduct, either itself or through national aviation authorities, the technical inspections associated with such certification. This system will facilitate the marketing of aircraft, such as captive balloons, throughout the Community.
<P>

<a name="31006w17.html_para9">The agency is required to take up its certification responsibilities by 28 September. Commission Regulations detailing how these responsibilities will be implemented are being drawn up to a very tight timetable and should be finalised very shortly. The UK has been fully involved in the process of drawing up these implementing regulations. The regulations will include transitional provisions to ensure that all aircraft types currently used in member states can continue to be used after 28 September, including UK built tethered balloons.
<P>

<a name="31006w17.html_para10">There are also provisions to give grandfather rights to a large range of aircraft and products certified under previous regimes. Under specified conditions, the type certification basis for certain products will be deemed to be an EASA certification basis: this will apply to a number of types of tethered balloons certified in other member states. Such provisions cannot apply to UK designed balloons because there has been no UK type certification basis for them. The agency has to establish 



<P>
<P><I>6 Oct 2003 : Column 1058W</I><P>
an EASA certification basis for these aircraft and work is in hand to draft the appropriate certification specification (Certification Specification 31 Tethered Gas Balloons, known as CS 31 TGB). The agency is using a team of national expert put together by the Joint Aviation Authorities to develop this specification, industry will be consulted and it is expected to be adopted early in 2004.
<P>

<a name="31006w17.html_para11">EASA arrangements for outsourcing tasks to national aviation authorities will allow the CAA to carry out a range of certification activities on behalf of the agency after 28 September and we understand that the CAA could quickly begin the necessary certification work for UK tethered balloons on the basis of the current draft of the certification specification. The authority has been in touch with the manufacturer of tethered balloons in the UK about the EASA developments and will endeavour to ensure as smooth a transition to the new system as possible.

<a name="31006w18.html_para0">The Department's catering services are all contracted out, with the contractor recovering costs through the sale of services.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will list the <i>(a)</i> unclaimed and <i>(b)</i> returned sums from each local authority's local transport plans for the last year for which figures are available.  [129721]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Most capital funds paid through the Local Transport Plan system to local authorities are subject to financial flexibilities which are sufficient to ensure that none are unclaimed or returned. The exceptions relate to funds allocated for major local transport schemes&#151;through grants under Section 56 of the Transport Act 1968, or through credit approvals.
<P>

<a name="31006w18.html_para4">As Section 56 grants are claimed in arrears and are subsequently subject to audit, local authorities invariably claim only as much as they need to cover works undertaken on a particular scheme in a particular financial year, and no grant needs to be returned. The authorities that claimed less than the full amount offered by the Government for major schemes in 2002&#150;03 are listed as follows.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the effect that the charge for lorries using the M6 toll road will have on lorry movements on the non-tolled M6 motorway.  [130970]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Since the announcement of the toll prices the Highways Agency have not carried out any assessment.
<P>

<a name="31006w18.html_para8">Following the opening of the Toll Road, the Highways Agency in conjunction with the Concessionaire will carry out a review of flows along the adjacent network together with flows on the toll road.
<P>

<a name="31006w18.html_para9">Under all charging scenarios, the net relief to the M6 was forecast to be quite small. Long distance through traffic which transfers onto the M6 Toll, which represents about one third of M6 traffic, will release capacity on the M6 which will be taken up by local traffic, thus providing significant relief to many local roads.

 The Secretary of State has no powers to alter the charges. Under the terms of the concession agreement signed in 1992, the Concessionaire (Midland Expressway Ltd.) is responsible for all aspects of the M6 toll's operation, including the level of tolls.

 No formal representation has been received from road hauliers and their associations on the proposals for the controlled use of the hard shoulder within the Active Traffic Management project. However, as part of the preparation for the trial of Active Traffic Management on the M42, the Highways Agency commissioned research to assess user attitudes to the Active Traffic Management proposals. The views of HGV drivers that use the M42 were sought as part of this work.
<P>

<a name="31006w19.html_para2">Representatives of the Highways Agency have also met and discussed the proposals for the M42 with a range of key stakeholders including the local emergency services.

 Figures are only readily available for the years 1995 and 2003. There were 9,979 vehicles in 1995 and 10,610 in 2003. This increase reflects both the fact that some operators have increased the number of services they provide and the statutory requirement to replace the Mark 1 rolling stock that is currently operated by the three franchises operating south of the river Thames (GoVia South Central, Connex South Eastern and South West Trains).

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w19.html_spnew12"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B>

<a name="31006w19.html_para9">Since 1997 the UK has implemented mandatory UN arms embargoes on Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Ethiopia/Eritrea and Liberia, an EU embargo on Indonesia and a unilateral embargo on Zimbabwe. The latter was superseded by an EU arms embargo in February 2002. The UN arms embargo on Sierra Leone from 1998 was in response to internal armed conflict between the rebel militia group, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), and the government. In 1999 an arms embargo was imposed on Afghanistan because of internal conflict. In 2000, a UN arms embargo was placed on Ethiopia/Eritrea due to armed conflict between the two states. It was terminated in 2001. The UN arms embargo on Liberia from 2001 was imposed (superseding the UN arms embargo UNSCR 788 (1992)) because Charles Taylor's government was supporting the RUF in Sierra Leone, and at war internally with a rebel opposition group, the Liberian United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD). The UN Security Council deemed that all of these conflicts represented a threat to international peace and security and therefore the Security Council acted under Chapter 7 of the Charter of the United Nations. An EU arms embargo was imposed on Indonesia in September 1999 because of conflict in East Timor; this was limited to four months and it fell away in January 2000. In February 2001, the UK imposed a unilateral arms embargo on Zimbabwe because of human rights violations involving repression by the government of the Zimbabwean public. In February 2002, the EU imposed an arms embargo against Zimbabwe for the same reason, which the UK now implements instead.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w19.html_spnew26"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The new controls will support the Government's commitment to human rights. Under current export controls, all licence applications received are assessed on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria that require the Government to give consideration to respect for human rights. The Government have made clear that these criteria will also form the basis for decisions on licence applications for exports subject to the new controls. By increasing the number of transactions subject to licensing, the new controls will increase the Government's ability to act to prevent human rights abuses.

And despite the deficit, Government have agreed to a Trustee proposal allowing members of the MPS to continue to receive inflation linked increases to their total pension (i.e. basic pension plus bonus) over the next three years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what support the Government offers to new small businesses in the North East.  [130736]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w22.html_spnew11"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Government support for new businesses comes in a variety of forms. The Business Link Operators (BLOs) put together programmes for start-up businesses, working with Enterprise Agencies and other partners, which are funded from a variety of sources, including: SBS core funding, residual SRB monies, RDA "single programme" funds, and European funds. In total, in the North East, the BLOs are spending around &#163;3.6 million on start-up programmes (such as BL Tees Valley's "Start Right in Business" programme), and are contributing around &#163;1.7 million to supporting incubation projects.
<P>

<a name="31006w22.html_para6">Support programmes vary in content between sub-regions, but essentially offer a programme of advice and assistance in key areas where new businesses require help, eg producing business plans to help access finance; developing marketing programmes, managing finance and cash flow, etc. They may be able to offer subsidies directly, or secure funding through other partners.
<P>

<a name="31006w22.html_para7">Help for start-up businesses does not end with the start-up programmes. LSC-funded workforce development, DTI-funded TPUK activities, and DTI's new products such as the R&D) grant are part of the wider range of services available via BLOs which may be appropriate for young businesses.
<P>

<a name="31006w22.html_para8">Access to Finance initiatives, such as the SBS-funded Regional Venture Capital fund (Capital North East) and Investor Readiness programmes (operated by Northern Enterprise and Entrust respectively), and the BL Tyne and Wear-operated regional Micro Loan fund can also benefit businesses in the early stage of operation, and lead to a more mature approach to business finance being inculcated into new businesses in a region where a grant culture has persisted. This is essential for the future growth prospects of businesses.
<P>

<a name="31006w22.html_para9">Start-up programmes in the North East are becoming better co-ordinated, with closer working between BLOs, Enterprise Agencies and other partners. Examples include the new start-up consortium in Tyne and Wear, closer working relationships in County Durham, and the "Start Right In Business" programme in Tees Valley. The on-going RDA-led review of business support process will develop these co-operative approaches further.
<P>

<a name="31006w22.html_para10">An RDA-led initiative "Strategy for Success" should lead, through the creation of centres of excellence and an DPR exploitation company, to the spin out of more businesses through the HEI sector.
<P>

<a name="31006w22.html_para11">At national level, SBS is co-ordinating the development of a cross-Government national strategy for start up businesses. This will draw on the experience and research from partners around the country to create a consistent, evidence-based start-up proposition, to which local variations may be added.

The strategy is also expected to develop ideas for reducing risk to individuals contemplating business start-up.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent discussions she has had with trade union representatives on the development of union learning representatives.  [130578]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="31006w23.html_para4">Union Learning Representatives are a key component of the Government's new Skills Strategy. In developing the strategy we consulted widely and met with trade union representatives on a number of occasions to discuss the vital role that unions and their learning representatives have to play. The TUC is, of course, a key member of the Skills Alliance which will bring together Government, employers and trade unions to oversee the future development and delivery of the Skills Strategy.
<P>

<a name="31006w23.html_para5">Union Learning Representatives have already proved to be highly effective in helping to encourage workers to improve their skills, particularly workers with low skills and those with literacy and numeracy problems&#151;the very people who so often miss out on learning opportunities. That is why we introduced legislation to give them statutory backing and rights to time off with pay which came into effect at the end of April 2003. This will help to reinforce the invaluable role that Union Learning Representatives are currently playing in the workplace to promote workforce development and open up new training opportunities for their colleagues.
<P>

<a name="31006w23.html_para6">There are currently around 6,500 Union Learning Representatives. The new statutory rights will help their numbers to grow and we look forward to seeing a national network of over 22,000 trained Union Learning Representatives in place by 2010, helping over 250,000 workers a year into learning.

<a name="31006w26.html_para1">The estimates represent the reduction in tax liabilities from investment in ISAs. They do not indicate the yield from abolishing ISAs since in practice this could result in significant and uncertain changes in taxpayers' behaviour because of the range of alternative investment options. Therefore, no estimate is available of this yield.
<P>

<a name="31006w26.html_para2">There is no available estimate of the effect of ISAs on total savings. Overall, ISAs have attracted a wide range of individuals of different ages and income, whose savings experience will vary widely. They have attracted more younger and lower income savers than TESSAs and PEPs.
<P>

<a name="31006w26.html_para3">The relief in any particular year is derived from subscriptions built up over a number of years, including the current year. In 2000&#150;01, the latest year for which estimates are available, contributions in excess of half of the current limits represented around 40 per cent. of the total. Assuming a similar distribution of contributions in every year since the introduction of ISAs would imply that the costs of relief given in the table would have been 40 per cent. lower each year.

<P>
<a name="31006w28.html_spnew0"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 "Modernising the taxation of the haulage industry&#151;lorry road-user charge&#151;Progress Report Two", published on 6 May 2003 and available in the Library of the House, described the Government's plans to develop the lorry road-user charge, alongside an offsetting cut in hauliers' fuel duty. Since then Customs and Excise have been working very closely with the haulage industry and with other stakeholders to refine the detailed requirements of the Charge. This is necessary before the tendering process can begin.
<P>

<a name="31006w28.html_para0">The charge is a new and complex development, and it will therefore be some time before we will be certain about when it can be introduced.
<P>

<a name="31006w28.html_para1">The Government and the haulage industry want to ensure that the Charge will work reliably and as intended when it goes live. In the meantime our plan remains to introduce the Charge in 2006.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w28.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he intends that British road hauliers will have to pay vehicle excise duty for individual lorries when he implements the scheme for road use charges.  [130967]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w28.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government stated in "Modernisation the taxation of the haulage industry: progress report two", published in May 2003, that when introduced the distance based lorry user charge will be offset though tax cuts in fuel duty.
<P>

<a name="31006w28.html_para2">Decisions about vehicle excise duty for lorries will be made separately by the Chancellor as part of the normal Budget decision making process.

A copy of the report has been sent to all Members of Parliament and is also available on the FCO's website (www.fco.gov.uk). The report includes details of projects funded under the FCO's Human Rights Project Fund which has spent &#163;17 million over five years on over 600 human rights projects in more than 90 countries.

 Any proposal for sanctions, secondary or otherwise needs to be looked at on a case-by-case basis.

The UK therefore seeks to work with the international community where it can to prevent sanctions breaches.

 Where the United Nations Security Council has adopted a resolution deciding that states shall prohibit the supply of military and police training to specified countries or forces, the UK will generally implement this by making statutory instruments under the United Nations Act 1946 applicable to the UK, Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. Where the European Union has acted swiftly to implement a UN Security Council Resolution by an EC Regulation, the EC Regulation will be directly applicable in the UK and Gibraltar, and the UK and Gibraltar will legislate only to provide penalties for the breach of the Regulation in those territories.

Legislation will also generally provide ancillary powers to enforce the prohibition, for example, powers for the obtaining of evidence and information, and provisions for criminal proceedings and penalties. Penalties on summary conviction will generally be imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine not exceeding &#163;5,000 or both, and on conviction on indictment, imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or an unlimited fine or both.

 The Bonn-Berlin process (a German initiative involving the UN Secretariat and supported by the UK) on the design and implementation of arms embargoes and travel and aviation related sanctions in 2001, considered the question of whether the UN Security Council should adopt lists of military goods to which UN arms embargoes would apply. The participants concluded that it was important to agree a list of goods prior to the introduction of a UN resolution with the assistance of the UN Secretariat. If there were divergent views on the list, arbitration should be provided by the UN Secretary-General.
<P>

<a name="31006w32.html_para2">However, due to lack of consensus among Security Council members, these proposals were never adopted. UK sanctions policy focuses upon and encourages the use of sanctions that are appropriately targeted and effectively implemented and enforced.

 I issued a press statement on 15 September condemning the Government of Zimbabwe for this latest attack on the free and independent media in Zimbabwe. I made it clear that we regard the closure of the <i>Daily News</i> as a blatant attempt by the Government of Zimbabwe to stifle independent scrutiny and silence democratic voices in Zimbabwe. With our support the EU also issued a declaration on 18 September, condemning the closure of the <i>Daily News</i> and describing it as a serious attack on freedom of information in Zimbabwe. I issued a further press statement on 20 September. We will continue to press for the <i>Daily News</i> to be allowed to resume publication.

Ofsted look at how schools and local education authorities provide for all children, including those with special educational needs such as autistic spectrum disorders. They are currently carrying out a thematic study of how local education authorities and schools are implementing the inclusion framework introduced as a result of the SEN and Disability Act 2001 and this should be published in 2004. Information about Ofsted reports can be found at www. ofsted.gov.uk.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to the answer of 1 September 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 719W, on CAFCASS, how many private law cases were unallocated <i>(a)</i> less than 10 weeks and <i>(b)</i> more than 10 weeks before a CAFCASS report is filed at court.  [131177]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w35.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 CAFCASS's target is that at least 95 per cent. of requests in a month should be allocated 10 weeks before a report is filed at court. A benchmark of 10 weeks is used because this is the timescale required for an officer to complete relevant inquiries and meet the deadline for filing the report with the court. It also enables the service to be flexible when dealing with urgent cases that arise with shorter filing dates.
<P>

<a name="31006w35.html_para0">In July 2003, CAFCASS dealt with 3,200 private law cases. Of these, 385 cases were unallocated less than 10 weeks before a report was filed at court. This is 4.7 per cent. of the caseload and achieved the target. 1,236 private law cases were unallocated more than 10 weeks before a report was filed at court.

 On 19 May, my hon. Friend the then Health Minister, Jacqui Smith launched a booklet for practitioners who have concerns about the welfare of children. "What To Do If You're Worried A Child Is Being Abused" was published jointly by six Government Departments and is aimed at all practitioners who come into contact with children, parents and/or families in the course of their work.
<P>

<a name="31006w35.html_para1">The booklet contains a short section on sharing information. This steers practitioners through the process of deciding whether to share information, and if so, what to share and with whom.

We are putting in place a central team to learn lessons and develop a national framework for local information sharing systems. We will have early lessons from the trailblazers by December 2003, and more detailed information by late summer 2004. By the end of 2004, we aim to set out how the lessons from the trailblazers can be reflected across the country. As part of this, the Government will examine the potential benefits and risks of introducing ICT-based information sharing systems at local authority level.

In the case of reserved policies, the relevant Whitehall Department is responsible for observing the convention when making reserved policy decisions, and for consulting the Devolved Administrations as necessary. Examples of reserved policies covered by the convention are: asylum and immigration (Home Office), international development (DfID) and defence policies (MOD).

 Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) teaches pupils about social and moral differences, including aggressive behaviour. Specifically in primary schools, pupils are taught how to get help, to realise the consequences of anti-social and aggressive behaviour, and to resolve differences by looking at alternatives. There are opportunities for schools to address violence, including domestic violence, through the framework of PSHE and Citizenship. In Citizenship, for example, pupils can discuss the impact of domestic violence and challenge the belief that domestic violence is inevitable and acceptable.

<a name="31006w36.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Government is not currently operating an Earned Autonomy scheme, as defined in the Education Act 2002. Instead, it has taken a number of steps to extend autonomy across the school system more generally. In relation to teachers' pay and conditions, specific new freedoms have been introduced from 1 September this year which mean that schools have a greater degree of flexibility in relation to certain pay decisions. Changes to the curriculum at Key Stage 4 set out in the strategy document 14&#150;19: Opportunity and Excellence will enable schools to respond more flexibly to the needs of their pupils. We have established the Implementation Review Unit&#151;a Panel of serving head teachers and other school staff to identify areas where schools can be freed from bureaucracy and red tape. The Power to Innovate offers all schools the chance to apply for innovative projects that would otherwise be blocked by education legislation. The Government is keeping under review whether to introduce an Earned Autonomy scheme as provided for in the 2002 Act.

 The Department is working closely with ODPM on actions required to implement the European Directive on energy performance. ODPM believe that many of the requirements of the directive can be implemented through changes to the Building Regulations and to Approved Document Part L2 (the next revision being due in 2005). As schools are required to comply with building regulations, any changes in energy performance requirements will apply to schools.

<i>[holding answer 18 June 2003]:</i> The Department for Education and Skills is working in partnership with LEA and school representatives to identify changes that need to be made to the funding system for 2004&#150;05 so that all schools can expect to receive a reasonable per pupil settlement in that year. We have been discussing how best to ensure sufficient funding increases for every LEA; the right balance between support through general grant and through ring-fenced and targeted grant; how to give confidence that schools and pupils will receive the money intended for them; the right balance between school and LEA central provision; how to ensure that that variations in the budget increases received by different schools within each LEA are appropriate and fair; and how work force reform, in line with the National Agreement, can be sustained. We will aim to ensure that changes are in place in good time to allow LEAs and schools to plan for 2004&#150;05 and so provide increased predictability and stability in school funding.

 On 1 September I met with sixth form college employers' and union representatives to discuss funding for sixth form colleges. The outcome of the Spending Review 2002 provides a good settlement for the FE sector. In 2003&#150;04 assumed total funding for further education allocated to the Learning and Skills Council has increased by 6 per cent. in real terms compared with 2002&#150;03. The funding allocated to the Learning and Skills Council also assumes there will be year on year real terms increases in total funding 



<P>

for further education of 7 per cent. in 2004&#150;05 and 5 per cent. in 2005&#150;06. Sixth form colleges are independent organisations. It is for them to determine the level of pay increases for their staff in negotiation with the trade unions within the resources available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what information he collates on possible changes to the pattern of student enrolment paying <i>(a)</i> controlled undergraduate fees and <i>(b)</i> undergraduate fees as a result of his student support proposals.  [129991]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w40.html_spnew0"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 We do not have any specific estimates of the possible change to the pattern of student number enrolments as we do not know which universities will be charging the variable fees and which will be charging controlled fees. However initial analysis suggests that we can expect enrolment to continue to rise over the course of the decade. We continue to monitor enrolment through a number of sources such as UCAS, HESA and HEFCE.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w40.html_spnew1"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The opportunity costs incurred by students participating in higher education (HE) comprise the earnings they could have earned had they not been studying net of the income they receive through working during their studies. Both these income streams vary between individuals.
<P>

<a name="31006w40.html_para0">Individuals with two or more A-levels who have been in the labour market for up to three years have average net annual earnings of around &#163;8,300 <sup>1</sup> . Over a three year, full-time HE course this would be equivalent to around &#163;25,000 in foregone earnings.
<P>

<a name="31006w40.html_para1">However, many students also work while studying. Student Income and Expenditure Survey (SIES) data indicate that full-time first-degree students typically earn around &#163;5,000 <sup>2</sup>  over the duration of their course. This means that an overall opportunity cost for full-time first-degree students who enter with two or more A-levels is on average around &#163;20,000. However, this average figure will vary widely between individual students.

<P>
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 11 September 2003]:</i> Testing of all pupils at the end of each key stage of education provides objective evidence, against a national standard, of what children have learned in the core subjects. Teacher assessment is an important part of the overall statutory assessment framework and covers the full range and scope of the programmes of study, taking into account evidence of achievement in a range of contexts, including that gained through discussion and observation.

[129890]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w40.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend has made no such estimate. Provisional statistics on teacher and support staff numbers and teacher vacancies at January 2003 were published in April in Statistical First Release 10/2003. Statistics released on 9 September provided regional and LEA level breakdowns of these figures. Provisional national figures for January 2004 are due to be published next April. As I made clear in my reply to the hon. Member of 8 September 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 112w, the broad assessment of changes in teaching staff numbers made by my Department in liaison with local education authorities (LEAs) in May this year did not provide a definitive picture.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w40.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 My Department has moved from a system which obliges teacher training providers to aim for a particular intake target to one that incentivises them to recruit as many good candidates as they can in the areas where new teachers are needed most. That is why 4,000 more conventional teacher training places and over 5,000 more employment-based training places will be funded in 2003/04 than were being funded in 1996/97. The table shows the number of conventional teacher training places funded in 2002/03 by subject and phase; the number of entrants who took up these places; and the number of recruits to employment-based teacher training in that year. Numbers of funded employment-based training places are not specified in advance by subject or phase.

 The Teenage Pregnancy Unit was established in 1999 with a cross Whitehall remit to manage implementation of the Strategy. The first independent evaluation report of the Strategy, published in 2002, commended the joint working between the Teenage Pregnancy Unit, Regional Teenage Pregnancy Co-ordinators based in Government Offices and Local Teenage Pregnancy Co-ordinators who lead the implementation of strategies in each top tier local authority. The second annual report of the national evaluation will be published shortly.
<P>

<a name="31006w41.html_para0">The report acknowledged the success of these arrangements as a major factor in wielding influence at local level. The effectiveness of joint working was also recognised in the first annual report of the Independent Advisory Group on Teenage Pregnancy, published in 2001. The importance of joint working was reinforced in the second annual report of the Independent Advisory Group on Teenage Pregnancy, published in July 2003.
<P>

<a name="31006w41.html_para1">There are very encouraging signs that the Government's overall teenage pregnancy strategy is working. Data for 2001 published in February by the Office for National Statistics shows that conceptions among under 18-year-olds in England fell by 3 per cent. and represents a total reduction of 10 per cent. since 1998. For under 16s, the rate is 4 per cent. lower than in 2000 and represents a 10 per cent. reduction since 1998.

 The next Continuous Attitude Survey (CAS) for the Royal Navy will be issued at the end of September with a report expected at the end of December 2003. For the Army the next survey is scheduled to be sent out in December with a report due in the spring. For the RAF the next survey will be issued on 1 November with the results reported later next year. The RAF report with the 2002 results will however be produced on 1 November. All three reports are produced electronically and distributed to internal stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="31006w43.html_para0">Copies of the questions asked in each of the CASs are held in the Library of the House. There are no immediate plans to publish the answers. We are however reviewing the range of survey material to release and appropriate ways of putting it into the public domain.

 The Defence Diversification Agency (DDA) was created in 1999 as part of the then Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). In July 2001 the DDA became part of the Ministry of Defence head office when QinetiQ plc and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratories were created out of DERA.
<P>

<a name="31006w43.html_para2">Over the four years it has been operating the DDA has made very good progress. It has assisted over 2,000 firms with access to MOD's knowledge bases and

 The Department's estate strategy was set out in 'In Trust and On Trust', published in 2000. The aim is to create a defence estate of the right size, shape and location through corporate management of the estate. The implementation of this strategy has informed our active engagement in the Independent Review on Public Sector Relocation&#151;the Lyons Review&#151;and will continue to do so.
<P>

<a name="31006w43.html_para3">In recent years the Department has relocated a significant amount of defence activity from London.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w43.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence and the United States Army have been working together on a collaborative research programme into the Electro-Magnetic gun at Dundrennan range, in Kirkcudbright, since 1993. In December 2002, we jointly signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the US to continue this long-standing project agreement until 2009.
<P>

<a name="31006w43.html_para4">Extensive tests have proven that the electro-magnetic radiation from the gun is negligible and that it has no effect on the environment.
<P>

<a name="31006w43.html_para5">The safe operation of defence ranges is of paramount importance. Safety procedures at Dundrennan have been tried and tested over the last 10 years without incident. Risk assessments are conducted prior to each series of firings and strict operating procedures are followed. Safety procedures are constantly reviewed and updated in line with the progress of the trial, and all safety procedures are independently audited.
<P>

<a name="31006w43.html_para6">We have received a limited number of representations from the local community regarding the possible dangers associated with the Electro-Magnetic gun testing at Dundrennan. The correspondence received specifically focuses on the perceived use of depleted uranium, but also reflects some general concerns, which have been generated by articles in the press. The Electro-Magnetic gun's projectiles do not contain depleted uranium, nor do they contain any explosives.
<P>

<a name="31006w43.html_para7">The high velocity of the projectile round generates the penetrative effect, not the projectile's mass or density.

The Agency, which will be capability focussed, will, inter alia, promote and enhance European armaments co-operation with the aim of contributing to the military equipment needs of member states in a cost effective and efficient manner. The Government's view of the Commission's initiative to develop European armaments related proposals are set out in the Explanatory Memorandum on European Community Document entitled: "Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Social and Economic Committee of the Regions "European Defence&#151;Industrial and Market Issues: Towards an EU Defence Equipment Policy" Reference Number 8484/03 [COM (2003) 113 final] dated 15 May 2003, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House.

 As part of the agreement signed in March 1995 to acquire C-130J aircraft, 24 C-130K Hercules aircraft were returned to Lockheed Martin Aero between November 2000 and July 2002 in part exchange. There are no plans for the Department to re-acquire any of these.

<P>
<a name="31006w45.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In all of these considerations our overriding aim is to maintain effective relations on both sides of the Atlantic. At the same time, based on the Government's open and transparent defence industrial policy, we will continue to press for increased market access for United Kingdom defence companies in both the United States and Europe.

 The Government continues to do all it can to support the United States Administration in its scrutiny of the waiver for the United Kingdom from the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations. An amendment to the State Department Authorizations Bill, to support a waiver for the UK, is to be discussed in the autumn in Conference between the Senate and House of Representatives. It goes without saying that the Government would very much regret any attempt by Congress to impose damaging restrictions on the ability of UK companies to access the US defence market, which could only be detrimental to our mutual interests.

In addition, the European Commission in its Communication, "Towards an EU Defence Equipment Policy" (COM 2003 113 final of 11 March 2003), has proposed an impact analysis to establish the value of any Community-level legislative initiative to simplify intra-community transfers of defence-related goods. Work on this will start at the end of 2004.

 The information is not held in the form requested. The amount of military low flying that takes place in the United Kingdom is expressed in hours rather than by number of sorties, which can vary significantly from minutes to several hours. A statement on the Pattern of Low Flying Across the UK is published annually, with copies placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The statement for the training year 2002&#150;03 records that foreign-based aircraft were booked into the UK Low Flying System for some 174 hours (this figure covers all foreign aircraft with the exception of United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) aircraft which are based in the UK). The total amount of booked low flying by all military aircraft was some 47,058 hours.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w45.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 Low flying tactics have been used in military conflicts in the Balkans, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq. Although fast jet low flying has not been employed in all of these conflicts, I can confirm that a number of fast jet sorties were flown at low level during the recent operation in Iraq. The heights at which operational sorties are undertaken vary according to the assessed threat at the time. Details of the number of sorties and the heights at which they were flown are not held centrally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w45.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 Low flying in the United Kingdom by non UK-based foreign air forces, whether in RAF-led exercises or any other training, is closely controlled and generally only permitted on a reciprocal basis. Foreign aircrew are bound by the same restrictions as those that apply to UK aircrew, but additionally are not generally permitted to operate under more favourable conditions than those applied to our forces in the country concerned. All foreign aircrew receive a face to face brief from an appropriately qualified member of British forces before they can operate in the UK Low Flying System.

 Low flying military exercises are not generally conducted by foreign air forces alone. The number of pilots involved in low flying is not recorded centrally. The amount of low flying by foreign military aircraft is typically less than 1 per cent. of all the low flying training that takes place in the United Kingdom.

 RAF Fylingdales has operated as a ballistic missile early warning station for some 40 years, and provides an essential component of United Kingdom defences. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence told the House on 15 January 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 698, we are satisfied that the upgrade of the radar at RAF Fylingdales for missile defence purposes will also be in the national interest. The Ministry of Defence is negotiating an annex to the recently signed Ballistic Missile Defence Memorandum of Understanding with the United States to cover the upgrade, and is discussing with the US the operational arrangements for its use in missile defence. These agreements will ensure that UK interests are protected.

Force undertake a minimum of 62 hours Elementary Flying Training (EFT) during their first year, before being streamed for fast jet, rotary wing or multi-engine pilot training. Flying hours will then depend on which aircraft type their training has undertaken. For example, fast jet trainees normally undertake 130 hours Basic Fast Jet Training, 70 hours Advanced Flying Training and 52 hours Tactical Weapons Training following completion of EFT, over a further two-year period. All students undertake relevant ground school training prior to each flying phase.

 A study was commissioned by the Royal Air Force into the potential for commercial development at RAF Lyneham, which reported in March 2002. This included investigation into the potential for both passenger and freight services. It revealed minimal potential for the site mainly due to the vicinity of other airports and the need for considerable investment for a likely minimal return.

The Strategy sets standards for the pollutants of main concern and target dates for their achievement between 2003 and 2010. It also explains the measures that are in place to reduce emissions of harmful pollutants from all sectors. Copies are available via the Department's website at www.defra.gov.uk/environment/airquality.

This is as a result of the measures that have been implemented to reduce emissions of these pollutants, and their precursors, particularly from road transport and industry.

Defra has also produced a model food procurement action plan with guidance for completion that includes an objective concerned with opening up opportunities for local providers to compete for business. The guidance takes account of the Government's policy of achieving value for money in public procurement, and its commitment under the EC rules to ensure that public procurement is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. We are also taking a number of other steps to integrate sustainable development into the public procurement of food and catering services. We have had bilateral meetings at Ministerial and senior management level (including with representatives of local government) and have published a number of case studies.

 In 2001, 2,332,000 tonnes of hazardous waste were disposed to landfill in England and Wales. Projections for future years are affected by a range of factors, including the likely increase in costs of treatment and disposal as a result of requirements in the Landfill Directive, and the impact of these changes in costs on producers efforts to minimise waste. Changes to the hazardous waste list are likely to increase the amount of hazardous waste to be consigned. These and other factors are currently being investigated in support of work on possible scenarios for the hazardous waste forum, which is due to report in the autumn.

 A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) of the Landfill Directive in England and Wales was published with the Second Consultation Paper on Implementation of Council Directive (1999/31/EC) on the Landfill of Waste. This is available on the Defra website (www.defra.gov.uk). The RIA points out that increasing disposal costs will provide greater impetus to minimise, recycle and re-use waste and hence move the management of waste up the waste hierarchy. This outcome is a major objective of the Government's environmental policy and is supported by business, non-Government organisations and Select Committees of this House.
<P>

<a name="31006w49.html_para9">The RIA indicates that at the extreme, waste producers will face an additional cost in the range of &#163;97 million to &#163;696 million. Part of this increased cost relates to landfilling hazardous waste; this fell into the range of &#163;15 million to &#163;87 million.
<P>

<a name="31006w49.html_para10">The RIA recognises that many of the potential benefits cannot be quantified but believes that a number will be of local significance where they result in a reduced impact of existing landfills. These benefits relate principally to reducing health and environmental risks and by promoting more sustainable options as set out above. The RIA also draws attention to benefits from investment in treatment technologies and rising landfill standards that could result in new opportunities for business.

 The purpose of discussions about loss insurance for disease outbreaks is to explore ways to reduce the cost to taxpayers of such outbreaks. For animal diseases a working group which Defra set up with representatives of the insurance and livestock sectors met several times last year. The group has completed its initial task and we are now working on proposals for the livestock sector to bear a greater share of the cost of animal diseases. While there is no cost to taxpayers from crop diseases, wider discussions on crop insurance generally were held last year by a joint Defra/HM Treasury working group on farm risk management, with representatives from the finance and arable sectors.

The raw data came from Mineral Planning Authorities but two of the largest authorities were unable to produce accurate survey data and assumptions were made based on previous information.

 In collaboration with the Forestry Commission, English Nature, and the Countryside Commission for Wales, Defra is currently undertaking a survey of a sample of areas of wild-growing Rhododendron ponticum in order to establish the extent of the presence of Phytophthora ramorum and the likely impact on our native flora. To date 56 such sites have been inspected for the presence of the organism but it has been found on only two sites, both of which are in the area of an existing confirmed outbreak.

 The Government believe the public should have as much information as possible about this disease and is happy to meet all reasonable requests for information. However, the information obtained specifically in relation to individual premises has been gathered in pursuance of the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate's statutory powers and on the basis of this information, where necessary, enforcement notices are issued to ensure compliance. In the absence of a statutory obligation to publish details identifying individual premises, to publish such details without consent could seriously jeopardise our ability to work with business in relation to the reporting and control of Phytophthora ramorum.

 It is unlikely that we will be able to determine exactly how long Phytophthora ramorum has been present in rhododendrons and related plants in this country. However, surveys are currently being conducted to establish how widespread the disease is and this may give an indication of how long it has been present.
<P>

<a name="31006w51.html_para1">In addition, the literature has been reviewed for records of Phytophthora species on rhododendrons in the UK. The established authority "Pathogens of Trees and Shrubs" by Pearce, published in 1963, states that at that time there was no evidence of any Phytophthora on rhododendrons. The first record of a Phytophthora species on this host was in 1968. Phytophthora ramorum was first described as a new species in October 2001 and first found in the UK in April 2002.

 Schedule 1 to the PPC Regulations categorises installations subject to integrated pollution prevention and control into Part A(1) and Part A(2).

<P>

<a name="31006w52.html_para1">As my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Housing and Planning announced on 17 July, <i>Official Report</i>, column 53WS, the Government are consulting on an update of the existing nationwide guidance on planning for affordable housing, and the public consultation period runs until October 31. The update will be supported by practice advice. The update addresses a number of matters including the provision of affordable housing in rural areas. The proposed changes give greater flexibility to local authorities to seek affordable housing on smaller sites where this is justified. It is also envisaged that in rural areas affordable housing provision may be supported by allocating sites solely for affordable housing, on land within or adjoining existing villages, which would not otherwise be released for housing and where this would contribute to the attainment of mixed communities.

<a name="31006w52.html_para6">While a change in sea temperature could affect stock distribution, spawning, migratory patterns and survival of very young fish, the effect of long term temperature trends on fish stocks is not easy to predict. Increased sea temperature has been linked to reduced recruitment (the 



<P>
<P><I>6 Oct 2003 : Column 1194W</I><P>
numbers of young fish entering the population) in cold-water species such as cod, and improved recruitment in other species such as bass, but the factors influencing the survival of fish are complex and in many cases still poorly understood. For heavily fished species, fishing pressure remains the primary control on stock size but recruitment success also has a significant impact.

Licensed electricity suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales are subject to the Renewables Obligation&#151;requiring them to supply a specified and growing amount of their sales from electricity generated from a range of eligible renewable sources. The Obligation is backed up by a package of funding worth nearly &#163;350 million. This is divided between: capital grants, which are available to help kickstart a range of new and emerging technologies, for example, offshore wind, wave and tidal power and solar photovoltaics; and the New & Renewable R&D programme.

 As the licensing of zoos is a function for local authorities, there are no central records for the numbers of different species kept in zoos. The British Llama and Alpaca Association's own figures indicate that there are in the region of 2,700 llamas and 4,500&#150;5,500 alpacas in private ownership in the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w54.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The advice received from the Zoos Forum is that New World Camelids such as llamas and alpacas have not been kept in this country in sufficient numbers for sufficient time for them to be considered "normally domesticated in Great Britain" and they therefore fall within the scope of zoo licensing legislation.
<P>

<a name="31006w54.html_para0">Keepers of llamas and alpacas wishing to exhibit their animals to the public for seven days or more in any period of 12 consecutive months are therefore required to apply for a zoo licence. However, establishments displaying small numbers of llamas and alpacas may be eligible for a full exemption from the Act or for dispensations from the full inspection regime. I consider each case on its own merits.

 The Agency is already making an effective contribution towards recovering criminal proceeds. Since the Agency became operational on 24 February 2003, the total value of assets under its investigation exceeds &#163;17million in 33 cases, of which some &#163;10 million is currently frozen under court orders in nine cases, pending hearings for recovery orders. In addition, one tax assessment has been issued under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 for tax in excess of 250,000. The Agency has also provided assistance to law enforcement agencies in 11 confiscation order cases raised under the previous legislation with a total value of &#163;3.25 million.
<P>

<a name="31006w55.html_para7">The Centre of Excellence in the Assets Recovery Agency has delivered training in the Proceeds of Crime Act to over 1,400 financial investigators in law enforcement agencies. This year it plans to provide enhanced training and accreditation in financial investigation to an additional 350 staff from law enforcement agencies and to 50 staff from other agencies. The Agency has also successfully raised awareness of the new powers in the Act by hosting a series of conferences and presentations; and by the issue of a monthly newsletter which publicises successes in recovering the proceeds of crime.

<a name="31006w56.html_para1">The Police Service retains a tactical option to use CS agents to disperse a riotous assembly in life-threatening situations; subject to prior authorisation by the relevant chief officer. The CS is pyrotechnically discharged in the form of a cloud of smoke from a hand-thrown or weapon-launched grenade. The option has only been used once in a public disorder situation in Toxteth, Liverpool, in 1981. A small stock of such devices is retained by some forces.

 It is a tragedy for any child to become involved in prostitution. Children involved in prostitution are primarily victims of abuse and adults who take advantage of them, whether by exploiting them as pimps or by buying sexual services from them, are child abusers.

<a name="31006w56.html_para12">The new Sexual Offences Bill sets out new wide-ranging offences covering trafficking for sexual exploitation to replace the stop-gap offence of trafficking for the purpose of prostitution, introduced in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The offence of trafficking for sexual exploitation carries a tough maximum penalty of 14 years. In addition to this, the Bill also introduces a new offence of commercial sexual exploitation of a child, which will protect children up to 18. It covers a range of offences, including buying the sexual services of a child, (for which the penalty ranges from seven years to life depending on the age of the child); and causing, facilitating or controlling the commercial sexual exploitation of a child in prostitution or pornography, for which the maximum penalty will be 14 years imprisonment.

 The term cleared up is used when an individual has been charged, cautioned, reprimanded, or received a final warning for a notifiable offence or offences in relation to a crime, or when such an offence has been accepted for consideration in court. A crime may also be counted as cleared up when no further action is taken on an offence for one of the following reasons:

 We are determined to minimise the number of juvenile girls mixing with adult prisoners. We are currently setting up a new, separate juvenile unit at Downview, to end placements in Holloway. Given the numbers and geographical spread, complete separation across England and Wales is not simple, but we are looking at how further improvements can be made.

<P>
<a name="31006w58.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I have regular bilateral meetings with the Commissioner which cover the whole of the Metropolitan police area. The Youth Offending Team (YOT) in Havering was the first in London to be managed by a serving officer from the Metropolitan police and is one of the best performing YOTs in London, according to the tables of performance compiled by the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="31006w58.html_para3">It forms part of a consortium of YOTs which run the East London Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme for persistent young offenders. With support from the Children's Fund, Havering is also developing a Youth Inclusion and Support Programme which will aim to identify young people at risk of offending and provide a series of early intervention measures to address this risk.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the proposed timelines and targets set by each local Criminal Justice Board for the reduction of the time from arrest to sentence.  [130483]<P>

<P>
<a name="31006w58.html_spnew11"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 All Local Criminal Justice Boards are expected to continue to work towards meeting and maintaining the Government's objective to halve the average time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders in England and Wales from 142 days (1996) to 71 days. The average time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders in England and Wales was 64 days for the second quarter of 2003&#151;the eighth consecutive quarter at or below the 71 day target. Current Persistent Young Offenders (PYO) performance for each Local Criminal Justice Board is set out in the table (Table A) and further details are available at www.youth-justice-board.gov. uk/PractitionersPostal/PracticeAnd Performance/Performance.
<P>

<a name="31006w58.html_para4">Locally, since April 2003 when the Boards were formally established, each Board has set itself individual adult and youth targets for improving general timeliness in the magistrates courts, with separate Crown court targets for different types of cases. These have been set in the context of the overall delivery of the Criminal Justice Systems (CJS's) Public Service Agreements and in the magistrates courts are expressed in terms of charge to completion. Targets for each area are set out in the table (Table B). Performance data from April-June 2003, is due to be published in October 2003.

<a name="31006w59.html_spnew0"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The proportion of victims satisfied with their treatment by the criminal justice system has remained at around 58 per cent. since 2000, although this year's figure has shown a small rise, to 59 per cent.
<P>

<a name="31006w59.html_para0">We recognise that there is more to do to improve support and services for victims, and to ensure that their interests are fully taken into account at every stage of the criminal justice process. We detailed our plans in the national strategy for victims and witnesses, published in July. Among the proposals highlighted in the strategy was new legislation, to be brought forward as soon as Parliamentary time allows, which will include the first statutory Code of Practice for victims. The Code will list the minimum services which criminal justice agencies should deliver, and give victims the right of complaint to the Parliamentary Ombudsman if they are not received.

(3) what the average time taken is to process a criminal record check on a <i>(a)</i> domiciliary care agency employee and <i>(b)</i> nursing agency employee in cases (i) when a criminal records certificate is issued with no further investigation or problems arising, (ii) when further investigations are necessary before a criminal records certificate can be issued and (iii) when further investigations were necessary and it was consequently determined that a criminal records certificate would not be issued.

<i>[holding answer 17 September 2003]:</i> The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) issues a Disclosure against all applications received, regardless of the information contained in it, except where the application has been withdrawn at the request of the registered body or applicant. I am unable to provide data on the average time taken to process CRB checks, broken down by category of worker or when further investigation has been required as there are no information technology procedures at present to extract these data from the CRB database.
<P>

<a name="31006w59.html_para1">However, I can confirm that the average turnaround times for Standard and Enhanced Disclosures across all business sectors is 24 days. Service turnaround times for Standard and Enhanced continue to exceed the CRB target of 90 per cent. of Standard Disclosures within two weeks and 90 per cent. of Enhanced Disclosures within four weeks. The CRB expects to process the checks for new care home workers within this service standard. In

The NCSC does not identify the voluntary sector payments separate from payments made by the statutory and private providers of care services. It is therefore not possible to provide separate figures for the voluntary sector.
<P>

<a name="31006w59.html_para4"><i>(c)</i> The Department of Health has informed us that as far as they are aware, there are no medical checks, as such, required by legislation. There are requirements in the various care regulations that providers, managers and staff must be physically and mentally fit for the purpose of the work they are to do. However, the regulations do not specify how these people are to prove they are fit. It is for the NCSC to decide whether the evidence of fitness is satisfactory.

 The Report of the joint Cabinet Office/Home Office Review of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/docs/pacereview2002.pdf) published in November 2002 recommended that the existing maximum detention period of 24 hours without charge for an arrestable offence was insufficient and should be extended to 36 hours. The police provided the Review with supporting evidence on difficulties associated with the 24-hour detention period. The extended period would enable investigations being completed more effectively and avoid the investigative process to be rushed to the detriment of either the suspect or the criminal justice system or both. The provision is included at Clause 5 to the Criminal Justice Bill currently before Parliament.

<P>

<a name="31006w61.html_para0">Graffiti spoils our enjoyment of public places, increases fear of crime and produces an environment where crime and anti-social behaviour can thrive. That is why we are taking action to tackle it in both the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill and the Criminal Justice Bill. We are banning the sale of spray paints to under 18s. We are closing the loophole which prevents the police from searching for items which they suspect may be intended for causing criminal damage, such as spray paints. We are also giving local authorities powers to issue fixed penalty notices for graffiti and to clean graffiti from certain types of property now owned by them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w61.html_spnew1"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 I have not received recent studies. In developing our approach to gun control we pay broad regard to aspects of controls in other countries and to our European Union and international obligations. But ultimately United Kingdom legislation has to be framed in the context of domestic requirements. We have one of the toughest frameworks of control in the world, and we consider it right that we should. However, although controlling legal firearms is important in helping to prevent guns falling into the wrong hands, it does not obviate the need for other measures to deal with armed crime. This needs to be addressed in the context of all violent crime and other activities such as drug dealing, as well as the emergence of a gang culture in some areas, and in the light of what we can learn from police best practice, both here and abroad. The experience of the police in Boston, for example, is already being taken into account by police forces in the United Kingdom.

<i>[holding answer 16 September 2003]:</i> British overseas citizens do not have right of abode in the United Kingdom and are subject to immigration control. There is no provision within the immigration rules for dependants of members of the armed forces to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. Under a concession outside the rules dependants are normally granted leave for the duration of the principal member's posting, up to a maximum of three years, on conditions permitting employment.
<P>

<a name="31006w61.html_para2">Gurkhas are discharged in Nepal and Gurkhas often return to Nepal, with their personal possessions, six months prior to their official discharge in order to undertake pre-retirement courses and take leave. During this time, the basis of any leave in the United Kingdom granted to the dependant wife of such a Gurkha no longer exists, as the Gurkha is no longer in the United Kingdom, and she may be refused entry.

<a name="31006w61.html_para3">An application for a visa to enter the United Kingdom may also be refused for the same reason.

 <i>[holding answer 16 September 2003]:</i> Officials from the Immigration and Nationality Directorate met with officials from the Ministry of Defence on Friday 12 September as part of their review of immigration issues affecting Gurkhas and other foreign and commonwealth personnel in the armed forces. Their discussion included access to settlement, work permits, naturalisation and welfare issues, including those affecting dependants. They are aiming to conclude their review and report their findings by Christmas.

 The Government set out its position on these issues in its response, published in March 2003 this year, to the 2nd Report of the Home Affairs Committee (Session 2002&#150;2003) Criminal Justice Bill:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In relation to the admissibility in criminal proceedings of confessions made to third parties, judges already have discretion to exclude evidence if it appears to the court that the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it. When considering exercising this discretion the court would have regard for all the circumstances of the case, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained. [Ref: Section 78 Police & Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE)].
<P>
<BR>
Judges also have the discretion to exclude evidence where its prejudicial effect would outweigh any probative value. [Ref: Section 82(3) of PACE].
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="31006w61.html_para4">More specifically, where evidence is obtained in circumstances such as confessions made in custody cells, it is also open to the judge to draw the attention of the jury to these circumstances in his summing up.

<a name="31006w61.html_para5">The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice considered this issue in 1993 and made no recommendation for change. It was considered again by the Law Commission as part of its review of the hearsay laws in 1997. It concluded that confessions should continue to be admissible against their makers, subject to the discretions in PACE and in common law to exclude them. This view was supported on consultation.

<P>
<a name="31006w62.html_spnew0"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The Department of Trade and Industry commissioned research to look at the viability of a potential drug detecting device, such as a "swizzle stick", that could be unobtrusively used by people in pubs and clubs to detect drugs in drinks. Unfortunately, the prohibitive costs involved, and the difficulty of producing a satisfactory device, led to the project's discontinuance.
<P>

<a name="31006w62.html_para0">In general, we would urge people to exercise care with any product that claims to provide a complete solution to this problem, not least because of the reported widespread use of alcohol itself as a substance to facilitate the overpowering of a victim. Any device that provides only a partial screen is potentially dangerous to the extent that it may offer false reassurance.

 The Immigration Research and Statistics Service recently commissioned a research study to map the provision of interpretation and translation across five geographical regions and across eight public sector services. The research was carried out by the Health for Asylum Seekers and Refugees Portal (HARP) group at East London University. Its main aims were to identify the range of interpretation and translation services available in the United Kingdom, to identify the main service providers and public sector users of these services and to identify the role of community groups in this provision. The project also aimed to examine the costs of this provision and to identify good practice in providing interpretation and translation services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w64.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Police Standards Unit's (PSU) work with police forces to address performance issues is initiated where there are gaps in performance across a range of indicators, including key volume crime indicators. The full range of indicators were set out in the National Policing Plan 2003&#150;06. The PSU is also leading the development of the Policing Performance Assessment Framework (PPAF) which aims to provide a broader balanced score approach to performance assessment.
<P>

<a name="31006w64.html_para11">While each PSU project is subject to scrutiny and review, no formal assessment has been made to quantify the impact of this work on meeting specific volume crime targets in forces.

 The National Centre for Policing Excellence was launched in April 2003 to increase the professional capacity of the police by identifying and disseminating evidence-based best practice. In 2002&#150;03, it produced a knowledge map on street robbery which has been available to all forces on the Criminal Justice Extranet.

<P>
<a name="31006w65.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Oaten: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what research his Department has commissioned into the effect of prison overcrowding on prisoners, what his evaluation is of this research; and if he will make a statement;  [124597]
<P>
<UL>(2) what research his Department has commissioned on the effect of prison overcrowding on <i>(a)</i> prison staff morale and <i>(b)</i> safety in prisons; and if he will make a statement.  [124598]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w65.html_spnew0"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Prison overcrowding is carefully managed within agreed operating capacities at each establishment. Operating capacities are the total number of prisoners that an establishment can hold taking into account control, security and the proper operation of the planned regime. Prison Service area managers determine such capacities on the basis of operational judgement and experience.
<P>

<a name="31006w65.html_para0">No specific research projects have been undertaken into the effects of overcrowding on prisoners. However, we do keep under careful review the impact of population pressures, including overcrowding, on prisoners and staff in all prisons. There are a number of measures that can be used to assess the effects, for example, by the monitoring of regime performance, we know that population pressures are not yet significantly affecting the provision of rehabilitative schemes in prisons. It is inevitable though that at times of high population pressures, such provision may become disrupted.
<P>

<a name="31006w65.html_para1">The Prison Service is taking steps to ensure the safety of prisoners and to mitigate against the effect of overcrowding.
<P>

<a name="31006w65.html_para2">For example, The Prison Service is in the final year of a three-year safer custody programme to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and self-harm in prisons. The programme includes a series of 



<P>
<P><I>6 Oct 2003 : Column 1245W</I><P>
inter-related projects to improve pre-reception, reception and induction arrangements; inter-agency information exchange; prisoner care; detoxification; prisoner peer support, and the learning from investigations into deaths in custody. Over the next few months the outcome of this programme will be reviewed taking into account an evaluation of these projects and emerging research findings.
<P>

<a name="31006w65.html_para3">The Prison Service also keeps under review the distance between where prisoners are accommodated and their home areas. The Prison Service aims to hold prisoners in establishments that provide the degree of security they require; are suitable to their gender, age and legal status; provide special facilities appropriate to prisoner needs or are near to their homes or the courts dealing with their cases. High population levels throughout the prison estate can lead to prisoners being transferred from their home area to establishments where there are vacancies. However, evidence shows that over the last two years there has been little change in the proportion of prisoners held either under or more than 50 miles from their home area.
<P>

<a name="31006w65.html_para4">There is, however, no evidence to suggest that population pressures compromise public security. Since 1992&#150;93, the number of escapes from prison has significantly fallen from 232 in 1992&#150;93 to five in 2002&#150;03. This is despite an increase of around 50 per cent. in the average prison population over the same period.
<P>

<a name="31006w65.html_para5">The number of assaults across the Prison Service fell in 2001&#150;02 in comparison to figures for 2000&#150;01. There was an increase in assaults in 2002&#150;03, but early indications are that there may be a slight decrease in the number of such incidents for 2003&#150;04. Minimising the number of incidents is essential to the safe custody of prisoners and to the protection of prisoners and staff. While it is expected that the number of incidents will increase as the prison population rises, it should be recognised that the majority of incidents other than escapes, assaults and deaths are quickly and safely resolved through the use of good contingency planning and incident resolution procedures.
<P>

<a name="31006w65.html_para6">While there has been no research into effects of overcrowding on Prison Service staff, an annual staff survey asks staff, as part of a range of questions, and as an indication of motivation about job satisfaction, whether they feel safe in their working environment. 67 per cent. of staff that responded to the 2002 survey said that they felt safe in their working environment. The survey itself does not directly research the effects of overcrowding on staff attitudes and morale. It cannot, therefore, identify whether the reasons for this response rate can be directly attributed to overcrowding.

 There is a long history of providing probation services in partnership with the voluntary and private sector.

 <i>[holding answer 11 September 2003]:</i> The Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme was launched in 2001 to provide the courts with a tough community based programme designed to tackle persistent young offenders. It currently provides for approximately 3,500 young offenders a year at an annual cost of &#163;21.5million. Additional funding of &#163;2 million has been made available for national roll-out, providing for a total of 4,200 persistent young offenders annually from January 2004. The programme is being fully evaluated by Oxford University; the final report with an analysis of reconvictions is due in March 2004. It is not possible at present to provide a comprehensive answer to my hon. Friend's question.

 The purpose of the notification requirements of Part 1 of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 (commonly known as the Sex Offenders' Register) is that the police know the names and addresses of the most serious sex offenders living in their area. This is one of a number of tools which enable them to protect the public more effectively.
<P>

<a name="31006w66.html_para5">We have received no specific representations on the effectiveness of the register. However, we receive a large number of letters on the Sex Offenders Act, which sometimes raise, among other issues, the effectiveness of the register as it applies in individual cases.
<P>

<a name="31006w66.html_para6">The most useful measure of effectiveness for the 'register' itself is the level of compliance with the notification requirements. We estimate that nationally around 97 per cent. of offenders currently on the 'register' are complying fully with the notification requirements.

<P>
<a name="31006w68.html_spnew0"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Home Office has commissioned a consortium of researchers to conduct an evaluation of special measures for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses (VIWs). The aims of the research are: (1) to evaluate how well the special measures have been implemented throughout the criminal justice system (CJS); and (2) to examine the experience of VIWs before and after the implementation of special measures in Crown Courts. The latter was addressed using pre and post-implementation surveys. The pre-implementation survey was conducted in 2000 and published in 2001 (Home Office Research Findings 147). This report can be found on the Home Office website at: http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/r147.pdf
<P>

<a name="31006w68.html_para0">The post-implementation survey was conducted in 2003 and is currently being written-up. The survey work will help determine: whether the introduction of special measures has been accompanied by an increase in VIWs' satisfaction with the CJS, to what extent provisions for VIWs have changed with the implementation of special measures; and VIWs attitudes to the special measures. Home Office Research and Development Statistics expect to publish a full report next year.

 It is for primary care trusts, which commission abortion services, to consider whether psychological services should be available for women who have had an abortion. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' evidence-based guideline, "The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion (2000)", considered the mental health implications of termination and concluded only a small minority of women experience any long term, adverse psychological consequences after abortion and that referral for further counselling should be available for those women.

 The Department funded the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' evidence-based guideline "The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion (2000)".

Cancer Research UK is undertaking a study, which is considering the full range of potential risk factors for breast cancer. This is an important and complex international research project. We understand that Cancer Research UK intends to publish the work when it is available.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The prescription information was obtained from the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) system and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispensed in the community, ie by community pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors, and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Total prescriptions include not only prescriptions originating from general medical practitioners in England but also from hospital doctors, nurses, and dentists, provided they were dispensed in the community. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospital or private prescriptions.<P>

2. Drugs used for dementia are those defined in the British National Formulary (BNF) section 4.11 "Drugs for dementia". Drugs used for dementia have been grouped into those used for mild to moderate and moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease in line with the NICE guidance on drugs for Alzheimers disease. Please refer to the NICE website at www.nice.org.uk for more details.<P>

3. Doctors, dentists or nurses write prescriptions on a prescription form. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item.<P>

4. Net ingredient cost refers to the basic cost (which the dispenser is reimbursed) of the drug before discounts and does not include any dispensing costs or fees.<P>

1. The prescription information was obtained from the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) system and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispensed in the community, i.e. by community pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors, and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Total prescriptions include not only prescriptions originating from general medical practitioners in England but also from hospital doctors, nurses, and dentists, provided they were dispensed in the community. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England.

 The Department attaches great importance to preventing coronary heart disease.
<P>

<a name="31006w72.html_para9">The priorities and planning framework for 2003&#150;06 includes targets for reducing the incidence of coronary heart disease. One of these requires practice-based registers for patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes, with systematic treatment regimes, including advice on diet physical activity and smoking. This covers the majority of patients at high risk of coronary heart disease, particularly those with hypertension, diabetes and a body mass index greater than 30.
<P>

<a name="31006w72.html_para10">Programmes are also in place to tackle the risk factors for coronary heart disease in the general population. These take a life-course approach and focus on improvements to diet and nutrition, reducing excess weight and obesity, increasing physical activity and reducing the prevalence of smoking.

 <i>[holding answer 16 September 2003]:</i> The purpose of National Health Service treatment centres is to provide additional capacity to treat more patients more quickly, in a modern streamlined environment.

Trend information on children's obesity by social class is not available. Young people aged 16&#150;18 are classified as adults. The following analyses therefore cover children under age 16. Social class comparisons of the percentage of children in BMI quintiles were published in the Health Survey for England&#151;The Health of Young People 95&#150;97 table 3.15, a copy of which is available in the Library. Overall trends show that obesity in children is rising. Although there is no generally accepted consensus on the definition of obesity in childhood, all recent studies, no matter which definition is used, have shown that the prevalence of obesity is increasing in children in England.<P>

 The number of people eligible for direct payments is not available.

Since April 2003, it has been made a "duty" for each council to offer a direct payment, but eligibility will depend on a number of factors, including the person's ability to manage a direct payment. The number of people in receipt of direct payments between the years 1997&#150;2000 is also not available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what role he envisages primary care trusts taking in dealing with domestic violence.  [129622]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w75.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Government are firmly committed to tackling domestic violence, a serious and abhorrent crime, and we recently published our strategy to co-ordinate concerted action on this issue in the consultation paper, "Safety and Justice". Within this framework, the national health service has a particular contribution to make in identifying and responding to domestic violence, which has a profound impact on the health and well-being of the individuals concerned and their children.
<P>

<a name="31006w75.html_para0">The Department of Health's publication, "Domestic Violence: A Resource Manual for Health Care Professionals (March 2000)", provides a solid foundation for local multi-agency work and supports health care professionals and managers across all sectors of the NHS, including those working in primary care trusts (PCTs), in developing their domestic violence policies, protocols and services to ensure victims receive the care and support they need in whatever health setting they present.
<P>

<P>
<a name="31006w75.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Helen Clark: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to increase the number of GPs recognised as having a special interest in the treatment of drug addiction.  [129141]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w75.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We are committed to expanding the numbers and the role of general practitioners with a special interest (GPwSIs) and have already met the NHS Plan commitment to have 1,000 such GPs. These GPs will help expand the range of services offered by primary care in settings more convenient for patients than hospital-based care. It is important, however, that the services offered by these GPs address local priorities and needs. The decisions on which specialties to develop locally are therefore for primary care trusts.
<P>

<a name="31006w75.html_para2">We are supporting the GPwSIs' development with guidelines which we have commissioned from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) on a range of specialities. Drug misuse is among these and we are funding a RCGP training programme on this. In the first year, 440 GPs attended the training and there were over a 100 on the waiting list.

<a name="31006w75.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his answer of 9 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 694W, on unused drugs, if he will commission independent research to assess ways of reducing this wastage; and what assessment he has made of whether smaller packs of drugs could reduce wastage.  [129807]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w75.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Department is concerned about the wastage of unused medicines and has introduced a number of measures to address this.




<P>
<P><I>6 Oct 2003 : Column 1287W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31006w75.html_para5">These include the medicines management collaborative, which involves primary care trusts (PCTs), general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacies in schemes that demonstrate innovation and good practice in medicines management. Reducing the volume of unwanted medicines is one of the local objectives being pursued by some of the PCTs participating in the programme.
<P>

<a name="31006w75.html_para6">Repeat dispensing makes it possible for patients to get their repeat medicines for up to a year without having to contact their GP's surgery. At each repeat dispensing episode, the pharmacist checks that the medicines are still needed and being used appropriately by the patient. The first wave of pathfinder sites is now under way and I announced the second wave of 40 sites at the British Pharmaceutical Conference on 17 September 2003. We remain committed to repeat dispensing schemes nationwide until the end of 2004. Evidence from previous pilot studies has shown that repeat dispensing helps reduce waste.
<P>

<a name="31006w75.html_para7">Modernising hospital pharmacy services, where patients can now continue to use their medicines when admitted to hospital, together with dispensing for discharge, has also been shown to reduce waste.
<P>

<a name="31006w75.html_para8">Given all these initiatives we do not propose to commission further research.
<P>

<a name="31006w75.html_para9">Patients have different requirements according to their clinical condition. Pharmaceutical companies therefore have to decide what pack sizes will suit the majority of patients and provide pack sizes to meet these needs.

 There are no plans to publish the detailed findings of the review. The review has helped ensure that national health service major incident planning is continuously reviewed and improved. Revised guidance will be issued to the NHS later this year. Our approach was described in the Treasury minute responding to the Public Accounts Committee report "Facing the Challenge: NHS Emergency Planning in England", which was published on 17 March. Copies of the minute have been placed in the Library.

<P>

<a name="31006w76.html_para14">As part of a nation-wide food hygiene campaign, the FSA is currently developing material to promote awareness of Campylobacter among poultry farmers. Earlier phases of this campaign have been targeted largely at raising awareness and promoting good hygiene practice in the catering industry. Messages about thorough cooking and the avoidance of cross-contamination are particularly relevant to prevention of Campylobacter infection. Further high-profile activity to increase awareness of cross-contamination in the kitchen is planned for early 2004.

 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is responsible for food safety issues. It frequently discusses many aspects of food safety, on the basis of European Commission proposals and in scientific exchanges, with all other European Union member states. In addition, FSA officials have met counterparts from the 10 countries which are preparing to join the EU on 1 May next year as well as from many other countries. The discussions, at various levels, have ranged over many items of mutual interest, including: development of food safety and consumer-related policies; risk management and current legislative programmes; communication of risk; building relationships between food authorities; methods of scientific analysis; research and development; and inspection and food law enforcement.

 The key intervention is the statutory on-farm control programme for breeding flocks. All layer breeding flocks must be monitored at regular intervals for the presence of Salmonella. Any flock infected with Salmonella Enteriditis or Salmonella Typhimurium is compulsorily slaughtered. Ministers at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) are responsible for these controls. The Government will also be supporting new European Union proposals aimed at controlling salmonella pathogens of public health significance in poultry and other farm animals, including egg layer flocks.

<a name="31006w76.html_para16">Statutory measures are complemented by voluntary codes of practice published by DEFRA, which industry has incorporated into their own salmonella controls.

<P>
<a name="31006w76.html_spnew10"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Current European Union meat hygiene rules contain detailed requirements for the structure and operation of slaughterhouses and require all slaughterhouse operators to implement and maintain hazard analysis critical control point-based programmes to prevent, eliminate or reduce hazards to acceptable levels. Red meat slaughterhouse operators are required to carry out microbiological testing of carcasses to verify that their controls are working. The legislation is enforced in Great Britain by the Meat Hygiene Service, an executive agency of the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and in Northern Ireland by the Department for Agriculture and Rural Development veterinary service on behalf of the FSA.

[130076]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w76.html_spnew11"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Staff working with food must, by law, maintain high standards of personal hygiene and be supervised to ensure that they work hygienically. These requirements are enforced by local food authorities.
<P>

<a name="31006w76.html_para18">Effective hand washing is important in preventing contamination of food and the spread of food poisoning bacteria in catering premises and in the domestic setting. To help reinforce this message, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has run a high profile nationwide campaign targeting the catering industry with material stressing the importance of staff working with food washing their hands after visiting the lavatory. Further advice on how to clean and dry hands, is available on the FSA website at www.foodstandards.gov.uk

 <i>[holding answer 16 September 2003]:</i> Individual applicants are developing their own plans for consultation to reflect how best to engage with key stakeholders locally. These consultations may involve a balance of staff and public meetings, written documents and presentations to key stakeholders depending on what fits best locally to allow the public, staff and other stakeholders to provide their views. Evidence of consultation and a summary of comments received is a requirement for the material submitted for consideration by the Secretary of State on 12 December as part of the next stage of the applications process.

 Paragraph 14.35 of the NHS Plan said that by 2004 up to 400 patients should have moved from the high security hospitals to more appropriate accommodation. A programme is under way aimed at moving up to 400 patients from high security hospitals to more appropriate accommodation by 2004.

The programme has been initiated to address the problem of patients remaining in high security hospitals for longer than safety and security considerations dictate, which is an infringement of human rights and wasteful of scarce resources. The movement out of inappropriately placed patients will also facilitate the admission of people who do need high security care and treatment, including prisoners requiring transfer.

 Following careful review of the recent findings from a number of studies that provide important new information on the safety of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), the committee on safety of medicines (CSM) and its expert working group on HRT have issued clear advice to prescribers and women.
<P>

<a name="31006w80.html_para6">The CSM has advised that, for short-term use of HRT for the relief of menopausal symptoms, the benefits outweigh the risks for many women. However, for longer-term use of HRT, prescribers are advised that each decision to start HRT should be made on an individual basis and that women should be made aware of the increased risk of the adverse effects, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. Each treatment decision should take into consideration the known risks and benefits of HRT, the contraindications for use and each woman's individual circumstances.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the cost of the specialist training in illegal meat for local authority enforcement officers; whether the 30 candidates being appointed as regional advisers following the specialist training will be in addition to the current levels of local authority enforcement officers; who has been appointed to run the training and under what procedure they were chosen; and whether the funding for the training is to be taken from <i>(a)</i> the Food Standards Agency funding and <i>(b)</i> his Department's central funding.

 The cost of the specialist training in illegal meat for 26 United Kingdom local authority officers and four officers from the Republic of Ireland, including accommodation, venue hire and travel and subsistence, was &#163;40,000. The training of the UK officers was funded by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and provided by Mallard Consultancy Ltd., following a competitive tendering process. The 26 candidates appointed as regional advisers in the UK will act in this capacity for 10 working days per year for the FSA. They will continue to be employed by their local authorities and, when not working on behalf of the FSA, will continue their normal work for their authorities. They are not additional staff for the local authorities. The FSA will reimburse the authorities for the cost of their time in carrying out work for the FSA.

 Problems with compatibility are the responsibility of local trusts to resolve with their suppliers.

<a name="31006w81.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Two key initiatives which aim to improve the standards of information management in the national health service focus on the better recording and exchange of information to national standards and the development of health informatics skills.
<P>

<a name="31006w81.html_para1">All national standards for the recording and transfer of information across the NHS now have to be approved by the independent NHS information standards board. This ensures that data are collected using agreed common standards so that NHS information can be used consistently across the NHS. When approved, these standards are included within the NHS data dictionary which provides the core reference manual on information standards for the NHS. Part of the approval process of the information standards board is to ensure compatibility with the design authority of the national programme for information technology. This Design Authority is responsible for the design of the future NHS IT infrastructure through which much patient-related information will be collected in future.
<P>

<a name="31006w81.html_para2">The management of information to support the delivery of patient care and healthcare service planning and performance is undertaken by a range of people within the NHS. This includes clinicians, managers and specialist information analysts working in a range of local and national NHS organisations. For effective use of information, skills in health informatics are vital to ensure that information is not misinterpreted or misunderstood. The National Health Informatics Development Programme run by the NHS Information Authority is developing a range of products and services which aim to improve these across the NHS, so that the analysis and interpretation of information is undertaken to clear professional standards.

 The Government have recently announced their intention to remove the ban on advertising over the counter (OTC) medicines for certain diseases and conditions. The change will mean that if a product is classified as available for purchase by consumers then they will be able to receive advertising about the medicine.
<P>

<a name="31006w83.html_para5">The change will affect OTC medicines for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of bone diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diseases of the liver, biliary system and pancreas, endocrine diseases, genetic disorders, joint, rheumatic and collagen diseases, psychiatric diseases, serious disorders of the eye and ear, serious gastrointestinal diseases, serious neurological and muscular diseases, serious renal diseases, serious respiratory diseases and serious skin disorders. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is not aware of any medicines at present classified as suitable for OTC supply in a number of these categories, including psychiatric diseases, endocrine diseases and genetic diseases.
<P>

<a name="31006w83.html_para6">Examples of OTC products that will be affected by the change include aspirin 75 mg tablets, calcium/vitamin D preparations, fish oils, isphagula, nitrates and theophylline and aminophylline products. To protect public safety, these changes will not come into force until the necessary guidelines for advertisers are in place and information and training for pharmacy staff have been provided.

<a name="31006w84.html_para3">In 2000, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) made an appraisal of the use of Methylphenidate in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). NICE estimated that approximately 1 per cent. of all school-aged children&#151;about 69,000 of 6 to 16-year-olds in England met the diagnostic criteria for Hyperkinetic Disorder, the more severe type ADHD, of whom some 45,000 might benefit from Methylphenidate were not receiving this treatment.

 Methylphenidate (sold in the UK as Ritalin, Equasym and Concerta XL) is licensed for use in children over six years of age as part of a comprehensive treatment programme for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, where remedial measures alone prove insufficient.




<P>

<a name="31006w84.html_para4">The most common short-term adverse effects generally occur at the beginning of treatment, and include central nervous system effects, such as nervousness and insomnia, and gastro-intestinal effects, such as abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.
<P>

<a name="31006w84.html_para5">The long-term safety and efficacy profiles of methylphenidate are not fully known. This is reflected in the product information of Ritalin provided to prescribers which advises that patients requiring long-term therapy should be carefully monitored. It warns of the risk of moderately reduced weight gain and slight growth retardation with the long-term use of stimulants in children and that careful monitoring of growth is recommended. It also recommends that blood tests should be performed periodically during long-term use.

 The Department's guidance to the national health service&#151;HSC 2003/001 "Protecting Staff, Delivering Services&#151;Implementing the European Working Time Directive (EWTD) for Doctors in Training" states that while the number of doctors on an individual rota will generally have to increase, trusts should find ways to reduce the number of resident rotas. Thus, the total staffing requirement does not have to increase substantially as a result of the EWTD.

<P>

<a name="31006w86.html_para1">It is not appropriate to show the total of revenue and capital allocations as a percentage of the national health service budget. This is because NHS trust capital allocations are financed, in part, through primary care trust (PCT) revenue allocations. Adding the two allocations together would mean double counting this element of expenditure.
<P>

<a name="31006w86.html_para2">In addition to PCT revenue allocations, a number of revenue budgets currently held centrally will be issued to PCTs later, for example, for personal medical services pilot schemes. These will mean that PCTs will control more than 75 per cent. of the NHS budget from 2003&#150;04 onwards.

 The national health service pensions figures in figure 3.1 of the Department's annual report 2003 shows the request for resource figure.

 Job titles of staff within National Health Service organisations are determined at a local level and are not collated centrally. The annual NHS work force census records staff by a system of occupational coding introduced in 1995.

It states that, "all NHS employer organisations, supported by Workforce Development Confederations will have in place a clear organisational strategy and annual plan for education, training and development which links explicitly with local modernisation priorities and the delivery of clinical governance".
<P>

<a name="31006w87.html_para0">The proposed introduction of the knowledge and skills framework through pay modernisation will strengthen the identification of the skills and competencies of nurses to undertake certain work.

 Information on the level of insurance costs paid by voluntary organisations involved in personal care is not collected centrally. We have consequently no way of relating back any measure of activity relating to the care sector with any change to insurance costs. However, overall activity levels in the care sector have increased over this period: since 1997 the number of older residents supported by local authorities in care homes has increased by 3,000, and the number of households receiving intensive home care, ten hours or more and six plus visits, increased from 72,300 in 2000 to 81,500 in 2002. We cannot, however, determine any relationship between this increase in overall activity to either voluntary sector providers or to any change in liability insurance costs.

 The Government's strategy document, "Building the Information Core&#151;Implementing the NHS Plan" published in 2000 set the target of March 2003 for all radiology reports between hospital and general practitioners to be sent electronically. This target was based on the use of messaging technology. Work in this area has been superseded by the national programme for information technology in the national health service and the development of the integrated care records service (ICRS). Electronic transfer of radiology reports forms one element of phase 1 that will be implemented by December 2004.

In response to concerns expressed by the health committee and others about sexual health services, an additional &#163;11 million will be allocated this year.

 Data collected from the NHS stop smoking services and published in the Department's Statistical Bulletin&#151;Statistics on smoking cessation services in England, April 2001 to March 2002, tables 8 & 9&#151;show the average cost for the national health service to assist someone to give up smoking in 2001&#150;02 was around &#163;210 (based on self report). Costs including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion (Zyban) are not centrally collected.

<a name="31006w91.html_para8">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on the use of NRT and bupropion for smoking cessation, published in March 2002, estimated the cost of life year gained for a smoker using either NRT or bupropion in addition to brief advice would be not more than &#163;1,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will take steps to limit by legislation the amount of freebase nicotine in tobacco products.  [130171]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w91.html_spnew13"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Levels of nicotine are currently regulated by the Tobacco Products (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale) (Safety) Regulations 2002. As of 1 January 2004, the maximum permitted yield of nicotine in cigarettes will be one milligram. This is measured in accordance with the International Standards Organisation's methodology. The Regulations implement a European Directive which is due to be reviewed in 2004 in the light of any updated scientific evidence.
<P>

<a name="31006w91.html_para9">However, experimental work for the Department in 2000&#150;01 has indicated that the current International Standards Organisation's methodology used for determining tar and nicotine yields of cigarettes traps over 99 per cent. of nicotine present in cigarette smoke of major brands on the United Kingdom market. Therefore at that time there was no evidence that freebase nicotine posed a problem in UK cigarette brands.

 Ammonium compounds and urea are currently permitted in United Kingdom cigarettes under the terms of a voluntary agreement concluded in 1997.

Tobacco products may not be actively promoted by way of sponsorship or product placement in either medium. Beyond that, the depiction of smoking in television programmes is already discouraged and otherwise responsibly regulated by the broadcasting regulatory authorities.

 We do not routinely collect the information requested. The most comprehensive source of information is the national sentinel stroke audit, carried out by the Royal College of Physicians. The audit was commissioned by the national health service in 1998 and was last updated in 2002. The results can be found at http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/pubs/strokeaudit01&#150;02.pdf. The 2002 audit shows that 73 per cent. of trusts who participated had a stroke unit compared to 56 per cent. three years earlier. The audit shows that 80 per cent. of trusts that participated have a consultant physician with specialist knowledge of stroke who is formally recognised as having principal responsibility for stroke services.

<i>[holding answer 30 June 2003]:</i> The vaccines used in the childhood immunisation programme have been thoroughly assessed for safety prior to being licensed. As with all medicinal products, vaccine safety is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the independent expert advisory Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM).
<P>

<a name="31006w93.html_para2">No vaccine or medicinal product is without potential side effects and these are clearly listed in the product information that is available to health professionals and patients. The CSM has reviewed the safety of vaccines containing the preservative thiomersal (which contains ethyl mercury) on a number of occasions. In 2001, the CSM conducted a major review of the available evidence and has considered new data as it has come to light in 2003. A statement was placed on the MHRA website at http://medicines.mhra.gov.uk in February 2003, summarising the latest evidence on this issue.
<P>

<a name="31006w93.html_para3">The advice of the CSM remains that, with the exception of possible hypersensitivity reactions (that typically include skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection), there is no evidence of harm from thiomersal contained in vaccines and that the benefits of immunisation with thiomersal-containing vaccines outweigh any potential risks of vaccination. This view concurs with that of the World Health Organisation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how many surgeons performed weight reduction operations in the last 12 months;  [127088]
<P>
<UL>
<P>
(2) if he will state for each hospital trust whether it has established a database to monitor surgery undertaken to aid weight loss for patients;  [127091]
<P>
(3) how many children in the last year have undergone surgery to aid weight reduction.  [127092]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w93.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 8 September 2003]:</i> The data collected by Hospital Episode Statistics do not identify individual surgeons, so it is not possible to confirm how many surgeons performed these operations.
<P>

<a name="31006w93.html_para4">The Department does not collect centrally information on whether trusts have developed databases to monitor surgery undertaken to aid weight loss. The decision on whether surgery is the most appropriate option for children to aid weight reduction is for clinical judgement. Hospital Episode Statistics data show that in 2001&#150;02 there were 16 Finished Consultant Episodes for children aged between 0&#150;17 years of age with a primary diagnosis of obesity and which included a main operative procedure.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his answer of 4 February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 230W, on whistleblowers, who in the Department is responsible for examining such cases.  [129336]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31006w93.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 September 2003]:</i> The Department's policy is that, wherever possible, concerns raised by staff should be dealt with locally in accordance with local policies and procedures on whistleblowing, so that problems can be addressed quickly. However, there have been cases where whistleblowers have considered the local response inadequate, and as a consequence have sought to raise their concerns with the Department. Such cases are examined by the relevant strategic health authorities at the request of the human resources directorate of the Department.
<P>

<a name="31006w93.html_para5">An updated policy pack to support organisations in developing and/or reviewing their whistleblowing policies and procedures was sent by the director of human resources to all National Health Service trusts and health authorities on 25 July 2003. A copy has been placed in the Library.

<i>[holding answer 15 September 2003]:</i> Officials have looked into the matters which Mr. Heyes raised in his letter to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. These were considered to be a reiteration of previous issues, which have already been investigated by the Southport and Ormskirk Hospitals National Health Service Trust.
