From October 2008 the way in which the disabling condition is recorded on the live system changed. Disabling conditions are now recorded as primary and secondary, (previously recorded as disability care and mobility codes). For existing cases a mapping exercise was carried out which assigned disability care code to primary disabling condition and disability mobility code to secondary condition. Information Directorate has updated the methodology used to derive main disabling condition to reflect this change in the live system. The old category D08 (blindness) is now subdivided into a range of more specific condition codes. These are referred to by the over-arching title &#147;Visual Disorder&#148;.  3. The preferred data source for benefit statistics is 100% Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study. However, the 5 per cent. sample data are generally the preferred source for analysis on disabling condition as information is more complete for disabling condition on the 5 per cent. sample (some recipients of disability living allowance who transferred from the attendance allowance system may not have been allocated a specific disabling condition code. This problem can be corrected on the sample data but not on the WPLS data. The number of cases affected is decreasing over time). In this case the WPLS data have been used as some of the caseload figures produced are very small and so would have a high level of statistical variation should the sample data have been used.  <i> Source:</i>  DWP Information Directorate: Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study.<br>

 Receipt of Disability Living Allowance at any level does not automatically mean that a person will be considered as having limited capability for work for the purposes of Employment and Support Allowance. Entitlement criteria for Employment and Support Allowance are based on functional ability, not on the benefits an individual receives or their diagnosis. Entitlement to Disability Living Allowance depends on a person's care and mobility needs, not their capability for work. Each person is assessed on an individual basis to determine whether their level of functional ability is such that it is unreasonable to require them to work.</p>

 While no formal assessment has been made, we are currently considering the impact of the use of soya-based animal feed on the environment. In view of soya-based meal being a by-product of oil production, and there currently being no other mainstream uses for this by-product, reduction in its use for animal feed may not therefore lead to a reduction in soya bean production itself. Whatever feed source was to replace soya based feed would also have its own environmental impact.</p>

 DEFRA does not collect figures on the number of farmers who enter and leave the dairy sector in each year. Figures from the June Survey of Agriculture only indicate activity on registered holdings in England at June each year and therefore show net change only.</p>

Prior to 2007 the method of categorising holdings into predominant farming activity was calculated using responses from the June Survey. From 2007 onwards data from the Cattle Tracing System has been used. Numbers of dairy holdings for 2006 are shown using both data sources for comparison. To show the overall trend across the change in data source a longer time series has also been included.</p>

 We are continuing to work closely with the Commission and have received positive feedback from them on a further proposal to reduce the EID implementation burden on industry, which would provide for individual recording to be carried out at critical control points i.e. markets and abattoirs on behalf of the keeper.

 Water companies report annual leakage figures to Ofwat as part of their annual regulatory returns. Ofwat publishes leakage performance annually in its Service and Delivery report. Ofwat sets the water companies targets to reduce their leakage to the economic level, the level of leakage at which it would cost more to make further reductions than to produce water from another source.

Our embassy in Rangoon transmitted a message from the Government to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs early on 1 July 2009 expressing our continued concern about Aung San Suu Kyi's trial and urging the regime to co-operate with the UN General Secretary upon his visit.</p>

 Since the end of World War II, the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals (known as the HD Committee) has maintained a policy that it will not consider the belated institution of awards and medals for service given many years earlier. The reason for this policy is that the present HD Committee cannot put itself in the place of the Committee which made the original decision and which would have been able to take account of the views of the Government and of other interested parties at the time of the decision. The HD Committee has made it clear on a number of occasions in response to requests for the institution of belated awards, that it will not reconsider this policy.</p>

This does not imply that their contribution to the defence of the country has not been appreciated.</p>

 It is our policy that armed forces personnel should be recruited to be fully fit for deployment worldwide on operations. For this reason, the services do not recruit or commission personnel with existing medical conditions which require regular access to medication, such as diabetes. We currently have no plans to review this policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="90706w0012.htm_para4"><a name="09070625002156">This policy is intended to protect sufferers of diabetes from military circumstances which may adversely impact upon their condition and to ensure the effectiveness of the armed forces. For example, a diabetic individual deployed on operations may experience difficulties in monitoring blood or urinary glucose levels; accessing medication; taking regular meals; maintaining a regular sleep pattern; accessing shared-care diabetic clinics; and accessing specialist services such as ophthalmology or chiropody. Such circumstances would adversely impact upon their diabetic control, thus increasing their risk of micro&#151;and macro-vascular complications. Furthermore, an uncontrolled diabetic may constitute a risk not only to themselves, but also to others in a military or operational context.</p>

The total number and rank of individuals who were diagnosed with diabetes while serving in the armed forces and are currently still serving is not held centrally, and could be obtained only by examining the medical records of all personnel, which would incur disproportionate cost. While we will make every effort to retain in-service individuals who subsequently develop diabetes (provided that there are worthwhile military roles for them to fulfil), this will normally mean that they will have to be re-graded and will not be able to deploy on operations.

<i>  [holding answer 14 May 2009]:</i> Information is not held centrally on the number of cases in which a DNA sample has contributed to a conviction. The National DNA Database (NDNAD), which contains profiles obtained from DNA subject samples, does not hold any information indicating either innocence or guilt. It is used as an intelligence database to assist the police in the investigation of crime and detection of potential offenders. The Police National Computer (PNC) holds information on convictions and whether a record exists on the National DNA Database. However, a manual case by case examination would be required to determine whether the DNA profile contributed to the conviction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="90706w0014.htm_para3"><a name="09070625002314">The European Court of Human Rights in the case of S and Marper recognised that biometric data "pursues the legitimate purpose of the detection, and therefore, prevention of crime". The National DNA Database contributes to public protection. Between April 1998 and September 2008, there were over 390,000 crimes with DNA matches, providing the police with a lead on the possible identity of the offender. In 2007-08, 17,614 crimes were detected in which a DNA match was available. They included 83 &#147;homicides&#148;, 184 rapes and a further 15,420 additional detections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="90706w0017.htm_para1"><a name="09070631000102">Between 1977 and 1994, a large number of women in the Irish Republic were infected with Hepatitis C from contaminated Anti-D immunoglobulin produced by the Irish national blood transfusion service. An expert group set up by the Irish Government found the blood service to have been at fault, and the same conclusion was reached by a later judicial inquiry chaired by the Honourable Mr. Justice T. A. Finlay. The &#147;Report of the Finlay Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board&#148; was published on 6 March 1997.</p>

The &#147;Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Infection with HIV and Hepatitis C of Persons with Haemophilia and Related Matters&#148; was published on 5 September 2002 by Her Honour Judge Alison Lindsay.</p>

 The Department and its two agencies (the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency) are currently in a three-year pay settlement covered by the Pay Remit process. Discussions took place with trade unions in May 2009 about the possibility of recycling efficiency savings into the pay deal under the terms of the remit guidance but it was clear that the scale of efficiency savings required by the remit would not allow this.

<i> [holding answer 19 June 2009]:</i> We have given careful consideration to the issue of whether it would be possible to make an exception to this rule in the case of consumers who have taken over the registration of a vehicle which was previously registered to a spouse who has died, but have concluded that this will not be possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="90706w0021.htm_para0"><a name="09070631000557">The rules of the scheme are that the registered keeper of the old and new vehicle must be the same person, and that the old vehicle must have been registered to the keeper continuously for 12 months before the order date of the new vehicle. This rule was put in place for two main reasons. First, the rule seeks to prevent the sorts of abuses that have taken place in other EU countries, for example where individuals bought a very old car for a token sum simply in order to take advantage  <br>

of scrappage scheme. Secondly, given the need to provide urgent support to the industry it was imperative to launch the scheme quickly and to ensure the scheme was simple and that bureaucracy and costs for all parties were minimised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="90706w0021.htm_para1"><a name="09070631000558">It is a regrettable fact that we have had instances of less scrupulous individuals seeking to identify loopholes in the scheme in order to abuse it. It is clear that if we make an exception to the rules of this nature, unscrupulous individuals will seek to exploit what they will see as a loophole. It is also clear that to make an exception of this nature will very significantly add to the administrative burden and complexity of the scheme and require non-experts (dealers) to check facts and documentation which they are not equipped to verify, which in turn would raise further concerns about the capacity for abuse of the scheme. For example, dealers would need to verify whether the person who was the keeper of the car in question has in fact died and whether the car in question has in fact been left to the person proposing to scrap it (as opposed to another relative, friend, charity etc.). This in turn would raise issues in the case of those who had died intestate and of whether or not probate had been obtained, again adding to the complexity of the scheme and the capacity for abuse.</p>

 All prisoners are placed in the lowest security category consistent with the needs of security and control.
