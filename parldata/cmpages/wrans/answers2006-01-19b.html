 The Government are keen to promote the production of biomass heat and electricity, and transport biofuels.

The co-firing of biomass with coal in conventional power stations is permitted. &#163;66 million of funding has been allocated to develop dedicated biomass power stations, combined heat and power schemes, and heating boilers. &#163;12.5 million is available for household and community renewable energy projects, including biomass heating.

A cross-departmental team is looking at the recommendations from the Biomass Task Force on ways to overcome the barriers to developing biomass energy. The Government will publish a full response by April. Support for the production of transport biofuels is through the 20 pence per litre cut in the duty rate for biodiesel and bioethanol. Last November, the Government announced that a Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation will be introduced to require 5 per cent. of road fuel to come from a renewable source by 2010. Other measures being considered include duty incentives to encourage the mixing of biomass with hydrocarbons in the conventional refinery process, and an enhanced capital allowance scheme for the cleanest biofuels processing plants. The latter scheme would allow the cost of capital assets to be written off against taxable profits. Regional support grants for capital investment in production plants are already available.

 Programmes within pillar II of the CAP are designed, in part, to encourage farmers to adopt environmentally beneficial land management practices, and progress is being made. The UK&#039;s position is that such targeted programmes need to be continued, and perhaps strengthened with reform. The overall budget for the Rural Development Regulation was agreed as part of the financial perspective (2007&#150;13) negotiations and has been set at &#8364;69.75 billion for the whole EU. This is in line with existing expenditure, although the precise allocation of funding is still to be proposed by the Commission. We will continue to argue that this should be based on the need for rural development and not on historical expenditure.

There is additional employment where energy crops are grown on set-aside land as more labour is invested in crop production than in maintenance of set-aside. For oilseed rape, about two farming jobs are created (or sustained where crops substitute for other cultivation) for each 1,000 tonnes of biodiesel produced. Bioethanol production from wheat and sugar beet would generate around 5.5 jobs/1,000 tonnes of bioethanol production. For both energy crops and straw feedstocks, additional

<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60119w13.html_spnew1"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> 
<i>[holding answer 16 January 2006]:</i> The primary purpose of the MOT test is to help safeguard against unroadworthy vehicles being used on the road. The average failure rate at annual test is, and has been for many years, around 30 per cent. for cars (equating to 6,752,700 cars), 35 per cent. for light goods (about 173,250 light goods vehicles between 3 and 3.5 tonnes) and 20 per cent. for motorcycles (about 149,000 motorcycles). The failure rate for cars undergoing their first MOT since their initial registration is around 16 per cent. (and equates to 375,000 vehicles). This reflects mainly items prone to wearing such as brake pads and tyres, which high mileage drivers who fail to check their vehicles regularly can easily overlook.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60119w13.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_65">The current frequency of the test represents a reasonable balance between the cost to the motoring public and the risk to road safety of allowing defective vehicles to go undetected. However Ministers keep this under review.

</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">It should be borne in mind that the percentage of the resident population who are registered to vote does not provide a reliable estimate of the registration rate of the eligible population. This is mainly because there are definitional differences between &quot;usually resident&quot; and eligibility to vote and therefore the estimated resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote. For example, the resident population includes all those who usually live in an area irrespective of nationality whereas the parliamentary electorate excludes foreign nationals (but Commonwealth and Irish citizens are included) and may include some overseas electors who do not currently live in the area. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate and this can occur for a number of reasons. People who have more than one address, including students, may register in more than one place. Electoral registration officers may vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died.</p>
</ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">Table 1 contains data for England. The closest available geography to current electoral wards, for which population estimates are available, is Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards. This geography was created for outputs from the 2001 Census and is based mainly on 2003 electoral wards. The electorate counts are on electoral ward boundaries and it has been necessary to convert these to the CAS ward geography.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">The latest available population data available at ward level are for mid-2002, published in April 2005. The ward electorate counts are for December 2002 parliamentary electors, including attainers. The parliamentary electorate has been used rather than the local government electorate even though the latter is definition ally closer to the resident population because the local government electorate is not available at ward level. No adjustment has been made to reflect the difference between these two time points. There are a number of wards that are split by parliamentary constituency i.e. they fall within two or more parliamentary constituencies. These are shown by an asterisk * alongside their ward name, and appear under both constituencies. Electorate and population figures for the whole ward are shown. Some wards will therefore be double counted. It is not possible to split the data for these wards.</p>

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer further to the answer of 20 December 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 2797W, on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, whether the bank has approached shareholders since Statutory Instrument 1991 No 757 was made to ask permission to increase payment to employees and retirees for the specific purpose of paying income tax; whether UK nationals are obligated to use pension payments made to them by the bank to buy a taxable investment; what the value has been of pension payments made to employees and retirees by the bank since its inception; and what the most recent valuation is of the assets held in both schemes.  [43061]</p>




<p><a name="st_77"><a name="60119w14.html_spnew3"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development provides for retirement by making lump sum payments to employees to be invested by them to provide retirement income. As stated in the answer of 20 December 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 2797W, a payment made by the bank from the bank&#039;s funds to enable an employee to purchase retirement income is, as an emolument of his employment, exempted from UK income tax by paragraph 14 of Statutory Instrument 1991 no 757.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60119w14.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_68">The emolument paid to staff is determined in accordance with the rules of the bank&#039;s retirement plans. At the creation of the bank, its consulting actuaries advised that, based on a range of actuarial assumptions, the lump sum benefits under the plans would enable a married participant with 30 years service to purchase a single life annuity, with contingent spouse pension and 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Jan 2006 : Column 1493W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
indexation, equivalent to 70 per cent. of final EBRD gross base salary. This 70 per cent. figure was purely indicative and was not a commitment to provide a retirement income of such amount. Any income would depend upon the rate of return of the investment. However, this gross salary was initially calculated as the employees&#039; net salary grossed up by the bank&#039;s own internal income tax. In 1992 a report by the bank&#039;s consulting actuaries found that this approach led to a level of benefits lower than in comparable organisations. Following this report the board of directors&#151; as representatives of the bank&#039;s shareholders&#151;on 15 December 1992 decided that the appropriate measure of gross salary for pension purposes would be one that took account of average UK tax rates. Since UK tax rates were, and are, higher than the bank&#039;s internal tax, the level of lump sum necessary to generate the same potential level of income, using the original actuarial assumptions, was greater.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60119w14.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_69">As a result, both bank and employee contributions to the retirement plans which provide the lump sum payments were increased. The tax position of these lump sum payments remains as set out earlier in this answer. As stated in the answer of 20 December 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 2797W, retirement income arising from the investment of the payment is liable to income tax in the normal way.

Notes:<br>

1. Cells in this table have been randomly adjusted to avoid release of confidential data.<br>

2. The table counts all families with children (dependent and non-dependent) and the ethnic group is that of the family reference person.<br>

5.43 Family<br>

A family comprises a group of people consisting of a married or cohabiting couple with or without child(ren), or a lone parent with child(ren). It also includes a married or cohabiting couple with their grandchild(ren) or a lone grandparent with his or her grandchild(ren) where there are no children in the intervening generation in the household. Cohabiting couples include same sex couples. Children in couple families need not belong to both members of the couple.<br>

5.44 Family Reference Person (FRP)<br>

In a Lone parent family, the family reference person (FRP) is taken to be the lone parent in a lone-parent family. In a couple family, the FRP is chosen from the two people in the couple on the basis of their economic activity (in the priority order; full-time job, part-time job, unemployed, retired, other). If both people have the same economic activity, the FRP is identified as the elder of the two or, if they are the same age, the first member of the couple on the form.<br>

5.18 Child<br>

There is no age limit on the term child. For example, a married couple living with their son aged 40 would be classified as a family consisting of a married couple and their child unless the son has a spouse, partner or child living in the household.<br>





5.31 Dependent child<br>

A dependent child is a person aged 0&#150;15 in a household (whether or not in a family) or aged 16&#150;18 in full-time education and living in a family with his or her parent(s). This is a change from the 1991 definition which was a person aged 0&#150;15 in a household or a person aged 16&#150;18, never married, in full-time education and economically inactive. The revised 2001 definition has been agreed following consultation with users. An &#039;adult&#039; in a household is any person who is not a dependent child.<br>

 Many of the most important recommendations from the Ofcom report into premium rate service regulation have already been implemented. For example, from 15 September network operators have been obliged to withhold payments to services providers for 30 days after a call has been made thus enabling repayment or the payment of penalties to be guarantees. This is a powerful discouragement to fraudulent or exploitative activities. Other measures have also been implemented by DTI. For instance we have increased the maximum penalty for breaching the ICSTIS code of practice from &#163;100,000 to &#163;250,000. I expect the remaining recommendations to be implemented in the spring. It is important to get these regulatory changes right for the future and we have to meet requirements for extensive consultation of the industry and the public.

<a name="stpa_101">The impact on UK businesses of increases in gas prices will depend on a variety of factors, including how much gas a particular company uses, the degree of their exposure to spot and forward prices and the duration of high prices. It will also be affected by the energy prices paid by their competitors. A further sector-specific issue is whether they are in a competitive market where international trade sets the price or in a sector where prices are determined more locally and rising energy costs could be passed

<a name="stpa_102">Provisional data for October 2005 shows that UK retail gas prices for small, medium and large industrial users were below the EU15 median. However, individual companies will have agreed commercially confidential contract terms and prices that might differ from these averages. I am also aware, from my industry visits and meetings, that, there is some evidence that gas prices in the UK for some of our very large industrial users is above those on the continent, and I recognise the risk that this presents to UK competitiveness.

 Any increase in overall annual CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions from coal fired power stations running at a higher rate than usual will need to be covered by allowances under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. There is a fixed number of allowances which are allocated directly to installations, such as power stations. If an installation wants to increase emissions above its allowance, it will need to buy extra allowances from other holders of allowances who are able to abate emissions and therefore have allowances to sell. Allowances can also be bought through Kyoto protocol mechanisms whereby credits can be bought for emissions reductions in mainly developing countries. The Emissions Trading Scheme therefore works to ensure that those responsible for increased CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions on an annual basis have to pay for offsetting reductions in emissions elsewhere.

 The UK meets its international obligations to hold stocks of oil for use in the event of disruption of supplies by imposing obligations on companies. We believe that stocks held by companies are, in the event of an emergency, likely to be where they will be needed and capable of being quickly processed into the supply chain. The release of stocks following Hurricane Katrina has shown that the UK system was able to respond well to the disruption which occurred.

In order to return to full compliance with the UK obligations the Government agreed increases in company obligations with industry, and the UK has been fully compliant with the obligations since November 2004.

<p>
<a name="60119w21.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_112">We must, however, consider future needs. The UK&#039;s obligation will increase as our domestic production of oil declines. We have, therefore, consulted the oil industry and others about a new system which will ensure that the UK can continue to meet its obligations in future. We propose that this system should be based on products from refineries or entering the UK as imports. As we work with the industry to establish the system, we have agreed to explore the long-term potential of establishing an agency to ensure that stocking obligations are met.

<i>[holding answer 16 January 2006]:</i> Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for ensuring that community health services have satisfactory arrangements for clinical governance, whether they are provided by the PCT or commissioned from alternative providers. The Healthcare Commission&#039;s annual health check of PCTs will among other things assess how well they are discharging this responsibility.

<a name="stpa_131">A study funded by the MHRA and published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> on 2 July 2004, was conducted in two large hospitals in Merseyside in order to ascertain the current burden of ADRs in the national health service. The study found that of 18,820 patients aged over 16 years admitted to hospital over a six-month period, there were 1,225 admissions judged to be related to an ADR, giving a prevalence of 6.5 per cent. Of these 1,225, the ADR was judged to lead directly to the admission in 80 per cent. of cases. The median bed stay was eight days, accounting for 4 per cent. of the hospital bed capacity. The projected annual cost of such admissions to the NHS was &#163;466 million.

 The Eritrean demand for staff of Canadian, European, Russian and US nationalities to be removed from the UN Mission to Ethiopia/Eritrea (UNMEE) has added to the already highly tense situation. The withdrawal of those, plus other staff for their own safety, has in addition to the Eritrean restrictions on UNMEE already in place, further reduced UNMEE&#039;s monitoring and conflict prevention capability. This reduced capability and the resulting increase in tension may have a negative impact both on progress towards a peaceful resolution of the Ethiopia-Eritrea border dispute, and on stability and security in the Horn of Africa.

In general, the Government recognises that dwellings are vacant for a variety of reasons. About half of all private sector vacant dwellings are empty for less than six months and many of these will be unoccupied for transactional reasons to do with sale and renovation and will come back into occupation once sold or renovated. Dwellings that are vacant for non-transactional reasons often have problems associated with disrepair that must be overcome.

<sup>(27)</sup> A reliable estimate of the median shortfall in 2002&#150;03 is not available due to data limitations.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. A shortfall is defined as the difference between the rent charged by the landlord and the maximum amount of housing benefit a claimant could receive. This does not take into account non-dependant deductions or any income over the applicable amount.<br>




2. The average measure given in this response is the median as this will not be as influenced as the mean by a small number of extreme observations, some of which may be recorded incorrectly in the data. It is therefore more representative of the average rent shortfall.<br>
3. The average rent shortfalls presented in the table apply only to those cases assessed under the single room rent restriction where this restriction results in a rent shortfall. Some cases assessed under the single room rent restriction will be bound by other Rent Officer restrictions and some will not face a shortfall. In 2004&#150;05 three-quarters of all cases assessed under the single room rent restriction faced a shortfall as a result of this restriction.<br>

4. Average rent shortfalls are rounded to the nearest pound.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are rounded to the nearest thousand.<br>

2. Numbers are based on 1 per cent., 5 per cent. and 100 per cent. samples, and are therefore subject to a degree of sampling variation.<br>

3. JSA(IB) figures have been derived by applying 5 per cent. proportions to 100 per cent. WPLS totals.<br>

4. The data refers to benefit units, which may be a single person or a couple.<br>

5. Income-based JSA includes cases with underlying entitlement to contribution-based JSA.<br>

6. Council tax benefit totals exclude any second adult rebate cases.<br>

7. Housing benefit figures exclude any extended payment cases.<br>

8. Children are defined as children aged under 16 and young persons aged 16 to 18 in full time education.<br>

9. There will be a significant overlap between the figures as most people receive both HB and CTB, and a significant proportion also receives IS or JSA.<br>

10. Single parents are defined as all claimants with dependants and without a partner.<br>

11. Figures may be affected by the introduction of the new tax credits in April 2003.<br>

12. IS figures include MIG claimants.<br>

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>

<p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how much child maintenance outstanding from 1993&#150;94 to 2004&#150;05 from non-resident parents with cases with the Child Support Agency resulted from <i>(a)</i> full maintenance assessments and maintenance calculations where the outstanding amount is deemed to be possibly uncollectable or collectable, <i>(b)</i> full maintenance assessments and maintenance calculations where the outstanding amount is deemed probably uncollectable, <i>(c)</i> interim maintenance assessments where the outstanding

<ul>amount is deemed to be possibly uncollectable or collectable and <i>(d)</i> interim maintenance assessments where the outstanding amount is deemed to be probably uncollectable; and what proportion of each category of debt has been recovered.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68">The tables provided show Agency debt from 1994&#150;1995 to 2004&#150;2005 split by collectability and assessment type. These are cumulative figures representing debt arising from the respective year and all previous years as no debt has ever been written off by the Agency.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69">As reported in the 2004/05 annual report, the Agency updated the classification criteria used to analyse debt. This was to reflect improved management information around the recoverability of debt, resulting in more debt being classified as collectable. The outstanding amounts will be pursued vigorously through the Enforcement Directorate.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70">The Agency currently receives over &#163;585 million maintenance per year however there is still a culture surrounding its activities whereby some non-resident parents perceive it as acceptable not to comply with the Agency and make their maintenance payments. The Agency has therefore begun to take steps to tackle this issue.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71">Debt has been increasing year on year because many non-resident parents actively avoid their obligations for example by changing jobs when the Agency imposes enforcement action on them or changing addresses whenever the Agency locates them. The Agency recognises that it needs to make more use of its powers of enforcement, and has started to take steps to do this, however this is constrained by the requirements of the legal process and dependent on decisions made by the courts.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72">A dedicated Enforcement Directorate has been set up to focus on the collection of debt from the more difficult cases and the Agency is aggressively pursuing non-compliant clients more pro-actively than in the past. The directorate&#039;s aims are also to change the culture to one where it is not acceptable to deliberately avoid payment of maintenance.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73">The creation of the Enforcement Directorate has already improved the Agency&#039;s enforcement performance and effectiveness with improved outcomes at the more routine stages of enforcement for example, bailiff action, third party debt orders and charging orders.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74">The number of liability orders granted is improving with more than 4,500 liability orders being granted already this financial year. Also this year the amount collected by bailiff teams has doubled to &#163;3 million and the Agency has achieved successful outcomes in increasing numbers of committal actions. In addition, the directorate has achieved collections of &#163;8.39 million from April to November 2005, with November achieving the highest in month collections of &#163;1.42 million.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75">The actions outlined above should therefore start to reduce the historic debt levels and improve compliance.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76">The achievements are modest in the context of the total debt but demonstrate that more focussed enforcement action can be successful. I have also made recommendations to Ministers on further improving enforcement following my review of the operations of the Agency.</p>
</ul>

n/a=Not available.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The annual report and accounts for previous years were re-published in 1997&#150;98, due to a change in accounting policy in reporting collectability of the debt. Also, the Agency did not publish audited accounts in 1993&#150;94; and no figures are therefore shown for this year.<br>

2. The new scheme was launched on 3 March 2003, and (monies from new scheme cases and default maintenance decisions) began to accrue in the 2002&#150;03. Information is provided from this date.<br>

3. The &quot;Deferred&quot; figures represent arrears maintenance that the Agency has agreed not to collect from non-resident parents because the Agency was wholly or partly responsible for the build-up of those arrears.<br>

4. Full maintenance assessments and interim maintenance assessments include new and old scheme cases. Maintenance calculated and default maintenance decisions are new scheme only.<br>

5. The Agency is unable to provide the proportion recovered for each debt category. The principle behind the recoverability of debt as reported in the annual report and accounts is based on a sample of cases examined as part of a National Audit Office approved annual debt analysis exercise.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Numbers include deduction from earnings requests (DER&#039;s), which are issued when the non-resident parent is in the armed forces.<br>

2. Numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand.<br>

3. Robust information covering the period May 2003 to February 2004 is not currently available.<br>

4. The number of cases includes those old scheme cases with a full maintenance assessment, and those new scheme cases with either a full maintenance calculation, or a default maintenance decision. Old scheme cases with a punitive interim maintenance assessment (an imposed assessment due to the non co-operation of the non-resident parent), a small number of which would have deductions from earnings orders in place, are excluded from this analysis in line with the Agency&#039;s target definitions, as are new scheme cases being processed clerically. There are also currently around 5,000 cases for which the method of payment is unknown, some of which could be DEOs.<br>

 The primary impact on recruitment and employment of disabled people among businesses of all sizes stems from the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 as amended by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Amendment) Regulations 2003. These Regulations significantly extended the employment provisions of the 1995 Act to cover small employers and all previously excluded occupations, except the armed forces, from 1 October 2004.

(i) The figures are given for Great Britain since the Northern Ireland Child Support Agency administers child support in Northern Ireland.<br>

(ii) The fact that the number of suspensions and actual penalties is less than half the number of referrals is explained by the number of debtors who enter into agreements to pay rather than attend court. Similarly, only a very small number of debtors actually go to prison or lose their driving licences because the courts normally suspend a sentence on condition that the defendant commits to pay.<br>

 The Government have taken a number of steps to help all people save for their retirement, including contracted and sub-contracted workers who do not have access to a suitable company pension scheme. For employees, the introduction of the state second pension in April 2002 is helping around 18.7 million people to build up entitlement to a second tier pension: this includes around 5.8 million low earners, and around 8.8 million moderate earners.

<a name="qnpa_34">We also introduced stakeholder pensions in April 2001 as an additional pension option. These are flexible and portable with a limit on annual management charges, and they allow for minimum contributions of as little as &#163;20 at a time. As stakeholder pensions are also open to non-earners, policy holders can continue to contribute to their pension plan in any periods of non-employment. These features may be of particular benefit to contracted and sub-contracted workers, who may have interrupted work patterns.

Notes:<br>

1. Total calls received exclude calls outside working hours.<br>

2. It is not possible to break down ineffective calls into those that did or did not receive an engaged tone for old system calls in 2002&#150;03.<br>

3. Other ineffective calls are those that result in a ring tone but no reply, fail due to network technical problems, or are answered by a BT message but do not connect to the CSA system.<br>

4. The figures exclude new system (CS2) calls received between April 2003 and June 2003 (of which there were 225,000) as the Agency does not hold disaggregated management information as to the outcome of these calls.<br>

5. &#039;Calls for which outcome not recorded&#039;, are those which were received but for which, due to problems with the Ml system, the eventual outcome was not recorded. Some of these calls would have been answered, and others would have been abandoned. The volume of such calls has decreased significantly in the last 3 years as management information systems have improved.<br>

6. &#039;Calls for which outcome recorded&#039; are those which were received and for which there is management information to track the eventual outcome.<br>





7. IVR denotes the automated touch tone part of the process where customers enter their details via the telephone key pad. Once callers have cleared this part of the process, they enter a queue to be answered by a member of CSA staff. There is no IVR process on the old system.<br>

8. Numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand, and percentages to the nearest per cent. Components may not sum to totals due to rounding.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he plans to amend the criminal law in relation to environmental matters as a consequence of the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 15 September 2003.  [41027]</p>




<p><a name="st_277"><a name="60119w34.html_spnew7"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 In its judgment of 13 September 2005 the European Court of Justice annulled certain European legislation to protect the environment through criminal law because it had been adopted under the wrong treaty provisions. That annulment has no impact on the application of national laws of the United Kingdom. Moreover, the United Kingdom relied largely on existing legislation in order to comply with the instrument. The Government have no plans to amend the criminal law in relation to environmental matters as a consequence of the judgment.

 There are no plans to bring the number down. The relatively large number of people on the British National DNA Database means there is a greater chance of matching DNA found at the scene of a crime to a suspect. The Database provides the public with a vital intelligence tool, providing around 3,000 intelligence matches per month. There has been a four-fold increase in the number of detections obtained through the use of DNA between 1999 and 2005.

Testing on Arrest is currently operational in three areas of England and will commence in all other DIP intensive areas in England on 31 March 2006.

 People in prison are being helped to stop smoking through services specially targeted to meet their needs, including nicotine replacement therapy. In 2001&#150;02 the Department of Health ran a pilot project on smoking cessation in prison. It publication, &quot;Acquitted&quot;, is a reference guide for those starting up new stop smoking services in the prison setting and outlines key learning points from the project. It is targeted at both NHS smoking services and prisons. An evaluation is under way to report on the Department of Health&#039;s &#163;1.5 million investment, between 2003 and 2006, for smoking cessation services in prisons.

 As regards adult offenders, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides that a custodial sentence may only be imposed on adult offenders when the offence is so serious that no other sentence can be justified. A wide range of non-custodial sentences is available to deal with offenders. While sentencing in individual cases is entirely a matter for the courts, the Government believes that prison should be reserved for dangerous, violent and seriously persistent offenders.

<p>
<a name="60119w36.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_199">The 2003 Act also provides that before passing a custodial sentence on an offender who is or appears to be mentally disordered, the court must consider any information before it relating to his mental condition, and the likely effect of a custodial sentence on that condition. Section 166 of the Act specifically allows the court to mitigate sentences for mentally disordered offenders, and to impose non-custodial sentences where normally a custodial sentence would be justified.

Defendants also enjoy the protections afforded by Article six of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), the right to a fair trial.

 There are two distinct sets of guidelines which cover police officers and police staff. These are as follows:
</p>


<p>
<a name="60119w38.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_215"><i>1. Police Staff are covered by NICS code paragraph 1084, which states:</i>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_161">An individual may at any time be suspended from duty if, in the opinion of the person exercising disciplinary powers, that course is a necessary precaution in the public interest pending the outcome of criminal or disciplinary investigations or proceedings, and no alternative course eg transfer to other duties is appropriate. Suspension in these circumstances, as distinct from suspension as a disciplinary penalty (see paragraph 1093d), does not imply any decisions about the case, and this important distinction should be kept in mind whenever any record or report of the period of absence is necessary. Pay in respect of any period of suspension may be withheld wholly or in part so long as such suspension continues, if the person exercising disciplinary powers so decides. In such circumstances individuals may be told that they may be eligible to claim for National Insurance benefits such as unemployment or sickness or supplementary benefits. Where it is decided that pay, in the whole or in part, should continue, for the purposes of calculating the amount to be paid the person on suspension should be treated in the same way as staff treated during the first six months of sickness absence. This would entail, among other things, paying shift disturbance (SDA) for the first 30 days but not paying notional overtime. Any decision to withhold pay will be subject to early and regular review; among the factors taken into account will be the circumstances of the alleged offence and the person&#039;s dependents. If disciplinary proceedings result in a penalty any withheld pay in respect of the suspension will be forfeited wholly or in part if the person exercising disciplinary powers so determines after consideration of all the circumstances of the case. Any withheld pay which it is decided will not be forfeited will be paid. Someone cleared of all charges, will receive a net sum making up any shortfall in net pay that would have been received during the period of suspension. Where it is concluded that someone should be paid during the period of suspension including retrospective payment, the period, the period should reckon under the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme in the normal way. The procedures set out in this paragraph do not affect the practice whereby a line manager may send someone home if the circumstances seem to require this: unless this is for a very brief period, however, consideration should be given by the person exercising disciplinary powers to the need for formal suspension.</p>

 An independent evaluation of the Early Support Pilot Programme began in July 2004 and is being undertaken by the University of Manchester, in association with the University of Central Lancashire. A report on the outcomes and cost effectiveness of the programme will be available towards the end of June 2006. To date, feedback about the programme and its materials from parents and professionals working with disabled children has been extremely positive.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what policy options will be considered following the Institute of Fiscal Studies evaluation of the work of employment training pilots up to 2004.  [43738]</p>




<p><a name="st_339"><a name="60119w41.html_spnew3"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The IPS report covers the first phase of the Employer Training Pilots (ETP) and has highlighted that we need to do more to attract the harder to reach employers. The subsequent phases of the pilots have shown us better how to do this, which has been one of the many real values of the pilots and their evaluation. ETP has also been the subject of an ongoing evaluation by the Institute of Employment Studies (IES). The development of the new national programme, Train to Gain, was based on the lessons learned from these evaluations. The final IES evaluation report is due in the spring, and we will consider the findings of that report alongside the IPS report.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60119w41.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_226">Skills brokers in Train to Gain will have a target of at least half the employers they engage being &quot;hard to reach&quot;, additional employers. We are making &#163;15 million available in 2005&#150;06 and &#163;20 million in 2006&#150;07 to develop the capacity of the brokerage network and implement a performance management system that focuses services on this priority and rewards achievement accordingly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60119w41.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_227">A number of evaluations, including the IPS report, have shown that employers identify many benefits from ETP including productivity improvement, changed attitudes to learning, improved motivation and provided employers and employees with a platform for progression. Participating employers were more likely to train their low-skilled staff to the benefit of their business and say that ETP has allowed them to train more people over a shorter period of time. So we are confident that we are already involving more hard-to-reach learners.

 We do not currently hold data on the number of children and adults that have made use of extended services accessed through schools and it could only be provided at disproportionate cost. However we do have data on the number of schools offering access to extended services from a baseline survey of maintained schools published in September 2005. This survey showed that 87 per cent. of primary and 95 per cent. of secondary schools provide some form of childcare or activities outside of normal school hours; 69 per cent. of primary and 66 per cent. of secondary schools provide some form of parenting support; and 75 per cent. of primary schools and 97 per cent. of secondary schools provide wider community access to their facilities such as sports, arts and ICT facilities. This is a good baseline to build on and we will continue to monitor progress.

 As announced on 8 December, the estimated set-up costs are &#163;224 million over the next three years. This includes the costs of adapting existing systems that will supply the data to the index and ensuring that data are accurate; adapting the day-to-day systems used by practitioners so they can access the index from those systems; introducing robust arrangements to ensure security, and training staff to use the index properly.

Developing and implementing large IT-enabled systems is not an area where DfES can rely on employing permanent civil servants to deliver, since we cannot offer the career structure or range of projects that people with the necessary specialist skills will be seeking. There is no alternative approach which will deliver to Government at lower cost the expert people with the skills we need to deliver this project.

 The Department&#039;s Effective Provision of Pre-School Education (EPPE) study has reported that the EPPE findings are similar to those of research studies in other countries, including the US, Canada, Norway, Germany and New Zealand. The EPPE study uses the same quality measures as in key US studies to facilitate comparisons. It will continue to follow children&#039;s development to the end of Key Stage 2, looking at comparisons with international research.
