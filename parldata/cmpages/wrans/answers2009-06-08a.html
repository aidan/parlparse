It would bring about change in as much as EU activities will be designed and implemented in ways that support democratic processes and strengthen democratic principles.

 Noting the key role it plays in flood risk management, the Met Office is committed to improving its forecasting capability to meet the needs of emergency responders. Following a major investment in supercomputing it is already exploiting a new, highly detailed, forecast model that provides significantly improved support for the issue of flood related warnings. Building on this capability, in line with recommendation 3 of the Pitt review, the Met Office has developed a detailed research plan and started work which will further enhance its ability to forecast local-scale heavy rainfall events and further increase the amount of warning it is able to give to responders for such events. This research programme is due to be completed by summer 2012 in line with the timetable outlined by the Government in response to the Pitt Review, although some benefits will be realised before this.</p>

<i> [holding answer 24 April 2009]:</i> The UK has led the world in taking a strategic and long-term approach to the problem of climate change. Existing policies are already enabling &#163;50 billion of low carbon investment over the three years to 2011, and helping to support 900,000 jobs. Budget 2009 builds on these foundations and provides over &#163;1.4 billion of extra targeted support in the low carbon sector. Together with announcements made last autumn, these measures will enable an additional &#163;10.4 billion of low carbon and energy investment over the next three years. This will help protect investment and jobs in the low carbon sector in the short term and provide the foundations for strong growth in the future.</p>

 The International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Co-operation (IPEEC) was formally launched at the meeting of G8 Energy Ministers in Rome on 24 May 2009.

We hope that IPEEC will quickly expand beyond its founding members (the G8, China, India, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico and the European Commission). At the G8 Energy Ministers meeting the partners issued an open invitation for all interested countries to join IPEEC.

 The National Expert Panel for New and Emerging Infections (NEPNEI) concluded, in November 2004, that Lyme disease was the most significant public health vector-borne disease in the United Kingdom. The Panel considered incidence and detection of disease in the UK and modes of transmission.</p>

His report &#147;The use of unorthodox and unvalidated laboratory tests in the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis and in relation to medically unexplained symptoms&#148;, has been placed in the Library.</p>

Advice was also received confirming that only validated tests that conform to the internationally agreed criteria for the diagnosis of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent for Lyme disease, should be used for the diagnosis of Lyme disease. This advice is consistent with that on the HPA&#146;s website.</p>

Ratepayers occupying property that received transitional relief in 2008-09 will in addition be able to defer payment of 60 per cent. of the increase in their 2009-10 rates bills due to the end of the 2005 transitional relief scheme.</p>

 Zimbabwe&#146;s social and economic decline has forced many Zimbabweans to leave the country during the last few years. The vast majority of those leaving do so by irregular means and do not request refugee status. They are viewed by neighbouring governments as illegal economic migrants and run the risk of deportation. It is therefore difficult to assess their numbers or provide assistance. Since 2000, oppressive policies and post-election violence have also seen hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans forcibly displaced within the country. However the Government of Zimbabwe denies the existence of internally displaced people and has thus refused a comprehensive national assessment of their numbers and needs.</p>

The UK also provides further support to Zimbabwean migrants, including street children, in Zambia and South Africa. DFID will provide around &#163;49 million of humanitarian and other essential support to the people of Zimbabwe this financial year, none of which goes through the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>

 Probation areas have been required to promote the unpaid work community sentence as Community Payback since 2005. This has been done in a variety of ways including the use of signs at Community Payback work sites and on vehicles. In addition Probation areas have also worked to generate local and national publicity in order to increase public awareness of the millions of hours worked by offenders to make reparation for the crimes and to improve local communities. To further increase visibility and public confidence the use of distinctive clothing, to be worn by offenders sentenced to Community Payback, was introduced on 1 December 2008. This followed the review, &#145;Engaging Communities in Fighting Crime&#146;, which proposed that community payback should be made increasingly visible.
