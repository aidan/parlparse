groups prior to 1997 are not comparable see background note 5. In 2001 Social Class was replaced by the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC), and since then infant mortality figures have been published by NS-SEC. It is not possible to use NS-SEC for data prior to 2001 because there is not a one-to-one equivalence with the Social Class classification; an approximation is used, referred to as NS-SEC90 because it is based on the 1990 occupational classification. NS-SEC90 is used specifically to aid interpretation of trends over time in infant mortality and was calculated back to 1997.</p>

The resulting increases in individual cow milk yields can reduce methane emissions per unit of milk produced. The DEFRA research has included for example developing grass varieties that are high in sugar and lead indirectly to a reduction in methane emissions. Complementary private sector research, including research sponsored by DEFRA through our Sustainable Livestock LINK Programme, has raised the efficiency of dairy production.</p>

First, we want to integrate the Stern report&#146;s recommendations about international climate change into the UK&#146;s own international climate change policy. For example, the report set out the key role of carbon pricing to ensure that the costs of climate change are factored into all economic decisions. The Chancellor, the Environment Secretary and the Trade and Industry Secretary subsequently published the Government&#146;s vision to ensure that the EU Emissions Trading Scheme works to become the centre of a global carbon market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_400"><a name="70109w0006.htm_para2"><a name="0701118000424">Second, we are committed to taking action at home that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions without reducing economic growth. For example, the Stern report suggests a credible long-term framework is crucial to ensure effective low-carbon investment decisions and thus enhance competitiveness. In this respect, we announced a new Climate Change Bill, which will put into statute the Government&#146;s long-term goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent. by 2050 and set out a framework for achieving this. This will also strengthen our ability to be global leaders in a future international framework for climate change.</p>

The police quickly took control and imposed a curfew. There have been no further outbreaks of violence in the area and this appears to be an isolated situation, which boiled over.

This includes support to the excellent work of Coventry Cathedral on building trust and understanding at grass-roots level between different religious and ethnic communities, which has contributed to a drop in the level of violence and an increased level of dialogue between Christians and Muslims. We are also funding the work of the Bridge Builders Foundation, a mixed Christian and Muslim organisation operating in northern Nigeria, to look into the causes of recent conflict between Christians and Muslims.

Grossing these to population estimates suggests that the number of working age adults in Britain who live in a workless household has fallen by approximately 1.3 million, from 4.74 million in 1993 to 3.47 million in 2003. Almost all pensioners live in a workless household (by definition), and so we have excluded this from the pensioner analysis.)</p>

For this reason, it is not possible to predict what levels of humanitarian spending are likely over the next three years.

2. The data are based on the number of soldiers joining the untrained strength of the Infantry Divisions during the period 1 October 2005 and 30 September 2006. The figures also include untrained soldiers returning from being Long-Term Illegally Absent.<br>
3. The data have been rounded to the nearest 10, numbers ending in &#145;5&#146; have been rounded to the nearest multiple of 20 to avoid systematic bias. Totals have been rounded separately and therefore may not be equal to the sum of their parts.<br>

These include drug testing for heroin and crack/cocaine following arrest for &#147;trigger offences&#148;, or any offence where a police officer of inspector rank or above suspects the misuse of such drugs caused or contributed to the offence. For those who test positive there is a requirement to attend an initial assessment with a drugs worker and, where applicable, restrictions on bail are used to encourage offenders to address their drug misuse problems. Other features of the programme are the case management of offenders and the brokering of access to other service such as housing or training support.</p>

In this context, being on the caseload means that individuals are being case managed by drug workers, having been assessed as requiring interventions which are agreed in a specific care plan. The drugs worker will ensure that there is at all times co-ordination of the care plan, which in addition to drug treatment this may include support with issues relating to accommodation, finances and rebuilding family relationships. The cumulative caseload will change as new clients are engaged and existing ones no longer require management or are temporarily suspended while their management is supervised elsewhere.</p>

However, there are good reasons for believing that the great majority of the prison population has a profile on the NDNAD. Forces have had the power to retain DNA taken from those convicted of recordable offences since the establishment of the DNA Database in 1995. For the first few years this power was exercised in relation to more serious offenders, but from 2000 onwards additional funding was made available under the DNA Expansion Programme to make it standard practice to take samples from all offenders. In addition, two prisoner sampling projects have been undertaken, most recently in 2003, to take DNA from any prisoner who had not already been sampled, for example because they had been imprisoned before DNA sampling was widely practiced.</p>

Year Childcare Strategy commitments and to discuss issues of implementation including those relating to the 2006 code of practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_588"><a name="70109w0021.htm_para7"><a name="07011136001171">Since the code of practice came into force in April 2006, Ministers and officials have received a range of correspondence from a variety of stakeholders. Correspondents routinely acknowledge the benefits of the free entitlement for children, and demonstrate commitment to its delivery. A number of correspondents have raised issues relating to the arrangements for increasing the free entitlement from 33 to 38 weeks and to 15 hours per week by 2010, and a number have expressed views about the Government&#146;s position on providers charging parents for elements of their free provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_589"><a name="70109w0021.htm_para8"><a name="07011136001172">In responding, I have been clear that the Government provide sufficient funding to local authorities for the delivery of a universal free early learning entitlement that benefits all children regardless of their parents&#146; income or ability to pay. Local authorities have discretion over the use they make of funding from the Dedicated Schools Grant including the rates at which they fund early education in all types of setting. They are encouraged to fund early years provision equitably across settings in accordance with local circumstances. It has always been unacceptable for providers to charge so called &#147;top up fees&#148; for the free entitlement, in addition to the money they receive from local authorities for delivering the free entitlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_590"><a name="70109w0021.htm_para9"><a name="07011136001173">We conducted a full public consultation on the 2006 code of practice, to which 585 responses were received, the majority from private providers. Most respondents were content with the extension of the free entitlement to 38 weeks in all sectors. None of those who responded questioned the requirement to ensure that the entitlement is entirely free at the point of delivery.</p>

The purpose of Pneumoconiosis Etc. (Workers Compensation) Act 1979 is to provide compensation for sufferers of certain dust related diseases (or their dependants on their behalf) who are unable to claim damages from employers. No payments have been made to the relatives under either scheme where they have exposure to asbestos from washing overalls and the Department operates no other schemes under which compensation would be payable.</p>

We will however be looking at all options for the future and we intend publishing a consultation document in early 2007. The Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform has met the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council (MAC) and discussed the issue of the review of the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit scheme.

Information is not available at local authority or constituency level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_604"><a name="70109w0023.htm_para6"><a name="07011136001393">The rationale behind compensation recovery is twofold. Firstly it ensures that the taxpayer (via the benefit system) does not subsidise the costs arising from a compensator&#146;s actions. Secondly it ensures that an injured person is not compensated twice for the same need, once via the benefit system and again via the compensation payment. This is achieved by an offset mechanism within the scheme, which allows the compensator to reduce the compensation by some or all of the benefit repaid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_605"><a name="70109w0023.htm_para7"><a name="07011136001394">Legislation to exempt payments made to former employees of Turner and Newall (and associated companies) suffering from asbestos related diseases from the scheme is currently being brought forward. The exemption is being made due to the unique nature of these cases. Payments are being made from two Trust Funds set up for the sole purpose of meeting asbestos liabilities. Due to the insolvent position of the parent American company however the Trust will not meet the claims in full.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_606"><a name="70109w0023.htm_para8"><a name="07011136001395">Operating the compensation recovery scheme in these cases would further reduce payments to those suffering from asbestos related diseases. The exemption does not breach either of the fundamental principles of the scheme as the finite amount to be paid out has already been established and the sufferers will only receive a small portion of their gross compensation awards.</p>

1. The figures for the years 2002-03 and 2003-04 include only automated payments. These account for the great majority of payments made. Figures for clerical payments made in these years are not available broken down by country. However clerical payments are included in the figures from 2004-05.<br>
2. Malta and Cyprus joined the European Union and therefore became part of the European Economic Area in May 2004. Winter fuel payments could be paid to eligible former UK residents living in these countries from winter 2004-05. The figures for winter 2004-05 include some payments made for earlier years where entitlement had been established but not paid prior to leaving the UK.<br>
3. Figures for payments made are rounded to the nearest five and figures for costs are rounded to the nearest 1,000.<br>
