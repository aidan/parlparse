 No representations regarding co-operation between the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) and NXT have been addressed to DERA and I am not aware that any representations have been received elsewhere in the Department.

<a name="00419w01.html_para0"><i>Letter from Robert Walmsley to Mr. Robert Key, dated 19 April 2000:</i>
<P>

<a name="00419w01.html_para1">

<BR>
I am replying to your questions to the Secretary of State for Defence asking for estimates of the sums to be spent each year on the new carriers until they enter service and their annual operating costs. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.
<BR>
Our estimates of annual procurement costs for the new carriers are projections of equipment costs for internal planning purposes and furthermore their disclosure could damage the competitive process. I am therefore withholding the information requested under exemptions 2 and 7a of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. As to operating costs, annual estimates for the support of the carriers have still to be established.
<BR>
I am able to confirm, however, that the estimated total procurement cost of the future carriers is broadly &#163;2Bn with operating and support costs of around &#163;3.5Bn over the life of the programme. Both these figures are at 1999 prices.

<a name="00419w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The statement in the press on 28 March attributed to an MOD spokesman was taken out of context. The Ministry of Defence press office issued a 



<P>
<P><I>19 Apr 2000 : Column: 480W</I><P>
statement that day making it clear that it did not represent my view, nor that of the Ministry of Defence and that there was no reason why British shipyards should not be able to bid competitively for roll-on roll-off ferry work either in the UK or abroad.
<P>

<a name="00419w01.html_para2">The Government have encouraged consortiums bidding for the MOD sealift contract to look to UK shipyards. Bids are still being considered and we expect a decision to be taken in the late spring.

 The "Presidency" of the Western European Union is currently held by Portugal, who also currently hold the Presidency of the European Union. I have met my Portuguese counterpart in his EU capacity where we discussed future arrangements for European Defence--but we have not met in his WEU capacity.

<P>
<a name="00419w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Key Targets have been set for the Chief Executive of the Defence Analytical Services Agency for the financial year 2000-01. The targets build on the progress already made by the Agency since it was formed in 1992 and are as follows:
<P>

<a name="00419w01.html_para5">

<BR>
<i>Delivery of Customer Service</i>
<BR>
The majority of the Agency's business is covered by Service Level Agreements with customers, which set out the targets for timeliness and quality of work. For those parts of the business where Service Level Agreements are not appropriate, project agreements are in place. The Agency is committed to continuous improvement in the range and quality of the services it provides to customers. Key targets are:
<BR>
a. To meet at least 95 per cent. of the timeliness and quality targets set in Service Level Agreements and project agreements.
<BR>
b. To have at least 90 per cent. of customers saying they are at least satisfied with the timeliness, quality of work and helpfulness of staff in the annual Customer Satisfaction Survey.
<BR>
c. To have at least 25 per cent. of customers who received DASA services in 1999-2000 and 2000-01 report an improvement in services provided in the annual Customer Satisfaction Survey.
<BR>
<i>Efficiency and Quality</i>
<BR>
The Agency plans to make efficiency savings in 2000-01 as well as continuing to meet the additional demands placed upon it by new Departmental studies and initiatives. DASA is part of the Government Statistical Service and will play its part in 



<P>
<P><I>19 Apr 2000 : Column: 481W</I><P>
implementing "National Statistics"--the Government's policy on improving the integrity, quality and freedom from political interference of official statistics. Key targets are:
<BR>
a. To make all of DASA's unclassified National Statistics publications available on the MOD Intranet and the DASA internet websites.
<BR>
b. To conduct a review of the production and publication of armed forces and MOD civilian personnel statistics against National Statistics quality standards.
<BR>
c. To deliver efficiency savings with a value of 2.2 per cent. of the initial running cost allocation.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what was the outcome of the Agriculture Council held in Luxembourg on 17 to 18 April; and if he will make a statement.  [119918]

<P>
<P>
<a name="00419w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 I represented the UK at the Agriculture Council meeting in Luxembourg on 17 April.
<P>

<a name="00419w01.html_para6">The Council reached political agreement by qualified majority (only Denmark expressing dissent) on a Community wide system of rules for the compulsory labelling of beef. The first stage of the scheme--providing for most beef sold to consumers to show the member state where it was slaughtered and cut/deboned and the approval numbers of the relevant establishments--should come into effect on 1 September 2000. The second stage, coming into effect on 1 January 2002, will additionally require labelling by reference to country of origin. I welcomed this agreement which will ensure British consumers can look forward to clearer, more informative labelling on beef. The agreement will now be put to the European Parliament for its consideration with a view to adoption of a Regulation before 1 September.
<P>

<a name="00419w01.html_para7">Commissioner Franz Fischler reported the latest developments in the WTO agriculture negotiations in Geneva. Along with many other Ministers, I welcomed the start of negotiations and encouraged the Commission to continue its efforts to facilitate the launch of a new Round of comprehensive trade negotiations and to continue pursuing a constructive line in the agriculture negotiations in accordance with the Council mandate agreed last autumn.
<P>

<a name="00419w01.html_para8">Under Other Business, I raised concerns about the impact on British millers of the operation of a WTO concession permitting the import of maize from third countries into Spain and Portugal at reduced duty rates. Originally intended to cover maize for animal feed, an increasing proportion was being imported as flint maize which is used for processing into breakfast cereals. This was distorting the single market to the detriment of millers in the UK and other northern member states. Commissioner Fischler undertook to try to resolve this problem with the main exporting countries in time for the next marketing year.

<P>
<a name="00419w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply, as responsibility for food safety and standards matters has now passed to the Food Standards Agency (FSA) which reports to Parliament through Health Ministers.
<P>

<a name="00419w01.html_para9">The FSA funds extensive independent research programmes to support and further its aim of protecting public health from risks which could arise from the consumption of food. The results of these are made widely available to all sectors of the food industry via scientific literature, and from the agency on request, to assist them in ensuring that the food that they are supplying does not pose an unacceptable risk to health. The availability of the results is also publicised in the Agency's Food Safety Information Bulletin when the work has been completed.

 The Government set out their policy towards dealing with the problems of traffic noise on roads managed by the Highways Agency in "A New Deal for Trunk Roads in England". In addition to the increased use of quieter surfaces both for new roads and for roads needing maintenance, we proposed to set aside a budget for the Highways Agency to provide additional mitigation in the worst cases where no other action was being taken. The budget and qualifying criteria were announced on 22 March 1999 and a letter from the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency listing locations which would be subject to a detailed investigation of feasible measures was published in the 11 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 681-83.

<P>

<a name="00419w02.html_para15">I have not set any target for the use of quieter road surfaces in general because the Highways Agency routinely considers their use in all cases where a trunk road needs to be re-surfaced.

This has been achieved after sustained effort over many months by staff in the Department and in the British Embassy in Paris.

 It is important that the public has an opportunity to comment on the proposed installation of telecommunications masts.

In respect of mast development carried out under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (GPDO), under the 42 day prior approval procedure, the operator is required to erect a site notice to publicise the development proposed, in order to provide the public with a clear opportunity to comment to the local planning authority on the siting and appearance of the proposed mast.

The sSRA reports to Ministers as necessary. Railtrack has confirmed that it is on course to meet its contractual commitments to Virgin in 2002 and 2005. The Rail Regulator has published a draft final order he proposes to make, which would require Railtrack to produce robust plans which demonstrate that it can in fact do so, and that it can meet the reasonable requirements of other train operators and funders including the sSRA.

 Except as provided otherwise, a water company, under section 142 of the Water Industry Act 1991, may fix charges by reference to such matters and may adopt such methods and principles for the calculation and imposition of the charges as appear to them to be appropriate.

 My Department has today issued a consultation paper setting out proposals to bring standards for drinking water supplied by English water companies into line with those set out in the new EC Drinking Water Directive. Responses are invited by 30 June 2000.
<P>

<a name="00419w04.html_para6">The quality of drinking water is a vital element of public health. Its overall quality in England and Wales is very high. Of the nearly three million tests carried out on drinking water in 1998, 99.78 per cent. met the required standard. The new regulations will revise and tighten standards to take account of the latest scientific and medical advice. The most important change proposed is a reduction from 50g/l to 10g/l by 2013 in the maximum permitted concentration of lead in drinking water. This change is in accordance with the latest World Health Organisation guidelines and is introduced primarily to protect unborn children and infants. Neuro toxic effects from exposure to excessive levels of lead are known to contribute to problems in learning and behaviour and to slightly lower IQs.

<P>
<a name="00419w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Research which I am publishing today shows that small business tenants still have little knowledge of property matters. I consider it essential that they should be properly informed, to enable them to get the best deals in the market rather than the standard packages still too often on offer.
<P>

<a name="00419w05.html_para23">I urge the industry and professions to join Government in ensuring that small businesses, and particularly those starting in business for the first time, have access to information about property arrangements. We will be making a contribution through the new Small Business Service, but I look to the industry and the professions to play their part.

<P>

<a name="00419w05.html_para25">The research, on the impact of the Code of Practice on Commercial Property Leases since its introduction in 1995, was carried out by Reading University and was designed to see how far the Code of Practice had brought about more flexibility in the commercial property market.

<a name="00419w05.html_para27">I am concerned that upward-only rent reviews still predominate in longer leases, and while I welcome the report's evidence of greater flexibility, I am disappointed that the Code of Practice has not had a greater influence.

 Since 1 January 1982, the Civil Aviation Authority has, under a Memorandum of Understanding negotiated with the then Secretary of State for Trade, undertaken responsibility, on behalf of the Secretary of State, for advising local authorities on planning applications relating to sites within Public Safety Zones. The draft circular issued for consultation on 15 June 1999 contained guidance to local authorities to enable them to decide planning applications within Public Safety Zones without the need for advice from the Authority. In the light of the comments received on the draft circular, I am satisfied that I should meet the Authority's wish to discontinue its role in Public Safety Zone administration. The Authority will be terminating the Memorandum of Understanding with early effect. In the interim period before the new circular comes into effect, my Department will be willing to provide advice to local authorities in place of the Authority where this would be appropriate.

<P>
<a name="00419w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I am pleased to be able to announce today the successful conclusion of my negotiations with the newspaper publishers. Ten years ago, the publishers entered into a voluntary agreement with the Government to increase levels of recycled fibre in newspapers. Over the last decade this has led to increases in the recycled content of newspapers from 28 per cent. to 52.4 per cent.
<P>

<a name="00419w06.html_para1">Both I and the newspaper publishers acknowledge that to achieve further significant increases in recycled content will require a major addition to the recycled output from British newspaper mills. However, in anticipation that the new capacity will be forthcoming within the next two years UK publishers have agreed the following targets: 60 per cent. by the end of 2001; 65 per cent. by the end of 2003; 70 per cent. by the end of 2006.
<P>

<a name="00419w06.html_para2">The newspaper publishers have said that it is their firm intention to achieve these targets but the Government recognise that there may be factors beyond their control. Progress towards these targets will, therefore, be continually monitored by the Newspaper Recycling Working Group with formal in-depth reviews carried out at each target stage. At these reviews, the following factors will be taken into account:
<P>

<a name="00419w06.html_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the availability of additional reprocessing capacity, which is dependent on whether a decision to increase investment is reached this year;

the quality of the recycled newsprint available and, in particular, whether this hindered the production process significantly and damaged the product;

any uncompetitive pricing of recycled newsprint by newsprint suppliers.

</FONT></UL>
<a name="00419w06.html_para4">The reviews will be on the basis of an understanding that the objective of the agreement is to achieve high and rising recycled content of UK newspapers; and the newspaper publishers have reaffirmed their commitment to continue to achieve the most stringent targets compatible with such newly arising factors which may be beyond the control of industry.

As a non-departmental public body, the Commission is subject to a financial management and policy review every five years and my Department appointed in-house consultants last January to undertake this work. The Review, which comprised two stages, is now complete. Stage 1 found that there is a continuing need for the Royal Commission to advise Government on environmental policy and sustainable development and that the Commission provided the most efficient and cost-effective means of delivering this.
<P>

<a name="00419w06.html_para5">The second stage of the Review considered the performance of the Commission in greater depth, making recommendations on the Commission's relationship with Government; its strategic planning arrangements, including processes for reviewing performance and auditing impact; internal organisation and working methods, financial management, staffing and the role of the secretariat; and membership arrangements, including appointments. The overall conclusion of the Review is very positive and, though a number of recommendations are intended to enhance effectiveness, the Review commends the Commission for action which it has already taken to update and improve its working methods.

The arrangements uphold the constitutional position of Gibraltar, while at the same time removing a major obstacle to the development of EU business.

To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission, what steps the House of Commons has taken following the judgment of the High Court in the case of Harmon <i>v.</i> Corporate Officer of the House of Commons.  [119804]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00419w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 On 28 October 1999, His Honour Judge Lloyd QC gave judgment on liability in this action, which was brought by an unsuccessful tenderer for the fenestration contract for Portcullis House. The judge held that the Corporate Officer, on behalf of the House, was liable to Harmon for breach of the Public Works Contracts Regulations 1991, of European law and implied contract. The action is now continuing for the purpose of assessing the amount of the damages.
<P>

<a name="00419w08.html_para0">Concerned by the judgment, the House of Commons Commission asked the Clerk of the House to arrange an independent inquiry. On 17 January 2000, the Clerk accordingly appointed Sir Thomas Legg KCB QC, a former Permanent Secretary of the Lord Chancellor's Department, and Mr. Peter Bosworth, a consultant specialising in project management, to consider the judgment in the case, to inquire into the circumstances which led to it, and to advise him, and through him the Commission, on any action to be taken, including any changes in the structure and practices of the Parliamentary Works Directorate.
<P>

<a name="00419w08.html_para1">Sir Thomas and Mr. Bosworth completed their inquiry, and submitted their report, on 21 March 2000. The action is still <i>sub judice</i> but I can tell hon. Members that the inquiry concluded in the first place that serious mistakes were made in the handling of the fenestration contract, which exposed the House to liability; and secondly that in future major projects the Parliamentary Works Directorate should establish more clearly: (a) the roles and responsibilities of key members of the project team; (b) a project management process to include guidelines and control systems; and (c) lines of governance within a culture of professional and technical support; and that these recommendations should be taken into account in the current review of the Parliamentary Works Directorate.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2000]:</i> There is a maximum national level of fines for the offence of parking illegally in an area reserved for disabled drivers. The maximum penalty is a level 3 fine, currently &#163;1,000. When such offences are brought before the courts it is for the court to decide the nature and severity of penalties, taking account of the circumstances of the offence and the offender.
<P>

<a name="00419w10.html_para1">More commonly, such offences are dealt with under the fixed penalty system in which the offender is required to pay a fixed penalty notice in lieu of prosecution. This is currently &#163;20 for all such non-endorsable offences outside London, &#163;30 inside London and &#163;40 on Red Routes. The 



<P>

different levels of penalty reflect greater traffic pressures and congestion in London and the need for greater compliance. The level of fixed penalty are under review.

<i>AEGIS (ADROIT Electronically Generated Information Service)</i>
<BR>
AEGIS allows the electronic transmission of Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) data between the MCA and selected pharmaceutical companies. AEGIS is a continuously evolving system involving close liaison between the MCA and participating pharmaceutical companies. AEGIS allows the supply of ADR data reports electronically, from the MCA's ADROIT system on demand, thus allowing access to up-to-date information and easy transfer of data to subscribing companies. The AEGIS system also allows messages to be sent to and from the MCA using the Mail facility. This allows the MCA to deal with individual company's specific queries. AEGIS enables ADR reports to be sent to the MCA electronically using the AEGIS e-mail system. The receipt of reports is also acknowledged electronically.
<BR>
<i>GP electronic reporting of ADRs</i>
<BR>
The MCA has worked closely with two general practitioner prescribing system suppliers (EMIS and AAH MEDITEL) to develop an electronic "Yellow Card" (the means by which ADRs are reported to the MCA by healthcare professionals). The report is accessed from within the GPs computer system and allows most of the relevant information about the patient and their treatment to be automatically populated from the patients records hence minimising time consuming GP input.
<BR>
<i>RAMA (Remote Access to Marketing Authorisations)</i>
<BR>
The RAMA service provides subscribers with on line, real time access to non-confidential information on all authorised medicinal products in the UK and additional confidential information on their own medicinal products and can track the progress of their applications. Subscribers additionally can create some parts of their applications on RAMA and send them electronically to the MCA for final quality assurance and assessment.

<i>NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency</i>--(http://www.nhspa.gov.uk)
<BR>
The NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency provides the following services on-line for NHS trusts and health authorities:
<BR>
<i>Electronic communications</i>
<BR>
The NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency website includes purchasing advice and information to NHS Trusts, provides information, promotional and technical information in support of contracting activity and a web version of the Agency's contracts catalogue.
<BR>
<i>Electronic catalogues</i>
<BR>
NHS Supplies' contracts catalogue, with 4,217 contracts and 1,428 suppliers, produced on CD ROM, continued to be developed throughout 1999 in response to NHS trusts' suggestions for improvement. A web version of the contracts catalogue has been available since September 1999. 3,000 CDs are issued monthly with 140,000 products shown.
<BR>
<i>Links to contracted suppliers</i>
<BR>
Electronic links have been created between the Agency's website and a dedicated NHS-contract website developed by suppliers in a joint initiative with NHS Supplies. This link enables NHS Trusts to access a wide variety of additional product and technical information to aid their purchase decisions.
<BR>
<i>Supplier profiles and information</i>
<BR>
The development of links to supplier websites for contracted products incorporates a parallel development on the display of company profile information, to provide trusts with standard company information required as part of the tendering process. This information is now available to all trusts from a number of the Agency's contracted suppliers and eliminates the need for suppliers to provide such data in paper format. With over 1,400 suppliers more work is required during the year to obtain critical mass.
<BR>
<i>European Union contract notices</i>
<BR>
NHS Supplies has played an active part in the development of an information technology software package to allow the electronic transmission of contract notices to the European Union in Brussels. The heads of purchasing in the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions also supported this work.
<BR>
<i>Contract management system</i>
<BR>
During 1999, a contract work plan management system was developed in-house by NHS Supplies to enable buyers to record and monitor purchasing and contracting work in progress. Relevant information from this system will be displayed on the Agency's website to give trusts information on the Agency's detailed purchasing and contracting plans for 2000-01.
<BR>

<P>
<a name="00419w12.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2000]:</i> All acute National Health Service trusts have an infection control team. Details of the amount spent by the NHS, including trusts, on infection control, are not held centrally. Expenditure on infection control is a matter for individual organisations to determine in the light of their local circumstances. Infection control is a priority for the NHS and is a "must do" in the "Modernising Health and Social Services National Priorities Guidance 2000/01--2002/03".

<P>

<P>
<a name="00419w12.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2000]:</i> Action has already been taken to update and reinforce the 1995 guidance. Infection Control standards for National Health Service acute trusts were issued in November 1999 and a circular was issued on 11 February setting out a timetabled programme of action to strengthen arrangements for the prevention and control of infection in hospitals.

<P>
<a name="00419w12.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The Department complies with the "Framework Policy and Guidelines for Government Websites" published by the Central Information Technology Unit of the Cabinet Office. This allows for advertising and sponsorship on departmental web pages but advises that in many contexts this may not be appropriate.
<P>

<a name="00419w12.html_para7">The Department, its agencies and non-departmental bodies do not carry advertising or sponsorship on their websites. Some hyperlinks to free internet products do appear when it is judged that these may enhance viewing of the sites, for example to the free Adobe Acrobat viewer, but no revenue is received by the Department or its agencies and non-departmental bodies in return for these hyperlinks.
<P>

<a name="00419w12.html_para8">Some National Health Service websites mention companies who have provided services to assist in the development of the site. Examples include the site set up to mark the 50th anniversary of the NHS and NHS Direct Online. In these instances, the "sponsorship" is in the form of provision of technical services, and relationships such as these enable the NHS to get the best possible value for its web developments. In these cases, the NHS receives the technical service free of charge and does not obtain revenue for mention of company names or display of company logos.

<a name="00419w14.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative is an international agreement and so the conditions attached to the debt relief provided under the initiative must be agreed internationally. As my answer on 5 April made clear, I am pleased that the main criterion is that the debt relief benefits the poor, with governments of HIPC countries producing poverty reduction strategies to qualify for their relief.
<P>

<a name="00419w14.html_para15">The internationally agreed conditions for debt relief do not discriminate between good and bad stewardship of aid in the past. In many cases, the indebtedness will have arisen, in part, from bad stewardship of aid and other resources. Regardless of past performance, very poor, heavily indebted countries can qualify for the initiative. The key test is whether current governments have demonstrated a commitment to sound policies and poverty reduction, which will include the effective use of aid resources. The HIPC initiative requires a track record of three years before countries start getting their debt relief.

<P>
<a name="00419w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 My hon. Friend and I meet regularly with our colleagues in the National Assembly to discuss a range of issues including the agriculture sector. The Assembly subscribes to the voluntary Beef Labelling Scheme which operates in implementation of an EC Regulation, and traceability is a key feature. The labels must indicate the location where birth, rearing and slaughter took place and, though labelling itself is voluntary, the rules of the scheme should be adhered to if labelling is done. There are discussions taking place within the EU to finalise the precise structure of a compulsory scheme which it is anticipated will start to operate in September.

<P>

<a name="00419w17.html_para0">It is hoped that other furniture retailers will acquire the majority of the stores from which Uno Plc traded, although the number of staff who will be offered continued employment by the businesses acquiring those stores is presently not known.
<P>

<a name="00419w17.html_para1">The furniture manufacturing industry has indicated that the short term effects on employment are likely to be limited, although I understand that there have already been closures of two furniture manufacturers as a direct result of the administration of Uno Plc. Concerns have been expressed about employment in the medium term in the sector, not least arising from the effect any adverse publicity will have on consumer confidence.

<P>
<a name="00419w17.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, the joint administrators of the company are obliged to report to me within six months of the administration order on the conduct of the directors of Uno Plc ("World of Leather"). In particular, schedule 1 to that Act requires the administrators, in making their report, to have regard to certain matters including the extent of the directors' responsibility for any failure by the company to supply any goods or services which have been paid for (in whole or in part). The contents of the administrators' report will be given careful consideration by my officials in the Disqualification Unit of the Insolvency Service.

<a name="00419w17.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The results of the Department's consultation on "Shareholder Remedies" are being considered in the wider context of the Company Law Review. The Steering Group of the Company Law Review published a further consultation document last month--"Developing the Framework"--which included sections on shareholders and shareholder remedies. A copy of that document was made available to the House: it can also be accessed on the Department's website.

 None. Under the terms of the UK/ Euratom/IAEA safeguards agreement and the Euratom Treaty, British Nuclear Fuels are already required to allow access by safeguards inspectors to all civil nuclear material they hold, including plutonium.

 The entry in the relevant legislation under which the export of goods is controlled is known as their rating. The Export Control Organisation's computer databases have been interrogated. Between 1 January 2000 and 5 April 2000, 15 Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs), and no Open Individual Export Licences, were issued covering the export to consignees or end-users in the specified countries of goods subject to export control by being listed in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, commonly known as the Military List. One SIEL covered the export to Angola of goods with the rating PL5033, one SIEL covered the export to Uganda of goods with the rating PL5031, and 13 SIELs covered exports to Zimbabwe; information on the SIELs covering exports for Zimbabwe is set out in the table. Licences may cover a range of goods with various ratings; where this is so, the licence is included in the table in the total for all of the relevant ratings.

This is five years after the UKAEA assumed its current form following the separation of AEA Technology. The review will be forward-looking, open to external input and take full account of the views of all stakeholders.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to his answer of 1 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 537W, what plans he has to set separate renewable energy generation targets for each of the UK standard regions; and if he will make a statement.  [119692]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00419w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Government Offices for the Regions are initiating work to prepare regional assessments and targets for renewable energy provision based upon, and where necessary updating, existing resource studies. On 9 February, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) published "Guidance on Preparing Regional Sustainable Development Frameworks". The guidance indicated that the Government hope that the frameworks will draw upon this work and elaborate a regional approach to renewable energy, including regional targets flowing from the assessments of each region's capacity to generate electricity from a range of different sources. The Government would like to see frameworks in place in all regions by the end of 2000.
<P>

<a name="00419w21.html_para1">The frameworks will work alongside Regional Planning Guidance (RPG) and Regional Development Agencies' Economic Strategies in promoting sustainable development. We are encouraging regional planning bodies to set targets in RPG for the structure plan and unitary development plan areas within the region consistent with the regional targets provided by the regional sustainable development frameworks. Advice on this will be set out in the final version of the revised "Planning Policy Guidance (PPG) Note 11: Regional Planning" to be published by DETR shortly.
<P>

<a name="00419w21.html_para2">Together with the national planning policy guidance in "PPP 22: Renewable Energy", RPG--as taken forward through structure plans and Part 1 unitary development plans--will provide a strategic framework for policies and 



<P>
<P><I>19 Apr 2000 : Column: 550W</I><P>
proposals for renewable energy development in local plans, including the identification in those plans of suitable sites. This, in turn, will feed through to decisions on individual planning applications.
<P>

<a name="00419w21.html_para3">More positive planning at regional and local levels will contribute to greater public familiarity with, and acceptance of, prospective renewable energy developments. It remains important, however, for operators to prepare the ground with local authorities, environmental organisations and local people before formal planning applications are submitted and to develop proposals in consultation with them.

 Under the Child Support Act 1991, "absent parents" are defined as parents who do not live in the same household with their children. However, many parents who do not live with their children have regular contact with them, they are not in fact absent from their children's lives. Therefore under new legislation, currently before Parliament, the term "absent parent" will be replaced by the term "non-resident parent". In practice, there is no difference between an absent and non-resident parent in the calculation of child maintenance liability.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if the CSA maintenance payment is calculated as a sum to be spent directly on the children concerned; and to what extent it includes a payment to the custodial parent for looking after the children.  [119569]

<P>
<a name="00419w22.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The basis of the current, complex maintenance calculation is the maintenance requirement, which is intended to represent the basic amount that is needed to support the child. Where the qualifying child is aged 16 or less, the maintenance requirement includes an age-related premium to reflect the fact that a child needs someone to care for them.
<P>

<a name="00419w22.html_para5">The complexity of the current formula makes it difficult for both parents to understand how maintenance has been worked out. In the new child support scheme, maintenance will be calculated according to the number of qualifying children. There will be no separate allowance for the cost of caring for the child.

 The Child Support Agency's (CSA) role is to establish maintenance liability and to calculate and collect child maintenance. It is for the parent with care to decide how best to use the money paid to support and care for her children: the CSA is not equipped to police family expenditure.

 The current child support calculation requires a wide range of information to be obtained, including details about both parents' income. The current scheme can be frustrated by parents who fail to produce the information required. Parents may also provide false information, which can result in an incorrect assessment of liability.
<P>

<a name="00419w22.html_para6">If the Child Support Agency cannot obtain information about earnings from the parent, they will contact the employer for the details. If the information is still not provided, a child support inspector can arrange to visit the employer. Currently there is no penalty for failure to provide information, but it is an offence to obstruct an inspector. For self-employed cases, the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 gives the Child Support Agency access to information about earnings held by the Inland Revenue if all other measures have failed.
<P>

<a name="00419w22.html_para7">The new child support scheme will require substantially less information. Liability will be based only on the non-resident parent's income and the number of children for whom he is responsible. However, to ensure that this

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00419w22.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Under the present scheme, non-resident parents can be assessed to pay up to 30 per cent. of their net income in current child maintenance. However, the specific percentages will vary in individual cases. Liability is assessed on the basis of a complex calculation taking account of a variety of factors, including housing costs and the circumstances of the non-resident parent's second family. Parents who owe arrears of maintenance may be required to pay up to 40 per cent. of their net income in a combination of current maintenance and arrears.
<P>

<a name="00419w22.html_para8">Under the new child support scheme, maintenance assessments will be based on a simple percentage of the non-resident parent's net income: 15 per cent. for one child, 20 per cent. for two, and 25 per cent. for three or more children. Allowance will be made for children in the non-resident parent's second family, for shared care arrangements if the non-resident parent has the child to stay for more than 52 nights a year, and for those on a low income. If the non-resident parent owes arrears, he may be asked to pay an extra 5 per cent. of his net income.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00419w22.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Liability to pay child support maintenance usually begins on the day that the non-resident parent is told about the application for a maintenance calculation. However, there can be some delay between this date and the date the maintenance calculation is completed. Voluntary payments made by the non-resident parent during this period can reduce any arrears that have built up. But voluntary payments are not defined and currently have no statutory basis, which means that the Child Support Agency uses discretion in what might be considered an acceptable payment towards child maintenance. New legislation, currently before Parliament, will give statutory recognition to such payments.

<a name="00419w22.html_para9">In the new child support scheme, the amount of child maintenance to be paid will be based on a simple percentage of the non-resident parent's net income. The basic rate will be 15 per cent. for one child, 20 per cent. for two and 25 per cent. for three or more. The amount of maintenance will be reduced if the non-resident parent shares the care of the child for 52 nights a week or more a year, has a second family or if his income is low.

<a name="00419w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 National Lottery funding for ICT training is not available to teachers in the independent sector because of the need to maintain a viable programme within the limited Lottery money available. The basis on which the New Opportunities Fund funds the training programme was set out in their Policy Directions, copies of which are available in the Libraries of both Houses. The Department is currently exploring ways in which the independent and state sector can work together in order to spread good practice in the use of ICT training.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has to amend the regulations governing the criteria under which church schools can veto school closure plans proposed by local education authorities.  [119252]

 Under Schedule 6 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, School Organisation Committees and Adjudicators are required to have regard to any guidance given by the Secretary of State when deciding whether or not to approve statutory proposals for changes to schools. The guidance on statutory proposals says that, in deciding proposals to close or reduce the capacity of denominational schools, care should be taken to consider the effect that this will have on the balance of denominational and non-denominational provision. Where the local School Organisation Committee cannot reach a unanimous decision on a proposal, it is passed to a schools Adjudicator to decide. The guidance also says that, where the relevant Church group on the School Organisation Committee has voted against the closure of a denominational school, the Adjudicator should not take a decision that will, when taken with any other related changes, reduce the proportion of such denominational places within an LEA area. We have no plans to amend this aspect of the guidance.

Teachers seeking election must have qualified teacher status; must have been employed as a teacher in the 12 months preceding the election and for an aggregate of two years in the five years preceding the election; and must also not be prohibited from teaching. The electoral scheme required candidates, their proposer, seconder and five others to be on the GTC's electoral roll and in the same constituency as the candidate.

 The Government have asked the Higher Education Funding Council for England to ensure that all higher education institutions have in place student complaint procedures which meet the requirements set out in the report of the Dearing Committee. I understand the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education will shortly launch a Code of Practice on student appeals and complaints which will make reference to university governance. The Government will consider the position in the light of the Code of Practice and discussions with representative bodies.

 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2000]:</i> The number of primary and maintained and non- maintained special schools which have been placed in special measures in each local education authority area since 1995 is contained in tables, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries. While there are some special schools which cater for pupils wholly of primary school age, or wholly of secondary school age, there are many others which cover age ranges bridging part or the whole of the primary and secondary phases. The table does not distinguish between special schools covering the wide number of possible different age ranges. The figures in the table represent those primary and maintained and non-maintained special schools which were inspected by Ofsted during that academic year and deemed to be in need of special measures. In total, of the 609 primary schools that have been in special measures, 382 have so far come out and 41 closed. Of the 122 special schools that have been in special measures, 66 have so far come out and 26 closed.

 Of the 101 Learning Partnerships now established across England, 67 directly involve higher education institutions (HEIs) as members while many others are engaging with HEIs in other ways (for example, through thematic or geographical working groups tackling specific local issues). The DfEE--alongside regional and local partners--is working to further improve links between Learning Partnerships and all those local and regional bodies with an interest in post-16 learning. I fully expect that to result in increased involvement of HEIs in the work of Learning Partnerships.

 My Department fully supports the e-government strategy and the Internet forms an integral part of our overall communications, publications and information strategy.
<P>

<a name="00419w26.html_para2">Details of the websites of the Cabinet Office, its Agencies and NDPBs, and the Central Office of Information are given in the table. The Cabinet Office has no executive NDPBs. The figures for its advisory NDPBs are included in the Department's total figures. As of 1 April 2000 the Cabinet Office only has one Executive Agency, the Government Car and Despatch Agency, so estimated expenditure for future years only covers Cabinet Office, GCDA and COI.

 As part of our modernising Government agenda we are transforming the delivery of public services to fit in with the needs of those who use them. This means not only providing services in a way that fits in with people's needs but also getting rid of the paper-chasing bureaucracy of the past. We are currently developing a pilot that will be available later this year where people can record their change of address with different parts of Government electronically in one transaction.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what discussions he has had with the horticultural industry on substituting a voluntary agreement on emission reduction for the Climate Change Levy.  [119293]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00419w27.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Budget 2000 announced the Government's intention to offer a special package of support to the horticulture sector under the climate change levy, through setting aside part of the &#163;50 million 'energy efficiency' fund to improve the energy efficiency of the sector and through the additional of thermal screens used in glasshouses to the list of technologies qualifying for the enhanced capital allowances scheme. And to further safeguard the competitiveness of the horticulture sector while these measures take effect, the Government intend to offer a temporary 50 per cent. discount to horticulture firms.
<P>

<a name="00419w27.html_para0">This package of support and the 50 per cent. discount are not conditional on the horticulture sector entering any form of emission reduction agreement with the Government. The Government have been listening carefully to the views of the horticulture industry as the design of the levy has been worked up and the Government intend to continue working with the industry to maximise the environmental benefits of this package of support by improving the energy efficiency of firms in this sector.

<a name="00419w27.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gummer: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what was the total carbon dioxide saving expected from the Government's original proposals for a climate change levy; and what is the saving expected from the present proposals.  [119287]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00419w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The original estimate of the emission saving from the climate change levy, as set out in table 5.1 of the 1999 Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report, was around 1.5 million tonnes of carbon (MtC) a year by 2010. This estimate related to the pure price effect of the levy, and did not include any savings from the negotiated agreements with the energy intensive sectors.
<P>

<a name="00419w27.html_para1">The most recent estimate of the emission saving from the levy package as a whole, as detailed in table 6.2 of the 2000 Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report, is at least 5 MtC a year by 2010. This estimate now includes the savings from the negotiated agreements with the energy intensive sectors, and the savings from the refinements to the design of the levy that were set out in the 1999 Pre-Budget Report.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is the distributional impact <i>(a)</i> of the children's tax credit and Working Families Tax Credit of &#163;32 per week for a second adult and <i>(b)</i> if the CTC were reduced so that the cost to the Exchequer was the same as a &#163;32 credit for a second adult.  [118202]

<P>
<a name="00419w28.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 As given in the reply to my hon. Friend on 9 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 817W, based on the full year cost of the Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC), the cost of including an additional &#163;32 per week within the credits for all couples already in receipt of WFTC would be about &#163;1.3 billion before taking into account additional take-up and other behavioural effects. If the overall costs to the Exchequer were to remain the same, a cost of this magnitude could absorb the funding for the children's tax credit (CTC).
<P>

<a name="00419w28.html_para0">The &#163;32 per week second adult credit would benefit all couples in receipt of the WFTC equally, whereas the CTC would benefit all families with children under 16 by up to &#163;8.50 per week.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The information comes from the "Household Below Average Income" (HBAI) data set for 1997-98, based on the Family Resources Survey, and relate to Great Britain.<P>

2. The estimates are presented on household income both Before Housing Costs and After Housing Costs, in line with HBAI conventions.<P>

3. All the estimates in the table relate to families in receipt of Family Credit, and are based on their incomes recorded in the survey, not at the time of claim. The are also based on incomes equivalised using the McClements scale. Equivalised incomes are equivalent to cash incomes for couples with no children. The results in table (b) are particularly sensitive to the choice of scale.<P>

4. All the estimates are subject to sampling error. Groups have been aggregated due to small sample numbers. In particular, this has led to decile groups being aggregated to quintile groups in table (a). Results are not reliable for cells with small sample sizes: cells with sample sizes under 50 are marked with an asterisk (<P>

*. Results for cells based on samples of 50 to 100 benefit units are bracketed. <P>

<a name="00419w28.html_para3">Given the difference in income rules in relation to maintenance and the fact that it is not possible to isolate behavioural effects (such as the number of families who may have entered work or increased their hours because Working Families Tax Credit provides a more generous work incentive than Family Credit) it is not possible to determine whether individual Working Families Tax Credit recipients in each month would have been entitled to Family Credit.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer for what reasons it is necessary for claimants of working families tax credit who are paid monthly to provide more evidence of earnings than claimants who are paid weekly.  [119739]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00419w28.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Working Families Tax Credit is based on a snapshot of a family's income immediately before the claim and is paid for a fixed period of 26 weeks. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the period over which normal earnings are considered is representative. For weekly-paid applicants, the set period is six weeks in the seven weeks immediately before the week in which the application is made. For monthly-paid people, the set period is the three months before the application. These periods should provide a representative picture in arriving at the applicant's normal earnings. Although monthly-paid staff are asked to provide evidence of pay over a three month period they need only provide three payslips whereas weekly-paid staff are required to provide six payslips.

<BR>
Targets in respect of key services to be delivered by 2002
<BR>
Complaints and correspondence. Facility already enabled. The target is for 25 per cent. being received electronically by 2002. The recent implementation of Internet e-mail in all Valuation 



<P>
<P><I>19 Apr 2000 : Column: 585W</I><P>
Offices and creation of the VOA website should ensure this target is, commensurate with the public's access to e-mail, easily met.
<BR>
Rating List availability
<BR>
The 1995 and 2000 rating lists are now available online via the Internet. There have been 2 million "hits" since January 2000
<BR>
Rating appeals
<BR>
Since April 2000 ratepayers and their advisers have been able to submit appeals electronically against the 1995 and 2000 rating lists. The target is that by 2002 40 per cent. of appeals are submitted this way. Critical to meeting this target is success in working closely with the surveying profession to ensure the numerous appeals they submit on behalf of clients are electronic.
<BR>
Forms of Return
<BR>
Prior to each quinquennial revaluation of non domestic properties up to 1.8 million notices requiring a return of information essential to the valuation process are issued.
<BR>
The next 2005 revaluation will require forms being issued in early 2003. We expect to offer an electronic lodgement service with a target of 20 per cent. of forms being received this way.
<BR>
Transfer of Rating and Council Tax Data to Valuation Tribunal Offices.
<BR>
The VOA transfers large quantities of information in respect of appeals to the VTO's on a regular basis. Previously achieved in hard copy and then magnetic tape this process became electronic in October 1999.
<BR>
Council Tax Lists and Appeals via the Internet
<BR>
Government guidelines currently preclude publishing the Council Tax lists on the Internet. Consideration is being given to how to facilitate electronic lodgement of appeals and what the target should be.
<BR>
Data transfer of lists and schedules to BA's
<BR>
VOA frequently transfers significant quantities of data to Billing Authorities in the form of complete lists and schedules for Council Tax and Rating. Current media is hard copy, floppy disk or tape (23 million properties). With effect from 1 May 2000 this data transfer is available electronically.
<BR>
Instructions
<BR>
With effect from 1 June 2000 the key instructions used by VOA staff to carry out their responsibilities will be available online to the public
<BR>

<i>CCTA</i>
<BR>
The only service CCTA provides online to the public is the availability of the open.gov.uk access point to government websites. We have no plans for additional services by 2002.
<BR>
We do provide online services to other Government organisations, <i>(a)</i> in terms of advice and guidance provided on the Virtual Foundation intranet site and <i>(b)</i> through our catalogue services and framework contracts for Government purchasers of IT goods and services. It is planned to expand these facilities by 2002.

<a name="00419w30.html_para0">Royal Mail has its own quality assurance procedures. In addition, the two mailing contractors have strict quality assurance measures in place and the Inland Revenue sends in some of its own staff to check on the assembly and packing of the Annual Packs.

 We understand there is a small problem in the order of 1 per cent. in the despatch of Employers' Annual Packs by 4 April 2000.
<P>

<a name="00419w30.html_para1">The Inland Revenue's IT partner--EDS--supplied Dataforce Group, Northampton, with name, address and reference details of some 1.2 million employers to whom an Annual Pack was to be issued. Dataforce Group personalised address carriers for each employer and enclosed 50 per cent. of these together with the other contents of Annual Packs, the other 50 per cent. being handled by Scotmail Ltd. of Glasgow. The Annual Packs were despatched by second class post. The Inland Revenue has three year contracts with both Dataforce Group and Scotmail, which have at least a further two years to run. These contracts were let in 1999 through the normal contract letting process, overseen by the Inland Revenue Contractors and Procurement Unit.

 The Government recently announced a huge new investment of up to &#163;209 million for HM Customs and Excise to tackle tobacco smuggling. Customs are appointing nearly 1,000 extra staff, a substantial number of whom will be at Dover. In addition, Dover will be included in the new national network of x-ray scanners.

 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2000]:</i> Draftsmen always seek to write as clearly as possible, subject to the overriding requirements of accuracy and certainty. Where provisions in a Finance Bill amend past Finance Acts--as is often the case--the drafting has to take account of the structure and wording of the existing legislation.
<P>

<a name="00419w30.html_para4">In the case of the Finance Bill 2000, the draftsmen have also been able to take account of the draft legislation published by the Tax Law Rewrite Project and have, where possible, taken the Project's approach into account. Part 9 of Schedule 22 (on Tonnage Tax) is an example of this.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 16 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 609W, what assumptions were made regarding entitlement to inherited SERPS in calculating the estimated balance in the National Insurance Fund at the end of 2001-02.  [118935]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00419w30.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2000]:</i> In calculating the estimated balance in the National Insurance Fund at the end of 2001-02 it was assumed that there would be a 100 per cent. entitlement to inherited SERPS if the spouse died in 2000-01 or 2001-02.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00419w30.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2000]:</i> I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave to him on 16 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 608W, detailing estimates for 2000-01 and 2001-02. As I explained then, the figures are based on the difference between forecasts of receipts and expenditure. Small changes in these forecasts could have a substantial impact on the excess. Current projections suggest that existing policy with respect to the National Insurance Fund is consistent with long-term sustainability. However, given the sensitivity of the variables involved, precise long-term forecasts of any actual excess on the Fund reserves would be misleading.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what method was used in calculating the cost of an employment tax credit given in paragraph 3.24 of the Treasury paper, "Supporting Work Through an Employment Tax Credit"; how much he estimates will be paid through the adult allowance portion of the working families tax credit in financial year 2000-01; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="00419w30.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2000]:</i> Detailed design of the parameters for an employment tax credit for people without children will be decided in due course prior to its introduction from 2003. The costing in paragraph 3.24 is based on an illustrative model which extends the adult credit in the Working Families Tax Credit to single people and couples with someone over the age of 25, working 30 or more hours, and with a higher rate for couples than for singles. It was estimated using household and income data from the Family Expenditure Survey and the Family Resources Survey.
<P>

<a name="00419w30.html_para5">It is not possible to provide a breakdown of expenditure in the Working Families Tax Credit by type of credit. The amount of award payable is reduced for families whose incomes are above the threshold, and this reduction is applied to the total value of all credits taken together.
