<P>
<P>
<a name="01117w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to make available extra moneys for river dredging flood defence works in East Sussex.  [137545]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01117w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 November 2000]:</i> Additional funding of &#163;51 million over four years has already been announced for, inter alia, an accelerated programme of river flood defence capital works in 



<P>
<P><I>17 Nov 2000 : Column: 798W</I><P>
England. The Environment Agency's staff in East Sussex are reviewing options for flood defence of communities on East Sussex rivers in the light of experience of the recent floods. They plan to meet local residents in the near future to explain those options. It is therefore too early to say what plans there are for river dredging flood defence works in East Sussex, whether it would be effective, or the extent to which such work would attract funding from this Department.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01117w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to strengthen and enhance the flood defences at York.  [138545]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01117w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I understand that the flood defences at York have operated to their design standard or better in the recent flooding. The Environment Agency will be checking the necessity for urgent repairs and reviewing the need for strengthening and enhancing the defences once the immediate work of dealing with the floods is completed. No doubt they will consider if advantage can be taken of the Government's additional funding over the next four years, a major element of which is aimed at accelerating the programme of river flood defence works.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01117w01.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment has been made of the impact of global warming and sea level rise on the risk of the Thames Barrier being unable to withstand future storm surges.  [138498]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01117w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Thames Barrier is the largest component of the complex system of gates, walls and embankments which form the tidal barrier to London and the Thames Estuary. The Barrier is a robust and flexible installation with a design based on rates of sea level rise predicted in the 1970s which were higher than those currently anticipated. It provides London with a high level of protection from tidal flooding and with normal care and maintenance should continue to do so until at least the latter half of this century. Even then, although the Barrier may need to be closed more frequently, it will continue to fulfil its primary function.
<P>

<a name="01117w01.html_para2">The Environment Agency is currently developing its tidal defence strategy for the next 100 years, with several studies already in progress.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans the Government have to regulate flows of water in the <i>(a)</i> River Severn, <i>(b)</i> River Derwent, <i>(c)</i> River Ouse, <i>(d)</i> River Aire and <i>(e)</i> River Don.  [138560]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01117w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2000]:</i> I have asked the Environment Agency, in conjunction with their partners, to produce a full report on the flooding, its effects, how flood warning and emergency response worked and what lessons we can learn. The Agency will initiate this when the immediate work of dealing with the floods has been completed; the report should be available by Easter. In the meantime there are no new plans for these rivers.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the river improvement schemes that will be funded from the new money he has announced for the Environment Agency.  [138559]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01117w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2000]:</i> The additional funding of &#163;51 million over the next four years is primarily for the Environment Agency, but some may be allocated to local authorities and Internal Drainage Boards as well. A major element of the package is designed to accelerate the programme of river flood defence works. The Ministry is approaching all the operating authorities to establish their plans with a view to determining the content of the enhanced national river works programme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01117w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 One of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission's statutory duties is to provide advice to the Secretary of State on the scope for defining, in Westminster legislation, rights supplementary to those in the European Convention on Human Rights. The Commission is currently undertaking an extensive consultation exercise and will submit a preliminary report to the Secretary of State next March.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01117w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I have agreed that a review should be undertaken. The Compensation Agency was previously reviewed in 1995. Accordingly it should, like other agencies, now be subject to a quinquennial review. The review will commence immediately and should be completed by 30 May 2001.
<P>

<a name="01117w01.html_para3">The review will be directed by a Steering Group under the Chairmanship of the Director of Resources in my Department.

 I have agreed that a review should be undertaken. Forensic Science Northern Ireland completed five years of operation as an executive agency on 31 August 2000.

 We acknowledge that the Chambre Hardman collection is of national importance and support the wish to ensure its conservation and presentation to the public. My Department has had discussions with a number of interested parties, including the National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside, the National Museum of Film, Photography and Television, and the North West Museum Service, to ensure the preservation of the collection and the house.
<P>

<a name="01117w02.html_para0">There are a number of potential solutions for the long-term care and public presentation of both the collection, and Chambre Hardman's house in Liverpool. It is now for the Trustees of the Chambre Hardman Trust to assess all of the available options; to determine which of these is the most realistically able to meet its objectives; and to develop a viable business case for the preferred solution.

<P>

<a name="01117w03.html_para1">

<BR>
The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to respond to your Parliamentary Question asking what conclusions the Benefits Agency (BA) internal audit came to regarding the role of EDS in the duplication of income support payments on 17th and 18th January.
<BR>
The report concluded that responsibility for the error lay with DSS Information Technology Services Group (ITSG), Benefits Agency (BA) and EDS. The report did not apportion levels of responsibility; it identified errors on the part of all parties. The report concluded:
<BR>
'Following a technical problem, incorrect (re-start) action by ITSG led to the creation of the &#163;10.5m Income Support file with an incomplete number of records. The EDS automated system to transfer files to BACS had limited in-built validation and reconciliation checks and this allowed the &#163;10.5m file to be forwarded to BACS . . . Reconciliation checks undertaken within the BA identified a problem but the incident handling and escalation procedures were inadequate'.
<BR>
As mentioned in my response on 30 October, Official Report columns 346-347, the report contained a series of thirteen recommendations. EDS is a key stakeholder, working with DSS in the programme of activity to implement these recommendations, which include improvements to validation and reconciliation checks to prevent a reoccurrence of the original incident. My previous response provided more detail.
<BR>
I hope this additional information is helpful.

 A number of research studies have been conducted in this area. The range of methods which can be used to explore questions of absolute and relative adequacy of benefits include budget standards methodology, deprivations studies, expenditure studies and consensual studies. All these research methods are considered when assessing benefit levels; however, no single method can be used to calculate an "adequate" income. What people need to live on varies greatly depending on their needs, age, proximity to friends and relatives--it is not possible to produce figures showing what is adequate for all pensioner families.

 The contract for NIRS2 was signed in 1995 and there have been problems with the system from the start, the full effects of which we are still trying to resolve.
<P>

<a name="01117w03.html_para3">We are sorry to report that the Benefits Agency (BA) will not complete its review of benefit claims affected by the delayed implementation of NIRS2 by the end of this year as had been expected. Although good progress has been made with outstanding cases in BA offices, full completion of the necessary benefits reviews is dependent on the clearance of work arrears in the Inland Revenue's National Insurance Contributions Office (NICO) that result in a change to the contribution record.
<P>

<a name="01117w03.html_para4">NICO is urgently looking at when it expects to have completed its own recovery from the late implementation of NIRS2. BA recovery cannot be achieved until after the NICO recovery has been achieved and this will not be by the end of this year.
<P>

<a name="01117w03.html_para5">As contribution records are brought up to date, BA offices will be prompted by NIRS2 to review an old or existing benefit claim if the change to the record has affected the previous benefit rate. Many of these prompted reviews however will not require the rate in payment to be revised because the contingency arrangements deployed by the Benefits Agency will have ensured the new NIRS2 rate is already in payment.
<P>

<a name="01117w03.html_para6">I would like to take this opportunity to express my regret and apologise to those pensioners and other benefit claimants who have been adversely affected by these delays.

Where this is not possible, however, payment of compensation is available either within the normal rules of the Department's Special Payments Scheme or by way of the special &#163;10 scheme we announced on 1 February 1999.

 Post office closures remain below past peak levels. In 1991-92, 478 offices closed and in 1984-85 395 closed. The number of rural office closures in the first half of the current financial year is running at a lower level than in the same period last year. I have asked the Post Office for an analysis of the factors underlying Post Office closures. This analysis is to include age of person moving out of the business, property sold, location and reason. In addition, we are implementing in full the recommendations of the Performance and Innovation Unit report to modernise the post office network and strengthen its future viability.

<P>
<a name="01117w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The reliability of DNA evidence is assured through the internal quality assurance measures adopted by the Forensic Science Service (FSS) and through external accreditation by the British Standards Institute (BSI) and United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) to the BS EN ISO 9000 and M10 National Standards. This independent accreditation of the DNA process involves regular audit to ensure the standards are maintained.

<a name="01117w05.html_para5">The more advanced SGMplus technique was introduced by the FSS in September 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01117w06.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 2 November 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 611W, if he will <i>(a)</i> list the categories of offence for which the 1,756 people were sentenced and <i>(b)</i> the action taken following the breaches of the conditions of their release.  [137993]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01117w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 An analysis of the index offences of the 1,756 prisoners who were placed on the home detention curfew scheme and who breached the conditions of their licence is contained in the table.
<P>

<a name="01117w06.html_para0">Where a breach is notified to the Prison Service, consideration is given to the most appropriate course of action, in the light of the available legal powers and the circumstances of the individual case. Where an offender breaches his licence conditions, the presumption is that the Prison Service will always revoke the licence unless there are legal considerations which prevent this or make it impracticable, or other exceptional circumstances. Of the 1,756 cases referred to, 1,294 had their licences revoked by the Secretary of State pursuant to 



<P>
<P><I>17 Nov 2000 : Column: 815W</I><P>
section 38A(1) or section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. In a further 46 cases, the breach was reported to the police or probation service to consider initiating breach action through the courts under section 38(1) of the Act. In addition, those prisoners who were convicted of committing a further offence during the currency of their licence, and therefore were in breach of their licence conditions, would have been liable, under section 40 of the Act, to an additional sentence of imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="01117w06.html_para1">In 416 cases legal considerations prevented revocation action. The majority of these were cases where the breach of licence was notified to the Prison Service only after the licence had expired; as my answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Hope) of 22 May 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 360W, indicated, a significant proportion of cases involving further charges brought against curfewees have not been notified to the Prison Service by the police. Action is currently being taken to improve reporting arrangements.

 The most recent project commissioned by the Department is a systematic review to determine the clinical effectiveness of treatments and interventions for chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis. The review was commissioned for a working group which is looking at the efficacy of available treatments and interventions for chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). The results of this review will inform the final report produced by the CFS/ME Working Group. In addition the National Health Service Health Technology Assessment Programme has recently commissioned a study on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy in chronic fatigue syndrome.

The strategy focuses on the areas of access, quality and oral health and is supported by &#163;100 million new funding. Responsibility for dentistry is devolved to health authorities, which will be performance managed on service provision in their area.

 In the period between entry to medical school and full registration, it is estimated that training a doctor costs between &#163;200,000 and &#163;250,000. Doctors generally continue training after full registration. As the duration and nature of post-registration training varies greatly and as service and training costs are closely related it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the total cost of training.
<P>

<a name="01117w09.html_para0">The latest year for which figures are available show that in 1999-2000 the national average estimated cost of training a nurse was &#163;11,000 per annum; an occupational therapist &#163;7,000 per annum; a physiotherapist &#163;7,200 per annum and a speech and language therapist &#163;7,000 per annum. These costs are inclusive of tuition, bursary and salary support costs. Most courses are of three years duration.

 We have published the Government Response today, as Cm 4928, and copies are available in the Library. We welcome the thorough inquiry into all the research and related issues that the Committee has conducted. We accept many of the recommendations in the report.
<P>

<a name="01117w09.html_para2">When the Committee published its report, we decided that an essential first step in improving cancer research and, through this, cancer care in this country, was to create a NHS Cancer Research Network. By 2003, we will be investing an additional &#163;20 million each year on this new initiative.
<P>

<a name="01117w09.html_para3">The NHS Cancer Research Network will have a direct impact on the quality of cancer care by integrating research and cancer care; improving the quality, speed and co-ordination of cancer research; and increasing the number of NHS organisations, health care professionals, and patients participating in cancer research studies. The initial target for the NCRN will be to double the number of cancer patients entering trials within three years. The first step in establishing the NHS Cancer Research Network is to commission a Co-ordinating Centre and an appointment has now been made, following an open competition.
<P>

<a name="01117w09.html_para4">The Co-ordinating Centre will be a joint enterprise. Two groups will work together to achieve the overall aims of the NHS Cancer Research Network. A consortium involving the universities of Leeds and York and the MRC Clinical Trials Unit, led by Professor Peter Selby will concentrate on operating a network for controlled trials, especially of new approaches that have shown promise in diagnosing, treating and caring for patients with cancer. Professor David Kerr will lead the NHS's contribution to early studies translating advances in basic science into promising new treatments for cancer through a network of centres.
<P>

<a name="01117w09.html_para5">In relation to further action, we agree with the Committee that a new 'bricks and mortar' institute for cancer research is not the best way forward in this country.

 Competitive sports in schools play an important role in providing extra-curricular physical activity for schoolchildren. They are a compulsory part of the National Curriculum for Physical Education for pupils aged between 5 and 14 and are one of the options for pupils aged 14 to 16. HMCI's Annual Report looked at a sample of 115 primary schools and 53 secondary schools, and without exception, all secondary schools provided opportunities to participate in extra-curricular sports, and three quarters of primary schools provided similar opportunities for the older range of pupils. As part of the Government's Sports Strategy, the first phase of School Sports Co-ordinators has just been established. They will work with families of primary and secondary schools in areas of greatest need to provide children with even more opportunities to compete and participate in a wide range of school sports, and will also promote school team competitions.

 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2000]:</i> The need for greater clarity and consistency in the use of higher education qualification titles is recognised by both higher education institutions and employers. The Quality Assurance Agency has published its proposals for a qualifications framework for higher education together with a position paper on the nomenclature of qualifications. A further revised consultation paper was issued on 14 November. My officials have received a small number of comments on the framework and these have been addressed in the revised consultation paper. A separate framework for Scotland is being introduced and questions on this should be addressed to the Scottish Parliament.

 Phase 1 of the Computers within Reach scheme has just been announced. The first phase of the scheme is intended to provide 35,000 recycled computers and printers, and will attract funding of &#163;5,250,000 to the contractors operating the pilots.
<P>

<a name="01117w11.html_para4">In addition, the individuals who receive each PC (except a small minority in a linked scheme, Wired Up Communities) will be asked for a &#163;60 contribution towards the cost. For those individuals who have special needs that require further adaption of the computer or software we have a further budget available. The Department has also bulk purchased software from a software company to run on the recycled computers. There will be further costs in relation to the operation and evaluation of the scheme. These costs have not been fully finalised at present.

<P>
<a name="01117w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 I can today announce that we have commissioned a study to look at the future development and financing of the National Grid for Learning (NGfL). It will include an analysis of the full range of options for future progress and will produce recommendations about the best way forward.
<P>

<a name="01117w11.html_para5">New technology in schools is changing all the time. When we started the national drive to get all our schools connected to the internet three years ago, very little had been done to prepare our schools, teachers or pupils for new technology.




<P>
<P><I>17 Nov 2000 : Column: 835W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01117w11.html_para6">In the last three years we have achieved a tremendous amount. Today, 98 per cent. of secondary schools and 86 per cent. of primary schools are online. That is a total of 20,200 schools connected to the internet compared with around 6,500 in 1998. The Prime Minister recently announced a further &#163;1 billion investment to step up the drive to use new technology to raise standards in schools.




<P>
<P><I>17 Nov 2000 : Column: 836W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01117w11.html_para7">However, we must renew and re-invigorate the National Grid so that it moves with the times. It is critical that it provides accessible, high-quality, interactive content and that schools have the fast internet access that will enable them to make the best use of it. The study we have commissioned will look at the best options for securing these outcomes and the best ways of financing them, including making the best use of the private sector.
