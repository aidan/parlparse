<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Austin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry which British companies involved in the Ilisu Dam project are involved in the trial concerning bribery and corruption in Lesotho; and if he will make a statement.  [127079]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 June 2000]:</i> As has already been reported in the press, Balfour Beatty, one of the companies involved in a bribery trial in Lesotho, is bidding for work on the proposed Ilisu Dam project in Turkey.
<P>

<a name="00621w01.html_para0">It would be inappropriate to comment on specific allegations against British firms, which are a matter for the appropriate courts.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Austin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what formal procedures are in place in the event of companies in receipt of ECGD support <i>(a)</i> being charged with corruption and <i>(b)</i> having allegations of corruption made against them.  [127082]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 June 2000]:</i> ECGD's audit services would normally investigate any case, in either category, where there are grounds for believing that the Exchequer's interest might be prejudiced as a result of alleged corrupt practices.
<P>

<a name="00621w01.html_para1">ECGD will shortly be introducing new procedures to the OECD Bribery Convention aimed at further deterring corrupt practices.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Austin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what action he has taken concerning recent allegations of bribery and corruption on the part of British companies in Lesotho.  [127080]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 June 2000]:</i> The Government share international concern at all allegations of corruption. It would, however, be inappropriate to comment on specific allegations against UK firms which are a matter, in this instance, for the Lesotho courts. The Government will, if asked, co-operate fully in any way that it can.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Austin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list the directors of UK companies banned from World bank contracts who are directors of companies in receipt of ECGD support; and if he will list the relevant companies.  [127085]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 June 2000]:</i> The World bank last updated their list of ineligible firms on 29 February 2000. ECGD has no record of having provided support to any of the firms on that list.

<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Austin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what staff he has in post to check for corruption relating to ECGD- backed projects.  [127083]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 June 2000]:</i> ECGD policy makes it clear that all staff have a part to play in minimising the risks of corruption and malpractice by remaining alert to such possibilities and by developing and maintaining effective controls to reduce these risks. Additionally there is an Internal Audit Department of seven who have responsibility for investigating any suspected cases of corruption relating to ECGD backed projects.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Austin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if guidelines to prevent corruption will be included in the forthcoming recommendations for the ECGD's Mission and Status.  [127084]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 June 2000]:</i> The review of ECGD's Mission and Status is ongoing and I cannot comment on the outcome of the review until it is complete. It is looking at what ECGD's future role should be and, as I stressed when I announced the review last July, will consider carefully how ECGD can better help the Government to meet their wider objectives. I expect Ministers to determine necessary changes to ECGD's Mission in the next month or so. A report of the review will be published.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what payments were made to post offices in each of the last five years for undertaking Benefits Agency business in <i>(a)</i> Scotland, <i>(b)</i> Dumfries and Galloway and <i>(c)</i> Galloway and Upper Nithsdale parliamentary constituency.  [124713]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 I understand from the Post Office that details of payments made to post offices in respect of business undertaken for the Benefits Agency are contractual matters and as such commercially confidential.

<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Prior: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the recent performance of British Trade International; and what are its <i>(a)</i> performance criteria and <i>(b)</i> annual budget.  [126751]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 British Trade International's services for trade development and promotion are now delivered under the single brand name of Trade Partners UK. As I announced last month, British Trade International is also the umbrella body for the Invest in Britain Bureau which will work alongside Trade Partners UK.
<P>

<a name="00621w01.html_para2">Trade Partners UK was launched nationally on 31 May 2000, and replaces the various promotional brands that have been used in the past. The services available to firms will be easier to access and more effective. A new electronic gateway provides internet access to all basic information on international markets and business sectors, and an electronic inquiry service. Trade Partners UK will continue to work in partnership with other Government Departments, devolved administrations and regional bodies.

<P>

<a name="00621w01.html_para3">Trade Partners UK's aim is to enhance the competitiveness of Britain's companies through overseas sales and investments. Trade development and promotion objectives have been published in both the Foreign Office's Departmental Report and the Department of Trade and Industry's Government Expenditure Plans.
<P>

<a name="00621w01.html_para4">In the period 1999-2000, these objectives were achieved with, for example, a customer satisfaction rate of 89 per cent. and more businesses (especially SMEs) being encouraged to take an active and professional approach to exporting as a result of assistance provided.
<P>

<a name="00621w01.html_para5">Detailed performance criteria for Trade Partners UK's future activities are in development. These will be in place by April 2001.
<P>

<a name="00621w01.html_para6">British Trade International's annual budget for its Trade Partners UK activities consists of three elements. In round figures these are:

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what will be the cost of establishing Trade Partners UK.  [126753]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 It cost &#163;250,000 to develop the Trade Partners UK brand. Further costs of promoting and developing customer awareness of the new brand and the services we offer are being met by redirecting marketing effort that would in any case have been spent on promoting our services.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what level of launch aid has been provided by his Department for the Airbus A3XX; to how many sets of components the launch aid applies; and how many jobs he estimates will be created as a result of the launch aid.  [127158]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced on 13 March 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 9W, that the Government would provide &#163;530 million of launch investment to BAE Systems to help them develop the wings for the A3XX. We estimate this project will create 22,000 new jobs (8,000 in BAE Systems and supply companies, and 14,000 new induced employment) and safeguard a further 62,000 jobs (20,000 on current Airbus programmes and 42,000 in induced employment).

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Government are committed to carrying out full public consultation before exercising the power in section 23, which allows the Secretary of State to confer existing employment rights on categories of individuals who currently fall outside their coverage. The issue of rights for ministers of religion is one of those on which we intend to seek views in the consultation document.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="00621w01.html_para11">Commercial staff overseas are employed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as part of the unified FCO/DTI British Trade International operation. Staff in British Trade International's UK operation are primarily employed by the Department of Trade and Industry. We have no representation in Tajikistan or Kyrgystan. Details of commercial staffing in the other countries are <i>(a)</i> Kazakhstan--the equivalent of 2.68 staff (including a DTI officer on loan), <i>(b)</i> Uzbekistan--the equivalent of 2.65 staff and <i>(c)</i> Turkmenistan--the equivalent of 1.95 staff. The staff involved in commercial work vary in grades. These totals are a reflection of the total time spent by both UK based and locally engaged staff over a year. They reflect the combined efforts of several staff at each post on commercial work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2000]:</i> It is estimated that about <i>(a)</i> 70 per cent. of organic foods, <i>(b)</i> 35 per cent. of mineral water, and <i>(d)</i> 15 per cent. of yoghurt consumed in the UK are imported. Statistics on imports of parsnips are not separately available.

<P>
<P><I>21 Jun 2000 : Column: 187W</I><P>
European Commission's decision to suspend the payment of refunds payable on the export of non-Annex 1 products.  [124769]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 June 2000]:</i> From 8 May this year the European Commission temporarily suspended the issue of further refund certificates, required for refund payments on the export of non-Annex 1 products. Special provision has been made for small traders to ensure that they are unaffected by the suspension. This suspension reflects the Commission's concern about the value of claims made so far in the current year compared to budgetary limits.
<P>

<a name="00621w02.html_para0">For the British confectionery manufacturing industry this could result in a shortfall in the current budget year of some &#163;4.7 million from the previous year's export refund receipt of &#163;18.5 million, if certificates remain suspended until the end of the budget year in October. The UK confectionery industry exports products worth some &#163;300 million per year to non-EU destinations, and it is these exports that will be affected by suspension.
<P>

<a name="00621w02.html_para1">Discussions with the Commission are continuing at official and at ministerial level to secure a solution that will minimise the impact for all exporting industries affected by the suspension.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what steps he is taking to promote the consumption of fresh milk in schools.  [125790]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Government have already taken action via the Intervention Board to draw the attention of schools and local education authorities to the existence of the EU School Milk Subsidy Scheme and to simplify its operations. The Intervention Board has also recently issued a questionnaire to all claimant organisations in England and Wales seeking further suggestions for improvements to the administration of the scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 In response to calls from representatives of dairy farmers the Government widened the remit of the Milk Development Council (MDC) to allow it to engage in the generic promotion of milk. The MDC's first marketing campaign for fresh milk, funded jointly by producers and processors, commenced on 19 June.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w02.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The monthly, wholesale, butterfat-adjusted, milk production figures calculated by the Intervention Board are based on monthly returns submitted to the Intervention Board by all approved milk purchasers, as required by regulation 28(2) of the Dairy Produce Quotas Regulations 1997, as amended.




<P>
<P><I>21 Jun 2000 : Column: 188W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00621w02.html_para2">The Intervention Board has received a number of representations over time about the accuracy of the milk production figures and, in response to such inquiries, has explained that the figures are subject to amendment and should not be regarded as definitive. It is made clear in the accompanying notes that the figures are issued only as a guide to trends in milk production and for comparison against a calculated milk quota profile. Those using the figures, particularly in reaching commercial decisions relating to milk quota or milk production, are advised to take account of the limitations, which are set out in some detail.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what steps he is taking to persuade his European Union partners to give a high priority during negotiations to revise WTO rules ensuring that the EU can maintain and improve its standards of farm animal welfare; and if he will make a statement.  [126514]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w02.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The conclusions of the EU Agriculture Council on 27 September 1999 and the General Affairs Council on 25 October 1999 committed the EU to taking forward the issue of farm animal welfare in the WTO negotiations. The UK has been a strong support of this commitment, which was reinforced by the Prime Minister in his Action Plan for Farming, published on 30 March 2000, and we will be seeking to take it forward in the negotiations on agriculture which have now started.

 The Fisheries Council met in Luxembourg on 16 June. I led the UK delegation, accompanied by John Home Robertson, Deputy Minister for Rural Affairs in the Scottish Executive.
<P>

<a name="00621w02.html_para4">The Commission presented its mid-term review of the Multi Annual Guidance Programme (MAGP) IV, which will now go for further study. I made clear that I could not accept the cuts in the UK fleet suggested by the Commission. In particular, effort control must be retained.

 Governments are elected on the basis of their Manifestos, which will always contain a number of commitments requiring legislation. It is right that Manifesto commitments should have priority. Other legislative needs are identified by Government and examined on a case-by-case basis. Although parliamentary time is limited, there have always been occasions when the Government has found time for matters on which it is itself neutral.

<a name="00621w03.html_para3">The use of bus lanes by those vehicles, which are limited by Regulation to a maximum speed of 12.8 kph, would impede the flow of buses. That would clearly undermine the purpose of bus lanes which is to afford buses greater priority over other vehicles.

 The Secretary of State has not received any representations about the timekeeping of West Coast Main Line trains between Liverpool and Euston. All trains on the West Coast Main Line have been subject to some delays due to the West Coast Main Line upgrade, but consequential amendments have been to the timetable and timekeeping has remained constant. The Franchising Director's publication 'On Track' (copies of which are available in the House Libraries) shows that 80.6 per cent. of West Coast Main Line trains arrived at their destination within 10 minutes of the advertised time in the year to 31 March 2000.

<P>
<a name="00621w03.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Secretary of State has received no representations relating specifically to delays in boarding trains to Liverpool at Euston station. Development work in connection with the West Coast Main Line upgrade has resulted in a number of platforms at Euston being closed between May and September of this year. The consequential shortage of platforms has meant that upon arrival trains unload passengers and are then cleaned and stored out of the immediate station area, returning to the departure platform shortly before departure time. This has resulted in reduced intervals between trains being available for loading and departure times but this is common to all services from Euston.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w03.html_spnew18"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The present franchise for the West Coast Main Line is not due to be replaced until 9 March 2012. The franchise, in common with all the other passenger rail franchises, does not contain any provisions stipulating what on-board services must be provided. It is not envisaged that there will be any such provisions in any of the replacement franchises.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Employers in the water supply and sewage treatment industry have general duties placed upon them by the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 to ensure that, so far as is reasonably practicable, visitors are not exposed to risks to their health and safety.
<P>

<a name="00621w04.html_para0">The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations require employers to carry out a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks arising from their undertaking to the health and safety of persons not in their employment. This includes members of the public.
<P>

<a name="00621w04.html_para1">Risks to health, including biological risks, are also covered by the more specific requirements of the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1999. They require the employer to carry out a risk assessment and where necessary to implement suitable measures to reduce the risk. This duty would extend to groups visiting the site.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of whether washing screens in the screen houses of sewage works with untreated effluent produces a local atmosphere containing biological agents of a hazardous nature.  [126269]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 HSE has undertaken at least one local intervention to monitor levels of aerosols in a screen house and at visits to water treatment companies over the years has looked into the biological risks arising from the process and the way they are controlled.
<P>

<a name="00621w04.html_para3">There are potentially hazardous micro-organisms in all sewage and a range of reasonably practicable precautions should be taken to control the risk.
<P>

<a name="00621w04.html_para4">HSE made a number of recommendations including improved washing facilities, disposable overalls, respiratory protective equipment and improved ventilation. Although they had initially recommended the use of clean mains water or its equivalent for screen washing, they accepted that this was not reasonably practicable given the very large volumes used and the fact that a new secondary treatment works is being built and that biologically treated effluent will be available for screen washing from September 2000, with the plant being fully commissioned by the end of 2000.
<P>

<a name="00621w04.html_para5">At a national level HSE works with the water industry's national trade body, Water UK, to help identify and resolve health and safety problems in the industry. Work has been carried out at national level on the microbiological risks from sewage, including those encountered at sewage treatment works. HSE produced guidance for employers and workers in 1995.
<P>

<a name="00621w04.html_para6">Screens are usually washed with water which has been through the treatment process ("final effluent") which, while not of drinking-water quality, has fairly low levels of micro-organisms. However, where the treatment facilities are limited, as at Seafield, the water used will have higher levels of micro-organisms. The main risk is from ingestion/swallowing and from splashes on the skin and in the eyes. Aerosols containing micro-organisms are likely to be produced in screen houses from the general flow of sewage and also from the washing down of the screens. These aerosols can pose a risk to health from inhalation, depending on droplet size and the type and amount of micro-organisms present.

 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2000]:</i> The Department's website that contains the results of all the Department's air quality measuring programmes is widely publicised in a variety of media. The number of hits on the pages containing the dioxin measurements were 2,445 in the period 1 June 1999 to 31 May 2000, representing approximately 1,150 users. The website address is http://www.environment.detr.gov.uk/airq/aqinfo.htm, then click on National Air Quality Information Archive and then Monitoring Networks. The dioxin data are collected in the Toxic Organic Micropollutants section.

 The latest information my Department has on such schemes, based on local authority returns made in July 1999, indicated that 81 authorities, as listed, had schemes, and had registered approximately 10,000 houses in multiple occupation in the private rented sector. A number of these schemes, notably in London boroughs, are ward-based, although the majority are authority-wide:

<P>
<a name="00621w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The existing regulations are intended to provide owners with safeguards against a local authority prematurely assuming a vehicle is abandoned and having it towed away for scrap. They also ensure that local authorities do not have to go to the unnecessary expense of removing and storing vehicles that may not, in the event, have been abandoned.

[126851]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w05.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 My Department's document, "Policy Appraisal and the Environment: Policy Guidance", has been made widely available to other Departments since it was published in 1998. It is also now included on the Cabinet Office's website as part of the "Policy Makers Checklist" and all Departments will be adding that checklist to their own intranet sites. A number, including mine, already have. Electronic availability of this guidance is more efficient than the distribution of large numbers of paper copies.
<P>

<a name="00621w05.html_para3">The guide "Sustainable Development: What it is and What You Can Do" is one of four guidance notes issued by the Green Ministers Committee.

 The first regional sustainable development framework was launched in the West Midlands in February and the second is due to be launched in the North-West in July; both are promising documents. We expect all the regions to have completed their frameworks by the end of 2000. Frameworks are not Government documents nor are they statutory and they will set their own targets. For frameworks to have a real impact it is vital that their production, including setting priorities and establishing systems for monitoring progress, involves all stakeholders and has support across the region. That is why we have said they should be agreed by the regional chambers. Once published we expect regional decision-makers to "buy in" to the visions set out in frameworks and to act in ways that are consistent with them.

 <i>[holding answer 20 June 2000]:</i> The Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) has carried out two Government-funded studies on cancer incidence around the older generation of more polluting incinerators ("Elliott P et al (1996). Cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain. British Journal of Cancer, volume 73, pp 702-710", and "Elliott P et al (2000). Cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain. Part 2: Histopathological and Case-Notes Review of Primary Liver Cancer Cases. British Journal of Cancer, volume 82, pp 1103-6.") These found a small excess of primary liver cancer in people living near to incinerators between 1974 and 1987. The Government have sought advice on these studies from the Committee on the Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COC).
<P>

<a name="00621w06.html_para0">The COC has advised that it is not possible to conclude that this small increase in primary liver cancer is due to emissions of pollutants from incinerators, as it is not possible to rule out completely that it may be related to socio-economic factors. It has also advised that any potential risk of cancer due to living near municipal incinerators (for periods in excess of 10 years) was exceedingly low and probably not measurable by the most modern epidemiological techniques. The COC has recommended that, at the present time, there is no need for any further epidemiological investigations of this subject.

 The location of facilities is a matter for local authorities. Suitable sites for new incineration plant will be determined by local planning authorities, in line with the decisions of regional planning bodies. Planning policy guidance on waste management in England is set out in "Planning Policy Guidance Note 10: Planning and waste management".

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 14 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 635W, for what reasons the section of the Jubilee line between Charing Cross and Green Park was not retained as a separate branch.  [126999]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 LUL consider that while it is sensible to retain the Green Park--Charing Cross spur for occasional special purposes (e.g. reversing empty trains), it would not be feasible to use it for passenger services. Up to 24 trains per hour serve the Jubilee Line. Dividing these to serve both the extension to Stratford and the spur to Charing Cross would result in an unacceptably sparse service for both routes, significantly reducing the attractiveness of operations on the extended line while providing only a limited service to Charing Cross. In addition, running services in this way would be more complex operationally and could have an adverse impact on reliability.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment when the special educational needs and disability in education Bill will be introduced in Parliament.  [127380]<P>

<P>
<a name="00621w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 We are totally committed to taking forward the education recommendations of the Disability Rights Task Force (DRTF) and will legislate when parliamentary time allows, alongside our proposals to change the special educational needs framework. Our commitment to legislate on SEN was made in the Queen' Speech and remains in place. However, it has now become clear that it will not be possible to introduce a Bill this parliamentary Session.
<P>

<a name="00621w09.html_para0">The DRTF recommendations--crucial to our plans--were not available until December and required full consultation. Our consultation exercise on how to take forward the education recommendations of the report has revealed strong support for the broad thrust of our proposals, but there are some detailed issues which have required further consultation.
<P>

<a name="00621w09.html_para1">In view of the inevitable delay, and without the option of carryover, we have decided to publish a draft Bill in this parliamentary Session, giving the opportunity for comment and feedback before introduction of the Bill.

 The Pension Schemes Registry indicates that since April 1997, the first date at which reliable information is available, a total of about 22,500 occupational pension schemes have been recorded as having wound up.

Guidance was issued to this effect to all local authorities on 29 April 1996. We have no evidence to suggest there is a need to issue further guidance at this time.

 I assume the hon. Member is referring to the new Individual Learning Account framework being introduced shortly by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and in Scotland by the Scottish Ministers. Clause 57 of the Finance Bill provides that employees will not be taxable on any financial contribution which their employers may make towards the cost of an eligible learning course for which a Government grant may be payable. The range of training which can qualify will be a matter for the Department for Education and Employment and devolved administrations, but I can confirm that it will be a very wide range.

 As the Chancellor made clear in his 1999 Budget statement, the savings from the removal of Vocational Training Relief (VTR), as set out in Table A2.1 of the FSBR 2000--will help pay for the Government grants and discounts that can be claimed under the coming Individual Learning Account scheme. The Government are making available &#163;150 million in grants and discounts up to April 2002. In addition we are introducing in the Finance Bill a tax exemption for employees on employer contributions towards these learning accounts; the estimated Exchequer cost of this exemption is &#163;10 million in a full year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons will publish his report into his follow-up inspection of Her Majesty's Prison Wormwood Scrubs of 7 to 17 February.  [127381]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00621w10.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons' report of his unannounced inspection is being published today. Copies have been made available in the Library and the Vote Office.
<P>

<a name="00621w10.html_para3">I made a statement to the House on 28 June 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 21-33, on the report of an unannounced full inspection of Wormwood Scrubs prison that had taken place in March 1999. That report made deeply disturbing reading. Sir David's inspection had taken place against the background of criminal investigations into allegations that a number of members of staff at Wormwood Scrubs had assaulted prisoners. Sir David and his team of inspectors had found the overall treatment of prisoners was profoundly unsatisfactory.
<P>

<a name="00621w10.html_para4">In my statement last year, I said that I had made it absolutely clear to the Director General of the Prison Service that change must be delivered at Wormwood Scrubs. I expected a robust action plan to be put in place quickly, and I expected the majority of Sir David's recommendations to be accepted and implemented. I reported that I had asked Sir David Ramsbotham to carry out a further inspection in six months' time and that I would report the result to the House.
<P>

<a name="00621w10.html_para5">The Chief Inspector returned to Wormwood Scrubs between 7 and 17 February this year, and his report of that inspection is published today. He found Wormwood Scrubs much improved from his previous visit. Change had taken place, and life for prisoners had improved. Prisoners felt safer, and their relationships with staff were better. Health care was radically improved, education had been expanded and, together with employment, could attract most prisoners into purposeful activity.
<P>

<a name="00621w10.html_para6">The extent of the changes required, including substantial cultural change, inevitably takes time. Nevertheless, the chief inspector found that a promising start had been made and real improvements had already been delivered. The report makes 99 recommendations for further improvement, but encouragingly identifies 12 examples of good practice.
<P>

<a name="00621w10.html_para7">I should like to pay tribute to all those who have contributed to this change. Senior managers at Prison Service headquarters have given the establishment both leadership and support. The Governor and his management 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jun 2000 : Column: 217W</I><P>
team have tackled the problems at Wormwood Scrubs with determination and commitment, and their legitimate authority has been restored. It also gives me great pleasure to commend the staff of Wormwood Scrubs for what has been achieved. This time last year, there were serious concerns as to whether or not the Prison Officers' Association would co-operate fully with what needed to be done. Sir David notes the determination of the vast majority of staff in the prison to see Wormwood Scrubs restored to a place of excellence, known for the high quality of the treatment of and conditions for its prisoners.
<P>

<a name="00621w10.html_para8">Staff at Wormwood Scrubs still face a difficult time. A number of staff are still suspended from duty in connection with the investigations into the allegations of assault. I understand that the first criminal trials are likely to start in the next few weeks, and this will bring further unwelcome attention on everyone connected with the establishment. Nevertheless, today's report shows how much has already been achieved in the face of these sorts of difficulties, and with Sir David Ramsbotham I am optimistic that the programme of improvement will be continued and completed at Wormwood Scrubs. I am still keeping the option of market-testing open, but believe that this report shows the kind of rapid progress I had hoped for.

 During the Second World War local authorities were responsible for maintaining records of the locations of unexploded ordnance. Although some local authorities destroyed the details they held, some information is still available through the Public Record Office.
<P>

<a name="00621w11.html_para2">In 1997 the Home Office collated details of information from a variety of sources including emergency services, local authorities and the military. It had been intended to publish the information, but this was not pursued when it became evident that there were unexplained contradictions in the data and it could not be relied upon as either accurate or comprehensive. Because of this it would not be sensible to establish a national register as proposed.
<P>

<a name="00621w11.html_para3">We do, however, search the information if asked by individuals, local authorities or building contractors.

 The Government have already introduced legislation to extend the time available to the Chief Electoral Officer to scrutinise absent vote applications, one of the main areas where it is thought that abuse of the system takes place. The provisions of the Representation of the People Act 2000 which makes provision for rolling registration will also be extended to Northern Ireland and hence will make the electoral register more accurate. The staffing and other resources of the Chief Electoral Officer are also kept under constant review to ensure they meet changing needs and circumstances. In addition, the Government intend to bring forward other measures which will require legislation by Bill. As already confirmed elsewhere, we hope to find parliamentary time for this before the General Election but the timing will of course depend on the timing of that election.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what reason a Regulation 10 (Prohibition) Notice was served ordering Mead Webber immediately to cease slaughter operations.  [122065]<P>

<a name="00621w13.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 May 2000]:</i> I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that the Fresh Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) Regulations 1995 (as amended) oblige the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) to appoint one or more official veterinary surgeons (OVSs) at every licensed fresh meat slaughterhouse in Great Britain to be responsible for the ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection and other health inspection duties.
<P>

<a name="00621w13.html_para0">Following an alleged assault on an OVS by a member of Mead Webber plant management and ejection of the OVS from the premises on 21 April 2000, a notice was served on the plant occupier under regulation 10 of the regulations at 7.44pm the same day. Regulation 10(1)(b) of the regulations empowers the OVS to serve a notice on the occupier when it appears to the OVS that adequate health inspection in accordance with the regulations is being hampered. The notice was served to prevent operation of the plant in the absence of the OVS until such time as unobstructed access to the plant by the OVS was permitted by the occupier.

 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2000]:</i> Establishment of an impartial and effective judicial and penal system is a priority for the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). 400 judges, prosecutors and lay judges have been appointed and the capacity of the court system has been increased. However, as the UN Secretary-General's latest report noted, ethnic bias and the risk of intimidation continue to hamper the administration of justice. In order to strengthen the effectiveness and integrity of the justice system, the UN is recruiting international judges and prosecutors to work with their local counterparts, in particular to try war and ethnically related crimes. The UK has provided UNMIK with over 40 candidates for international prosecutors and UNMIK staff interviewed candidates in London last week. We also hope soon to be able to provide candidates for international judges and judicial support staff.

As required by UNSCR 1244, the development of these institutions will take account of the Rambouillet Accords, of which US officials were the principal architects. Under any proposals for provisional institutions UNMIK and KFOR would retain their overall responsibilities as set out in UNSCR 1244.
