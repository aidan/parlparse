<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="61009w0004.htm_para1"><a name="06101024000321">While we have no plans to extend the local housing allowance approach to the social sector, we are pressing ahead with plans to encourage more social tenants to take responsibility for managing their own rent payments. However, we recognise the need for adequate safeguards to protect the interests of both tenants and their landlords and we will explore this issue with stakeholders across the social housing sector, including the Scottish Executive, before finalising specific proposals.</p>

 The Rent Service in England has targets for quality and accuracy set by the Secretary of State. These are published in The Rent Service Business Plan and reported on in The Rent Service Annual Report. To achieve these targets, the Rent Service provides common guidance to all rent officers across England to ensure a consistent approach to the setting of the local housing allowance, including the regular review of the broad rental market areas.</p>

 During the oral statement I said that both the stock market fall of the late 1990s and rising longevity had cost UK pension funds &#163;250 billion. To clarify, between 1999 and 2002 the market value of occupational pension scheme assets reduced by a total of around &#163;250 billion. We believe this reduction was largely a result of the impact of the stock market fall. Rising longevity would have increased pension fund liabilities during this period, also leading to increases in scheme costs.</p>

For others, particularly where complex analysis is involved or firm data on outcomes may be delayed (for example, in areas involving medical events), reporting may take a year or longer.

 As I said in my reply to the hon. Member on 24 July 2006, <i> Official Report,</i> column 901W, we will continue to provide public information in order to help individuals make informed choices about saving for a pension, including information about stakeholder pensions. Stakeholder pensions are sold and marketed by the financial services industry. The suitability of a stakeholder pension for any individual will depend on their particular circumstances. Figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) show that around 2,880,000 stakeholder pension policies have been sold since their introduction in April 2001.</p>

 The BBC, as television licensing authority, is responsible for interpreting the television licensing regulations and for determining licensing requirements in specific circumstances. However, the general position is that free television licences are not available for second addresses, whether permanent or short-term. A person aged 75 or over who is ordinarily resident in a care home that qualifies for the communal Accommodation for Residential Care (ARC) concessionary licence does not need a separate television licence and the standard fee of &#163;5 per unit of accommodation is waived for their accommodation. An over-75 living in a care home that does not qualify for the ARC concession would be entitled to their own free television licence.</p>

 In 2001 my Department introduced the Public Library standards, to help to define local authorities' statutory duty.

Since 2001 there has been significant improvement in these areas primed by these standards, which both aim to encourage the quantity, freshness and condition of the stock that library users find when they visit.</p>

 The European Commission&#146;s proposal for a regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) was published in December 2005. Under Article 1 of the Protocol in the EC Treaty dealing with the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in relation to Title IV measures (which covers Rome I), the UK had until 9 May 2006 formally to opt in to the negotiations on this proposal. In view of the UK's serious concerns about some aspects of this proposal the UK decided not to do so. This means that the UK will not automatically be bound by Rome I when it is finally adopted by the Council. Whether at some later stage, the UK will opt in to the adopted instrument (as it may do with the agreement of the European Commission) will depend upon the final text of the regulation. The UK is currently participating in the negotiations with a view to obtaining the best possible outcome for the UK.</p>

 The DCA is responsible for maintaining absence data in respect of its staff working at the Scotland Office.

 Several research projects that examine the sexual attitudes and behaviours of BME groups have been commissioned as part of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, details of which are provided at annex 1. The strategy has also drawn upon routinely collected data to inform our understanding of ethnicity and teenage pregnancy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="61009w0023.htm_para6"><a name="06101116000053">The evidence suggests that young people from different ethnic groups are more or less likely to experience teenage pregnancy than others. But establishing the precise impact of ethnicity is difficult because: ethnicity is not recorded at birth registration; BME groups are over-represented in deprived areas where higher rates would be expected; and sexual behaviour, knowledge and attitudes may vary considerably within BME groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="61009w0023.htm_para7"><a name="06101116000054">Data on mothers giving birth under-19, identified from the 2001 Census, show rates of teenage motherhood are significantly higher among young women of &#145;Mixed White and Black Caribbean&#146;, &#145;Other Black&#146; and &#145;Black Caribbean&#146; ethnicity. &#145;White British&#146; young women are also over-represented among teenage mothers, while all Asian ethnic groups are under-represented. Girls and young women of Black and Black British ethnicity are also over-represented among abortions under-18. In 2004, Black ethnic groups (which represent around 3 per cent. of all females aged 15-17) accounted for 9 per cent. of all abortions under-18.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="61009w0023.htm_para8"><a name="06101116000055">The Teenage Pregnancy Strategy has a target to halve the rate of under-18 conceptions by 2010 (compared to the rate in 1998). Between 1998 and 2004 (the latest year for which data are available) the under-18 conception rate fell by 11.1 per cent., to its lowest level for 20 years and the under-16 rate fell by 15.2 per cent. The strategy does not have targets to reduce conceptions among different ethnic groups, although local areas are asked to take account of factors that increase the risk of early pregnancy, including social deprivation, poor educational attainment, living in care and ethnicity, in the delivery of local strategies.</p>

The following table therefore shows the numbers of learning aims funded by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) in 2004/05 and taken up by learners of State Pension Age, i.e. 65 for men and 60 for women, where fees are waived for whatever reason. Figures are in terms of aims, of which an individual learner may have several, because fee remission applies to individual aims rather than the learner. Additionally, where fees are paid in full by the learner, 75 per cent. of the total tuition cost in 2004/05 for learners in Further Education was still funded by the LSC.</p>

 Since 1998, of the 228 applications involving the loss of an area of grassed land capable of forming a school sports pitch, two have been rejected and 46 withdrawn. Applications to dispose, or change the use, of school playing fields are considered against strict criteria which are set out in the Department's guidance. Briefly, these are:</p>
<a name="61009w0028.htm_brev0"><a name="06101116001226"><ul><p class="tabletext">(a) school's needs: that playing field provision and curriculum requirements at the school making the disposal, and at other schools in the local area, are met;</p>
</ul><a name="61009w0028.htm_brev1"><a name="06101116001227"><ul><p class="tabletext">(b) community needs: that community use of a school's playing fields is taken into account, with alternative facilities made available if necessary;</p>
</ul><a name="61009w0028.htm_brev2"><a name="06101116001228"><ul><p class="tabletext">(c) finance: that any sale proceeds are reinvested to provide new or improved sports facilities at schools, with priority being given to outdoor sports facilities, or are used to help raise standards by improving educational facilities.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="61009w0028.htm_para0"><a name="06101116001078">In the case of the two rejected applications, the School Playing Fields Advisory Panel determined, on appeal, that the applications did not meet the published criteria. Applications have been withdrawn either as a result of the panel's preliminary view that the application failed to meet the criteria or as a result of similar advice from officials. In some instances, the applicant itself has withdrawn its application because it realised that it failed to meet the criteria. In every case, however, the reason for withdrawal was that the application failed to meet the criteria for giving consent. A withdrawn case has the same effect as one that is rejected in that the proposed disposal, or change of use, does not happen.</p>

 We are making good progress towards implementing the commitments. The consultation document &#147;The reform of higher education research assessment and funding&#148; was published on 13 June. We are working with partners such as the Training and Development Agency for Schools, and Science Learning Centres to deliver a range of other commitments. For example, we have commissioned the Science, Engineering, Technology and Mathematics Network (SETNET) to recruit an extra 6,000 science engineering ambassadors by 2007-08. We have also remitted the School Teachers&#146; Review Body (STRB) to advise on improving the use of current pay flexibilities and incentives to improve the recruitment, retention and quality of science teachers; and on whether science teachers should receive an incentive to encourage them to complete physics and chemistry enhancement CPD leading to an accredited qualification.</p>

 On 25 July, I chaired a meeting of ministerial colleagues across Whitehall which focused on delivery of G8 commitments, many of which were Commission for Africa recommendations. At this meeting, we agreed a set of milestones that we believe the international community need to meet by July 2007 to ensure we are on track to deliver G8 commitments. These milestones are included in the September update of the &#147;Gleneagles Implementation Plan for Africa&#148; which is deposited in the Libraries of both houses and available on DFID&#146;s website (http://www.dfid.gov.uk/g8/milestones.asp).</p>

For example, during my visit to Mozambique with the Chancellor in April, we committed &#163;8.5 billion over the next 10 years to support long-term education plans to help meet the target of getting all children into school by 2015. At the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Annual Meetings in Singapore in September, seventeen African countries reported substantial progress on developing these long term education plans.</p>

 Ituri is one of the areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo most affected by insecurity. Current estimates from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) suggest that there are over 200,000 internally displaced people (IDPs). The worst affected area is around the villages of Gety and Aveba, where over 40,000 people have sought shelter in camps. Attacks on these IDPs and on international non-governmental organisation (NGO) staff by rebel groups make it extremely difficult to provide support for these people, many of whom had been hiding in the surrounding forests for some time. Shortages in food supplies and logistical constraints have compounded a very serious humanitarian situation.</p>

Food rations supplied by the World Food Programme (WFP) were being distributed in Gety during the visit of one of DFID&#146;s humanitarian experts in the second half of September. Additional resources have been allocated to WFP in DRC this year to cover food, transport and logistics costs through the Central Emergency Relief Fund (CERF) and the DRC Humanitarian Pooled Fund. Both these funds were established with strong encouragement from DFID and the UK is a major contributor to both.</p>

 The Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) has been delivering basic services since July 2006. By the end of September, around 11,900 health care workers, 51,500 of the poorest Palestinian government workers and 40,000 social hardship cases had received basic allowances. The TIM has also provided 1.73 million litres of fuel for hospitals, clinics and water and sanitation facilities in Gaza. This fuel is powering emergency generators to help keep these vital services working after damage to Gaza's only power station in an Israeli air raid. However, the situation in the Palestinian Territories remains very difficult and the security has deteriorated recently. In Gaza many households continue to receive just 6 to 8 hours of electricity per day, and intermittent electricity supply is affecting all key services.

We have called on states who made commitments to AMIS at the 18 July Donors&#146; Conference to honour those commitments, and for others who have not yet contributed to AMIS to look again at what financial and in kind assistance they can give.

 The UK Government are immensely concerned about the attacks on aid workers in Darfur since July. We have made it clear to all parties that the fighting must stop and that any attempts to hinder the humanitarian effort are unacceptable. The situation is precarious and has the potential to deteriorate very rapidly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_399"><a name="61009w0034.htm_para1"><a name="06101118000675">Because of the rise in attacks, aid agencies have resorted to working remotely from regional centres and using commercial vehicles. This means that programmes are likely to be less effective as specialist staff are not on site. Having fewer international staff near the most vulnerable people increases the likelihood of attacks against them. The reduced presence of specialist health care means that any outbreak of disease, such as cholera could have potentially devastating consequences. We are discussing with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) the possibility of further support to their security and co-ordination role, and we are looking at funding additional security training for our NGO partners.</p>

United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) began actively promoting and assisting voluntary repatriation from camps and communities in neighbouring countries. Up to July 2006, 71,000 refugees were assisted to return home, leaving a residual case load of 162,000, of whom 38,000 are in C&#244;te d&#146;Ivoire, mainly integrated with local communities, rather than living in camps. While the rate of return this year has been initially slower than forecast, it is expected to accelerate markedly with the approaching end of the agricultural season and continued investment in basic services in Liberian home communities. UNHCR predict that 70 per cent. of the remaining refugees will have returned home by June 2007.</p>

Its closure, made possible by the residents finding alternative living and livelihood arrangements in local communities, is good for their dignity and well-being, and signifies the diminished likelihood of further influxes of refugees.</p>

In addition, in 2005 and 2006, DFID has provided &#163;2 million to UNHCR to support the voluntary repatriation of refugees from C&#244;te d&#146;Ivoire, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Ghana.</p>

Since the decision was to apply this to only 50 per cent. of cremations, using an innovative &#145;burden sharing&#146; approach to regulation, it is estimated that the increase should be in the region of &#163;25 to &#163;30. To put this into perspective; figures from the Office of Fair Trading in 2001 put the average cost of a cremation funeral at &#163;1,215 and &#163;2,048 for a burial.</p>

 The fuel prices in table 12 of the Standard Assessment Procedure for Energy Rating of Dwellings 2005 are derived from information produced at six-monthly intervals by Salkent (now Sutherland's Tables). The data given for different regions of the UK are weighted according to the population of the region, and the price of each fuel is averaged over a three-year period (to smooth the effect of short-term variations).</p>

canker can have a number of causes, but the recent upsurge in prevalence of the disease appears to be associated with a bacterium (Pseudomonas syringae) although this has yet to be fully confirmed by the scientists working on it. The increase in disease has been noted in France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands as well as Britain. Research into it is being led by scientists in the Netherlands. Though not necessarily fatal to infected trees, this is a widespread and serious disease. In common with other European countries, we are studying it to learn more about its origins, its impacts, and whether there are methods by which owners of trees could prevent or control infection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_582"><a name="61009w0051.htm_para7"><a name="06101160002466">As part of the 10-year plan, published in 2000, the Government proposed to install quieter surfacing on 60 per cent. of the strategic road network including all concrete stretches, dependent on funds available. To date the Highways Agency has resurfaced approximately 30 per cent. of the strategic road network with quieter materials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_583"><a name="61009w0051.htm_para8"><a name="06101160002467">In addition, on 22 March 1999, the Government announced a ring-fenced budget of &#163;5 million a year to deal with the most serious and pressing cases of traffic noise arising from the existing strategic road network, where there was no early prospect of resurfacing with low-noise materials due to maintenance need. A list of 79 locations was published on 11 November 1999, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 681-83, and studies carried out to identify the most cost-effective measures to reduce noise. To date, 60 of these locations have been addressed.</p>

Consistent with this aim, cameras operating within the National Safety Camera Programme are required to meet strict visibility and conspicuity rules in order to enhance their deterrent effect.</p>

Neither is there evidence that this is a cause of accidents. In any case, drivers who comply with the posted speed limit should not need to reduce their speed when they see a speed camera or camera warning sign.</p>

I have attached tables containing statistics on earnings from the ASHE for the years 1997-2005 which are all that is available.

It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>

The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV e.g. for an average of 200 with a CV of 5 percent., we would expect the population average to be within the range 180 to 220. The above estimates all have a CV of less than 5 percent. An x has been given for estimates with a CV of greater than 20 percent.  <i> Note:</i><i> </i>The median replaces the mean as the headline statistic. The weighted mean is the sum of the weighted values divided by the sum of the weights. The median is the value below which 50 percent. of employees fall. It is preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less by extreme values and because of the skewed distribution of earnings data. <i> Source:</i> Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, Office for National Statistics.<br>

 The UK oils strategy, announced in 2001, introduced a number of measures designed to tackle all types of oils fraud including laundering and smuggling. These measures included the introduction of the registered dealers in controlled oils scheme, enhanced law enforcement activity and the creation of a specialist intelligence function. Further details on the UK oils strategy can be found on the HMRC website www.hmrc.gov.uk.</p>

It undermines legitimate fuel retailers, and has a debilitating effect on respect for the law by encouraging members of the public into participating in an illicit activity. The latest estimates of revenue loss in the hydrocarbon oils sector are published in &#147;Measuring Indirect Tax Loss-2005&#148;, which was published alongside the PBR. All estimates for Northern Ireland relate to total non-UK duty paid consumption rather than the illicit market. This is because it is not yet possible to split revenue losses between those resulting from the illicit market and those from legitimate cross-border shopping.</p>

 The most recent HMRC estimate of the revenue lost to the UK Exchequer through the illicit trade in tobacco is for 2003-04. The latest estimates were published in &#147;Measuring Indirect Tax Losses&#151;2005&#148; by HM Revenue and Customs in the pre-Budget report and is available from the House of Commons Library. The Government launched the original &#147;Tackling Tobacco Strategy&#148; in 2000 and successfully reduced the size of the illicit market by a quarter from 21 per cent. to 16 per cent in 2003-04. HMRC has a revised PSA target to reduce the illicit market to 13 per cent. by 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_653"><a name="61009w0063.htm_para1"><a name="06101222001455">At Budget 2006 the Government published &#147;New Responses to New Challenges: Reinforcing the Tackling Tobacco Strategy&#148; and announced new measures designed to tackle HRT smuggling and counterfeit cigarettes. These new measures include working with the tobacco manufacturers and the introduction of supply chain control legislation. A copy of &#147;New Responses to New Challenges: Reinforcing the Tackling Tobacco Strategy&#148; can be found on the HMRC website www.hmrc.gsi.gov.uk. This included a new operational target for HMRC to reduce the illicit HRT market by 1,200 tonnes by 2007-08.</p>

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him on 2 May 2006, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 1455-456W. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has committed significant additional resources to strengthen its strategy for tackling MTIC fraud, and there are now over 1400 staff engaged in that work.</p>

We have had a series of meetings with children and young people, including those who traditionally have been harder-to-reach.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps have been taken to establish the level of crime that is not reported to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) across each of its district command units; and what investigations have been undertaken to establish the reasons for possible changes in the reporting of crime to the PSNI.

 Recorded crime statistics are produced by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in line with Home Office Counting rules and are broadly comparable with those supplied by police forces in England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_673"><a name="61009w0066.htm_para1"><a name="06101247000627">Information on crime levels and public attitudes to crime is gathered through the Northern Ireland Crime Survey (NICS), run by NISRA central survey unit on behalf of the Northern Ireland Office. The survey is also the main vehicle by which the Department is able to (1) identify those most at risk from different types of crime, (2) examine people&#146;s attitudes to crime and (3) measure confidence in the police and the wider criminal justice system. By examining crime reporting levels in Northern Ireland the survey also offers comparisons to reporting levels in England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_674"><a name="61009w0066.htm_para2"><a name="06101247000628">Results from the Northern Ireland Crime Survey (2003-04&#151;the last full year for which results are available) showed that 45 per cent. of comparable crimes were reported to the police. This is broadly similar to England and Wales where the British Crime Survey (2003-04) stated that 42 per cent. of such crimes were reported to the police for the same period. Due to its sample size, the NICS cannot be used to produce sufficiently robust crime reporting data to facilitate analysis at district command unit level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_675"><a name="61009w0066.htm_para3"><a name="06101247000629">The Northern Ireland Crime Survey also examines reasons for not reporting crime in Northern Ireland. In the most recent survey, only 1 per cent. of respondents who did not report crime gave the reason &#145;dislike/fear the police&#146;, while the most common reasons were &#145;too trivial/no loss&#146; (33 per cent.), &#145;police could not have done anything&#146; (32 per cent.) and &#145;police would not have been bothered/been interested&#146; (24 per cent.).</p>

A new pilot project in South Belfast will record all forms of hate incidents with the aim of collecting information on the nature and extent of hate incidents including attacks on migrant workers. The information collected through this pilot will help inform actions to reduce the incidence of violent attacks. A number of Community Safety Partnerships have also developed welcome packs for migrant workers in a range of languages which provide information on community safety issues and assist their integration into the community.</p>

This means that candidates of both religious traditions and genders will sadly experience the disappointment of an unsuccessful application.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_713"><a name="61009w0072.htm_para2"><a name="06101247001875">The latest campaign saw the highest number of applications yet, with 7,691 applicants competing for 220 places. 37 per cent. of these applications were from the Catholic community, which is the highest rate to date, and the number of female and ethnic minority applications has increased.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_714"><a name="61009w0072.htm_para3"><a name="06101247001876">In terms of religion, the Government believe that the temporary recruitment provisions are necessary and reasonable to correct an historic imbalance in the composition of the PSNI. These exceptional measures are reviewed every three years, with the next, and hopefully final, such review due later this year. This will be subject to detailed review of the policy, extensive consultation, and debate in both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_715"><a name="61009w0072.htm_para4"><a name="06101247001877">Catholic composition in the PSNI regulars has increased from 8.3 per cent. to 20.05 per cent. Our goal is to increase Catholic representation to 30 per cent. by 2010-11, the date envisaged by Patten. I am pleased to say that we are on track to meet this, which would  not be possible if the 50:50 provisions were not in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_716"><a name="61009w0072.htm_para5"><a name="06101247001878">Although our efforts have focused on the imbalance between the number of Catholics and Protestants in the composition of the Police Service, we also recognise the importance of gender and ethnic minority representation. It is notable that female composition has risen from 13 per cent. to 20.54 per cent. and the ethnic minority background composition compares favourably with the overall level of the working age ethnic minority population in Northern Ireland.</p>

 The Department of the Environment will continue to be resourced to identify buildings of interest including Regency and Georgian architecture and to record them.

There is currently a grant-aid budget of &#163;2.4 million for the repair and maintenance of the historic fabric of listed buildings. This funding is set to increase with effect from 1 April 2007. Extra staff resources have been deployed to deal with significant increases in planning applications for listed buildings.

As a first step in implementation, the service is currently conducting a tender exercise for the provision of two 60 cell ready to use units, one each at Maghaberry and Magilligan for operational use by late 2007. A decision will shortly be taken on whether to extend the Maghaberry unit to 120 cells, in the light of continuing increases in the prison population. The service can also bring additional accommodation into use in the period before then, if required.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland launched the Household programme on Monday 24 July as the first initiative to provide funding for homes under the &#163;59 million Environment and Renewable Energy Fund (EREF). Householders are eligible to apply for assistance under this programme, which will provide up to 50 per cent. of the cost of installation of renewable energy systems, including solar hot water systems provided they own the property and it is used primarily for domestic purposes. The grant will be offered on the applicant's choice of technology on a first-come first-served basis. Applicants will need to satisfy themselves in advance that their property is suitable for their chosen technology and obtain two quotations from an approved installer. Advice is available for the schemes managing agent on both these aspects.</p>

The criteria used to select homes for this assistance will be based on the eligibility criteria for the existing warm homes scheme as well as conditions relating to the suitability of the property including suitable orientation needed to benefit from the solar energy. Selection will initially be carried out by the warm homes managing agent from the database of homes that have previously received other energy-related assistance under the Warm Homes programme.</p>

Most Education and Library Boards hold local history collections and these routinely deal with enquiries on personal family history from visitors from both home and overseas.

The centre maintains links with overseas museums, Irish and family history agencies, tour companies, public library network, and US college network. It is an active member of the Association of European Migration Institutions (AEMI) and hosts the Ulster American Heritage Symposium which is held alternately in the US and Northern Ireland. The only identifiable cost is for the Centre for Migration Studies for which the Western Board receives approximately &#163;100,000 per annum. All other costs are subsumed in the overall running costs of the library service.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government what obligation a local authority has to pay compensation to the owner for the full value of a domestic property obtained by <i> (a)</i> an Empty Dwelling Management Order and <i> (b)</i> a compulsory purchase order under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.

 Ownership does not transfer when a property is subject to an Empty Dwelling Management Order and the owner maintains the right to sell the dwelling at any time. Therefore there is no obligation on the local authority to compensate the owner for the full value of the dwelling s/he continues to own. A local authority must, however, pay any balance of income received from rent, after deduction of its relevant expenditure, to the owner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_784"><a name="61009w0078.htm_para9"><a name="06101247002496">The level of compensation in cases in which domestic property is acquired compulsorily is a matter of negotiation between the acquiring local authority and the claimant. Where a local authority acquires land compulsorily, it will have an obligation to pay compensation to those legally entitled to claim it. The level of compensation will be in accordance with a number of principles established under statute, case law and guidance, often described as the "Compensation Code." The open market value of the property acquired, disregarding the impact of the scheme, will form the basis of any award. The claimant may also be entitled to compensation for disturbance costs (removal expenses, fees etc.) and a Home Loss payment. The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 introduced new provisions about valuation principles, introduced other kinds of loss payments and allowed an advance payment of mortgage in appropriate circumstances.</p>

 The London-Wide Initiative is a scheme developed by English Partnerships to provide additional affordable homes in Greater London. The homes will be developed on 16 publicly owned brownfield sites including one provided by the London Development Agency, and the initiative is expected to deliver more than 4,500 homes over the next five years.</p>

Estimates show that overall the scheme has the potential to deliver about 1,600 market homes, over 2,000 low-cost home ownership homes and up to 1,000 social rented homes. At this stage there are no plans to include sub-market rented homes in the programme. The first of the 16 sites, Adelaide Wharf in Hackney, is now under construction. Planning consent for schemes in Wandsworth and Croydon has now been granted, with work having started or due to start shortly. A rolling programme of planning consents and starts on sites is planned for 2007 and 2008 for the remaining sites.</p>

 Fire and rescue authorities in England are required by the Fire and Rescue Service National Framework to have in place and maintain an Integrated Risk Management Plan (IRMP) which reflects local need and sets out plans to tackle effectively both existing and potential risks to communities. It is, therefore, for each fire and rescue authority to determine appropriate fire cover in its area, including the number of fire appliances sent to an educational establishment in response to an automatic fire alarm alone or a 999 call.</p>

1. Discussions have not yet concluded with Birmingham Sandwell, Manchester Salford and Hull and East Riding on their programmes for 2006-07.<br>
2. The outputs in the table are only those that are funded directly by HMRP. The pathfinders have played a part in generating significant additional outputs through the contributions of partners, principally local authorities, RSLs and the private sector, in related and complementary interventions in housing market renewal areas.<br>
3. The variation in outputs between pathfinders is partly explained by the different sizes of the programmes and how long they have been running. There is also a wide variety in approaches taken depending on the particular problems face in each area.<br>

 Regional Housing Boards advise Government on how resources for housing capital investment should be targeted. These resources totalled &#163;5 billion over 2004-06. Regional Housing Boards do not have separate administrative budgets; they are funded from existing Government Regional Office budgets and contributions from other Board members. Given this, the following table sets out estimates of the total expenditure of each Regional Housing Board on carrying out its responsibilities to develop and publish a Regional Housing Strategy for its area and provide advice to Ministers on spending priorities. These estimates do not include staff costs, but they do include contributions from Board members other than the Government Offices.</p>

We have recently amended the legislation to make clear that "medical and welfare" includes grounds relating to a disability. Annex 3 to the statutory code of guidance on the allocation of accommodation (issued in November 2002) provides a list of indicators for the "medical and welfare" reasonable preference category, including, for example, a mental illness or disorder, a physical or learning disability, and chronic or progressive medical conditions.

Some 80 per cent. of this figure relates to local authorities only, and on this basis a further estimate of employers' contributions would, in 2004-05 terms, be in the range of &#163;2.4-&#163;2.6 billion in 2005-06, &#163;2.7-&#163;2.9 billion in 2006-07 and &#163;3.1-&#163;3.3 billion in 2007-08.

 The Taliban derives economic benefits from the drugs trade at the local level. There are longstanding links between the Taliban and traffickers based on personal relationships, tribal loyalties and business interests. They share a common interest in resisting the Afghan government and coalition forces. The Taliban is also attempting to exploit the continued existence of the drugs trade to undermine the central government's authority. In the south, there was evidence earlier this year that the Taliban was encouraging farmers to grow opium poppy and resist Afghan government eradication efforts. The Taliban also received payments from traffickers. However in the north, regional warlords and drug traffickers are more likely to resist the Taliban when this would be in their interests. We continue to assess all links closely and to support Afghan efforts to disrupt these.</p>

 The UK and EU have stated that they are willing to deepen the relationship with Belarus, but the Belarusian authorities must clearly demonstrate their respect for democratic values, fundamental rights and the rule of law. The UK and EU are committed to supporting democratisation and to demonstrating to the people of Belarus the benefits of closer co-operation. The UK supports current EU policy restricting ministerial level contact. However, the UK and EU will not abandon the people of Belarus.

 The regulations on the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) clearly state the conditions on which the Preferences are granted. EU member states and Belarus both agreed to abide by those conditions. However, in 2004 the International Labour Organisation (ILO) concluded that the Belarusian authorities had seriously violated the basic civil liberties of trade union members and leaders. The European Commission subsequently launched its own investigation in 2005 which agreed with the ILO. It is clear Belarus has not met the standards necessary and is facing withdrawal of preferences, after a long and considered process. The Belarusians have had over two years to answer ILO and EU concerns. The decision is based on the clear criteria for GSP and does not form part of the EU sanctions introduced following the fraudulent elections earlier this year. The political implications were not therefore part of the decision making process. Nevertheless, it should send a signal that the EU is serious about the need for Belarus to honour its international obligations.</p>

The Mission will focus on areas with the potential to lead to instability, including reconciliation, policing and capacity-building in governance, as well as crucial support to the elections scheduled for 2007. It also provides for an international police component within the Mission and an international military security force operating separately to the UN Mission.

 Progress on voter registration and identification, as well as the disarmament of militias, has been slow, with periods of complete deadlock. Consequently, it has been necessary to postpone presidential elections for the second time. The UN, the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union are currently considering how the peace process should proceed, since the UN Security Council Resolution mandating the peace plan expires at the end of October. The Government are in discussion with all these bodies and with the Government of France. The Government continues to urge all the Ivorian parties to deliver on their commitments. We will continue to support targeted sanctions against those who frustrate the process.</p>

 Estimates vary between as few as 151 dead and as many as 54,700, but the very nature of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) makes it very difficult to make reliable assessments.

<p><a name="stpa_916"><a name="61009w0090.htm_para4"><a name="06101265000293">The food problems of the DPRK arise not only from the decision by the Government of the Republic of Korea to suspend non-emergency food aid, but from lower domestic food production and from lower grain shipments from China.

 The UK played a leading role in the passage of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1559, which called for the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon. This call was further reinforced in UNSCR 1680 and again by Resolution 1701. The UK is now working with our international partners to implement these resolutions, in particular by strengthening the ability of the democratically elected Lebanese government to exercise control throughout Lebanon and ensuring that militias, supported and supplied from outside Lebanon, can never again plunge the region into crisis.</p>

 The UK played a leading role in passing UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1559 in September 2004.

Since Syrian troops withdrew in April 2005, we have been giving practical assistance to the Lebanese Government to help it assert its authority over its territory. This has included sending UK experts to advise on security sector reform, training courses for the Lebanese security forces and a visit by a UK military team to review equipment requirements for the Lebanese armed forces in its role following Syrian withdrawal.</p>

 We are aware of the imprisonment of Mr. Abou and Mr. Lalo following their conviction for defamation of the Nigerien Prime Minister. EU Heads of Mission have raised their concerns over this action with the Nigerien government and have urged the repeal of the &#145;Offence by the Press&#146; Law under which Mr. Abou and Mr. Lalo were convicted, and which is disproportionate in its response to defamation.

 We regularly monitor the situation in Chechnya and the wider North Caucasus. Recent years have seen a gradual improvement in the security situation in Chechnya, resulting in the UN downgrading its security classification for Chechnya from Phase 5 to Phase 4 in August. Russian and local security forces have had some success in improving security recently. The death of Shamil Basayev has been followed by an amnesty under which over 200 fighters are reported to have turned themselves in, creating the opportunity for a process of reconciliation that could underpin long-term security.</p>

We believe that security measures which do not respect international human rights law are counter-productive, and that a long-term solution to the region&#146;s problems is only possible once an end has been put to human rights abuses.</p>

 Singapore is a republic with a parliamentary system of government. The Head of State is the President, currently Mr S R Nathan. General elections are held every five years and presidential elections every six years. The People's Action Party have won every general election since 1959 and currently hold 82 of the 84 elected seats in Parliament. The Workers' Party and the Singapore Democratic Alliance hold the other two elected seats. There is a further opposition MP in Parliament from the Workers' Party who was selected as a non-constituency MP (NCMP), as provided for by Singapore law. The Prime Minister of Singapore, currently Mr Lee Hsien Loong, is appointed by the President as the leader of the majority party in Parliament. All other Ministers are also MPs.</p>

It also provides for the independence of the Supreme Court judges and enshrines the fundamental rights of the individual. The constitution provides for freedom of speech and freedom of the press but it also permits restrictions on these rights.</p>

 The loss of life in recent incidents including, but not limited to, the killing of the 17 Action Contre la Faim workers in Muttur is tragic. The full facts and circumstances of these killings remain unclear. Until they are established, it would not be appropriate to speculate on the status of this case. It is vital that a thorough and credible investigation be completed. The Sri Lankan authorities are currently carrying out an investigation.

 UN Security Council resolution 1612 deals with the recruitment of child soldiers, and calls for the monitoring of this practice in a number of countries including, Sri Lanka. Officials regularly make clear that the use of child soldiers in Sri Lanka cannot be tolerated and will continue to make such representations. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has identified the rights of the child as one of its top three human rights priorities. The UK has supported the establishment of a UN monitoring and reporting mechanism on children affected by armed conflict and is actively involved in the UN Security Council working group on children and armed conflict. We welcome the efforts of the UN Secretary-General&#146;s special representative on children and armed conflict, and promote the ratification of the UN convention on the rights of the child and its optional protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict.</p>

 The Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) and various UN Security Council Resolutions require the Government of Sudan to disarm the Janjaweed.

On Friday 23 June, the Government of Sudan publicly began disarming a small group of Janjaweed in South Darfur but no further disarmament has taken place so far as we can ascertain. We welcomed this step and call on the Sudanese Government to intensify this work. We also call on them urgently to present a comprehensive plan for neutralising and disarming the Janjaweed, as the DPA requires them to do.

 Our Ambassador in Ashgabat has been following the cases of Annakurban Amanklychev, Ogulsapar Muradova and Sapardurdy Khadjiev extremely closely. He has been in regular touch with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Centre in Ashgabat and worked alongside the local EU presidency, who have taken the lead in contacting the Turkmen authorities. The fact that no international observers were allowed into the trial of the three co-accused raises serious questions about whether due process of law was observed.</p>

 The Government are committed to tackling antisocial behaviour, and has a proven track record of success. We keep under continuous review the range of tools and powers available to practitioners and provide practical day to day support to front line services, for example through the Respect ActionLine and website. However, we know that more needs to be done to combat antisocial behaviour which is why, in January this year, the Respect Action Plan set out our intention to consider strengthening summary powers to bring about immediate protection for those suffering antisocial behaviour. This aligns with my further commitment in 'Rebalancing the Criminal Justice System' to consult on proposals to tackle low-level offending and antisocial behaviour.</p>

 The land border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is part of the Common Travel Area (CTA).The objective of the common travel area (the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland) is to treat all territories as a single unit for the purpose of travel. The recently published report about the immigration system does not include any plans to change these arrangements. The UK Immigration Service and the Garda National Immigration Bureau have a close working relationship. There are regular intelligence led operations run by the Immigration Service, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda to test any potential risks to the land border.</p>

<i> [holding answer 26 July 2006]:</i> Information about specific interventions for offenders targeted by the Prolific and other Priority Offender programme is not held centrally. These interventions are tailored to meet the needs of the offenders targeted by the programme to address the risk of re-offending. The nature of the interventions is not necessarily dependent on whether the offender has been selected for the programme as a &#145;prolific&#146; or &#145;other priority&#146; offender. There are currently six PPO schemes across Cambridgeshire, including the Peterborough scheme. Each brings together a range of local partners including the police and probation services but also, for example, Youth Offending Teams, mental health services, Connexions and education and welfare services. The support provided to individual offenders will include help in addressing drugs or alcohol problems, accommodation and employment training needs. Early findings from the national evaluation of the PRO programme suggested that there was a 10 per cent. reduction in recorded convictions for those first targeted by the programme over their first six months on a PRO scheme</p>

ACPO have tasked a specialist unit within Hampshire police (known as ACPO Criminal Record Office) with supporting the Chief Officer's consideration of the exercise of his or her discretion, by providing examples of how requests have been dealt with in other forces and offering advice. However, the decision remains with Chief Officers, who for example may still decide to retain DNA samples without reference to the unit. Specialist unit figures show that at 31 August 2006, of the cases which they have examined, 36 profiles have been removed. In a further 38 cases it has been decided that they are to be removed but this decision has not yet been actioned. There are no central records for cases considered before January 2006, or cases since then where the Chief Officer has not referred the matter to the unit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1031"><a name="61009w0103.htm_para9"><a name="06101336002547">Demand did however drop from 7 July&#151;the day of the London bombings&#151;and was down 7 per cent. overall on 2004 for the July to September period. Non-family visits experienced the biggest fall in demand. A number of factors may have influenced the downturn including the bombings of 7 July. UKvisas does not rule out the possibility that increased visa fees were a factor but there is no conclusive evidence for this. Between November 2005 and March 2006 there was a slight decrease in demand compared with the same period in the previous year. By March 2006 demand had increased.</p>

 The United Kingdom currently has prisoner transfer arrangements with 96 countries and territories.

The consent of the prisoner is a requirement of the Repatriation of Prisoner Act 1984 and, as a consequence, is reflected in our prisoner transfer agreements. The Government intends to introduce an amendment via the Police and Justice Bill to remove this requirement. If Parliament approves the amendment discussions will be held with relevant countries about renegotiating existing prisoner transfer agreements and the return of their nationals.</p>

 The British Crime Survey (BCS) is a nationally representative survey of households in England and Wales.

 Enforcement of this offence is an operational matter for the police. The likelihood of police detection is increased by the use of intercept teams linked to the expanded operation of Automatic Number Plate Recognition Systems. A clause in the Road Safety Bill currently before Parliament aims to increase penalties by making the offence subject to endorsement of three penalty points and a &#163;60 fixed penalty.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 July 2006]:</i> During financial year 2005-06 the total number of complaints received by the UK Passport Service was 8,551, which equates to 0.13 per cent. of total business. The UK Passport Service paid compensation to members of the pubic on just under 3,400 occasions, representing 0.05 per cent. of total applications. The main reasons for compensation payments were for lost documents and photographs, a good number of which were almost certainly lost in transit and through no fault of UKPS. The total value of these payments was &#163;129,000 relating to an average payment of just under &#163;38.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 July 2006]: </i>The IPS has a policy of seeking continuous improvement in efficiency and quality and has a range of initiatives in place, including improvements in processes and workflow management. Initiatives aimed specifically at staff performance include a leadership development programme for senior and middle managers, a computer-based training and accreditation programme to assess and refresh the specialised knowledge of passport examiners, an award scheme to recognise and reward outstanding performers, and further development of individual performance objectives and development plans and performance appraisal arrangements.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 July 2006]:</i> The issue of a passport is not refused on the grounds of an incorrectly completed form. In these circumstances, applicants are invited to correct the deficiency so that their application can be processed. About 12.5 per cent. of applications received by post or at passport office counters are incomplete or incorrect; the percentage falls to about 1.5 per cent. for applications received through the Post Office/Travel Agent Check and Send service.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 July 2006]:</i> The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) have held no meetings with the Plain English Campaign (PEC) in the past 12 months. The IPS are however lifetime affiliates to the PEC and the majority of its customer publications have been tested with the PEC as part of their production process. Indeed the passport application pack was awarded the PEC Crystal Mark in autumn 2005. In addition IPS customer service staff have attended training courses run by the PEC to further improve the standards of communication with customers.</p>

<i> [holding answer 18 September 2006]: </i>Assaults on police community support officers are not identified separately by the Home Office in the recorded crime data.

 The Government are working with the alcohol industry to develop a consistent sensible drinking message on labelling and point-of-sale. The first phase of the Know Your Limits campaign, which will promote sensible drinking to the 16-24 age group, will be launched on television in mid-October. The alcohol industry launched its own voluntary Social Responsibility Standards document last November and the Government have asked for a full report back on its implementation. This is expected shortly. Among other things, the standards encourage retailers to have a clear policy to implement the legal requirement not to sell to customers who are drunk or under age and to put in place internal disciplinary procedures to support this. A fourth Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign was undertaken in the summer aimed at irresponsible drinkers and sellers. The Licensing Act 2003 has provided stakeholders with additional powers to help them deal with problem premises, and the Violent Crime Reduction Bill currently before Parliament will provide additional powers for stakeholders to enable   <br>

Existing powers such as local authorities introducing Designated Public Places Orders (DPPOs), where it is then an offence to drink alcohol after being required by a police officer not to do so, can also help in dealing with problems of antisocial alcohol misuse. Details on introducing DPPOs can be found from the website at: www.crimereduction.gov.uk/alcoholorders/alcoholorders01.htm.</p>

 The Government strategy is to encourage, without requiring, the use of adult restorative justice while we continue to develop the evidence base to show how it works best for adults, particularly in relation to its impact on re-offending. But we strongly support its use as a service to victims as there is consistent evidence to show that it delivers high levels of victim satisfaction. Best practice guidance for practitioners was issued in December 2004 and guidance on setting up adult restorative justice schemes was issued to Local Criminal Justice Boards in March 2005. Restorative justice may be delivered at any stage of the criminal justice system and we are, for example, encouraging its use under the recently introduced conditional caution. Restorative justice has been a central part of the youth justice system since the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and victim contact or reparation can be part of all youth justice disposals.</p>

 The information requested is given in the tables, a copy of which will be placed in the Library. Since 1990, there have been two major changes to the way in which crime is recorded. The effect of the extended coverage and the change in counting rules in 1998 was to artificially increase recorded violent crime nationally by more than 80 per cent while it is estimated that the effect of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002 caused a further 20 per cent increase in recorded violent crime in its first year.</p>

Associated environmental impacts include reductions in energy use by more efficient use of space and the adoption of flexible working throughout the Department, on the basis of eight desks for 10 staff.

<i> [holding answer 13 September 2006]:</i> The majority of the amendments made in Standing Committee were of a technical nature and are unlikely to give rise to major costs to UK businesses. Among the more substantive amendments that are likely to have the largest economic impact was the amendment relating to indirect investors in what is now Part 9 of the Bill. This amendment in some respects reverses the effect of an amendment originally made in the House of Lords. Following discussions with key representatives from the corporate, investor and broking communities, it was clear that the Bill as it left the Lords imposed significant costs to businesses, and the amendment brought forward in Standing Committee should reduce these considerably. Around 400 clauses restating other provisions of the Companies Act were also added. While there will be costs of familiarisation there are expected to be sizeable benefits for users of the law from having it together in one place.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what tax efficient schemes for the purchase of bicycles his Department makes available to its employees; how many and what percentage of his Department&#146;s staff purchased bicycles through such schemes in 2005-06; whether the schemes are available through a range of suppliers; and whether arrangements are made to enable staff with disabilities to purchase adapted bicycles from a specialist supplier.

 The Department of Trade and Industry introduced DTI Choices in March 2006, a benefit scheme enabling DTI staff to obtain tax-efficient computers, child care and bikes on a salary sacrifice basis. Safety equipment for the participant or their bike attracts the same tax savings. In accordance with Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs guidelines, bikes and safety equipment are loaned to employees, not purchased by employees.</p>

 During the evaluation period, officials from the Patent Office heard many diverse views from stakeholders. Given the diversity of opinion and the absence of conclusive economic evidence for changing the directive, the UK did not make representations to the Commission. Instead, it was felt that the views of UK stakeholders would be better heard if they made representations to the Commission directly, and the Patent Office actively encouraged interested parties to do so.</p>

 The works in these buildings formed part of the Department&#146;s very successful Two Roof project which reduced the size of the DTI estate in London by a third, introduced flexible desking on the basis of eight desks for every 10 staff across the whole Department (a Whitehall first on this scale) and generated annual savings of around &#163;15 million per annum. The project has been subject of case studies by both the Office of Government Commerce and the National Audit Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1138"><a name="61009w0117.htm_para0"><a name="06101336004481">The cost of the works to 1 Victoria Street totalled &#163;7.9 million of which over half comprised works to improve the performance of the building infrastructure, particularly the ventilation and cooling systems.

<p><a name="stpa_1139"><a name="61009w0117.htm_para1"><a name="06101336004482">The cost of the works to 151 Buckingham Palace Road totalled &#163;3.9 million which again included a substantial element of life cycle works to the building infrastructure such as the ICT cabling. This enabled the DTI presence in the building to be concentrated on just three floors (total capacity 1,050) instead of the original five floors. The surplus two floors were completely vacated and then sublet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1140"><a name="61009w0117.htm_para2"><a name="06101336004483">The cost of the works to Kingsgate House totalled &#163;2.8 million and was concentrated on three floors. This enabled further activity (totalling 335 staff) to be brought into the building from other DTI accommodation in London which was then vacated and disposed of. The remainder of the building comprising the accommodation occupied by UK Trade and Investment was not part of the Two Roof programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1141"><a name="61009w0117.htm_para3"><a name="06101336004484">The DTI continues to keep its overall accommodation needs under review and an integral part of the overall works was the introduction of a standardized accommodation layout to enable further reductions in space to be carried out quickly and at low cost.</p>

The policy rationale for this legislation was, and continues to be, to provide a degree of protection to a person who is vulnerable in relation to another in terms of financial position and level of business acumen (i.e. a person analogous to a consumer), while not burdening legitimate business, particularly the franchise sector, with unnecessary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004722">For gas, indigenous gas fields connected only to the UK transmission system and in continuous production act in the same way as storage facilities for other fuels. However, gas demand is seasonal and storage capability is necessary to meet peak winter demand and daily demand fluctuations and to enable shippers to balance the gas they put into the network with their offtakes on a daily basis. Even in winter gas storage is unlikely to be used as a continuous form of supply, and stocks are replenished during periods of lower demand. Indicator 2 of the Sixth Report of the Joint Energy Security of Supply Working Group (April 2006), a copy of which is in the Library of the House, shows how gas storage contributes to gas supply over the 100 coldest winter days.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps he is taking to promote investment in industry in Southend-on-Sea; and if he will make a statement. [87108]</p>

<p><a name="06101336004756"><a name="06101336012379"><b>Margaret Hodge:</b>
 The Department has promoted investment in industry in Southend-on-Sea through the East of England Development Agency (EEDA).</p>

<p><a name="06101336004757">East of England Development Agency (EEDA) has, since 1999, engaged in a wide range of regional activities to increase enterprise throughout the East of England including Southend-on-Sea. Business Support activity includes, for example, funding services such as Business Link, the Manufacturing Advisory Service (MAS-East); and promoting inward investment and trade through East of England International (EEI) established in 2005 as successor to the previous regional organisation, Invest East of England. Further examples include programmes such as &#145;Towards 2010&#146; (developing business skills) and &#145;Enterprising Women&#146; (increasing rates of women in enterprise, launched in January 2006). All of these services have a region-wide remit.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004758"><i> Business Link Activity in Southend-on-Sea</i></p>

<p><a name="06101336004759">According to the Inter-departmental Business Register (IDBR) there are 7,932 registered small and medium sized businesses in the unitary authority area of Southend-on-Sea. Of this total, Business Link (Essex) has provided a service to 1,590 (20 per cent.) in the 12 months to 30 June 2006. In addition, a further 620 early stage businesses have been supported in the past 12 months.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004760">The register shows that 150 SMEs have developed a more in-depth relationship with Business Link and have received individualised support with their business development issues.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004761">In addition to the above:</p>

<p><a name="06101336004762">Business Link (Essex) has secured European Regional Development Funding to help finance a &#163;2.1 million programme of business support operating in the Objective 2 wards within Southend-on-Sea. These are Milton, Shoeburyness, St. Lukes, Thorpe and Victoria.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004763">Objective 2 funding in Southend-on-Sea is intended to stimulate business start-up activity, improve prospects for survival and growth and strengthen the competitive performance of established businesses. Working with partners including Southend borough council, the East of England Development Agency, the Regional Centre for Manufacturing Excellence, South East Essex College and the University of Essex at Southend, Business Link provides an integrated package of subsidised business support according to  <br>

businesses&#146; needs and encourages active labour market policies, lifelong learning, adaptability and entrepreneurship.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004764">Business Link (regionally) has also used funds from the East of England Development Agency and the European Regional Development Fund to set up the East of England Co-investment Fund (COIN), which helps to stimulate investment into businesses located in or re-locating to an Objective 2 area by investing alongside private capital.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004765">The fund has been designed for businesses with viable business plans who are looking for investment capital to finance their start-up or growth plans and who are keen to work with one or more private equity investors who will often bring skills and experience as well as capital.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004766">Business Link (Essex) raises awareness of Objective 2 and COIN in Southend-on-Sea using the Business Link website, events for local businesses and e-newsletters aimed at established and growing businesses. These encourage businesses to take the advice available to them and offer information and articles on the latest issues affecting businesses, such as new legislation and best practice.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004767"><i> International Investor Development</i></p>

<p><a name="06101336004768">Southend-on-Sea is home to some eleven overseas-owned investors including Olympus Keymed and the UK&#146;s largest manufacturer of endoscopy equipment</p>

<p><a name="06101336004769">Olympus Keymed provides over 900 high quality jobs in Southend in the medical devices sector and is a priority company for the EEI investor development programme which also directly supports the other overseas-owned companies in the area, two of which also operate in this high-technology sector.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004770"><i> Airport Development</i></p>

<p><a name="06101336004771">EEI have also worked with the new owners of Southend Airport to provide route development assistance over the last year to help them attract new airlines and routes to this airport.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004772">In addition EEDA has invested in a number of key regeneration projects in Southend which ultimately will provide a more attractive environment for business investment. Key projects include:</p>

<p><a name="06101336004773"><i> University of Essex&#151;Southend Campus</i></p>

<p><a name="06101336004774">The University of Essex (UoE) and South East Essex College in partnership are moving to a new &#163;50 million campus in the centre of Southend in September 2004 which will accommodate up to 12,000 students (not all full-time). EEDA have acted as accountable body for &#163;14 million of ODPM funding spent between 2003-06. EEDA also contributed in the region of &#163;4 million towards the acquisition of the site in 2003.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004775">EEDA and UoE are discussing subsequent potential phases of the Southend Campus project. These include innovative proposals for Business Incubation, based around focused research and International Cluster development (in key clusters around an Indo-Chinese axis.) EEDA is proposing to provide &#163;200,000 to support this initiative.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004776"><i> The Palace Hotel</i></p>

<p><a name="06101336004777">The Palace Hotel is a prominent landmark building and historic cultural asset on the seafront above the pier in Southend. It has fallen into a neglected physical  <br>

condition and prior to the instigation of this project was being used to provide temporary accommodation for refugees and asylum seekers. Securing its refurbishment and maximising the potential of this asset for Southend is seen as a key aspect of wider emerging regeneration plans for the town centre and seafront areas on which its future has significant impacts.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004778">EEDA is working with the University of Essex on the creation of a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and business training facility, over one floor within a refurbished Palace Hotel, as part of a larger scheme to regenerate the property (which will involve the creation of a high quality hotel using private capital).</p>

<p><a name="06101336004779">High quality training facilities, aimed at a business audience, will provide a unique facility in the sub-region, with the opportunity to tap into the London market. It forms part of the strategic development of the university to enhance its offer to business and fits well within the development of Southend as an important education hub. The project also sits well in the context of developing Southend as a more upmarket leisure destination.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004780">The proposed EEDA investment of &#163;1.5 million is part of a wider public and private sector investment of &#163;26.5 million.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004781"><i> Former Rossi&#146;s Factory Site</i></p>

<p><a name="06101336004782">The regeneration of the commercial seafront area of Southend-on-Sea is a key element of the overall vision of the town as a significant urban area and cultural and educational focus which serves local people and the Thames Gateway. The Seaway Car Park site was identified as a site which should be undertaken in a comprehensive redevelopment incorporating properties fronting the Golden Mile and adjoining properties to the west of site including the Rossi Ice Cream Factory.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004783">The purchase of this key development site (1.94 ha) will assist in assembling a land package which includes the Seaway Car Park and will facilitate the unlocking of the area which enables its regeneration within a wider integrated regeneration strategy for the central seafront commercial area.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004784">EEDA has allocated about &#163;1.5 million for this acquisition and heads of terms for funding agreement have already been drafted. Negotiations between the vendors and Southend borough council (who are leading delivery on behalf of the partners) are ongoing. </p>

<p><a name="06101336004785"><i> Progress Road Industrial Estate</i></p>

<p><a name="06101336004786">The acquisition and redevelopment of this site is key to improving the quality of the Progress Road employment area. The site currently accommodates a low quality production and warehouse facility. Its acquisition (and eventual redevelopment) would act as a catalyst for approx. 1.5-2 ha of under-utilised employment to the south of the site alongside an area of council owned land to the west of the site. The site runs to 0.57 ha and the premises 35,000 sq ft.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004787">The site was acquired in late March by Southend borough council via EEDA funding of &#163;2 million over 2005-06. A further &#163;200,000 is projected to be spent 2006-07 in undertaking on-site demolition and clearance, followed by master-planning of the broader  <br>

Progress Road employment area to support delivery of the emerging Regeneration Framework.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004788">The above demonstrates that the economic development of Southend is a major priority for EEDA with in excess of &#163;10 million being invested and committed within the past three years.</p>

Friend the Prime Minister and my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, the latter most recently in her speech to the UN General Assembly on 22 September, have made clear our commitment to securing agreement, at the General Assembly this year, for a UN based process to this end. I, along with my Department for International Development and Ministry of Defence counterparts, hosted a meeting with London&#146;s diplomatic community, non-governmental organisations and industry representatives on 14 September. This gave us the opportunity to emphasise to the diplomatic community why an arms trade treaty is so important to the Government, and our determination to secure agreement at the UN. With a range of partners we intend to bring forward the appropriate resolution at the UN First Committee for this initiative.

<p><a name="06101336004793"><a name="06101336012383"><b>Jim Fitzpatrick:</b>
 The majority of the Department&#146;s expenditure on these subjects is allocated from the Science Budget to the UK Research Councils. In turn, the UK Research Councils allocate the majority of their funds in a &#147;bottom-up&#148; mode responding to the demands of the science community and making funding decisions on quality rather than international geographic focus. It is therefore not possible to provide exact figures on spending which relates to collaboration with Japan. However, there is active collaboration, supported by the Research Councils, in a wide range of areas&#151;including genome work, nano and bio-nanotechnology, climate change, sustainable development and energy technologies.</p>

<p><a name="06101336004794">The Office of Science and Innovation does have specific schemes to support links between UK and Japan in these areas, which are administered by the Embassy in Tokyo and which cost &#163;120,000 over financial years 2001-02 to 2005-06.</p>

 Under the assumption that in the absence of an uprating the earnings of low paid employees would have remained unchanged, it is estimated that the gross increase in aggregate wage costs to business due to the October 2006 national minimum wage uprating would be around &#163;540 million.</p>

Under the alternative assumption that low-paid earnings would have risen in line with average earnings in the absence of any uprating (the median forecast for AEI growth in 2006 is 4.2 percent.), the Department estimates that the net increase in aggregate wage costs resulting from the October 2006 NMW increase is around &#163;89 million.

 DTI officials regularly meet with each of the UK&#146;s five Mobile Network Operators to discuss regulatory and policy concerns, and this includes mobile coverage across the UK.</p>

<p><a name="06101336005666">Under the Telecommunications Act regime (i.e. up to 2003) the Operators were required to provide Second Generation (2G) of mobile services to cover 90 per cent. of the UK population by the year 2000. For the third generation (3G) of mobile services the Operators are required under the terms of their licences to achieve coverage of 80 per cent. of the population by the end of 2007.

accelerated rollout to the vast majority of the country, and today, mobile phone services are available to 99 per cent. of the population. The Industry Regulator Ofcom is currently consulting on &#145;3G rollout obligations&#146;. This consultation closes on 20 October. If Members would like to respond, a link can be found at: http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/3g_rollout/dti</p>

<p><a name="06101336005667">The remaining 1 per cent. of the population is generally located in deep rural locations with very small populations and topography that often presents physical barriers to radio waves. This means that the costs incurred by the Operators to develop new infrastructure to service these areas would massively outweigh the revenue, and would prove so uneconomic that the business case to provide a service by the Operators is not sustainable. It is not Government policy to put pressure on any of the Operators to provide a service in a particular location if the commercial case does not justify it. The Universal Service Obligation ensures that there is 100 per cent. coverage of fixed line services across the UK.</p>

<p><a name="06101336005668">In Government&#146;s experience though, the Operators have been willing to listen to representations to extend coverage to certain areas. One way of addressing poor mobile reception is by presenting evidence of local demand to one or more of the Operators, with a view to persuading them that investing in infrastructure in that area is worth while.</p>

 The transport of radioactive material, including irradiated or spent nuclear fuel, is governed by the stringent internationally-agreed standards recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the agency appointed by the United Nations to promote safe, secure and peaceful nuclear technologies worldwide. During the period of over 40 years that the IAEA regulations have been in existence, there has been no instance of death or serious injury to persons, nor significant damage to the environment, from radiological effects caused during the transport of radioactive material worldwide by all modes of transport when properly packaged and transported in conformity with those regulations.</p>

<p><a name="06101336005681">In 2005 the Department for Transport commissioned a survey into the radiological impact of the transport of radioactive material by road and rail. This report has sections explicitly covering the transport of irradiated nuclear fuel by rail. The report concludes that radiation doses from these transports are low. A copy of this report (Survey into the Radiological Impact of the Normal Transport of Radioactive Material in the UK by Road and Rail NRPB-W66) has been placed in the Libraries of the House and it is also available on the internet at the following address:</p>

<p><a name="06101336005682">The transportation of spent nuclear fuel is carried out in a secure manner, in accordance with stringent security regulations&#151;the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003 (NISR). These regulations are administered and enforced by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS), who regulate the security of such movements of spent nuclear fuel.</p>

<p><a name="06101336005683">The security of the transportation of civil nuclear material was thoroughly reviewed following the events of 11 September 2001, and is regularly reviewed in light of the prevailing threat. OCNS is satisfied that the measures in place to prevent theft or sabotage are adequately robust, and that in the event that a credible threat were detected, appropriate action would be taken. As I am sure you will understand, it is not Government policy to disclose details of security measures taken in connection with the transportation of nuclear material.</p>

 Power station operators would normally notify their customers well in advance of any planned maintenance outages in order that demand has sufficient time to contract with new sources of supply if necessary. In its role as Great Britain system operator, moreover, National Grid seeks to hold an &#145;operating margin&#146; of capacity in excess of electricity demand so as to limit the probability of inadequate generation in the short term. This operating margin varies widely between different times of the day and year; it is derived statistically by National Grid according to a number of factors such as generator availability and forecast demand. The level of the operating margin during a given period would therefore reflect any scheduled plant outages.</p>

 The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) assumed responsibility for the decommissioning and clean up of the UK's civil nuclear legacy on 1 April 2005. The NDA has four operational Magnox nuclear power stations: Dungeness A, Sizewell A, Oldbury, and Wylfa; and, seven which are being decommissioned: Berkeley, Bradwell, Calder Hall, Chapelcross, Hinkley A, Hunterston A, and Trawsfynydd. The recently approved NDA Strategy contains the following assumptions about decommissioning costs, end dates and states but also signals that the NDA intends to review these in consultation with stakeholders in the near future.

These regulations are administered and enforced by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS), who regulate the security of such movements of spent nuclear fuel. A key requirement of the NISR is that all carriers of civil nuclear material submit a Transport Security Statement (TSS), which is legally binding, detailing the security policies and procedures implemented in order to prevent the theft or sabotage of civil nuclear material in transit. Before a carrier can commence the transport of civil nuclear material, the TSS has to be approved by OCNS who must be assured that the standards detailed are sufficiently robust.</p>

The balance of the &#163;10 million for the PV Field Trials has been taken up by the detailed monitoring required. We do not have precise information on output as yet. However, current estimates suggest in the region of 800MWh pa. This is based on a figure of 750kWhpa/kW for crystalline silicon at an optimum elevation. However, as many of sites were not installed in this way a 25 per cent. reduction has been applied. A rough estimate of total energy produced to date from the Field Trials is 2,000MWh, based on the average project generating for 2.5 years.

<i> [holding answer 25 July 2006]:</i> The Department&#146;s Carbon Abatement Technologies Strategy for Fossil Fuel Use, published in June 2005, assessed the possibility of using underground coal gasification (UCG). This concluded that this technology, whilst it had longer term potential, would need to be deployed with carbon capture and storage so as to significantly reduce, if not eliminate, the carbon dioxide emissions which would be associated with it. The Department is therefore keeping a watching brief on the development of those key enabling technologies which would permit its deployment in the future.</p>

 Throughout the review of the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) directive, announced in December 2005, and the informal consultation period, my Department has been in very close contact with businesses and business representatives to ensure that their concerns are taken into account. I set up a WEEE Advisory Group of business and trade association representatives to provide a further mechanism for business to input to the process and to allow stakeholders and Government to work together to ensure an effective and workable implementation of the directive. In addition, I have personally received representations from stakeholders on a range of issues. Now that the Government have launched a formal consultation on the WEEE directive, business has another opportunity to input into the development of the WEEE Regulations in the UK.</p>

 The Energy Review was a high level and long-term review.

The review also announced a comprehensive review with Ofgem of all the barriers and incentives that impact on distributed generation, and a review by the Office of Science and Innovation of the long-term potential of distributed generation as an alternative or supplement to centralised generation.

Until 2000 infant mortality rates were published by Social Class based on father's occupation. In 2001 Social Class was replaced by the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC), and infant mortality figures have been published by NS-SEC. It is not possible to use NS-SEC for data prior to 2001 because there is not a one-to-one equivalence with the pre-2001 classification; an approximation is used, referred to as NS-SEC90 because it is based on the 1990 occupational classification. NS-SEC90 was used specifically to aid interpretation of trends over time in infant mortality.</p>

</ul><a name="61009w0122.htm_brev7"><a name="06101336011460"><ul><p class="tabletext">There is an overall downward trend in all groups. In 2001, special work was undertaken to code data to both NS-SEC90 and NS-SEC. Whilst the rates for &#145;managerial and professional&#146; and &#145;routine and manual&#146; occupations are the same, for both classifications, there is a difference of 0.2 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in the &#145;intermediate&#146; occupations. This suggests that a slight downward adjustment is needed. Further details are available in: Rowan S.

 Air products has increased, significantly, the number of cylinders in its service regions to improve cylinder availability and service delivery to patients. In addition, there is agreement with Air Products and BOC to transfer supply of the home oxygen service in the south-west region to BOC from 1 October 2006 to allow Air Products to focus further resources on service delivery in its other regions. We support these arrangements, which are in the best interests of patients. We are continuing to work with Air Products to improve further the delivery of this service to the required standards set out in the contract and performance indicators for service performance, including numbers of complaints received, are much improved</p>

There are a number of different factors associated with failure to deliver within required delivery times. For example, these include the need to give priority to delivery of orders for urgent supply, errors or incomplete information relating to a patient's address, patients away from home and unable to take delivery of equipment and changes in arrangements supporting a patient's discharge from hospital. The interplay of these different factors results in wide variations in data relating to the number of incomplete oxygen deliveries across service regions. However, overall, the trend continues to be one of improvement. Action is continuing to address the issues influencing the number of failed deliveries, including improving effective communications between suppliers, patients and healthcare professionals.</p>

We have yet to achieve the transfer of all patients to new suppliers in all regions. There are now relatively few patients awaiting transfer to new suppliers and these include those who have yet to come forward to seek further oxygen supplies. The national health service is working with suppliers and community pharmacies, who are continuing to supply some patients as part of transitional arrangements, to achieve the safe transfer of all patients to the new suppliers as soon as possible.  <br>

The UK and the US both see condoms as a critical public health tool and are the two largest bilateral donors of condoms.</p>

The UK believes that access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health information, services and supplies should be based on the principles of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD). That is the principle of informed choice, voluntarism and consent, not coercion. The US did agree to ICPD in 1994 and continues to be one of the largest donors for sexual and reproductive health supplies and services. However the US does not fund organisations promoting or providing safe abortion services due to their Mexico City policy (the &#147;global gag rule&#148;).</p>

We believe that this will lead to more women and girls resorting to unsafe abortion and risk death or injury as a result. Currently one in eight pregnancy-related deaths, an estimated 13 per cent., are due to an unsafe abortion. 80,000 women currently die of unsafe abortion. In Zambia, for example, the global   <br>

gag rule has caused the sole organisation providing family planning services in Zambia to cut its services by 40 per cent. This has left women unable to continue to have access to contraception causing unwanted pregnancies and more unsafe sex.</p>

This includes promoting condom use among the most vulnerable who are exposed to sexual health risks (this ranges from married women to commercial sex workers).
