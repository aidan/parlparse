 <i>[holding answer 11 January 2002]:</i> The authorised contractor is obligated to separate and remove wastepaper for recycling. From 12 March, the contract specification will be strengthened to ensure that these procedures are monitored and reported regularly to the House authorities. If the hon. Member has any specific concerns about paper recycling, I hope he will raise them with the Serjeant at Arms.

<sup>(1)</sup> Lord Saville continues to receive his salary as a Law Lord, currently &#163;157,699 a year. He receives no salary from the NIO and so it is not included in the figure quoted at item one.<P>

<P>

<sup>(2)</sup> The non-UK members of the tribunal are paid daily allowances of &#163;50 (net) while in Londonderry and &#163;75 (net) while in London. In addition these members are paid an allowance of &#163;500 (net) for every month in which they spend at least a fortnight in the UK. Lord Saville is paid the daily Londonderry allowance, but neither of the other allowances. As at 4 December 2001 he had been paid a total of &#163;7,400 in respect of this allowance. In addition the reasonable expenses incurred by members on tribunal business, and for travel to and from their home countries for the non-UK members, are met by the inquiry: the sums are included at item 11 in the table.<P>

<P>

<sup>(3)</sup> Eversheds are the solicitors contracted by the inquiry to take witness statements. They have also provided professional support to inquiry counsel and solicitors.<P>

<P>

<sup>(4)</sup> The experts concerned are in the fields of pathology, ballistics and explosives, sound, and history. The expenditure shown also includes that on the Peer Review Panel which has overseen the work of the pathology, ballistics, and sound experts.<P>

<P>

<sup>(5)</sup> Expenditure includes that on real-time transcription of the hearings, and on the evidence display system.<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The table displays the expenditure position as at 4 December 2001. The late submission of some bills means that the figures shown for certain expenditure components, notably four, do not fully reflect the scale on which expenditure had been incurred by December 2001. In addition, a prospective Judicial Review could affect the position at four, and a prospective judgment of the Senior Costs Judge the position at six.<P>

2. The expenditure figures include VAT where that is paid.<P>

3. The Ministry of Defence meets nearly all the costs of the four legal teams which between them represent most of the soldiers.<P>

 We fully support the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent (PIC), and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) which create a framework and promote political will to tackle the problems that poor management and hazardous use of pesticides pose to health, the environment and livelihoods in developing countries.
<P>

<a name="20114w02.html_para0">DFID also supports the revised Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO)'s International Code of Conduct on the Distribution of Use of Pesticides, which provides a widely accepted framework of good practice relating to pesticide management.

<P>

<a name="20114w02.html_para1">DFID does not supply pesticides to developing countries through its programmes (except in emergency conditions such as locust plagues) or support pesticide subsidies.

of the environment, and safety of the producer and consumer. By reducing the need for pesticide applications through the use of pest-resistant crop varieties, natural enemies and cultivation techniques, IPM has increased the sustainability of farming and ecological systems at minimal cost and reduced health risks to farmers.

 There is no UN Poverty Development Programme. Our core voluntary contribution to the United Nations Development Programme was &#163;35 million in 1999; &#163;35 million in 2000; and &#163;37 million in 2001.

<P>

<a name="20114w02.html_para3">My Department has so far allocated around &#163;10 million from these funds to UNICEF and other aid agencies to support activities focused on children, including orphans.

With DFID support, these agencies maintain databases of suitably qualified disaster specialists including engineers, logisticians, and qualified medical staff who have been selected and trained beforehand for work in this area. My Department also manages the UK contribution to the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination Team (UNDAC) system under which qualified British experts are made available for overseas service.

<a name="20114w02.html_para7">The World bank is concerned about the system's technical applicability and its value for money. These concerns were discussed with donors and undertakings given by the Government of Tanzania prior to the International Monetary Fund and World bank board meetings in November 2001. The Government of Tanzania undertook to work with the International Civil Aviation Organisation in identifying Tanzania's civil aviation requirements and to explore the modification of the contract with BAE to meet these requirements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20114w06.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 In addition to existing programmes, a total of five new programmes were launched by Government in 2001, providing enhanced opportunities for pre-school organisations and focused on increasing funding for the early years and child care sector and raising quality and standards for parents and children. A list is provided for information.
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para0">The expansion and development of existing early years programmes such as the universal nursery provision for all three and four-year-olds, has also provided a welcome boost to the sector.
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para1">Also introduced in September 2001 were the National Standards for Under 8s Day Care and Childminding, and the transfer of Regulation of Day Care to Ofsted.
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para2"><i>Initiatives launched 2001:</i>
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para3">1. The Local Network Fund:
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para4">This was launched in May 2001 to enable local voluntary and community groups to provide local solutions to child poverty. The fund provides grants up to &#163;7,000 for work with children and young people aged 0&#150;19. Projects run by voluntary organisations for pre-school children are already benefiting from the fund.
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para5">2. Universal Nursery Provision for three and four year olds:
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para6">Funding of &#163;200 million has been made available in 2001&#150;02 to provide up to 170,000 free part-time early education places for three-year-olds. The majority of these new free places are expected to be in the private, voluntary and independent sectors including pre-schools. To obtain this funding pre-schools must apply to their local education authority.
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para7">3. Day Care Expansion programme:
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para8">Supported with &#163;4 million of ESF was introduced in March 2001. The grant is aimed at encouraging and assisting providers in all sectors to make the move to provision of longer care, ideally full day care but certainly not less than four hours. Application for funding would be through EYDCPs.
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para9">4. Playgroups provide day care/wraparound:
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para10">An initiative was introduced to aid the conversion, by 2004, of at least 21,000 playgroups places to move to day care/wraparound care provision. The aim of this initiative is to enable playgroup places to be converted from sessional provision to day care, or wraparound care, combining early years education and care. This assists 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jan 2002 : Column 19W</I><P>
parents by allowing them sufficient time to take up employment, training or educational opportunities. Capital funding of &#163;6 million is being made available from 2002&#150;03 to aid this conversion programme. This initiative contributes to the Government's strategic aim of creating 1.6 million new child care places by March 2004.
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para11">5. Neighbourhood Nurseries Initiative (NNI):
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para12">This is part of the Government's wider Neighbourhood Childcare strategy. The NNI aims to create new child care places in day nurseries, in the most disadvantaged areas of the country. It aims to help reduce child poverty by helping parents take up work and training that will help them into work. It should also improve the life chances of children through access to quality care, early education and support.
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para13"><i>National Standards for Under 8s Day Care and Childminding, and the transfer of Regulation of Day Care to Ofsted:</i>
<P>

 The Government are committed to creating a learning society in which everyone, of every age and in all circumstances enjoys learning throughout life. Research shows that learning has many benefits for older people in particular, including increased self- confidence, self-esteem and better health and well being, all helping to contribute to an independent and fulfilling lifestyle. We want to encourage more older people to take advantage of the benefits of learning, particularly older people who have not previously engaged in learning or who have been "hard to reach". So we are working to raise awareness of the value of later life learning via our Learning in Later Life Campaign; encouraging practitioners to share good practice; working with libraries, museums and galleries to help unlock their potential as places of learning; and undertaking research into the learning needs of older people.
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para17">Accordingly, in his remit letter to the Learning and Skills Council in November 2000, the then Secretary of State emphasised that learning can help to strengthen families; build stronger neighbourhoods; help older people to stay healthy and active, and encourage independence for all by opening up new opportunities. He also highlighted that many adults, including large numbers of older and retired learners, would want to pursue high quality and rigorous study for its own sake, and that he expected provision to be made available to meet their needs. To support this, we have increased funding for adult and community learning&#151;provision which many older people access&#151;to &#163;165 million in 2002&#150;03.

 <i>[holding answer 9 January 2002]:</i> The principles and recommendations of the report from the social exclusion unit's policy action team (12) on young people continue to form the agenda of the children and young people's unit and the great majority of my meetings in my role as Minister responsible for young people are concerned with work taking forward its recommendations.
<P>

<a name="20114w06.html_para18">Two recent initiatives are of particular importance: the publication of the Core Principles for the Involvement of Children and Young People, launched on 2 November, and the consultation on the Government's proposed Strategy for Children and Young People, which began on 21 November. The core principles provide a framework that Government Departments have agreed to work to in order to increase the effective involvement of children and young people in the design and provision of policies and services. The strategy sets out a framework for measuring and monitoring real-life outcomes in children and young people's lives&#151;the consultation will help shape priorities for spending over &#163;40 billion each year on services for children and young people. I have, of course, met Ministers with an interest in children and young people's issues to discuss and agree both documents which are key elements in the implementation of the report's recommendations.

<a name="20114w07.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what powers <i>(a)</i> will be removed from local government and <i>(b)</i> she will gain under the Education Bill.  [25928]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20114w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Our key aim in legislating through the Education Bill is to remove barriers to innovation and free providers to adopt new approaches to the delivery of education. An important part of this is the creation of a legislative framework that can be adapted more easily to changing circumstances so that we can be more responsive to schools and LEAs delivering services. The Bill does not signal any change in our view of the role of local government. We know that LEAs have an important role to play in school improvement and are committed to working with them.
<P>

<a name="20114w07.html_para0">All the measures in the Bill are consistent with our principle of intervention in inverse proportion to success. Where schools and LEAs are delivering good quality services, we will support them to do so. If services should fail the children and young people involved, then intervention will be swift and decisive, so that they receive the quality of education which is their right.
<P>

<a name="20114w07.html_para1">It is not, therefore, our intention to change the balance of powers between central and local government through the Education Bill.

 Ministers regularly receive representations about performance management and also about assessments under the threshold pay system.
<P>

<a name="20114w08.html_para1">All schools have established new performance management arrangements and initial performance reviews will be completed this year. Nearly 200,000 teachers in England have been assessed as meeting the threshold standards and promoted to the upper pay scale.

A new statistical collection which will provide information for care leavers aged 19 has recently been introduced by the Department, and the first year of data will cover 12 months ending 31 March 2002. This will identify the percentage of care leavers in education, training or employment. The Department plans to publish this information in autumn 2002.

<a name="20114w10.html_para0">An enforcement notice requires an employer to start paying the national minimum wage and also to make up any past failure to pay the minimum wage. If an employer fails to comply with the enforcement notice, compliance officers can then issue a penalty notice which imposes a financial penalty equal to twice the hourly rate of the main national minimum wage rate (i.e. twice &#163;4.10) per worker affected for every day that the enforcement notice is ignored.

 Manufacturing, which accounts for over 10 per cent. of GDP and nearly 300,000 jobs, remains an important part of London's economy. More people work in manufacturing in London than in Birmingham, Manchester or Sheffield. Figures based on the Office for National Statistics figures for 1998, which are the latest available, show performance of manufacturing industry in London, on a gross value added per employee basis, is 123.2 per cent. of the UK average. Manufacturing labour productivity in London is now the highest of the English regions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on how the Working Time Directive is functioning; and how many prosecutions have been made against employees who are failing to implement it.  [26789]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20114w10.html_spnew4"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Working Time Directive was implemented in Great Britain through the Working Time Regulations 1998 (SI 1998 No. 1833) and the amending regulations of 1999 and 2001 (SI 1999 No. 3372 and SI 2001 No. 3256 respectively). These regulations are functioning effectively in providing workers with entitlements to rest, paid annual leave and working time and night work protections.
<P>

<a name="20114w10.html_para2">In referring to the number of prosecutions against employees, I take my hon. Friend to mean employers. There are no readily available figures in this respect. However, 1,369 claims received by the Employment Tribunal Service for 2000&#150;01 and 469 investigations completed by the Health and Safety Executive's Working Time Officers since the Regulations came into force, indicates that workers have not been dissuaded from asserting their rights and entitlements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20114w10.html_spnew5"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Providing employees with a right to compensation where the only issue is the absence of a written statement might encourage speculative claims where no real damage had been suffered. However, the Employment Bill, currently before Parliament, includes a proposal for employment tribunals to increase awards in cases brought under certain jurisdictions where it becomes evident that there was no written statement or that it was defective, and I believe this will do much to encourage compliance.

 The rules for the adjustment of benefit for periods in hospital prevent double provision from public funds as the NHS provides free board and lodgings as well as free treatment. So the downrating rules are based on the principle that Social Security maintenance benefits, also paid out of state funds, should not be paid in full indefinitely where a person is in a NHS hospital and having their day to day living expenses met through the NHS.

The figure quoted by my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor in the answer to which the hon.

 The primary responsibility for the clearance of land mines in Kosovo is that of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Within Kosovo, UNMIK works with non-governmental organisations, national military contingents and the indigenous Kosovo protection corps. British forces are not employed directly in land mine clearance, although KFOR troops continue to provide assistance to the UN when requested, to make areas safe for the return of displaced persons. The Government contribute through the provision of grants, specialist staff and equipment to the UN Mine Action Co-ordination Centre. The UN task is now regarded as largely complete, although there are still two areas west of Prizren, towards the border with Albania, that contain known minefields, where work will continue through 2002.

 The service families taskforce was set up in 1999 by the Government to deal with service family issues that were outside the control of the Ministry of Defence. It is headed by a ministerial group which last met on 15 November last year. I also meet with representatives of service families twice a year to discuss areas of concern. The service families taskforce has been involved in a wide range of issues since its conception. The main areas of progress over the last year are:

 The armed forces, both regular and volunteer reserves, will make a full contribution to the London celebrations of Her Majesty the Queen's golden jubilee, including participation at the service of thanksgiving which will take place on 4 June 2002. The details are being finalised.

 Since the Call-out Order (16 October 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1132) was signed last October to permit reservists to support the campaign against international terrorism, 74 reservists from all three services have been called out. Reservists have been supporting the operation on other forms of service. We are immensely grateful to all of them. As a further measure to support the current level of operations, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has authorised the compulsory call-out of up to 140 specialist Territorial Army personnel to provide intelligence support to headquarters organisations in the UK and to the UK forces deployed in Afghanistan. This action is fully in accordance with our stated intention as part of the Strategic Defence Review to make our reserve forces more usable, integrated and relevant. We believe that the compulsory call-out will be welcomed by the personnel involved and their employers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what accommodation is available for air crews deployed on Operation Veritas and based at Muscat; how many <i>(a)</i> aircrew and <i>(b)</i> personnel may be accommodated in one tent (i) on exercise and (ii) on operations; how long each aircrew's shift is; how much sleep each aircrew gets

between shifts; if an aircrew on different shifts may be accommodated in the same tent; if accommodation at Muscat accords with Group Air Staff Order GASO 9072; and if crews are accommodated in local hotels (A) at his Department's expense and (B) at their own expense.  [24374]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20114w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Aircrews deployed to the region on Operation Veritas are accommodated in two types of air-conditioned tent. On exercises, the normal occupancy of the first type of tent is up to 24 aircrew, on Operation Veritas the number is under 20. The second type of tent, which is slightly smaller, can accommodate up to 14 aircrew on exercises but on Operation Veritas the occupancy is 10 or lower. During unit handovers numbers have been exceeded for short periods.
<P>

<a name="20114w14.html_para0">Non-aircrew are mainly accommodated in the smaller tents without air conditioning. Where possible non- aircrew on night duty, who need to sleep in the heat of the day, are accommodated in the large air-conditioned tents.
<P>

<a name="20114w14.html_para1">The length of aircrews' shifts varies according to the type of aircraft and sortie flown. The length of time between shifts can also vary but is not usually less than 10 hours. Aircrew on different shifts may be accommodated in the same tent but silence is enforced around tents when personnel are asleep. Deployed personnel are not accommodated in hotels except for those who have been in theatre for over four months and are entitled to a period of publicly funded rest and recuperation.
<P>

<a name="20114w14.html_para2">It is recognised that the living conditions for many of our personnel deployed to the middle east on Operation Veritas are challenging but they are in accordance with operational standards for accommodation. UK forces have successfully risen to this challenge and made a major contribution to the Coalition effort over Afghanistan. However, plans are in place to upgrade the living conditions of all RAF personnel on Operation Veritas by March.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20114w14.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Beggs: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will include members of all United Kingdom part-time forces in the armed forces pension scheme.  [25918]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20114w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The armed forces pension scheme is an occupational pension scheme providing pension provision for members of the regular armed services. The scheme also provides pensions for members of the reserve forces who serve respectively on full-time or part-time commitments under sections 24 or 25 of the Reserve Forces Act (RFA) 1996.
<P>

<a name="20114w14.html_para4">The scheme does not provide pensions for members of the volunteer reserve forces serving under sections 22 or 27 of the RFA 1996 or for part-time members of the Royal Irish Regiment. This reflects the ad hoc nature of their service. However, those who are not included in the armed forces pension scheme are contracted-in to the state earnings-related pension scheme (SERPS) and are eligible for pension benefits under that arrangement.




<P>
<P><I>14 Jan 2002 : Column 56W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20114w14.html_para5">Benefits are available under the attributable benefits arrangements to members of the volunteer forces or their dependants if they are injured or killed as a result of their service, which are comparable to those of their regular service counterparts.
<P>

<a name="20114w14.html_para6">Since 8 October 2001, payroll deduction facilities have been available to enable members of the volunteer reserves to make contributions into the armed forces stakeholder pension scheme which was introduced in response to regulations under the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1998 to provide pensions to cover those who are excluded from the AFPS.

 <i>[holding answer 11 January 2002]:</i> Over the past two years, two ships have been deployed from their home bases for an average of more than 60 per cent. of the time.

<P>
<a name="20114w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ptarmigan system has supported successful operations by the ARRC during recent deployments to Bosnia and Kosovo. However, if advances in modern computing and communications technology are to be fully utilised by our forces, we recognise that Ptarmigan does not offer, in the longer term, the most effective solution. Therefore, plans are in place to replace Ptarmigan through Project Falcon from 2006 onwards. I refer the hon. Member to the answer given by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Dr. Moonie) on 9 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 829W, for evidence of our continuing commitment to maximising the ARRC's operational effectiveness through the full range of modern and robust communications systems.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many 680 approvals have been given each year since 1 May 1997; how many have led to export licence applications; and how many such licences have been approved.  [25733]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20114w15.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The F680 process is an informal process under which companies can obtain advice on the prospects for approval of exports at the marketing stage. The F680 also gives formal clearance for release of classified information, where required, for marketing purposes. The number of clearances for each of the years for which data are held, is as follows:

<P>

<a name="20114w15.html_para0">It is not possible to correlate data about F680 clearances with data relating to the export licensing process since the processes are quite separate. For example, F680s may be seeking advice in general terms about marketing prospects which may relate partially to the export that is eventually licensed. It is routinely made clear to exporters that advice in response to F680 applications does not prejudge a decision on the eventual consideration of an export licence application.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what contractual safeguards are in place in the event of a company winning a Ministry of Defence contract going bankrupt; and if he will make a statement.  [25869]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20114w15.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 In the event of various circumstances of insolvency or bankruptcy such as the appointment of an administrative receiver, or a receiver, or a company being wound up, the Ministry of Defence has the right to terminate the contract without recompense to the contractor. This is achieved by the terms of DEFCON 515 (Bankruptcy and Insolvency) which is included in all MOD headquarters contracts. The most effective means of dealing with this issue is to have a system that reduces the risk of placing contracts with suppliers of limited financial capability. The MOD employs such a system, but that risk cannot be entirely eliminated.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many people in the United Kingdom by nation and region, are diagnosed as having Lou Gehrig's disease; and what percentage of these are veterans of the Gulf War in the last year for which figures are available.  [23207]<P>

 Lou Gehrig's disease is classified as motor neurone disease (MND) in this country and there are between 5,000 and 6,000 sufferers of MND in the United Kingdom. Worldwide, the annual incidence of MND is estimated to be 1.5 new cases per 100,000 people. To date, the Ministry of Defence is aware of five veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict who have been diagnosed with motor neurone disease, one of whom died in 1992. The table shows the hospital admission figures for motor neurone disease in 2000&#150;01.

<a name="20114w17.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Martyn Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health on what scientific evidence the Food Standards Agency based its statement on dietary salt and its effect on human health contained in its announcement on salt in bread on 29 November; and for what reason the statement was made by FSA before the salt review by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition had been completed.  [23890]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20114w17.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 I am advised that the statement was based on the finding of the Committee on the Medical Aspects of Food Policy, as recently endorsed by the Chief Medical Officer in his annual report for 2001, as well as the large body of scientific evidence on the issues. The statement is without prejudice to the work that the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition currently has in hand on salt.

 Each local authority determines and pays its own rate of allowance and many provide enhanced allowances to provide for those children with special needs or where recruitment of carers might be a problem locally.
<P>

<a name="20114w18.html_para0">There are many contributing factors which might affect the rates of allowance payable&#151;for instance, the number of looked after children the local authority is caring for, the available pool of foster carers and whether special skills are needed by the foster carer to look after a particular child. It is therefore right, we believe, that each local authority determines and pays its own rate of allowance, taking into account the circumstances that exist locally.

<a name="20114w18.html_para1">The National Minimum Standards underpin the new Fostering Services Regulations, which come into force in April 2002. These have a statutory basis and will ensure that a minimum level of care is provided throughout the sector. They are not intended to be aspirational or references to best practice, but represent a core level of welfare provision that no establishment should fall below.

 The Food Safety (General Food Hygiene) (Butchers' Shops) Amendment Regulations 2000 (SI 2000 No. 930) were introduced in England in response to the recommendation in the Pennington report for the licensing of retail butchers' shops. These regulations, which came into force on 1 May 2000, require retail butchers and other retail outlets selling both unwrapped raw meat and ready to eat food to obtain an annual licence from their local food authority. Businesses must satisfy certain hygiene conditions before a licence can be issued, including compliance with existing food hygiene legislation, the operation of effective food safety management controls based on the principles of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system (HACCP) and appropriate food hygiene training for food handling and supervisory staff. Similarly oriented legislation has also been put in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20114w18.html_para2">We have also made &#163;4.5 million available to fund a free training and support initiative to help retail butchers in England introduce effective HACCP food safety management controls in their shops prior to the introduction of the licensing regulations. Approximately 7,500 butchers in England received help through this initiative which ran from 1998 to 2000. Funding was also made available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to assist butchers in implementing the new requirements over a similar time period.

Osteoporosis is not a named area of work within the Committee's current work programme. Information about the work of SACN can be obtained from the Committee's website www.sacn.gov.uk.

 The length and content of the Chief Medical Officer's annual report is a matter for the Chief Medical Officer of the day. The present Chief Medical Officer considered the length and format of the previous reports after taking up post in the autumn of 1998. He also reviewed the range of publications produced under the auspices of the Chief Medical Officer. He decided that the previous format which included detailed accounts of the Government's policies in relation to health and health care were now well covered in other publications and Government websites. With this is mind he decided to focus the report on a number of specific topics of importance to the public health. He began working personally on this new report in the spring of 2001 and it was published on 10 December 2001.

<a name="20114w18.html_para7">In the NHS Plan, we made a commitment to reduce under-nutrition by developing a hospital nutrition policy to improve the outcome of care of patients by 2004. A number of strategies are in place to manage, monitor and screen patients for under-nutrition in hospitals, residential care and the wider community. Nutritional screening is recommended for the care of specific groups, such as those outlined in the "National Service Framework for Older People".

 All prisoners' physical and mental health care needs are assessed when they are first received into prison custody. The Prison Service recognises that current reception screening arrangements can fail to identify prisoners who have serious mental health problems. A more effective health screening tool for identifying serious mental health problems on first reception into prison is being developed and implemented as part of the Prison Health Policy Unit/Task Force's current work programme.

 The housekeeping guide, "A first guide to new, modern and dependable ward housekeeping services in the NHS", includes a framework for the establishment of housekeeping services within trusts.

 <i>[holding answer 11 January 2002]:</i> National health service trusts were invited to be part of the project on the basis of geographical spread, preparedness to modernise, and the commitment of the local health community to the aims of the project. The criteria for selection for the next wave have yet to be determined.

 Officials within the Department have control over a small fund to deal with particular pressures on local health services. &#163;75,000 was agreed for the Norfolk and Norwich Health Care National Health Service Trust on 21 December 2001 to cover significant staff sickness. The money was used to fund extra shifts and additional child care costs of staff with family responsibilities to extend their hours. &#163;250,000 was agreed on 9 January 2002 to buy operations in the private sector to free up capacity for emergencies in the trust and to reduce waits for elective surgery, prior to the opening of an additional 144-bed unit later this year on the new hospital site. This is in line with well-established procedures for monitoring local health services. A number of other NHS trusts have already received support through this fund. Others will receive support throughout the year.

<P>

<a name="20114w23.html_para3">Fourteen member states and the Commission could agree to a revised Presidency compromise package, the principal elements of which were a three-year penalty threshold for the offences on the existing list of crimes for which dual criminality would be abolished, a time- limited opt out for one member state in relation to extradition of own nationals and a territoriality clause allowing a member state to refuse extradition where the offence was committed on its own territory. A council statement would broadly define the offences of racism and xenophobia, swindling, sabotage, racketeering and extortion. One member state was unable to accept the final compromise package and argued that the warrant should apply only to cases of terrorism and the most serious crimes on the list.

<P>

<a name="20114w23.html_para8">Fourteen member states could agree to the definitions of offences of children and child pornography contained in the framework decision; one member state disagreed, arguing that the exemptions from criminal liability for offences in relation in return to virtual pornography should be deleted.

<P>

<a name="20114w23.html_para9"><i>Harmonisation of Penalties:</i>
<P>

<a name="20114w23.html_para10">There was general agreement to pursue the Presidency's proposal for the future approximation of criminal law penalties.

<a name="20114w23.html_para18">The council held a debate on the Presidency text, which focused on appeal rights. I argued for swift agreement on the package of asylum directives currently under negotiation and added that asylum procedures should be rapid and fair but should not allow multiple opportunities for appeal. The Presidency noted a broad consensus on the way forward, and agreed to amend its text in the light of member states' comments.

<P>
<a name="20114w24.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 A survey of mental ill health in the prison population of England and Wales, undertaken in 1997 by the Office for National Statistics, showed that some 10 per cent. of remanded men, 7 per cent. of sentenced men and 14 per cent. of all women prisoners had suffered from a functional psychosis in the past year. Some 59 per cent. of remanded men, 76 per cent. of remanded women, 40 per cent. of sentenced men and 63 per cent. of sentenced women had a neurotic disorder.
<P>

<a name="20114w24.html_para2">Applying these rates to the current population would indicate that around 5,300 prisoners would be suffering from a functional psychosis and around 30,000 from a neurotic disorder. Some prisoners will have both conditions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 18 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 239W, on the budget of the assisted prisoner visits unit, how much of the budget for 2001&#150;02 is expected to be paid to assist <i>(a)</i> foreign nationals and <i>(b)</i> UK nationals to visit those held in prisons in England and Wales.

 Applicants for assistance under the Assisted Prison Visits scheme are required to show that they meet the eligibility criteria. They are not asked to state their nationality as this is not one of the criteria for assistance.

 By the end of January immigration detainees held in local prisons will, if their detention is to continue, be transferred to immigration removal centres.

<P>

<a name="20114w25.html_para4">Additionally immigration detainees are held in two dedicated prison establishments: a unit in Her Majesty's Prison Lindholme, near Doncaster; and Her Majesty's Prison Haslar. I am taking steps to establish these as immigration removal centres under the control of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate of the Home Office as from February. Detainees in these establishments will be subject to Detention Centre Rules, rather than the Prison Rules as at present. It may take some time before the facilities in the new centres match those of other removal centres, but that is our intention.
<P>

<a name="20114w25.html_para5">Asylum seekers are also detained in two wings of Her Majesty's Prison Rochester. These detainees will be transferred to other immigration removal centres by the end of January. A new removal centre will be established at Her Majesty's Prison Dover in the spring.
<P>

<a name="20114w25.html_para6">It will always remain necessary to hold small numbers of immigration detainees including asylum seekers in prisons for reasons of security, or who are awaiting deportation on conclusion of a prison sentence. Any asylum seeker who is held on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence, or is serving a custodial sentence will also be held in prison.

 Representations have been received from a variety of interested parties including children's charities, businesses involved in the development and provision of internet services and internet security technologies, and individuals. These have been followed up by officials both in writing and meetings to explore and encourage activity in support of the aims and objectives of the Task Force on Child Protection on the internet which the Home Secretary created last year.

 The police already have and use the power to disclose information to individuals or groups in the community where they believe that doing so is necessary to prevent an offence from being committed. They assess to whom to disclose the information and how to do so on the basis of the circumstances of the individual case.

<a name="20114w27.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 No recent discussions have taken place on this issue. Orders from all courts outside England and Wales, including Scottish orders, are registered at the Royal Courts of Justice within 48 hours of receipt. It is then a matter for the solicitors in the case to choose the method of enforcement. The speed at which this is done is in the hands of the solicitors. As all warrants from courts outside England and Wales are registered together, a special exercise would need to be conducted to calculate the time taken to process orders from Scottish courts. This could be done only at disproportionate cost.

 There are five categories under which a decree for divorce can be obtained, only two of which could be deemed fault free (two years' separation where the respondent consents and five years' separation without consent). The table shows the number of divorce petitions issued in each of the last 10 years, for which figures are available. The speed at which an individual divorce is processed is in the hands of the parties and/or their legal representatives. There is no system currently in place to measure either the average time to process or the cost to public funds of a fault free divorce.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many complaints have been reported in her Department under paragraph 11 of the Civil Service Code since 13 May 1999; and how many of them related to special advisers.  [25340]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20114w27.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The procedures for making complaints under the Civil Service Code are set out in the Department's staff handbook. Civil servants are encouraged, in the first instance, to raise complaints made under paragraph 11 of the Civil Service Code with their line manager. If for any reason this is not felt to be possible, perhaps because the line manager is part of the complaint, individuals may take their complaint to a 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jan 2002 : Column 103W</I><P>
nominated official (or officials). It is not possible to provide a comprehensive figure for the number of complaints made within this Department under paragraph 11 of the Code as there is no requirement for managers to report to the centre details of complaints made under the Civil Service Code which are resolved within the management lint.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what schemes targeting urban regeneration needs are managed by her Department; how much each scheme has available to invest; what issues each scheme aims to tackle; and how much has been spent annually since 1997 <i>(a)</i> in the United Kingdom, <i>(b)</i> in Teesside, <i>(c)</i> in Redcar and Cleveland and Middlesbrough councils and, <i>(d)</i> in the Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East constituency.

 The Community Legal Service provides a framework for local networks of legal and advice services through which &#163;792 million of core legal aid is delivered in England and Wales. This funding is allocated via contracts granted by the Legal Services Commission on behalf of the Lord Chancellor's Department.
<P>

<a name="20114w27.html_para0">The Partnership Innovation Budget (PIB) is a key element of the Community Legal Service. The PIB, approved in September 2000, provides "seedcorn" funding for new initiatives to improve people's access to

<P><I>14 Jan 2002 : Column 104W</I><P>
legal information and advice, particularly in the most deprived areas. Through competitive bidding it will distribute &#163;15 million over three years. Sixty-four successful PIB bids were announced in September 2001. Proposals covered a wide range of ideas including for example: a virtual law centre; projects to work with health care professionals to bring legal advice to hard to reach groups such as people with mental health difficulties, young and older people, the vulnerable and those less mobile; and a scheme for increasing the availability of trained lawyers in shortage categories of social welfare law.
<P>

<a name="20114w27.html_para1">Successful bids for Teesside were valued &#163;814,775. Bids for Middlesbrough and Redcar and Cleveland were valued at &#163;631,975. Successful bids included: Redcar and Cleveland Citizens Advice Bureau for a developmental education project about management money, basic rights and entitlements; Redcar and Cleveland Citizens Advice Bureau/MIND for delivering advice to people with mental health difficulties; Tees Valley Connexions for a help service for young people; Middlesbrough CAB for delivering advice to people with mental health difficulties; Middlesbrough BC Welfare Rights Unit for benefit advice to older people, Benefits Agency (Tees district) for a one stop advice circle; and Hartlepool CAB for a preventative education programme in Hartlepool.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to her answer of 26 November, <i>Official Report</i>, column 688W, on warm front grants, if she will publish for each quarter since 1 June 2000 by region <i>(a)</i> the modal, <i>(b)</i> the median and <i>(c)</i> the mean cost of HEES and HEES plus grants; and why the average cost of grant for England in 2000&#150;01 for HEES was 26 per cent. and for HEES plus 17 per cent. of the total grant available.  [21788]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20114w27.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 December 2001]:</i> The Eaga Partnership Ltd. and TXU Warm Front Ltd. manage the home energy efficiency scheme, marketed as the warm front team, under contract. The table shows the modal, median and mean cost for HEES and HEES Plus in the period from June 2000 to November 2001. The data are shown in terms of grouped regions as it is not possible to provide individual region areas without incurring disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="20114w27.html_para3">The difference between the average grant paid under HEES and the grant maximum is due to the nature of the scheme. The package of measures provided is tailored to the requirements of each property. For example if a home already has a central heating system then a package of insulation measures is provided. This approach ensures that the scheme provides the greatest assistance to those householders most in need, and less to those whose homes are already energy efficient.

<a name="20114w27.html_para5">Work in private sector landlords' properties is undertaken only once a no rent rise agreement is in place. This requirement was introduced following consultation on the proposed scheme in 1999. Many groups representing tenants and older people expressed concern that some private sector landlords would use the grant- funded improvements to justify an increase in rent. Agreements are time-limited to either one year for insulation measures only or two years where heating measures are installed.
<P>

<a name="20114w27.html_para6">In the period June 2000 to November 2001 some 27,000 private sector landlords agreed to the no rent rise agreement. This represents about 5 per cent. of all applications accepted under the scheme.

 The Government's target for improving energy efficiency in households is set out in the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy, published on 21 November 2001. The goal of the Government and the devolved Administrations is to seek an end to the problem of fuel poverty. In particular we will seek an end to the blight of fuel poverty for vulnerable households&#151;older people, families with children, the disabled or those with long-term illness&#151;by 2010. This involves improving the energy efficiency of

 <i>[holding answer 20 July 2001]:</i> The Government have had no such discussions with local authorities. Although Government policy seeks to encourage waste minimisation and to maximise the scope for recycling wherever possible, in those cases where options further up the waste hierarchy do not provide the Best Practicable Environmental Option (BPEO), some incineration capacity may be needed in order to achieve the landfill diversion targets under the Landfill Directive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20114w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Since launching the national waste strategy in May last year the Government have set demanding statutory targets for the recycling and composting of household waste for each local authority, increased the landfill tax and consulted on a system of tradeable landfill permits in order to achieve the diversion from landfill required. It has also set up the Waste and Resources Action Programme to help create stable and efficient markets for recycled materials and products, with funding from the Government and the devolved Administrations of around &#163;40 million over three years.
<P>

<a name="20114w28.html_para0">Extra funding has been made available to enable waste authorities to meet the Statutory Performance Standards for recycling and composting that are now in place. Spending Review 2000 included an increase of &#163;1.1 billion by 2003&#150;04 over 2000&#150;01 provision as well as the provision of other sources of funding including the ring-fenced fund of &#163;140 million specifically for recycling and &#163;220 million of PFI funding for waste projects.

 The European Commission made estimates of the likely amount of the ewe premium during the course of 2001 to enable advances of the premium to be paid. However, as the premium for 2001 is calculated as a deficiency payment, the final rate of the premium cannot be set until after the end of the year when the average community market price for sheepmeat will be known. The Commission is expected to determine the final rate for 2001 at a meeting of the Sheepmeat Management Committee on 18 January.

<sup>(36)</sup> Progress is expressed as a percentage relative to the 1990&#150;91 base year value of the performance indicator in question. Positive figures represent improvement. The standard indicator, against which the target to improve energy efficiency by 20 per cent. by 31 March 2000 is measured, is obtained by weather-correcting energy consumption and converting to costs using 'standard prices' for fuel (6p/kWh for electricity and 1.25p/kWh for all fossil fuels) then dividing by floor area. Conversion to money both reflects the relative costs of electricity and fossil fuel and their environmental impact, and the use of fixed prices eliminates the effects of tariff changes which distort the comparison of fuel bills.<P>

<sup>(38)</sup> HSE was removed from the DfEE estate on the formation of that Department. QEII Conference Centre is reported separately because of its business led demands. The initial sharp rise in consumption following the 1990&#150;91 base year was directly attributable to increased revenue earning activity, which has continued throughout the reporting period.<P>

<P>

<sup>(39)</sup> Rationalisation of the estate since the base year has led to staff moving from several naturally ventilated buildings to more densely occupied air-conditioned buildings, all equipped extensively with information technology equipment. Staff numbers have increased by over 25 per cent. since 1997&#150;98 which has led to a commensurate increase in energy consumption.<P>

<P>

<sup>(40)</sup> The transition from the former Welsh Office to the National Assembly for Wales resulted in staff numbers increasing by some 24 per cent. between 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000. This has significantly added to substantial increasing energy demands through the use of 



information technology. The transition to devolution also involved the acquisition of a large air-conditioned headquarters-type building and assimilation into the Assembly of various other building stock.<P>

<sup>(41)</sup> The Ministry of Defence (MOD) estate is different from the rest of the Government estate, and has been undergoing more radical changes. It is therefore treated in a slightly different way. In common with the civil estate, it has greatly increased its use of information technology.<P>

<P>

<sup>(42)</sup> In civil Departments, the effect of estate changes is allowed for by dividing consumption by floor area. In MOD, floor area is sometimes not meaningful (eg in relation to security or runway lighting) and also not often available. Estate changes are allowed for by being explicitly excluded from the calculations, ie the energy consumption of new facilities is removed, and for facilities no longer part of the estate, the consumption for the last full year of operation is added back. In most cases, such changes are small compared to the total and can often approximately cancel each other out.<P>

<sup>(45)</sup> It is almost impossible to produce any meaningful results to date for MOD's Procurement Executive (PE) since it has suffered major estate gains and losses over the past 10 years and now consists largely of one recently built large office. The standard MOD methodology produces a meaningless 'no change' result (since the present estate is almost entirely different from the original). Consequently, we have taken 1997&#150;98 as the base year and applied the civil Departments' methodology to this office. <P>

The purpose of licences is to ensure that waste is disposed of in ways which protect the environment and human health. Failure to comply with a licence condition, or the disposal of waste in a manner likely to cause environmental pollution or harm to human health is a criminal offence.
<P>

<a name="20114w29.html_para2">I understand that the original licence for the South Ockendon landfill site, issued by Essex county council in 1984 allowed consignments of mixed fly ash and bottom ash from the Edmonton municipal waste incinerator to be consigned to the South Ockendon site. The county council deemed the ash to be suitable for such disposal. These licences were completed in 1997.
<P>

<a name="20114w29.html_para3">The Environment Agency, which assumed responsibility for waste management licensing in 1996, advises that the deposit of this mixed ash at the site, in compliance with the licence at that time, ceased in December 1997 as a result of the new licence.

 Candidate Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) are selected using the criteria set out in the Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC). There are no rules to prevent sites being nominated individually for candidate SAC status. The selection principles are set out in JNCC report 270, a copy of which is in the House Library. Site selection principles are set out at section 1.10 of that report, with clarification of the justification principles for individual or cluster sites at section 1.11.

Consultation began on 18 August with a request for comments by 11 October 2000. In the light of request for further information, and subsequent objections received on 5 April 2001, English Nature have continued discussions with the intention of resolving areas of disagreement. Two meetings have been held between English Nature and the Peat Producers Association, on 6 October 2000 and on 12 November 2001. Subsequent to the scientific views submitted on 5 April no supplementary scientific information specifically relating to Hatfield Moors has been provided to English Nature in the course of these discussions. However, various issues concerning the interpretation of the habitat type and the process of selecting sites including the application of the criteria in the directive have been raised during the discussion.

A Government office survey showed that 93 per cent. of local authorities met this target. Local authorities now have a statutory duty, under the Local Government Act 2000, to prepare community strategies for promoting the social, environmental and economic well-being of their area. Guidance makes clear that these should continue the work done on LA21 strategies. The Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions has responsibility for community strategies. Progress is reported through a best value performance indicator.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent steps have been taken to improve the cleanliness of the Tees in the last five years; and what improvements there have been in the life of the river resulting from such action.  [25445]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20114w30.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Tees Barrage, which became operational in 1996, protects the river Tees from pollution discharged to the estuary and the river upstream of the barrage is now generally of good or very good quality. In 2001, 1,260 salmon and sea trout were counted in the fish trap at the Tees Barrage compared with 241 sea trout and salmon five years earlier. However, numbers of fish trapped in the barrage fish trap represent only a fraction of those running through the estuary and it is estimated that up to 20,000 salmon and sea trout migrated through the Tees during 2001. There is now also a healthy colony of breeding seals at Teesmouth.
<P>

<a name="20114w30.html_para0">The Environment Agency, working with industry, Northumbrian Water, local authorities and English Nature has also overseen dramatic improvements in water quality in the Tees estuary. In 2000, Northumbrian Water completed and commissioned the Bran Sands Treatment Complex at a cost of &#163;270 million. Domestic sewage and industrial effluents are now biologically treated to a very high standard before being discharged to the estuary.
<P>

<a name="20114w30.html_para1">Whereas 10 years ago there was no oxygen present in the estuary during the warm summer months, the main estuary is now classed as good or fair quality.
<P>

<a name="20114w30.html_para2">Biological oxygen demand (BOD) which measures the amount of oxygen consumed in water, usually by organic pollution, has been reduced from a daily load of 150 tonnes in 1990 to 35 tonnes in 2000. The daily load of ammonia, which is toxic to fish, has been reduced from 59 tonnes in 1990 to 14 tonnes in 2000. Inputs of other toxins such as organic chemicals and metals have also been reduced as a result of improved processes and treatment systems, better environmental management, recycling and reuse. Two major ammonia reduction investments in 2001 should bring environmental benefits in 2002. Programmes to further reduce ammonia and biological oxygen demand are programmed for 2002.

 The unlawful deposit of waste without a waste management licence or registered exemption (commonly known as fly-tipping) is a criminal offence. In the event of a conviction, severe penalties are available to the courts, including an unlimited fine or imprisonment of up to five years.
<P>

<a name="20114w30.html_para4">Section 59 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, provides a local authority or the Environment Agency with the power to effect the removal of fly-tipped waste and to recover costs from those responsible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20114w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 January 2002]:</i> Export refunds for dairy products may be set to compensate for the difference between world and EU prices. When this gap narrows, as was the case earlier last year, the refunds are reduced. When it widens, as is the case at present, the refunds may be increased. But in setting export refunds for dairy products the Commission and the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products are required to consider a number of factors. These include the objectives of the Common Organisation of the Market, the supply of dairy products on EU markets (required, for example, for food manufacture), as well as the difference between world and EU prices. In the last quarter of 2001 weak world markets made it difficult for EU traders to export, including the Northern Irish dairy sector which relies particularly heavily on exports of milk powders. The UK therefore supported proposals for higher export refunds for these products which were agreed in November and December 2001. The market situation is being kept under review.
