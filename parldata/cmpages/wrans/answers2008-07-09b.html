The final selection of stations will be influenced by, among other things, the extent to which third party funding&#151;from local authorities and the private sector&#151;is secured to supplement the industry&#146;s own proposals.</p>

 None. The timing of engineering works is an operational matter for Network Rail under the possessions regime overseen by the independent Office of Rail Regulation.

 Sea level rise and increasing storm activity are the key elements of coastal risk. The combined effect of these are generally greatest along the Anglian and south east coastlines, where there are extensive areas of low-lying land and where the impact of rising sea levels is exacerbated as the land is also sinking due to tectonic plate movement. The soft nature of the cliffs on the south and east coasts means that these areas are also at greatest risk of erosion.</p>

It should be noted that non-sanction detections that contribute to the overall detection rate have fallen in recent years reflecting a significant shift by many police forces away from recording detections of crime where no further action is taken. For this reason overall detection rates over time are not fully comparable. From 1 April 2007 the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they can be claimed to a very limited set of circumstances.<br>

It should be noted that non-sanction detections that contribute to the overall detection rate have fallen in recent years reflecting a significant shift by many police forces away from recording detections of crime where no further action is taken. For this reason overall detection rates over time are not fully comparable. From 1 April 2007 the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they can be claimed to a very limited set of circumstances<br>

It should be noted that non-sanction detections that contribute to the overall detection rate have fallen in recent years reflecting a significant shift by many police forces away from recording detections of crime where no further action is taken. For this reason overall detection rates over time are not fully comparable. From 1 April 2007 the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they can be claimed to a very limited set of circumstances.<br>

It should be noted that non-sanction detections that contribute to the overall detection rate have fallen in recent years reflecting a significant shift by many police forces away from recording detections of crime where no further action is taken. For this reason overall detection rates over time are not fully comparable. From 1 April 2007 the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they can be claimed to a very limited set of circumstances.<br>

<i> [holding answer 8 July 2008]:</i> Driving while disqualified is a criminal offence carrying a penalty of a maximum fine of &#163;5,000 or six months imprisonment or both. How the offence is enforced is an operational matter for the police. We have supported the growing use by the police of automatic number plate recognition technology. These enable the rapid identification of vehicles of potential interest, including those linked with a disqualified driver. We have given police the power to seize immediately vehicles that are being driven by someone otherwise than in accordance with a licence or who does not have insurance and to return them only on production of licence and insurance.</p>

The majority of water is sourced from boreholes, purified by reverse osmosis, checked for purity and then distributed. In Afghanistan the UK also has its own water bottling plant at Camp Bastion. Where sufficient water cannot be sourced locally, we import significant quantities of bottled water. This is distributed by a variety of means depending on the destination but can be by truck, helicopter or even air dispatch for the more austere locations. Finally, soldiers are provided with water purification tablets for use in extremis, but these are not viewed as a long term method of providing access to a safe water supply.</p>

 Rule 17 of the Coroners Rules 1984 allows coroners to exclude the public from an inquest or part of an inquest if they consider it would be in the national interest to do so. There is no requirement on coroners to record data about their use of Rule 17 and this information is not therefore held centrally. I would, however, expect these powers to be used infrequently.</p>

 The main aim of coroner reform is to deliver a better service for bereaved people. Since the draft Coroners Bill was published in 2006, extensive public consultation on our plans for reform has taken place and feedback from bereaved people and voluntary groups representing their interests has helped to improve several areas of policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="80709w0010.htm_para0"><a name="08070966000247">As well as receiving over 150 responses to the public consultation exercise, a panel of people with recent experience of the coroners' system debated the draft Bill in the Palace of Westminster in November 2006. The event highlighted broad support for the proposals&#151;for example, the introduction of an accessible appeals system for those who are unhappy with coroners' decisions. Panel members also made suggestions for improving the draft Charter for Bereaved People, which will be published alongside the Bill to show Members of Parliament how the reform proposals are intended to benefit bereaved families. I published a further version of the draft Charter for consultation on 18 June.</p>

 There are a range of issues that are known to affect the likelihood of reoffending.

The evidence suggests that as there are multiple influences on offending, the most effective response is with a package of interventions.</p>

<i> [holding answer 12 May 2008]: </i>Government are committed to increasing women&#146;s representation in political and public life, and recognises that black and minority ethnic women remain particularly under represented. The empowerment of black, Asian and minority ethnic women is one of the Ministers for women&#146;s priorities announced in July 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_436"><a name="80709w0015.htm_para0"><a name="08070975000134">In 2002 the Government introduced legislation that allowed positive measures to be taken by political parties to increase the number of women candidates. In March 2008 we announced an extension to the period during which parties can use all-women short lists for candidate selection for local, national and European elections from 2015 to 2030.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_437"><a name="80709w0015.htm_para1"><a name="08070975000135">Less than 1 per cent. of local councillors are black, Asian and minority ethnic women. To be more reflective of society this number needs to increase to around 1,000. That is why the Government have established a cross party taskforce to encourage more black, Asian and minority ethnic women to become councillors. This is chaired by Baroness Uddin, the first Muslim woman to sit in the House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_438"><a name="80709w0015.htm_para2"><a name="08070975000136">The taskforce will take into account the findings of the independent Councillors Commission which was set up last year by the Department of Communities and Local Government. This reported in December 2008 and made recommendations to encourage a more diverse range of people to become councillors so that communities are better represented. The Government&#146;s response will be published in the summer.</p>

 It is for local planning authorities to determine in the first instance whether a material change of use has occurred or would occur, and also whether planning permission is required. These decisions need to be made on a case by case basis taking into account individual circumstances, and by reference to the Town and Country (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) and the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (as amended).</p>

In general, if a local planning authority considers a bail hostel to be within class C2 or &#145;sui generis&#146;, then planning permission would usually be required for a change of use from a domestic dwelling.</p>

If the amenity impacts are consistent with those typical of a residential dwelling, it is likely that there would be no requirement for planning permission. This, however, would be for the local authorities to determine.</p>

<i> [holding answer 7 July 2008]:</i> There have been no meetings between Ministers at Communities and Local Government and the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) since 1 May 2005. As part of the process for taking forward the eco-towns programme officials have met with members of CWS, who have submitted proposals for an eco-town at Pennbury (Stoughton). The majority of these meetings have been as part of the further assessment of the proposal, in particular following its shortlisting in April and along with the relevant local authorities. This includes attendance at the eco-town joint technical group meetings and also the Eco-towns Challenge Panel. As we further consult and assess the shortlisted eco-town proposals we expect these meetings to continue.</p>

For example, if there are a large number of permanent staff with long service who are in the upper reaches of the pay band then the average amount paid to temporary staff, in the same grade, will be lower. Similarly if there are a large number of staff with short service in the lower reaches of the pay band and temporary staff have negotiated starting salaries based on increased skills and experience, the temporary staff average will be higher. There are no temporary D1 staff and we do not hold average pay for hours worked for senior civil service staff as they do not work contracted hours.</p>

For historical reasons, these cars pay only &#163;210, while others that emit the same amount, but were purchased from April 2006, pay &#163;400. The Budget included policy to move them to the band appropriate to their emissions levels, but in order to reduce the additional tax paid by these cars in one individual year, it was decided at Budget 2008 that this would be staggered, so that&#151;rather than moving immediately to their correct band, paying &#163;415 or &#163;440 in 2009&#151;these cars would move to Band K in 2009, paying only &#163;300, before moving to their correct band in 2010, paying either &#163;430 or &#163;455 annually.</p>

It is estimated that in 2008-09 there would be around 1.1 million cars (about 3.8 per cent. of all cars) in Band F that were registered before 2006 and emit 226 g/km or more, but this figure would be expected to fall in future years.

 The latest information available to Government on the 30 most popular versions of car comes from commercial sales data purchased from JATO Dynamics Ltd. for 2007. JATO is a leading provider of data in the automotive intelligence field and has partnerships with a large number of motor manufacturers around the world. Sales data are obtained from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and JATO then match this to vehicle specifications (including official carbon dioxide figures) which are provided to them by manufacturers and importers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_500"><a name="80709w0022.htm_para1"><a name="08070975001288">The level of detail that they can provide is available only from a very small number of sources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_501"><a name="80709w0022.htm_para2"><a name="08070975001289">A table showing a list of the top 30 model versions, in order of popularity, alongside their average carbon dioxide emissions, and the potential impact of the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) reforms announced at Budget 2008 is as follows. This shows that&#151;in real terms&#151;at least 24 out of the 30 most popular car model versions in 2007 will be better off, or no worse off, in 2009 as a result of the reforms announced at Budget 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_502"><a name="80709w0022.htm_para3"><a name="08070975001290">It is worth noting that two versions of a very similar Vauxhall Corsa 1.2 litre unleaded appear in the figures. This is because JATO do not have a record of whether a normal or &#145;Easytronic&#146; transmission is used by this particular vehicle. Arguably, if this vehicle were counted separately, then there would in fact be 25 out of the top 30 cars that are no worse off; however the Government have assumed 24 out of 30.</p>

 I wrote to the Chief Minister of Montserrat on 12 June 2008 responding to his Government&#146;s request to join the Caribbean Community Single Market and Economy. Given the recognised internal capacity constraints in Montserrat, I explained that it would be more appropriate to focus on the key economic priorities identified in the new Montserrat Sustainable Development Plan, rather than prepare for the Caribbean Community Single Market and Economy. The Sustainable Development Plan is more likely to support Montserrat&#146;s aim of economic self-sufficiency. I suggested to the Chief Minister that the Government of Montserrat defer the question of accession for two years or until such time as levels of economic activity and capacity are sufficiently enhanced to enable Montserrat to be able to take full advantage of the benefits of membership. I also offered to discuss these issues in more detail with Chief Minister Lewis when he visits London for the Overseas Territories Consultative Council in October.</p>

 The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) visited the region in 2006 to gather information on the human rights situation. The OHCHR shared its report privately with Morocco, Algeria and the Polisario on 8 September 2006 but, in accordance with the terms of reference agreed between the parties, did not publish it. I understand the OHCHR maintains its decision not to make the report public, and the UK respects this decision.</p>

We are keen to see a resolution to the situation in Western Sahara. To this end, the UK fully supports the efforts of the UN Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, Peter Van Walsum, to assist the parties to achieve a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution which will provide for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. We support the process of UN-chaired negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario currently under way. Success in these negotiations depends upon building greater confidence between the parties. In this respect, the UK remains open to supporting UN human rights monitoring in Western Sahara if it can be shown to enhance rather than obstruct the mutual confidence of the parties.</p>

 There is no legal authority for a blanket freeze of all Zimbabwean assets in the UK but we are looking at a range of targeted options which impact on those specifically responsible for the crisis in Zimbabwe. This could include extending the existing EU targeted measures which have already frozen the bank accounts and prevented the travel to the EU of 131 named regime members.

 A number of UK energy companies are already owned by non-UK companies.

 The Department for Work and Pension took responsibility for Directgov in April 2008 and has put in place comprehensive leadership and management arrangements to deliver the expected business performance, this includes value for money. As part of Sir David Varney's review (December 2006), it was recommended that Directgov become the single digital channel for Government to provide information to the citizen from the whole of Government. The case is based on benefits to the public of joined up public services on line and savings to Departments through the reduction of websites across government and related economies of scale. This recommendation was accepted by all Departments and central funding provided by the Treasury for the SR07 period to enable the rationalisation and convergence of Government websites. The resultant programme for website rationalisation covers the CSR07 period and benefits will be monitored and assessed over this period.</p>

In practice this means that Directgov will be assessed throughout each year of the SR07 period as deemed necessary for the risks it faces. DWP also provisioned for independent reviews as part of the arrangements in place for Directgov and intends to carry out independent reviews of Directgov over the period of the SR07.

1. Proportions are rounded to one decimal place.<br>
2. Population figures are ONS experimental ward mid-year population estimates. The methodology used to produce these ward estimates is subject to further review, hence the estimates have been published as &#147;experimental statistics&#148; and are under evaluation. Percentages derived from them should be treated as indicative only.<br>
3. Working age population figures are defined as males aged 15-64 and females aged 15-59. Working age benefit claimant figures are defined as males aged 16-64 and females aged 16-59.<br>
4. Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards are used for 2001 Census outputs, they are based on administrative ward boundaries legally in force at the end of 2002, which includes ward boundaries that became operative in a number of local authorities in May 2003, and some others that become operative in May 2004. CAS wards are identical to the 2003 Statistical wards except that 18 of the smallest wards (all in England) have been merged into other wards to avoid the confidentiality risks of releasing data for very small areas. This has occurred to those wards with fewer than 100 residents or 40 households (as at the 2001 Census). Unlike statistical wards, CAS wards are not subject to boundary change over time. There are 7,969 CAS wards in England and 881 in Wales, a total of 8,850.<br>

 The most common and internationally recognised threshold to measure poverty is income below 60 per cent. of median. Specific information regarding low income for the UK is available in &#147;Households Below Average Income 1994/95 to 2006/07&#148;. This annual National Statistics publication includes the number and proportion of individuals, children, working age adults and pensioners with incomes below 50 per cent., 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median income, and the proportion in persistent poverty. Information covering 40 per cent. of median income is not a sound measure of poverty and is not included in the Households Below Average Income series. This is because households stating the lowest incomes to the Family Resources Survey may not actually have the lowest living standards. Many people who report very low incomes appear to have high spending. Hence, any statistics on numbers in this group may be misleading.</p>

In phase 2 (2006 to 2008) further centres were developed in all local authorities across England to cover communities where the majority of families live in the 30 per cent. most disadvantaged areas, as defined by Super Output Areas, as well as some areas outside the 30 per cent. most disadvantaged areas.

<i> [holding answer 7 July 2008]:</i> Total Government investment in the post-16 further education system has increased by 52 per cent. in real terms from 1997 to 2007. Over the next three years, Government investment in adult learning will increase by 17 per cent. reaching &#163;3.6 billion per year by 2010-11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_608"><a name="80709w0035.htm_para1"><a name="08070979002156">Our planned and continuing strategy is to realign funding from a high number of very short and low quality courses to qualifications such as Skills for Life, full level 2 and full level 3 that offer the greatest opportunity for adults to gain the skills for employability and further progression in learning. This includes a full range of first steps and progression programmes below level 2 progression programmes encouraging adults back into learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_609"><a name="80709w0035.htm_para2"><a name="08070979002157">But we understand that as well as increasing skills, education is also about meeting the basic human desire for intellectual stimulation. That is why we have safeguarded &#163;210 million each year through to 2010/11 to support informal adult learning. Through our recent consultation, we have led discussion on a new vision for informal adult learning for the 21st century.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills what the reasons are for using the retail price index to calculate interest due on student loans; and if he will consider the use of the consumer price index instead. [214778]</p>

 Parliament determined the interest rate to be paid on student loans. The principle is that borrowers should repay the same amount, in real terms, as they borrowed. To achieve this, the rate of interest is based upon the retail price index (RPI), although the precise method for determining the rate of interest varies depending on the type of loan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_617"><a name="80709w0036.htm_para4"><a name="08070979002304">The interest rate for older &#145;mortgage style&#146; (MS) loans is determined in accordance with the Education (Student Loans) Regulations 1998 which prescribe the rate of interest to be equal to the RPI so long as that index is published. This basis for calculating the interest rate is also set out in the MS Loan Consumer Credit Act agreements, the key terms of which cannot be altered retrospectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_618"><a name="80709w0036.htm_para5"><a name="08070979002305">From 1998/99, income contingent repayment (ICR) loans replaced MS loans for new borrowers. These are &#145;low interest loans&#146; exempt under section 16(5) (b) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Borrowers only repay when they earn more than &#163;15,000 a year, at an affordable rate of 9 per cent. of earnings above this threshold. Interest is calculated in accordance with the Education (Student Support) Regulations 2007, as amended, and is the lower of March&#146;s RPI or 1 per cent. above the highest of the base rates published by the banks listed in Regulation 4 of the Consumer Credit (Exempt Agreements) Order 1989.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_619"><a name="80709w0036.htm_para6"><a name="08070979002306">Accordingly, there is potential for the interest rates for the two types of loans to differ but, to date, the RPI rate has consistently applied to both types of loans since their inception.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_620"><a name="80709w0036.htm_para7"><a name="08070979002307">The Government have no plans to abandon the consistent use of RPI in calculating interest on student loans. There is no single measure of inflation that is appropriate for all purposes. RPI is an index that is still widely used as the basis for uprating a range of state benefits and entitlements. Over time, it is a measure of inflation which is fair, both to taxpayers, and to student loans borrowers. The cost of providing student loans is already heavily subsidised by the taxpayer, enabling the average interest rate on student loans, to date, to be below 3 per cent. per annum&#151;significantly lower than for commercial loans.</p>

 Sector compacts are a &#145;something for something&#146; deal between Government and employers to drive up the skills of the work force in each sector to ensure that our nation has the world class skills it needs to meet the challenges of the global economy. In return for some flexibility in, and enhancement to, the core Train to Gain offer, the employers in each sector commit to increasing their engagement with Train to Gain and their investment in the skills of their work force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_623"><a name="80709w0036.htm_para10"><a name="08070979002314">It is important to note that some of the commitments agreed in compacts, such as the cost of additional apprenticeship places, will not be funded through Train to Gain directly but will draw on other, existing budgets. Our aim is to agree compacts for every SSC sector that wants one, and who can deliver a significant increase in demand for skills from employers to ensure that we are addressing the nation&#146;s skills needs. We will also explore the potential for developing compacts with key partners around large cross-sector projects such as the London 2012 Olympics.</p>

 In April 2008 the Africa and Global Conflict Prevention Pools (the ACPP and GCPP) were merged to form a single combined Conflict Prevention Pool (CPP). The CPP is managed jointly by the Department for International Development (DFID), the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Ministry of Defence (MOD). Its budget is voted on separately by Parliament to support the Government's conflict prevention policy in line with the tri-departmental public service agreement (PSA) on conflict.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) strongly condemns the use of trafficked labour in the production of cocoa and other industries. However, we believe the best way to raise labour standards is through capacity building and co-operation, and encouragement of business and governments, rather than trying to impose restrictions on trade. Ultimately, it is for individual governments to set and enforce their own labour standards, to protect workers in their own countries and provide a &#145;level playing field&#146; for companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_633"><a name="80709w0037.htm_para1"><a name="08070979002416">DFID supports a range of initiatives to reduce the vulnerability of children to trafficking and to support fair and ethical supply chains for the chocolate and other industries. This includes promoting the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises which set down the employment standards that the Government expect UK companies to implement in their supply chains. It also includes supporting the Fairtrade Foundation and the Ethical Trading Initiative which requires its corporate members to adopt the ETI Base Code which includes not using child labour.</p>

 Over the last two years, Department for International Development (DFID) officials have attended key meetings of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and technical meetings with stakeholders and negotiating partners in the UK and internationally, to discuss Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD).</p>

The Prime Minister recently commissioned a review on financial mechanisms for reducing emissions from deforestation. We will consider how we can further support REDD activities in light of the findings.</p>
