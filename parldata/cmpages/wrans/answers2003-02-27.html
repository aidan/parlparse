 This Government are committed to achieving an even balance of men and women on boards of public bodies. Responsibility for making these appointments lies with individual Ministers supported by their Departments. Each Department sets out its target for increasing diversity in public appointments in "Public Bodies: Opening up Public Appointments 2002&#150;2005". The DTI is committed to between 45 and 55 per cent. of appointments made each year to be women.

<P>
<a name="30227w01.html_wqn4"><B> Bob Spink: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many embryos the Medical Research Council envisages requiring per year for its embryo stem cell bank; and what their planned budget is for the bank.  [97989]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The bank will store adult, foetal and embryonic stem cell lines derived by the research community in the UK and overseas. Such lines will be ethically sourced and quality controlled. Embryonic stem cells will be supplied to the bank from IVF embryos donated for research. The MRC does not know how many embryos will be so donated.
<P>

<a name="30227w01.html_para3">However, it is a condition of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority licence that all embryonic stem cell lines derived in the UK must be deposited in the bank. It will be a condition of MRC funding for stem cell research that adult, foetal and embryonic stem cell lines generated with such funding must be deposited in the bank. Other UK funders are likely to adopt the same terms and conditions. Deposition in, and access of lines from the UK bank will be overseen by the Steering Committee chaired by Lord Patel. Since the UK bank will provide standardised stem cell lines for research purposes, the need for individual research groups to derive their own stem cell lines will be reduced, thereby minimising the overall number of embryos used.
<P>

<a name="30227w01.html_para4">The UK stem cell bank is being funded at a level of &#163;2.6 million over three years. MRC will contribute 75 per cent., and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council 25 per cent. of these costs.

<a name="30227w01.html_wqn5"><B> Bob Spink: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much the MRC has spent on research using human embryos in each the past 20 years.  [97990]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The majority of the research on embryos supported by the Medical Research Council involves material collected from animal models; only a small number of projects involve human embryos. Human embryonic tissue is currently used in the study of developmental biology and research on the treatment of disease. MRC does not keep historical figures for spend on such research, but estimates that in the last financial year (2001&#150;02) it spent &#163;0.6 million on research involving or related to human embryos.

 In licensing civil aerodromes in the UK, the Civil Aviation Authority does not specify the type or number of aircraft that can operate from a particular aerodrome. Instead, it ensures that national and international operating and safety standards are complied with.

 On 21 October 2002 the Minister for Transport submitted an Explanatory Memorandum on the draft Regulation to both Houses of Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w03.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Rosindell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what events and programmes were arranged for previous anniversaries of the Coronation of Her Majesty the Queen in <i>(a)</i> 1978 and <i>(b)</i> other years.  [98832]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w03.html_spnew0"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 Any events to mark the Anniversary of the Coronation in 1978 and other years were arranged as part of The Queen's normal programme of engagements. Similarly, any events to mark the 50th Anniversary of the Coronation this year will be part of The Queen's programme arranged by Buckingham Palace.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what representations she has received regarding the decision by the British Horseracing Board to alter the charges levied on bookmakers relating to receiving pre-race data; and if she will make a statement.  [99548]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 We have so far received about a hundred letters on this matter. Decisions by the British Horseracing Board about charges to bookmakers for the use of its data are commercial matters as between the parties; and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on them.

<a name="30227w03.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Hospitality</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w03.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) what criteria Ministers in her Department use when determining whether to offer hospitality in restaurants to interest groups at public expense; and if she will make a statement;  [99508]
<P>
<UL>(2) what hospitality has been offered at public expense in the last 12 months, by each Minister in her Department to outside interest groups, broken down by <i>(a)</i> restaurant, <i>(b)</i> recipient and <i>(c)</i> cost in each case;  [99509]
<P>
(3) how often Ministers in her Department have received hospitality in restaurants from outside groups in the last 12 months.  [99584]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w03.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 All offers of hospitality are made in accordance with published departmental guidance on financial procedures and propriety, based on the principles set out in Government Accounting. The giving and receiving of hospitality is conducted fully in accordance with the guidance set out in the Ministerial Code, and Guidance on Contacts with Outside Interest Groups including Lobbyists. The detailed information requested is not held centrally, and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.

<a name="30227w03.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Sanders: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what her estimate is of the potential benefits to non-London tourist centres of holding the 2012 Olympics.  [97930]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w03.html_spnew3"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 The additional tourism benefits of the Olympics and Paralympics outside London and the South East have been estimated at between &#163;100 million 



<P>
<P><I>27 Feb 2003 : Column 652W</I><P>
and &#163;190 million, reflecting the expected increase in expenditure by overseas and domestic visitors during the period of both the Olympics and Paralympics.
<P>

<a name="30227w03.html_para0">The estimates do not include any wider or longer-term effects outside London that hosting an Olympics would have on inbound and domestic tourism. Nor have we sought to break down the estimate by individual region. However, as the BTA said in its recent submission to the CMS Select Committee, there can be little doubt that the staging of a successful Olympics would be beneficial in the longer-term for inbound tourism, providing an unparalleled opportunity to showcase the wider UK as well as London. This is a view that has been endorsed by a number of organisations, including Advantage West Midlands and the South West Regional Assembly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many people are employed <i>(a)</i> part-time and <i>(b)</i> full-time in the British tourism industry.  [99680]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w03.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Since the tourism sector is formed of parts of a diverse set of industries whose businesses serve both tourists and non-tourists, the number of jobs supported by tourism can only be estimated. The latest estimate of total employment in tourism-related industries in Great Britain is 2.2 million in June 2002, of which 1.1 million jobs were part-time.

<a name="30227w03.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Sanders: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what estimate she has made of expenditure on domestic tourism in 2002.  [99681]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w03.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Domestic tourism expenditure on trips with an overnight stay is estimated to have been 22.6 billion for January to October 2002. Data to the end of 2002 will be published in April 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w03.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Since November 2002 there has been a variety of contact between the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence about the Daedalus property.
<P>

<a name="30227w03.html_para3">The Home Office contacted Defence Estates in late November 2002 requesting details of sites that might be available for an inter-governmental transfer to the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="30227w03.html_para4">In December 2002, the Home Office requested information, together with a site plan, in regard to an area of the Daedalus property, which MOD were considering for potential future disposal. Home Office representatives visited the site on 22 January 2003 and subsequently indicated that a portion of the site was could be of interest to them. My Home Office colleague, Beverly Hughes MP, wrote to me on 10 February 2003 to say that the Daedalus site was potentially suitable for an asylum accommodation centre for up to 400 single men and that the Home Office intended to make an announcement to this effect on February 11.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence assesses the range of threats that the armed forces may face in conflict, including those from chemical weapons. The use of all chemical weapons is prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention, which entered into force in April 1997. The Convention also prohibits the use of riot control agents (i.e. temporarily disabling agents) as a method of warfare.

<i>[pursuant to his reply, 12 February 2003, Official Report, column 747W]:</i> I mistakenly referred to HMS Dreadnought as a Polaris submarine. She is, of course, a Dreadnought Class submarines and never carried Polaris missiles.

<a name="30227w04.html_para6">There has been no assessment made of the change in use of CHP by companies covered by climate change agreements. The agreements set targets for improvements in energy efficiency, which in some cases take account of the potential for CHP in the facility. In other cases, operators are required to make an assessment of the potential for CHP, which may result in a change to their targets. Operators are free to meet their targets in a range of ways.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w05.html_wqn0"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many sightings there have been since June 2001 purporting to be of big cats, broken down by county; what steps have been taken to investigate these; and on how many occasions it has been concluded that a big cat probably was present.  [99220]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Big cats, such as tigers, lions, cheetahs, leopards or puma, are not native to the UK and are not naturally found in the wild in this country. There are widespread and frequent reported possible sightings but, despite investigations, the Department is not aware of any confirmed instances of big cats of unknown origin being found out of captivity in England in the last 20 years. The lack of hard evidence (such as captured animals, corpses or photographs) is hard to reconcile with the number of reported sightings, unless people are genuinely but frequently mistaken with their identification.
<P>

<a name="30227w05.html_para0">The Department does investigate claims of big cat sightings where there is a potential risk to possible livestock predation. Where livestock deaths are involved and it is likely that hard evidence could be obtained to identify the predator, a field visit may be conducted. However, the Department does not systematically record all alleged sightings.
<P>

<a name="30227w05.html_para1">Since June 2001, the Department's Rural Development Service (RDS) have had 22 cases of alleged big cats reported to them connected to possible livestock predation and where there was potentially hard evidence to follow up. There have been two field visits in relation to these reports. The counties for these reports were: Buckinghamshire; Cornwall; Devon (three); Essex (three); Kent; Norfolk; North Somerset (two); North Yorkshire; Oxfordshire; Shropshire; Staffordshire; Suffolk; Surrey (two); Warwickshire; West Midlands; and Wiltshire. In many cases the details of the report provide insufficient circumstantial evidence to justify the expense of a field visit. However, should a field visit be deemed necessary, a trained wildlife biologist carries out detailed searches for various types of evidence such as examining the body in the field for evidence of how it had been killed or checking for footprints. In none of the field visits could any evidence be found to confirm the presence of big cats.
<P>

<a name="30227w05.html_para2">Release of big cats into the wild is prohibited under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and possession of these species is regulated under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976. If there is believed to be a public safety issue, for example from an escaped big cat, then this is a matter for the police.

 All public water supplies are tested for the most important minerals, namely calcium and magnesium and for 34 other chemicals or group of chemicals.

 <i>[holding answer 24 February 2003]:</i> The Government's Regulatory Reform Action Plan issued in February 2002 included 59 entries covering all aspects of Defra's responsibility. Many of these will be implemented over the next two years; others will be more long term. They involve changes to EC legislation, major reviews of whole areas of enforcement, inspection and information handling to ease the burden on farmers. We have already had some success, for example from April 2002 inspectors have been carrying out combined bovine risk analysis inspections required by the four IACS cattle schemes. We have introduced simpler rules for sheep producer groups making them easier to understand.
<P>

<a name="30227w05.html_para5">Some regulation of agriculture is unavoidable if Defra is to safeguard the environment, public and animal health and public funds. However, our goal is to keep regulation to the minimum and find ways of streamlining the bureaucratic burden that regulation often imposes. We have a long-term strategy (2007) to introduce risk-based environment regulation across all sectors including agriculture. New risk- assessments, standardised permits better reporting arrangements will keep charges down and reduce the bureaucracy of regulation.
<P>

<a name="30227w05.html_para6">We are working towards an integrated solution to the problems of regulation and agriculture by developing a whole farm approach. This is a strategy that will be developed in close consultation with industry and other stakeholders and will maximise the benefits of major investments in new IT systems, by bringing together all information held by Defra and other agencies . This will be available to farmers and growers for business

<P>

<a name="30227w06.html_para5">To encourage domestic energy savings and health initiatives:
<P>

<a name="30227w06.html_para6">We fund the Warm Front grant scheme which assisted over 400,000 households living in Fuel Poverty by installing energy efficiency measures. This indicates that the Government is making good progress toward meeting its target of assisting 600,000 homes by 2004.
<P>

<a name="30227w06.html_para7">The Government has established the Energy Efficiency Commitment. The Commitment requires electricity and gas suppliers to achieve targets for the promotion of improvements in energy efficiency, with an emphasis on helping lower income customers. The overall target on all suppliers is a combined saving of 62 fuel-standardised terawatt hours.

<P><I>27 Feb 2003 : Column 674W</I><P>
one of the lowest non-completion rates among OECD countries.
<P>

<a name="30227w07.html_para0">Up to date research, the UNITE/MORI "Student Living Report 2003", found that 96 per cent. of students consider that going to university is a worthwhile experience and that the major reason for drop out is dissatisfaction with the course rather than financial issues. 87 per cent. of students interviewed agreed that the money they were spending on higher education was a good investment in their future.
<P>

<a name="30227w07.html_para1">These findings on drop out are backed up by research commissioned by the Department "Dropping Out: A Study of Early Leavers from Higher Education" by Peter Elias and Rhys Davies at the Institute of Employment Research at Warwick University, published January 2003 that shows that the most common cause of non-completion was poor choice of course. Financial problems and personal problems were also cited by respondents to the survey. However, a relatively low response rate to the survey underpinning the research implies the quantitative results are only indicative.
<P>

<a name="30227w07.html_para2">The National Audit Office report "Improving Student Achievement in English Higher Education" published in January 2002 showed that students who drop out tend to have lower prior academic qualifications. Most of them cite personal reasons (feeling unprepared for higher education, changing personal circumstances or financial matters) or withdraw because of academic failure.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many universities and colleges in the English and Welsh higher education sector have operating deficits; and if he will make a statement.  [98504]<P>

<P>
<a name="30227w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Information about higher education institutions in Wales is for the Welsh Assembly to provide. The Higher Education Funding Council for England published 'Outcomes of 2002 financial forecasts and annual operating statements' in January 2003. This report is based on information provided by higher education institutions in July 2002. The forecasts were based on assumptions reflecting the prevailing general economic climate and the funding announcements made at the time and so do not take account of the Spending Review settlement for 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06. Projected levels of surplus are significantly affected by exceptional items, such as gains or losses on property transactions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will list those universities with over 20 per cent. of students expected to drop out of their courses without finishing their degrees, using the latest figures compiled by the Higher Education Funding Council; if he will estimate the cost to public funds for each student; what initiative he is taking to reduce drop outs; and if he will make a statement.  [90465]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The latest information is shown in the table. The cost to the Exchequer of students who drop out from UK universities depends on factors such as the timing of drop outs within academic years, the level of public funding associated with individual courses, whether or not students transfer to other HE institutions and whether or not students return to HE at a later date. Figures for the cost are not compiled centrally.
<P>

<a name="30227w07.html_para6">The UK has one of the best completion rates in the world. The latest Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) Performance Indicators (Pis) put the national rate of non-completion at 17 per cent. This rate has stayed broadly the same since 1991&#150;92, a period of considerable expansion of student numbers. But there is room for improvement. That is why we have asked HEFCE to "bear down" on non-completion, in particular by identifying examples of good practice in student retention and disseminating them across the sector; by working more closely with those institutions whose performance indicator for non-completion fails to meet expectations; and by working with the Department in establishing a sector target for non-completion.

 As I said in my answer to the hon. Member on 10 February over 95 per cent. of pupils currently undertake work experience placements in their last years of compulsory schooling, and we want all pupils to benefit from high quality placements. A range of guidance and support is already provided by the Department, the Learning and Skills Council and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. This seeks to ensure that placements are safe, well structured, integrated into the curriculum and suited to the needs of the individual, with activities and outcomes captured within pupils' records of achievement.
<P>

<a name="30227w08.html_para1">We also intend to make work-related learning a statutory requirement for all pupils at Key 4 from 2004&#150;05. We have asked the QCA for further advice on work-related learning as part of their overall advice on Key Stage 4 curriculum change. While delivery will vary according to pupils' needs and circumstances, integrating work experience more closely into the curriculum will be one of the means by which this requirement may be fulfilled. In many cases the experience will be distinct and practical, providing opportunities for assignments and project work that will contribute directly to qualifications such as the new GCSEs in vocational subjects or NVQs.

 I take it that the hon. Gentleman is referring to tax credits paid on dividends received by investors.
<P>

<a name="30227w10.html_para1">When we announced the changes to dividend tax credits in July 1997 we estimated that they would increase revenue by amounts of &#163;2.3 billion in 1997&#150;98, &#163;3.95 billion in 1998&#150;99, and around &#163;51.5 billion each year thereafter.
<P>

<a name="30227w10.html_para2">But it is misleading to look at these figures in isolation. The abolition of payable tax credits was part of a wider package of CT reform that reduced rates of corporation tax and encourages re-investment of profits for growth. These reforms will have partly offset the effects of changes to tax credits.

 Proposals for the Child Trust Fund (CTF) were first published in April 2001 in the consultation document, Saving and Assets for All. A follow up consultation document, Delivering Saving and Assets, which asked specific questions about the delivery model for the CTF, was published in November 2001. The result of this consultation was published in the 2002 Pre-Budget Report. As part of the consultation launched on 5 February 2003 on the product specifications for the 'stakeholder' products recommended by the Sandier review, the Government is seeking views on whether explicitly linking the CTF to the other products in the Sandier suite would be helpful.

 There have been no recorded instances of amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) in humans in the United Kingdom due to the consumption of scallops.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w14.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 In April 2002, at the time of launch of Yasmin, a combined oral contraceptive authorised in the European Mutual Recognition procedure in June 2000, the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) identified advertising for the product through its routine monitoring of published advertising materials. The company&#151;Schering Health Care Limited&#151;was asked to provide the references quoted in the advertising material. At this stage, the evidence in the references was not examined as closely as it would have been, and subsequently was, in the event of a complaint from a health care professional from the perspective of the clinical usage of the product.
<P>

<a name="30227w14.html_para10">Following specific complaints from health professionals in August and September 2002, the MCA conducted an assessment of the claims made in advertising for Yasmin and concluded that the quality and extent of the evidence provided was not sufficiently robust to support the claims made and that the Yasmin advertising was in fact misleading. The MCA requested that the company, Schering Health Care Limited, withdraw the material and it did so in October 2002.
<P>

<a name="30227w14.html_para11">The company was subsequently required to submit all its advertising for Yasmin to the MCA for review prior to publication. The MCA has also required Schering Health Care Limited to issue a corrective statement concerning advertising for Yasmin. This will be sent to health professionals who received previous advertising material from 21 February 2003 and also published in all medical journals where previous advertisements had appeared.
<P>

<a name="30227w14.html_para12">The Agency makes an assessment of the safety, quality and efficacy of applications for a marketing authorisation. The data assessed in the Yasmin application included efficacy studies versus other licensed oral contraceptives as comparators. However, the comparative benefits of a particular product in relation to other products are not relevant to the Licensing Authority decision under the terms of the Medicines Act 1968, so long as there is acceptable evidence of efficacy.

<a name="30227w14.html_para13">The control of medicines advertising in the United Kingdom is based on a long established system of self-regulation, underpinned by statutory powers administered by the MCA under the Medicines (Advertising) Regulations 1994 and the Medicines (Monitoring of Advertising) Regulations 1994. The MCA undertakes a range of duties, set out in a published guidance note, to ensure that claims for the benefits of medicines in advertising comply with the statutory requirements. These include preventing of advertising prior to publication in certain circumstances, monitoring of medicines advertising in medical and other journals and investigation of complaints about advertising from any source, including health professionals and the public.

 In addition to undertaking a tender procurement exercise to set up a national health service e-recruitment project, the Department of Health is launching the 2003 national recruitment campaign for the NHS in February. The purpose of the national campaign is to provide a national brand for the NHS that is flexible and can be adapted at a local level to increase the impact of local recruitment activities.
<P>

<a name="30227w15.html_para2">I am advised that at local level within Hampshire & Isle of Wight, recruitment initiatives are also on going. These include; restructuring recruitment functions to form specialist teams working on long term and short term needs, implementation of a recruitment and retention strategy group, local and national advertisements, targeted advertisements in RGN student handbook, RCN Bulletin, and Nursing Times, roadshows, events in the hospitals, and other promotional events.
<P>

<a name="30227w15.html_para3">The Portsmouth City Primary Care Trust has recently launched its own website, which includes a job shop page advertising all vacancies including qualified nurses and there are a limited number of secondment opportunities to Southampton University to undertake qualified nurse training in adult mental health.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w15.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 During the six months April to September 2002, the net ingredient cost of the hormonal contraceptive pills Yasmin and Marvelon prescribed and dispensed in the community in England was &#163;786,400 and &#163;1.71 million respectively. The number of prescription items of Yasmin and Marvelon that were dispensed in the community over this time was 44,800 and 162,300 respectively.

<P>

<a name="30227w15.html_para4">Net ingredient cost refers to the cost, which the dispenser is reimbursed, of the drug before discounts and does not include any dispensing costs or fees. Data have been provided from the prescription cost analysis (PCA) system and data to September 2002 are the latest available. PCA does not cover items dispensed in hospitals or private prescriptions. PCA only covers drugs that are on a prescription. Therefore contraceptive pills dispensed in family planning clinics are not included in these data.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will ban the use of tissue from aborted foetuses in research for Parkinson's disease; and what assessment he has made of the side-effects caused to patients by its use in research.  [97986]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w15.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 There are no plans to ban the use of foetal tissue in therapeutic research programmes. In accordance with the Polkinghorne guidelines research ethics committees need to examine all such proposals. Research or innovative therapy involving foetal tissue must be assessed on the merit of the individual proposal and the ethical issues involved. Any adverse effects observed would need to be reported through the appropriate systems in accordance with the Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care (2001).

<P>
<a name="30227w15.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We recognise and are sympathetic to the problems experienced by people who have Pompe's disease, and understand the difficulties and distress caused for them and their families. Current treatment consists of symptomatic management of cardiac and respiratory failure, provided through mainstream health services. We are aware that some trials are taking place overseas of the effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy with a view to producing specialist effective therapy over the next few years.
<P>

<a name="30227w15.html_para5">The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry. The MRC is not currently funding any treatment trials into Pompe's Disease. However, the MRC always welcomes high quality applications for research into any aspect of human health and these are judged in open competition with other demands in funding. Awards are made according to their scientific quality and importance to human health. As a rule, the MRC does not earmark funds for particular topics.

 Rohypnol, the proprietary name for the substance flunitrazepam, is one of the benzodiazepine family of drugs, and is controlled as a Class 'C' drug. There are no plans to reclassify it. Rohypnol has not been dispensed in the community in England since 1985.

The study addressed current deficits and the vision for primary and community care looked at how many general practitioner surgeries would be needed over the growth period. "Ashford's Future The Overarching Report", published December 2002, included an indication of the number of primary care centres that would be required, phased over time.

 The average number of offenders on supervision per probation officer as at 31 December 2001 was 40.7. However, staff other than probation officers are involved with the supervision of offenders, chiefly probation service officers. The average number of offenders on supervision per probation officer and probation service officer grades combined was 27.0 as at 31 December 2001.

 The Department for Work and Pensions came into being on 1April 2001. Consequently there are no comparable figures prior to this date. The final actual expenditure for 2002&#150;03 has yet to be confirmed and therefore a comparison with actual expenditure for 2001&#150;02 or planned expenditure for 2003&#150;04 cannot be made. The current expenditure plans of the Department for Work and Pensions are contained in Tables 1&#150;11 of the Departmental Report: The Government expenditure plans 2002&#150;03 to 2003&#150;04, Command 5424.

<P>
<a name="30227w17.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We recognise that many people making a claim to benefit will be in need of immediate financial support. To avoid unnecessary hardship, discretionary payments on account of benefit (interim payments) can be made where a claim has not been determined but the decision maker is satisfied that the basic conditions of entitlement for the benefit are likely to be met. The amount of any interim payment is automatically recoverable from the main benefit when it is awarded.
<P>

<a name="30227w17.html_para0">Crisis Loan alignment payments can be made to people awaiting their first payment of benefit which is paid in arrears, or their first payment of wages. Crisis Loans made to people awaiting benefit payments will cover their needs until their first benefit pay-day, following which full or interim payments of benefit can be made. In the main, these payments are made to people of working age (as pensioners are generally paid in advance). Information is not collected separately on the number or value of alignment payments made to people awaiting a first payment of benefit.
<P>

<a name="30227w17.html_para1">The available information is in the table. The figures show the total number and value of Crisis Loan alignment payments made, including those made to people awaiting payment of their first wage.

The number of council houses which failed to meet the decent standard fell from 1.9 million in 1996 to 1.2 million in 2001. Around half of this reduction resulted from transfers to housing associations, where extensive improvement programmes will have been agreed as part of the transfer, Right to Buy sales and demolitions.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what account he took of the High Court decisions in the cases of R v Islington LBC ex parte Reilly and Maunix (1998) and R v Westminster CC ex parte Al-Khorshan (1999) in drawing up his code of guidance on allocation of accommodation; and if he will make a statement on the balance between his encouragement of choice-based lettings and the legal requirement to give preference to those identified as having urgent housing needs.  [98382]




<P>
<P><I>27 Feb 2003 : Column 718W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 A new Code of Guidance on the Allocation of Accommodation, revised to take account of the changes to Part 6 of the Housing Act 1996 contained in the Homelessness Act 2002, was issued in November 2002.
<P>

<a name="30227w19.html_para0">The new Code takes account of the Court of Appeal judgment in the conjoined cases of R (on the application of A) v Lambeth London Borough Council and R (on the application of Lindsay) v Lambeth London Borough Council on 23 July 2002 which upheld the High Court decisions in R v Islington LBC, ex parte Reilly and Mannix (1998) and R v Westminster, ex parte Al-Khorsan (1999). The covering letter which was sent with the Code to all housing authorities and other interested parties specifically mentioned the Court of Appeal judgment. It is for housing authorities to take account of the implications of the judgment for their allocation schemes, and to take account of the Secretary of State's guidance in the Code.
<P>

<a name="30227w19.html_para1">The revised Code provides (at paragraph 5.9) that, in framing their allocation scheme so as to secure that reasonable preference is given to certain categories of persons, housing authorities must have regard to the fact that the reasonable preference categories should not be treated in isolation from one another; and must provide a mechanism for identifying applicants who qualify under more than one category and for taking this into account in assessing their housing need.
<P>

<a name="30227w19.html_para2">The Government believe that all housing authorities should adopt more choice-based, customer-focussed, lettings policies, while continuing to meet housing need. This is the best way to ensure sustainable tenancies and to build settled and stable communities. We believe that there is sufficient flexibility within the existing statutory framework to enable housing authorities to offer applicants a choice of accommodation and to ensure that reasonable preference is given to those with the most urgent housing need.
<P>

<a name="30227w19.html_para3">The Code advises (at paragraph 5.11) that, when considering how to reconcile choice and housing need, housing authorities should consider adopting a simplified system of applicant prioritisation in place of a complex points-based approach. An appropriate approach might include systems that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) "band" applicants into a number of groups reflecting different levels of housing need, with prioritisation of applicants within these groups being determined by waiting time, and/or
<P>
<BR>
(b) give people in the most urgent housing need priority over other applicants (often by using a time-limited "priority card").
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30227w19.html_para4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be providing more detailed good practice guidance on this issue towards the end of this year, once the funded choice based lettings pilot scheme has been properly evaluated.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no general plans for land ownership reform and have held no such discussions, although the Lord Chancellor's Department is currently considering recommendations by the Law Commission for the abolition of remnants of the feudal system in land law.

<a name="30227w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Market renewal pathfinders are developing schemes to recreate sustainable communities in their areas, requiring long-term commitment from them and Government. Recognising that the problems differ in each area and that the solutions must also, it is intended that funding for the low demand pathfinder projects will be determined by negotiation with each project. Funding will be subject to the quality of plans and to subsequent performance. Independent Scrutiny by the Audit Commission will act as a check on value for money.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the rate of staff <i>(a)</i> absenteeism and <i>(b)</i> sickness was in his Department, its predecessors and each of its agencies and non-departmental public bodies in each year from 1990&#150;91 to 2002&#150;03; what the target set is for his Department; and if he will make a statement.  [93506]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was established following machinery of Government changes in May 2002.
<P>

<a name="30227w20.html_para3">In respect of sickness absence, the most recent 'Analysis of Sickness Absence in the Civil service' was published by the Cabinet Office and announced by Ministerial Statement on 19 December 2002. This is available in House Libraries. This covered the calendar year 2001 for the Cabinet Office, the predecessor Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions and its executive agencies. Previous reports go back to 1996. Figures for 2002 will be announced in due course.
<P>

<a name="30227w20.html_para4">The executive non departmental public bodies are not staffed by civil servants, and the sickness absence rates for those are not collected centrally. All cases of absence are taken up and dealt with by line management. Separate information on absenteeism is not readily available. The Office will set a target for reducing sickness absence in the context of its current business planning round.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will identify those elements of the resources listed in Annex A of the paper, Sustainable Communities, that

<P><I>27 Feb 2003 : Column 724W</I><P>
will provide funding for investment in <i>(a)</i> repairs and improvements to council housing, <i>(b)</i> repairs and improvements to housing owned by registered social landlords and <i>(c)</i> the provision of new homes for rent.  [98159]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 From 2004&#150;05 resources that were provided to local authorities for their Housing Investment Programme, and resources provided to the Housing Corporation will be put into a single regional housing pot. Final decisions on the allocation of resources will be made based on advice from the new Regional Housing Boards (RHBs).
<P>

<a name="30227w20.html_para5">The figures shown are those we used in building up the totals and may not be the final figures.
<P>

<a name="30227w20.html_para6"><i>(a) Money for improvements to Council housing includes:</i>
<P>

<a name="30227w20.html_para7">(i) The funding shown in the third line of the table for Arms Length Management Organisations (&#163;1,994 million over the next three years);
<P>

<a name="30227w20.html_para8">(ii) A share of the housing investment programme (HIP) money that forms part of the totals in the first two lines of the table. In 2003&#150;04 HIP amounts to &#163;842 million. Only a proportion of this will be used to support improvements to Council housing. HIP is also used to fund improvements to private housing, and provision of new affordable housing. HIP resources go into the local authority single capital pot for use at the discretion of the LA. But on past trends about one third of HIP funding will be used to support council housing improvements. From 2004&#150;05 this funding becomes part of the single regional housing pot.
<P>

<a name="30227w20.html_para9">(iii) In addition &#163;685 million of new PFI credits were announced in Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future. These are not included in the funds shown in Annex A.
<P>

<a name="30227w20.html_para10">(iv) The Major Repairs Allowance was introduced in 2001 and gives local authorities the funding required to maintain the condition of their stock. This is provided through the housing revenue account and does not appear in the figures in Annex A. It will total over &#163;4 billion over the next three years.
<P>

<a name="30227w20.html_para11"><i>(b) Funding for improvements to RSL housing</i>
<P>

<a name="30227w20.html_para12">RSLs fund the vast majority of their repairs and improvements from rental income or by borrowing privately. But the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme provides for some &#163;40 million next year to fund improvements. This funding will be included in the single regional housing pot from 2004&#150;05.
<P>

<a name="30227w20.html_para13"><i>(c) Funding for new homes to rent</i>
<P>

<a name="30227w20.html_para14">The single regional housing pots shown in the first two lines of the table in Annex A include funding for the Housing Corporation for new affordable homes. In addition some of the HIP resources, and some of the funding in the transitional arrangements line, will be used for the provision of affordable homes by RSLs. In total we are providing some &#163;5 billion over the next three years for affordable housing, though the precise figure allocated will depend on advice from the RHBs.




<P>

<P>

<a name="30227w20.html_para15">Not all of this funding will support homes to rent&#151;some will support low cost home ownership. Again the precise split will be subject to advice from the RHBs, but the majority will be invested in homes to rent.

 There is no target for transferring council housing to registered social landlords. The December 2000 housing policy statement, "Quality and Choice: The way forward for housing", said that the Government was willing to support the transfer of up to 200,000 homes annually in the period 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04, where a local authority selects the transfer option and has the support of tenants. The number of homes transferring over the last 5 financial years is set out in the table below:

<a name="30227w21.html_para2">* Between 1997 and 2000 the duration of each transfer programme was one year. This period was extended to 2 years from 2001. Therefore the final total for the 2001 programme is expected to be 186,777 which comprises 35,390 dwellings which transferred in 2001&#150;02, 86,387 transferred to date in 2002&#150;03, and a further 65,000 that are due to transfer by 31 March 2003.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what contribution the &#163;800 million set aside for 2003&#150;04 to finance stock transfer by writing of overhanging debt makes to the most deprived local authority areas.  [99060]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30227w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Government's target is to make all social housing decent by 2010, including that in the most deprived local authority areas. Housing transfer is one route by which this can be achieved. Payments to meet local authorities' overhanging debt are made where the value of the housing stock transferring is less than a local authority's associated housing debt.
