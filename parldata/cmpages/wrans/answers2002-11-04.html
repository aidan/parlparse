<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on how he intends to implement the EU Biofuel Directive.  [72936]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Negotiations on the precise drafting of the Biofuels Directive are currently underway and the final form of the Directive has still to be agreed. Negotiations so far indicate it is likely that the key measure in the final version will be a requirement for member states to set indicative targets for 2005 and 2010 for the use of biofuels in transport. Transposition into UK law is likely to be via Regulations under the European Communities Act 1972.

<P>
<a name="21104w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Rosindell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how he is ensuring improvements in off-peak frequency of bus services.  [79080]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Around 82 per cent. of bus services outside London are provided commercially and it is for the operators of those services to decide upon appropriate frequencies. Local authorities have powers to subsidise enhanced services outside peak hours.
<P>

<a name="21104w01.html_para1">For rural areas local authorities can use their allocations from the Government's Rural Bus Subsidy Grant (RBSG) to fund off-peak services. RBSG allocations total #47.5 million in 2002&#150;03, rising to #48.5 million in 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="21104w01.html_para2">In London, where local transport is the responsibility of the Mayor, most routes now operate seven days a week and are sufficiently frequent throughout the day to allow passengers to use the network on a "turn-up-and-go" basis. Routes operating at low frequency are regularly reviewed to see whether higher frequencies are worthwhile.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what recent advice he has given to the <i>(a)</i> SRA and <i>(b)</i> planning authorities concerning the safeguarding of disused railway track beds.  [79086]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Directions and Guidance the Secretary of State has issued to the Strategic Rail Authority require the Authority, when considering the disposal of land (including disused trackbeds), to have regard to the sites' transport potential and to avoid taking a short-term view. The Authority should look to the rail industry and local authorities to acquire sites with rail potential, but if these bodies do not purchase sites the Authority should consider whether they should be retained for rail use at a later date. The XPlanning Policy Guidance Note 13: Transport", issued to Local Planning Authorities, states that local authorities should identify, and protect sites and routes, both existing and potential, which could be critical in developing infrastructure for the movement of freight.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority has undertaken to contribute around half of the #7.5 million cost of fixed security installations at the Fr&#233;thun freight yard, by means of a freight facilities grant. The contribution is subject to the provision of project and budgetary information (which has now been received), confirmation of completion of works and an independent verification of the works by UK security experts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many planning authorities have included <i>(a)</i> new and <i>(b)</i> re-opened railways in their local transport plans in the last two years.  [79088]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Full information is not readily available in the form requested. However, in the five-year Local Transport Plans (LTPs) submitted in July 2000, and subsequent Annual Progress Reports on these, 12 local transport authorities in England outside London have included proposals for 16 rail-related major local transport schemes. Proposals are not categorised by whether they contain new or re-opened railways. In addition, all LTPs contain strategies which take account of the contribution rail can make towards their objectives.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport for what reason the southbound carriageway of the M1 motorway was closed on 6 October; and who authorised the closure.  [79134]




<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 On 6 October the southbound carriageway of the Ml in the area of Junction 21 had to be closed as a result of a fire in an outbuilding of a local farm, where gas cylinders containing potentially explosive gases were stored. Following consultation between Leicester County Fire Brigade and the Health and Safety Executive, a 200-metre exclusion zone was requested around the farm including a section of the motorway. Leicestershire police therefore closed the motorway until the risk of explosion had passed.

<P>
<a name="21104w02.html_wqn2"><B> Linda Perham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what obligations there are on public transport providers to provide access for passengers with disabilities.  [79052]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Part V of the Disability Discrimination Act gives the Secretary of State powers to introduce regulations requiring public transport to be accessible to disabled people, including those who need to travel in a wheelchair. Under these regulations all new trains (including light rail and underground) which have come into service since January 1999 have been required to meet comprehensive accessibility standards. Similar regulations have applied since January 2000 to all new buses with a capacity of over 22 passengers used on local or scheduled service. Some requirements to help ambulant disabled people and those with visual impairment use coaches and smaller buses have also been introduced but full wheelchair access will not be required for these vehicles until January 2005 because of the technical and operational challenges that remain. Regulations, which came into force on 1 October this year, also place obligations on bus drivers and conductors to assist disabled passengers.
<P>

<a name="21104w02.html_para0">Transport infrastructure, including bus and railway stations is covered by Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act which has placed duties on service providers since October 1999 to amend policies or practices which discriminate against disabled people. From October 2004 these duties will extend to the removal of physical barriers to access.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 It is not possible to give a generalised figure. The cost would depend on location, planned usage, the condition of existing or provision of new infrastructure, and a host of other factors. A meaningful cost estimate could only be made on a case by case basis, and would be unlikely to be best expressed as a 'cost per week'.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Proposals for a fifth motor insurance directive are at an early stage. It is not clear that a presumption of guilt on the part of the motorist is intended. The proposal states that there is no intention to 'prejudice the civil liability of the pedestrian or cyclist or the level of award for damages in a specific accident, under national legislation'.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what role she proposes for English regional assemblies in the governance of fisheries out to 12 nautical miles from the baseline.  [77644]<P>

<a name="21104w02.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 None. The powers and functions of elected regional assemblies are fully set out in the regional governance White Paper XYour Region, Your Choice" (Cm 5511). These proposals have no implications for the governance of fisheries either within or outside 12 nautical miles from the baseline.

 There are already detailed requirements governing the religious slaughter of animals and birds laid down in Schedule 12 of the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 (as amended). Although we are currently in the process of making some further amendments to the regulations, none of these changes are to Schedule 12. However we are in the process of producing draft Codes of Practice on the slaughter of animals and poultry, including religious slaughter, with the aim of improving the welfare of animals and birds at slaughter. In addition, the Farm Animal Welfare Council (the Government's advisory body on farmed animal welfare matters) is currently preparing a report on the welfare of farmed livestock (red meat animals) at slaughter, including livestock slaughtered by religious methods.

 The document entitled "Directing the Flow&#151;priorities for future water policy" will be published on 5 November.

The document takes the first steps towards setting out our strategic aims and summarising our proposed future priorities and direction for the water environment, water resources and water management. It aims to take a long-term view, looking at the next 20 years and beyond and setting the context within which specific actions will need to be taken. Copies of the document will be deposited in the House Libraries and will also be available on DEFRA's internet site (www.defra.gov.uk/environment/water/index.htm).

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The only comprehensive information about current job vacancies analysed by industry is the new monthly enterprise-based ONS Vacancy Survey, which at this stage is being published on an experimental basis. According to this survey there were 21,400 job vacancies in the construction industry on average for the period July to September 2002 for the United Kingdom as a whole. The design of the sample survey means it is not presently possible to provide regional analysis of vacancies on a reliable basis.</FONT></UL>

: <i>The</i> Department supports the provision of free and paid for milk in schools and encourages schools and LEAs to offer it to pupils. Following a 20 percent reduction of the EU subsidy on school milk from January 2001, this Department jointly agreed with the Department of Health and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to top up the 1.5m shortfall. This helped to prevent possible increased costs of school milk provision. This Department does not collect statistics on school milk provision.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what percentage of funding is distributed under the AEN for<i> (a)</i> deprivation, <i>(b)</i> ethnicity and <i>(c)</i> area cost adjustment; what criteria are used to access the need for increased funding for ethnicity in secondary and primary schools; and what plans she has to reduce the funding gap between schools.  [76274]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Under the current system of education standard spending assessments, 19 per cent. of funding is distributed according to additional educational needs, of which 17 per cent. is for deprivation and 2 per cent. is related to ethnicity (as measured by country of birth data taken from the 1991 national census). A further 4 per cent. is distributed through the area cost adjustment. The level of extra funding for ethnicity in the current system is determined by analysis of the spending patterns of local authorities from 1990&#150;91. In the new system of education funding assessments, which will be introduced for 2003&#150;04, the level of extra funding for additional educational needs will be decided on the basis of evidence about pupil characteristics and cost of provision. This will determine the distribution of funding between authorities and will be announced with the local authority finance settlement by early December.

 Colleges in the further education (FE) sector, including sixth form colleges, are independent corporations with their own pay arrangements. Colleges agree annual pay rises and conditions of employment with their staff in the context of local priorities and the overall resources available to them. There is a nationally recommended pay increase agreed by the employers' representative bodies and the unions but pay arrangements in the sector are diverse, reflecting colleges' local flexibility. Government have no plans to change this arrangement.
<P>

<a name="21104w05.html_para0">Extra resources have been made available to the FE sector. This year, #4.4 billion has been allocated to FE, an increase of #1.2 billion in five years. Within this, there is #142 million available for the Teaching Pay Initiative,

<P>

<a name="21104w07.html_para1">The main cause of low coffee prices is oversupply, with production far exceeding consumption.

<a name="21104w07.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 30 October 2002]:</i> The current situation of historically low coffee prices is having a significant effect on the livelihoods of very large numbers of coffee producers (who are predominantly smallholders) and those working in related industries and services. The income that people derive from the production and sale of commodities like coffee is influenced by a number of market (price, quality requirements) and non-market (pests and disease, weather etc.) factors. Low prices also have substantial macro-economic effects in terms of foreign exchange earnings, income to the exchequer and hence on debt repayment. Many of the poorest countries, particularly in Africa, remain dependent on a narrow range of commodity exports of which coffee is but one example.
<P>

<a name="21104w07.html_para2">The UK, through its development programme and by working at international level, supports programmes that seek to expand the trade opportunities for poor countries and improve the economic, social, environmental and political framework within which commodity-dependent people derive a livelihood. Diversification, both horizontal (into other economic activities or crops) and vertical (greater participation in value-adding activities within the coffee value chain such as processing) forms an important element of this broader approach.
<P>

<a name="21104w07.html_para3">In many countries we are assisting governments to develop poverty reduction strategies that address the needs of poor producers, taking into account commodity dependence. Ghana, Tanzania and Uganda are examples. We also support capacity building of individuals and producer organisations to better enable them to explore alternative markets and options and engage in the supply chain.
<P>

<a name="21104w07.html_para4">DFID provides support to producers and producer groups to meet the growing range of quality (eg food safety) and performance criteria (eg environmental; social) that increasingly characterise developed country market requirements. We also fund research on smaller producers (eg integrated pest management, germplasm quality, post-harvest management) that aims to provide effective and low-cost solutions for those seeking to diversify both vertically and horizontally.
<P>

<a name="21104w07.html_para5">DFID is also working hard to ensure that pressure is maintained for pro-poor trade reform (including CAP reform)&#151;to ensure that any diversification efforts by poor coffee producers in developing countries are not undermined by unfair trade arrangements. We are also, with other Whitehall Departments, working to ensure that the Common Fund for Commodities is more poverty focused.

 To date UK assistance to DRC has focused on humanitarian and peace building assistance provided through the UN and international NGOs. We have had no direct Government-to-Government assistance programme. However once an inclusive transitional Government has been agreed, the UK will be willing to consider providing direct assistance to the Government of DRC. In the short term we are considering options for Quick start initiatives to demonstrate to the people of DRC the benefits of peace. In the medium term we plan to provide assistance in a number of sectors where we believe we can best add value such as disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) and support to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process. We will also continue our humanitarian and peace building activities, and will support re-engagement in the DRC by the international financial institutions (IFIs).

 Libya is an Upper Middle Income Country with an annual GDP per capita of $7,570 (UN Human Development Report 2001).

The FCO's assessment is that Libya's record on human rights is not good, but there are recent signs of improvement (including the release of remaining political prisoners), and Libya is expected to continue to show a commitment to improving its human rights record during its period as chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights.

 Malawi is currently eligible for interim debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) Initiative amounting to some US$91.4 million in total. Relief in 2001 was about $27 million and is estimated at about $50 million (including Japan) for 2002. This relief should be used for increased spending on health, education, and other social priorities. Subject to satisfactory performance, Malawi is scheduled to reach its HIPC Completion Point in the second half of 2003.

 Poor people are particularly vulnerable both to crime and to weaknesses in the justice system. We believe that justice sector reform needs to be a key part of poverty reduction strategies in many countries. Justice programmes supported by my Department in SADC countries aim to promote respect for human rights, both through training, and through strengthening the accountability of the justice sector. Through such programmes we seek to encourage the integration of human rights principles into the training programmes of police services and other professionals in the justice sector.

 The Chief Fire Officer of Somerset Fire Brigade sent a short e-mail to officials at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on 20 September, in which he expressed the view that strike action at two retained stations in Somerset would potentially leave a significant number of road traffic accidents uncovered.
<P>

<a name="21104w11.html_para2">Emergency cover in Somerset, as for the rest of the country, will consist of a number of elements including Green Goddesses, breathing apparatus teams (BARTs), a rescue team equipped with specialist equipment (REST) and the police. The BARTs and RESTs carry basic cutting and other rescue equipment, and have been trained to respond to road traffic accidents.
<P>

<a name="21104w11.html_para3">The provision of MOD emergency cover has been planned in consultation with Chief Fire Officers to maximise the effectiveness of call-outs and the availability of a range of firefighting capabilities.

 Professional and retained firefighters who are on duty during any FBU industrial action will be fully covered by the standard insurance, death and pension benefits as normal. Members of the armed forces will benefit from the same cover and support as is provided for any operational duty. Police officers are afforded protection in the event of injury while on duty by the provisions of the Police Pension Regulations in the case of death or permanent disablement. In the event of temporary disablement the arrangements for contractual sick pay would safeguard the officer from immediate financial loss.

 We will announce the new system for distributing Formula Grant, including detailed grant allocations for individual authorities, at the time of the provisional local government finance settlement which we expect to be around the start of December. Once the Government has allocated its grant, decisions about budgets and services are primarily for local councils to make.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister commissioned research into the impact of sparsity, dispersal and settlement patterns as part of the work on the Environmental, Protective & Cultural Services block. In addition other Government departments have undertaken such research covering the services for which they are primarilyresponsible. Officials have also discussed sparsity issues with local government colleagues over the past 18 months in technical groups covering all service blocks. This informed the options put forward in the Formula Grant Review consultation document. We are currently taking decisions on the new system to be implemented following that consultation, and in doing so are considering carefully all of the evidence, pressures and representations that we received, including those from rural areas.

<a name="21104w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Armed Forces have been particularly busy over the last few years performing their primary duties in defence of United Kingdom interests and acting as a force for good. The deployment to provide emergency fire cover will inevitably impact on their ability to continue some of these tasks at the same level of effort. The longer service personnel are required to provide fire cover the greater the penalties that will accrue to other activities, and in particular on the Armed Forces personnel employed on these duties in place of professional firefighters.

<a name="21104w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 As announced by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Defence Procurement, Lord Bach, on 30 September, it has been decided to purchase up to 150 short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) versions of the Lockheed Martin F35s to meet the future joint combat aircraft (FJCA) requirement for the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. These aircraft, which are due to enter service in 2012 with the first unit of a new class of carrier, will replace both the land and carrier-based Harrier aircraft of Joint Force Harrier.

<P>

<a name="21104w15.html_para0">No final decision on aircraft numbers has yet been taken. The current planning assumptions to procure up to 150 includes not only front-line aircraft, but also provision for training, maintenance, trials, and attrition.
<P>

<a name="21104w15.html_para1">It is planned that, as with Joint Force Harrier, both Royal Navy and Royal Air Force pilots will fly the F35 aircraft when it enters into front-line service. The exact requirements for front-line crews for the successor joint force have yet to be determined by the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. On current planning assumptions it will not be necessary to supplement aircrew manning of the joint force from foreign and Commonwealth countries, as we are confident we will be able to fully man the force with regular Royal Navy and Royal Air Force pilots. However, as with all current operational and training squadrons, exchange personnel from foreign and Commonwealth countries may well fill some posts.

Data for Dumfries and Galloway are incorporated in the total for LFA 16, which also includes the Borders region of southern Scotland and other countries up to and including those within the central belt. Figures quoted in the table indicate the number of hours low flying training has been booked by day and night in the LFA over the last five years.

 On leaving the armed forces, personnel are provided with a summary of their medical history (Form F Med 133&#151;Medical History on Release from HM Forces) to give to their civilian doctor. Release of full military medical records is permitted if an individual makes a Subject Access Request to the appropriate Service Records Office. If an individual wishes to make his or her records available to other parties, such as civilian health care providers or solicitors, written consent must be given to release the records.
<P>

<a name="21104w16.html_para3">In respect of deceased persons, the Access to Health Records Act 1990 applies.

 Australian and New Zealand personnel who participated in the British nuclear test programme and who believe that they were injured or suffered a loss as a result of their participation are entitled to claim compensation from their own governments. However, the Governments of Australia and New Zealand have vigorously defended compensation claims on the grounds that particular regard was taken for the safety and welfare of test participants, and in the absence of evidence of negligence, there is no proper basis for settling the claims. I understand that no compensation has been paid to individual New Zealand veterans, but that 10 Australian veterans have secured compensation from the Australian Government.

 I do not consider it necessary to set up a public inquiry.

The MOD accepts the conclusion of this review, which was that XExposure to cadmium from dissemination of zinc cadmium sulphide during the 'cold war' should not have resulted in adverse health effects in the United Kingdom population". The findings of the review are summarised in an open literature paper entitled, XThe Risk to the UK Population of Zinc Cadmium Sulphide Dispersion by the MOD During the XCold War" (Occup.

 The Ministry of Defence is undertaking a range of research projects into the effects of both submarine and surface ship sonar on the behaviour and health of cetaceans. This research is intended to inform the Ministry of Defence's conduct of Environment Appraisals and Environmental Impact Assessments, as required by the Secretary of State for Defence's Policy Statement of 7 July 2000 on the Management of Safety and Environmental Protection in the Ministry of Defence. That Policy Statement requires Environmental Impact Assessments to be conducted for all new equipment projects. A copy of the Policy Statement, together with a chapter on the conduct of Environmental Appraisal and Environmental Impact Assessment, can be found in the Ministry of Defence's Environmental Manual, JSP 418 which is in the Library of the House.




<P>

<a name="21104w17.html_para8">The reason for the research programme is that, to date, it has not been possible to put forward any definitive conclusions on the effects of differing acoustic energy on marine mammals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w17.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 It is Ministry of Defence policy to consider the effects of sonar use on cetaceans. An environmental impact assessment is undertaken prior to all new projects and training activities. The way in which the equipment is then used during each subsequent training activity takes the assessment into account. Trials are preceded by a detailed environmental study of the operating area concerned. The operating area continues to be monitored while the trials are under way, and the activity is managed to minimize the potential impacts on cetaceans. Mitigation methods based on best scientific advice, such as acoustic and visual monitoring in accordance with Government and Joint Nature Conservation Committee published guidelines adapted for military use, are used so that the activity will be modified, delayed or moved as necessary.

<a name="21104w17.html_para9">These measures provide a balance between the requirement for essential trials work and training, and the equally important need to avoid causing any significant adverse effect on the marine environment.

 In 2001 the United Kingdom co-sponsored GA Resolution 55/282, which fixed the International Day of Peace on 21 September each year. The primary objective of the day is to encourage parties engaged in civil war and armed conflict to allow humanitarian agencies to deliver relief and medical supplies to civilian populations. The United Kingdom continues to make an important contribution to United Nations peacekeeping efforts around the world, most notably in Sierra Leone and the Balkans.

<i>[holding answer 23 October 2002]</i>: The Nice European Council agreed that the Charter of Fundamental Rights would be a political statement. As mandated by the Laeken European Council, the Convention on the Future of Europe is examining whether and, if so, how, the Charter should be included in the treaties. EU member states will take the final decision by unanimity at the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004. People need to know their rights and the EU institutions need to respect them. Our policy remains one of strong support for the charter.

 Following inquiries by the United Kingdom and others, Russian authorities have announced that the gas used in ending the siege on a Moscow theatre, on Saturday 26 October, was based on Fentanyl, an opium based narcotic. Fentanyl is not a chemical scheduled under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Non-scheduled chemicals are not in themselves prohibited under the Convention for use in law enforcement, including domestic riot control purposes. On 30 October, the Russian Health Minister, Mr. Shevchenko said XI officially declare that chemical substances of the kind banned under international conventions on chemical weapons were not used".

 The potential for conflicts of interest is addressed when BTI and the FCO consider candidates for secondment opportunities and when setting up the secondments themselves. There are two letters of appointment: one with the secondee, and one with the seconding organisation. Both cover this issue. The letter to the secondee states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>XIt is a prime condition of the secondment that you ensure that in the course of official duties there will be no conflict of interest that will cause either embarrassment to, or difficulties for, your parent organisation (Company) or the FCO. You will be expected to ensure that your position here is not, and raises no reasonable suspicion of being, abused either in your own personal interest, or in the interests of (Company). In practise this means that you should not undertake any work or research on behalf of (Company), or present yourself as a representative of the company, for the duration of the secondment. In addition,

Please be aware that if any of these guidelines are breached, British Trade International reserves the right to consider immediate termination of the secondment."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="21104w19.html_para0">The letter to the seconding organisation states:

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how much has been spent in recruiting staff to his Department in <i>(a)</i> London and <i>(b)</i> the south east in each year since 1997.  [78563]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w19.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office recruits nationally. We do not, therefore break down the recruitment budget by region. The following figures include money spent on recruitment in its widest sense. This includes general marketing via careers fairs, as well as targeted marketing aimed at under-represented groups such as minority ethnic communities and women.

 My Department has received no formal request from the Russian Government asking that permission be granted to issue the Defence of the Soviet Arctic Region Medal (also referred to as the Polar Region Medal) to British Veterans. Were the Russian authorities formally to ask for this campaign medal officially to be recognised in this country, the matter would be carefully considered, as are similar requests from foreign governments.

 The British Government looks forward to Turkey's membership of the European Union as soon as possible. Turkey has not started accession negotiations because it does not yet meet the Copenhagen political criteria, which include rule of law, democracy and respect for human rights and minorities.

<a name="21104w20.html_para0">We welcome the significant EU-related reforms that the Turkish Parliament has passed this year. As the Brussels European Council agreed, this has brought forward the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey.

 The Independent Football Commission was launched in March. In addition to its work in considering individual complaints from supporters, the Commission has already considered issues of racism, merchandising, broadcasting, and the treatment of away supporters. The Commission's success in establishing itself and meeting its initial objectives will be considered in its first annual report, which is due to be published in January 2003. In advance of that report, the Government does not see a need for separate research into the Commission's activities.
<P>

<a name="21104w20.html_para5">I have received one representation on the subject of the Commission since its launch. My Department has, however, drawn the attention of correspondents to it where this is appropriate.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has received numerous representations from Members of Parliament, village halls advisers and others about the funding difficulties facing village halls.

 The Government has issued policy directions to Lottery distributing bodies which include a requirement to take into account the needs of children and young people in distributing Lottery funds. This summer, 11.5m from the New Opportunities Fund went directly towards diversionary activities for young people to help reduce street crime. We are currently consulting on the future of Lottery distribution and a dedicated Youth Fund is among the options proposed.

 <i>[holding answer 31 October 2002]</i>: The New Opportunities Fund (NOF) has allocated funding to each LEA area to ensure that funding is available for projects in all parts of England.

<P>

<a name="21104w21.html_para3">The new service is being designed with the needs of all customers in mind. Banks are making their basic accounts accessible at the Post Office. The Post Office is developing a post office card account which is a simple account just for the receipt of benefit, pension and tax credit payments. As is now the case with orderbooks and girocheques, customers can, if they wish, nominate someone else to collect their money for them. In these cases a second card will be issued.

 It would not be appropriate for post office or Government staff to provide detailed financial advice, including which type of account people should open. The Government will make clear in its literature what options are available to customers.

The campaign raises employers' awareness of the business benefits of an age diverse work force and encourages a flexible approach to retirement to open up choice and opportunity for individuals to stay in work longer.
<P>

<a name="21104w21.html_para9">In 1999 we published the Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment which sets out the standards for non-ageist approaches to recruitment, training, promotion, redundancy and retirement. The code was developed with leading organisations including the CBI, TUC, the Employers Forum on Age and Age Concern. Evaluation shows that from 1999 to 2001 the number of companies using age in recruitment had already fallen from 27 per cent. to 13 per cent. and the number of companies having a policy against employing older workers had dropped from 14 per cent. to 7 per cent.
<P>

<a name="21104w21.html_para10">Older workers have a wealth of skills and experience that can benefit individual businesses and the economy as a whole. Our policies will help to improve further the employment rate of people over 50, which has risen considerably since 1997.

<P>

<a name="21104w22.html_para0">The overall aim of the Department's anti-fraud strategy is to have a benefit system, which is secure from first claim to final payment. The implementation of this strategy means that an anti-fraud focus is integral to the work of all staff in the Department, as is dealing with the wider agenda of error and incorrectness in benefit payments. It is therefore not possible to identify separately the cost involved in tackling benefit fraud across the Department and its Agencies.

 Customers are being supplied with information (including letters and leaflets), which clearly sets out their 'account options'. They can choose the bank or building society account (including the Post Office card account) which best meets their needs and circumstances. All of the Department for Work and Pensions material sets out the key features of the various accounts and mentions the availability of collecting cash from the Post Office, and the Post Office card account. 



<P>
<P><I>4 Nov 2002 : Column 89W</I><P>
The material the Inland Revenue have sent out with new Tax Credit application forms also clearly sets out the various account options, and the fact that people will still be able to collect their money from the Post Office if they wish.

<a name="21104w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 We understand the difficulties that people living in rural areas can face, both in securing employment and gaining access to our services. We are therefore developing new ways of making Jobcentre Plus services more accessible to such people, for example by:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>providing a single point of access to jobs and benefits
<P>
<BR>
providing access to jobs through call centres, touch screen 'Jobpoints' in a wider range of locations, and the internet
<P>
<BR>
enabling people to make claims for benefit by telephone, and eventually through other channels such as the internet
<P>
<BR>
extending outreach services such as local community surgeries
<P>
<BR>
making services available through mobile units
<P>
<BR>
delivering services from premises shared with our partners in the local community, for example local authorities
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="21104w23.html_para1">We have introduced new services which should be particularly useful for Jobcentre Plus customers in rural areas. XJobseeker Direct"&#151;on 0845 6060234&#151;is a telephone jobfinding service available to both unemployed and employed people. They can also look for jobs and learning opportunities on the internet, through two websites www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk and www.worktrain.gov.uk.
<P>

<a name="21104w23.html_para2">The integrated Jobcentre Plus offices which we will be extending throughout Great Britain over the next four years will offer a significantly enhanced telephone service that will improve access to services for those who do not live near a Jobcentre Plus office. Each Jobcentre Plus office will have a dedicated telephone contact centre open from 8.30 am to 6.00 pm. Customers will be able to make their initial claim to benefit through this service and book appointments with Personal Advisers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The amount and quality of support available to participants on our educational, training and employment programmes is under constant review as part of our continuous improvement agenda. This is led by Jobcentre Plus in partnership with the organisations delivering the programmes. Organisations wishing to compete for our education, training or employment related contracts are asked to set out how they intend delivering the programme, including the amount and quality of support they will offer participants. The providers who win the contracts are then subject to contractual and quality audits by Jobcentre Plus regional contracts managers, district quality management teams and, in some cases, the Adult Learning Inspectorate. These seek to ensure that providers deliver to the standards proposed in their bids and to support continuous improvement in the quality of their provision.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list local authorities that are <i>(a) </i>failing to meet Government recycling targets, <i>(b) </i>expected to meet them and <i>(c) </i>exceeding them; and what the estimates are for recycling in England for (i) the current year and (ii) 2003&#150;04. [71110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher  </B> 
<i>[holding Answer 19 July 2002]: </i>Local authority Statutory Performance Standard (Xtargets") for recycling and composting of household waste have been set for the years 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06. Local authorities will submit performance data against which these targets will be measured to the Audit Commission in Summer 2004 and audited performance figures will be available towards the end of 2004.
<P>

<a name="21104w23.html_para4">Targets for individual authorities are listed in the publication XGuidance on Municipal Waste Management Strategies" March 2001. Copies of this document were placed within both libraries of the House on 5 March 2001. They are also published on DEFRA's website at http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/management/guidance/mwms/10.htm.
<P>

<a name="21104w23.html_para5">We will have audited recycling performance figures for 2001&#150;02 in December 2002 and this should give us an indication of progress to targets. A document setting out individual local authorities' targets and the most recent available data for their household waste recycling rates (2000&#150;01), set out in ascending order according to their recycling and composting rate for 2000&#150;01, has been placed in both libraries of the House (Table A).
<P>

<a name="21104w23.html_para6">A further document (Table B) setting out the same information, but also including a column showing the difference between the 2000&#150;01 rate and the 2003&#150;04 target, in order to show Xprogress to target", has also been placed in both libraries of the House. Those furthest from their target in percentage points are shown at the top of the table. Note that, since all authorities had to achieve different levels of improvement to reach their target, that table does not allow for exact comparison.




<P>
<P><I>4 Nov 2002 : Column 92W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21104w23.html_para7">We set targets in a way which means all authorities would have to improve their performance over their rate in 1998&#150;99, no matter what their starting point. For that reason, when tracking local authorities' recycling performance, we consider how much the recycling rate has <i>increased, </i>rather than looking simply at the rate.
<P>

<a name="21104w23.html_para8">I have written to the leaders of the local authorities that are listed below about recycling. In these authorities, preliminary performance data for 2001&#150;02, taken from 2002&#150;03 Best Value Performance Plans, shows that the authority's recycling rate has decreased, stayed the same, or only increased by 1 per cent. between 1998&#150;99 and 2001&#150;02. I have invited the relevant leaders to identify work that is already in hand to meet their 2003&#150;04 Statutory Performance Standard for recycling and composting of household waste and to consider the need for further action where this is relevant.

<i>(a)</i> The latest figures for the Headline Sustainable Development Indicator for Climate Change were published in a Defra Statistical Press Release on 28 March. Emissions on the Xbasket" of six greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol, weighted by global warming potential, fell by 13.2 per cent. between the 1990 base year and 2000, the last year for which confirmed data is available. There was no change between 1999 and 2000. The UK has a target under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008&#150;12.

Precise support arrangements vary widely between countries. Within the EU, all Member States are able to operate programmes under the Rural Development Regulation.

<P>

<a name="21104w24.html_para1">The Department recently received the final report of an economic evaluation of agri-environment schemes commissioned from the Centre for Rural Economics Research at the University of Cambridge.

 The United Kingdom (UK) joined the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in June 2001. This was a result of an agreement between the Home Office, the Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, as the UK was increasingly making use of the lOM's services, and the increasing level of work being taken forward by the Home Office in conjunction with the IOM was at odds with the United Kingdom's retaining Xobserver"status.

<a name="21104w24.html_para8">The post of Chair was advertised for the first time in 1999. On that occasion the pack set out basic information about the CRE and the person specification. This time the information pack has been re-designed to provide additional information about the wider race equality agenda and the government's support for the work of the Commission. No new requirements have been added to the role of the Chair, but more information about the role has been included in the information pack.

<P>
<a name="21104w24.html_spnew8"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The information pack sent to candidates for the post of Chair of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE), which is currently vacant, states that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>XThe Chair must ensure that the CRE's policies are compatible with those of the Secretary of State and that the Commission's affairs are conducted with probity"</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="21104w24.html_para9">The requirement is not a new one as the Commission for Racial Equality's policy and resource framework is agreed with Ministers who remain accountable to Parliament for the work and efficiency of the Commission.
<P>

<a name="21104w24.html_para10">To my knowledge, this particular form of words has not been used in the job descriptions sent to applicants for the post of Chair of other public bodies sponsored by the Home Office. However, all non Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) agree their policy and resources framework with Ministers, and Ministers are answerable to Parliament for the policies and performance of all public bodies sponsored by their departments, including their use of resources and the policy framework within which they operate.

 No permanent resources are in place at either Belfast or Larne ports.

Any person who indicated to port staff at either port that they wished to claim asylum would be directed to the UK Immigration Service office at Belfast International Airport, where arrangements would be made for screening and interview in the normal way.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w25.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 31 October 2002]:</i> We do not have figures on the additional costs, if any, of providing support to asylum seekers who can no longer seek permission to work. Internal management Information indicates that during the financial year 2001&#150;02 we made initial decisions on the vast majority of new substantive applications within the initial six months. The number who might have been able to benefit from the concession is therefore much reduced.
<P>

<a name="21104w25.html_para2">The percentage of new substantive cases in 2001&#150;02 which were decided within six months will be available from 29 November 2002 on the Home Office Research Development and Statistics Directorate website at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1 .html
<P>

<a name="21104w25.html_para3">The work concession for asylum seekers did not extend to asylum seekers in detention.
<P>

<a name="21104w25.html_para4">Immigration detainees held in Immigration Service removal centres have never been required to work nor are they expected to assist in the running of the centres.
<P>

<a name="21104w25.html_para5">Following their redesignation earlier this year as removal centres, the Prison Service detention facilities at Dover, Haslar and Lindholme ceased to operate under Prison Rules. As a consequence, detainees no longer had the opportunity to undertake paid employment in the centres and the practice of relying on such work for the provision of certain ancillary services came to an end. Work formerly undertaken by detainees at these centres has been contracted out or transferred to agency staff. For this year this has resulted in a net additional cost of #1.09 million. This will be met from the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's budget.

 The Government is committed to the delivery of an effective service for undertaking pre-employment criminal record checks for people working with children and vulnerable adults. The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has not so far been able to provide a satisfactory service.

<a name="21104w25.html_para10">A number of steps have already been taken to improve the CRB's performance. In May an initial service improvement plan was put in place. As a result the number of disclosures issued by the CRB has increased from an average of 24,500 per week in August to an average of 39,500 per week in the three weeks ending 26 October. The CRB has now issued 541,000 disclosures.

<a name="21104w25.html_para12">I expect the independent team to report to me with their conclusions and recommendations by the end of the year. It is likely, however, to require a period of months before any system changes necessary to deliver the required step change in the CRB's output can be fully implemented. In the meantime it is expected that there will be a gradual improvement in performance through the ongoing service improvement plan.
<P>

<a name="21104w25.html_para13">In the interim, we need to take steps to ensure that the demand for disclosures is in line with the CRB's current ability to process the applications. I have therefore agreed with my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Health, and for Education and Skills a number of measures to defer the existing or proposed requirement on certain occupations or office holders to obtain a CRB disclosure.
<P>

<a name="21104w25.html_para14">Persons caring for children and vulnerable adults will, as now, continue to be subject to rigorous pre-employment checks, including confirming previous employment history and taking up references, to ensure their suitability for the position in question. All those occupations which were subject to a criminal record check prior to the advent of the CRB will continue to be subject to such a check.
<P>

<a name="21104w25.html_para15">The details of the measures are set out as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Care Homes</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The care homes regulations (relating to care homes for adults) currently require CRB checks for existing staff&#151;that is, those employed to work in a care home immediately before 1 April 2002&#151;to be completed by 31 March 2003. The Government will be amending the regulations to extend this time limit. Existing care home staff will now be required to obtain a CRB check during the course of 2004. New care homes staff will continue to be required to have CRB checks, as will registered providers and managers of care homes.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Nurses agencies and domiciliary care agencies</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Nurses supplied by nurses agencies, and staff supplied by domiciliary care agencies, will not be required to have CRB checks for the time being. The Department of Health will still be going ahead with the introduction of the nurses agency and domiciliary care agency regulations to come into effect in February 2003, but 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>4 Nov 2002 : Column 104W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>without the requirement for CRB checks. Staff will be required to provide a statement that they have no criminal convictions, or to provide a statement of any criminal convictions that they do have.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The CRB check requirements will however, apply to registered providers and managers of nurses agencies and domiciliary care agencies.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Some nurses agencies are already having to comply with requirements for CRB checks, which stem from the care homes regulations and the private and voluntary health care regulations which are already in place. These require checks to be made before temporary staff can be placed in those settings. These requirements have been in place since April 2002, and are not being removed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Other Department of Health regulations</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There will be no change to other regulations under the Care Standards Act 2000. Furthermore, none of these measures affect the requirements of those working with children to have a Protection of Children Act list check and the checks required by the Children's Homes Regulations and the Fostering Services Regulations.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is planned that regulations on residential family centres and adoption agencies will come into effect, with CRB check requirements, in February and April 2003 respectively.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health has agreed to postpone the implementation of the Protection of Vulnerable Adults list provided for the Care Standards Act.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>All these arrangements are designed to avoid having regulations in place which cannot be complied with by providers. The Government recognises the importance of criminal records checks but at the same time providers must not be prevented from operating. Care homes have to be able to continue to employ existing staff, and we believe that domiciliary care agencies and nurses agencies should not be prevented from being able to place staff because they have not obtained checks.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The regulations and national minimum standards, even with the CRB check requirements, will still be a significant factor in driving up standards and protecting service users. Among other things, they will cover the way the organisation is run, recruitment procedures, staffing arrangements, user feedback, information for service users, all of which are part of a system to protect vulnerable people.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>School Governors</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>School governors will not be required to have CRB checks for the time being. The Department for Education and Skills will still be going ahead with the introduction of the School Governance (Constitution) regulations to come into effect in April 2003, but without the requirement for CRB checks.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government remains committed to introducing CRB checks in these areas at the earliest possible opportunity.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Home Office, in conjunction with the Department of Health for Education and Skills, will be issuing detailed guidance to Registered Bodies about the implications of the above measures. The three Departments will continue to work with their partners and the CRB as the situation develops.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps are being taken by the Government to curb the number of women illegally trafficked against their will for use in vice rings.  [77555]<P>

<P>
<a name="21104w27.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 We set out a comprehensive approach to tackle trafficking and other forms of organised crime in the White Paper XSecure Borders, Safe Haven" published earlier this year. This approach encompasses new legislation to criminalise trafficking. The Nationality Immigration and Asylum (NIA) Bill currently before Parliament creates an offence of trafficking for the purpose of controlling someone through prostitution, with a tough maximum sentence of 14 years. This measure will tackle the worst forms of exploitation, pending the introduction of comprehensive legislation that will cover trafficking for the purposes of both labour and sexual exploitation.
<P>

<a name="21104w27.html_para0">We are working to tackle the criminal networks involved in people trafficking through Reflex, the multi-agency response to organised immigration crime. Reflex has co-ordinated intelligence on the scale and has assisted with planning operations such as Horsley, which dismantled a group trafficking Thai women into the UK.
<P>

<a name="21104w27.html_para1">We also recognise the importance of providing protection for the victims of trafficking in order to encourage them to co- operate with the authorities. We are developing support arrangements for victims in co-operation with the voluntary sector and plan to establish a pilot scheme next year. In conjunction with this we are developing a toolkit to raise awareness of the problem with police and immigration officers to help them to identify victims.
<P>

 We set out a comprehensive approach to tackle trafficking and other forms of organised crime in the White Paper XSecure Borders, Safe Haven" published earlier this year. This approach encompasses new legislation to criminalise trafficking. The Nationality Immigration and Asylum (NIA) Bill currently before Parliament creates an offence of trafficking for the purpose of controlling someone through prostitution, with a tough maximum sentence of 14 years. This measure will tackle the worst forms of exploitation, pending the introduction of comprehensive legislation that will cover trafficking for the purposes of both labour and sexual exploitation.

<P>

<a name="21104w27.html_para10">Last year we provided an extra #30 million through the Rural Policing Fund to tackle problems faced in the 31 more rural police areas. This is being paid again this year.
<P>

<a name="21104w27.html_para11">The Police Authority and the Chief Officer may decide how to spend this additional money for the benefit of rural communities. It may be used to fund additional officers. Some police authorities have used the money to buy and operate mobile police stations to provide an enhanced police presence in remote areas.
<P>

<a name="21104w27.html_para12">Police numbers in the rural areas have increased significantly. At 31 March 2002 there were 60,401 officers in the 31 more rural forces. This represents an increase of 2.6 per cent. over March 2001 and 4.9 per cent. over March 2000.
<P>

<a name="21104w27.html_para13">Police forces can also employ Community Support Officers (CSO's) to provide additional support in rural communities. 19 of the 27 successful bids on the new CSO Fund were from the 31 more rural forces and they will receive between them #3.9 million this year. CSOs will provide a visible police presence and will have a vital role to play in support of the police in reducing the fear of crime, increasing public safety and tackling anti-social behaviour.

 The Home Office does not collect information about the cost of retail crime.

 It is not possible to provide an overall figure for the amount of money allocated to the Home Office in this year's budget, which will be used to tackle retail crime. Chief officers of police forces and individual crime and disorder reduction partnerships decide on the priorities for their local areas, and a proportion of their mainstream expenditure or their Home Office funding may be spent on tackling retail crime. Many of the measures taken to reduce particular crimes, such as juvenile crime, street crime and drug-related crime, and anti-social behaviour, are also likely to have a beneficial impact on reducing retail crime.

 Lancashire is one of the 10 areas involved in the Government's street crime initiative, which was announced on 17 March 2002.
<P>

<a name="21104w29.html_para0">We published street crime figures on 14 October 2002 charting progress under the initiative to the end of September. There are two indicators of progress: a comparison with the period immediately before the initiative began, and a direct comparison with the same period last year.
<P>

<a name="21104w29.html_para1">In Lancashire, there was a 20 per cent reduction in street crime offences (robbery and snatch theft) between April and September 2002. For robbery, the more serious offence, figures showed 15 per cent fewer offences in September compared to March, the month preceding the initiative.




<P>
<P><I>4 Nov 2002 : Column 116W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21104w29.html_para2">Year on year comparisons show an 11 per cent reduction in the number of robberies in Lancashire in the six months from April to September 2002, compared to the same period last year.
<P>

<a name="21104w29.html_para3">Published figures for the first six months of the initiative, including a document detailing the achievements made through the initiative's partnership work, can be found in the Library or on the Crime Reduction website atwww.crimereduction.gov.uk/streetcrime.

<P>
<a name="21104w29.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The requested details in respect of crimes recorded by the police in the year ending March 2002 have already been published in table 6.06 of the Home Office Statistical Bulletin XCrime in England and Wales 2001&#150;02", which was published in July this year, and is available in the Library. The table also gives rates for overall violent crime obtained from the British Crime Survey, which records people's actual experiences of crime.




<P>
<P><I>4 Nov 2002 : Column 117W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21104w29.html_para4">Recorded crime figures may have been affected in comparison to the previous year as a result of changes to police recording practices. Some of the forces in Wales and the North West, including Lancashire, implemented the principles of the National Crime Recording Standard in advance of its national introduction in April 2002. This early implementation by these and other police forces had the effect of uplifting the number of offences of violence against the person in England and Wales as a whole in 2001&#150;02 by an estimated 13 per cent.

<a name="21104w29.html_wqn5"><B> Alistair Burt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether the re-opened facility at Yarl's Wood, Bedfordshire will be used from April 2003 for <i>(a)</i> the long-term detention of asylum seekers and <i>(b)</i> their removal after refusal of their applications; and if he will make a statement.  [78578]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w29.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 31 October 2002]:</i> I can confirm the intention is for the remaining centre at Yarl's Wood to be ready to re-open in April 2003 with a population of single females, and later families, both asylum and non-asylum cases. In advance of this, work has already commenced to install sprinklers and the necessary facilities so that this population can be accommodated. As with all other removal centres, Yarl's Wood will be used to ensure we deliver our commitment to remove those without lawful right to be here. The intention is always to ensure that the period in detention is as short as possible. However, it is sometimes regrettably necessary to detain asylum seekers and other immigration related cases for longer periods of time.

<P>
<a name="21104w29.html_spnew6"><B> Beverley Hughes  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 31 October 2002]:</i> It has not been decided when the report will be published. Stephen Moore has consulted widely and taken 



<P>
<P><I>4 Nov 2002 : Column 118W</I><P>
representations from a number of interested parties. However, his terms of reference require him to take full account of inquiries being undertaken by Bedfordshire police and the Bedfordshire fire and rescue service, neither of which has yet concluded investigations. He is also required to conduct his inquiry in a way that would not impede any criminal investigation. Criminal trials arising out of the events at Yarl's Wood on 14 and 15 February are listed for April 2003. Consideration is therefore still being given as to when the report can be completed and published.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action he will take in response to the finding of Home Office Research Study 45: Improving Public Attitudes to the Criminal Justice System, that overall knowledge of the criminal justice system among the general public was poor.  [73785]<P>

 We recognise that public understanding of the criminal justice system is poor, and the Home Office will take this into account when considering future communication activity.
<P>

<a name="21104w29.html_para6">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has publicly acknowledged this fact, and has sought to encourage a wide-ranging public debate about the criminal justice system in the run up to and following publication of the Criminal Justice White Paper, XJustice for All". Work is under way to develop a plan and programme of work to improve public confidence in the criminal justice system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w29.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that, in the knowledge of a theoretical risk of BSE in sheep, the Agency has recommended to the European Union (EU) Commission that sheep intestines, used to make some sausage casings, be added to the EU list of specified risk material (SRM) prohibited from the food chain. The EU scientific steering committee (SSC) considered at its September meeting the most recent data on BSE and sheep intestines. The SSC decided not to recommend, at this time, the addition of sheep intestines to the list of SRM. At the same time, differing scientific opinions on the effectiveness of processing sheep intestines, in removing potential infective material should BSE be present in a sheep, were acknowledged. The Agency has subsequently suggested to the Commission that experts be called together at EU level to achieve better common understanding. The Commission has agreed to this. In the meantime, there are no restrictions on the sale or use of such sausage casings pending any decision at the EU level.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will assess the impact on the NHS budget of the European food supplements directive and the proposed European directive on traditional herbal medicinal products; and if he will make a statement. [75816]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21104w29.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The European Union food supplements directive is not expected to have any impact on the availability of vitamin and mineral supplements required by specific population groups, such as pregnant women. It is therefore not expected to have any impact on the national health service budget.
<P>

<a name="21104w29.html_para7">Overall, it is not possible to quantify the likely impact of the proposed traditional herbal medicines directive on the NHS budget.
<P>

<a name="21104w29.html_para8">The proposed directive on traditional herbal medicinal products should ensure the availability of a wide range of traditional herbal remedies made to assured standards of safety and quality, and accompanied by systematic and reliable information about the purpose of the product and its safe usage. Potentially the directive could help members of the public wishing to take greater responsibility for their own health to make an informed choice about which traditional herbal remedy may be helpful. It could also reduce the possibility of the public taking remedies that may be inappropriate to their health needs.

<a name="21104w30.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 These labelling changes will help consumers make informed choices about consumption of these products. Many manufacturers already indicate when caffeine or quinine has been added as an ingredient and most beverages containing high levels of caffeine already carry a warning to that effect. The new rules do not take full effect until 1 July 2004 and the legislation provides for products labelled before that date to continue to be sold while stocks last. This generous transitional period should allow any necessary changes to be incorporated as part of normal label redesign cycles and therefore ensure costs are kept to a minimum.

 From April 2002, responsibility for securing the provision of the health contribution to child protection services began to be devolved to primary care trusts (PCTs). The particular roles and responsibilities of health professionals for child protection are set out in the Government's core inter-agency child protection guidance Working Together to Safeguard Children. Although this is a new role for PCTs, they are not expected to assume this responsibility without support. Child protection will form a key competency task within the national primary and care trust development programme currently being developed.
<P>

<a name="21104w30.html_para6">The exercise of responsibility for child protection involves more than the specific clinical service; it necessitates PCTs exercising a public health responsibility for a whole population.

Guidance on specific action required was issued to all chief executives of PCTs in January this year. This will be followed next year by supplementary child protection guidance for health professionals.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is not possible from routinely coded mortality data to obtain figures on complications arising from fractured bones. For deaths where an accident or violence initiated the train of events leading directly to death, a code is assigned to the type of injury sustained by the deceased. The figures below indicate the numbers of deaths where that injury was a fracture.</FONT></UL>

<sup>(15)</sup> The nature of injury was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 800 to 829 for the years 1997 to 2000 and, for the year 2001, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes S02, 812, S22, S32, S42, S52, 862, 872, 882, 892, T02, T08, T10, T12, T14.2.<P>

<P>

<sup>(16)</sup> Figures are for deaths occurring in each calendar year<P>





<sup>(17)</sup> The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 means that data for fractures in this year are not comparable with data for earlier years. The introduction of ICD-10 has led to an apparent increase of 17% in the number of deaths coded to fractures. The figures should therefore be interpreted with caution. The effect of the change in classification in 2001 is described in a report published in May 2002.i<P>

 There are currently 153 organs retained by the three hospitals covered by the University Hospitals of Leicester National Health Service Trust. Their retention complies with the Department's rules on the removal, retention and use of human organs. We have recently consulted on revised procedures and protocols for the taking, storage and use of human organs and tissue, and a code of practice on the import and export of body parts. That exercise will lead to a new Bill on human tissue in due course.

 It is our intention to make public as much as possible of the results of the inquiry. The presumption is that this will be the full report. However, much of the information being considered by the inquiry is subject to legal and commercial confidentiality restrictions, and such restrictions may also attach to information included in the report of the inquiry. It will not be possible to determine in advance of receiving the report from Lord Penrose whether any such restrictions prevent the report from being published in full.

<a name="21104w35.html_para0">Treasury Ministers will decide, on the basis of legal advice, whether it is possible to publish the whole of Lord Penrose's report within the restrictions relating to legal or commercial confidentiality.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> Currently the latest available estimates for the Gross Value Added (GVA*) for the countries and regions of the United Kingdom are for 1999. This publication lag is longer than usual and has been caused by the ONS completing an exceptionally demanding work programme to include a number of new and revised data sources. This additional work led to a deferral of the publication of estimates of GVA from their planned release date in May 2002 and the reasons for this deferral were covered in a ONS News Release of 21 May 2002.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>More usually, estimates of GVA below UK level are published some three to four months after the UK-level estimates are released. One of the main reasons for this delay is to ensure that the sub-UK estimates are consistent with (i.e. add up to) those published in the United Kingdom National Accounts. We plan to meet that goal this year by publishing estimates for the period up to 2001 before the end of 2002.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> The ONS announced in the August edition of Updates that Regional Gross Value Added is to be published for the years 2000 and 2001 on 17 December 2002.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>*While the estimates have been historically referred to as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), under the new European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95) they are more correctly referred to as Gross Value Added (GVA) at basic prices. From 2002 onwards, the term GVA is being used.</FONT></UL>

<i>[holding answer 29 October 2002]:</i> Prior to 6 April 1996 serving members of Her Majesty's Forces paid National Insurance contributions at a reduced rate. The contributions paid built up entitlement to all contributory benefits although Contributory Jobseekers Allowance and Incapacity Benefit are not payable to serving members of Her Majesty's Forces. The amount of the reductions, which were compulsory, are shown in the table below.
