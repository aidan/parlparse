 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her timetable is for public consultation on Article 8.2 of Council Directive (EU) 338/97, with particular reference to the <i>(a)</i> conservation and <i>(b)</i> animal welfare implications of the trade in primates as pets in the UK; and if she will make a statement.

<p><a name="50523w01.html_spnew1"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The Government plan to go out to public consultation on their proposals regarding the use of the powers under Article 8.2 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 338/97 by the end of July. The Regulation is essentially a conservation measure and its powers cannot be used to address animal welfare issues. Although we shall certainly consider whether it would be appropriate to use these powers to restrict the keeping of primates, the purpose of the consultation exercise is to seek views on how these powers should be used, rather than presenting a detailed list of protected species at this stage.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50523w01.html_para0">
As has been demonstrated by the tax and other financial benefits introduced over recent years for Community Amateur Sports Clubs, and the significant sums in Lottery support for them which is channelled through sport&#039;s governing bodies, the Government continues to support the estimated 140,000 amateur clubs across England and Wales. In introducing the new licensing regime, there is no intention to penalise those involved in running clubs, or to affect the important roles such clubs play in local communities. This was made clear during the passage of the Act, and thereafter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50523w01.html_para1">
My Department is working closely with the Central Council of Physical Recreation, and other sports bodies, as implementation continues. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made a commitment to an independent review of fee levels and associated costs, within a reasonable period after the new framework is fully introduced. The results of that review will inform any necessary adjustments to the levels of fees introduced under the Act.

<sup>(1)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>

<sup>(2)</sup> 2002&#150;03 saw a break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the Section 52 Outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the blank row. For 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04, school based expenditure is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table A Schools Net Current Expenditure. For 2001&#150;02 the expenditure is calculated as lines one to 12 less lines 29, 30, 35 and 37 of Section 52 Outturn Table 3.<br>

<sup>(3)</sup> The 2001&#150;02 calculation is broadly similar to the calculation in subsequent years. However, 2001&#150;02 includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses, while in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 only the schools element of these categories is included. Also, for some LEAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors in 2001&#150;02 was reported within the LEA part of the form in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 and would therefore be excluded, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>

<sup>(4)</sup> Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within each sector and are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 in cash terms as reported by Cheshire LEA.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the time scale for publication of the arrangements for the Review of Staffing Structure Regulations; and if she will delay the start of the consultation period for schools.  [186]</p>




<p><a name="50523w02.html_spnew0"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The Education (Review of Staffing Structure) (England) Regulations 2005 came into force on 6 May. They require that the staffing structures of all maintained schools and pupil referral units in England should be reviewed by the end of this year with a view to implementing any resulting changes to staffing arrangements by the end of 2008.

<p><a name="50523w02.html_spnew1"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 Everton in Liverpool has benefited from both the Sure Start West Everton and Breckfield local programme approved in 1999 and the Everton Early Childhood Centre (EEC) approved in February 2001 which are based on the same site. The building was developed with local and national Government funding including both the Sure Start and Early Excellence programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50523w02.html_para0">
The Sure Start local programme supports around 1,212 young local children and their families living in Everton. Through a multidisciplinary team, a highly trained volunteer force and committed partners they are delivering a range of services including: outreach and home visiting; support for families and parents; access to good quality play, learning and childcare experiences for children; primary care and health, including advice about child health and development; and support for children and families with special needs, including access to specialised services such as the paediatrician and child and adolescent mental health team.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50523w02.html_para1">
The Sure Start local programme has strong parental participation reflected in the management board membership with seven of the 20 places taken by parents. Parents have also been trained as researchers for the local evaluation of the programme and have been encouraged to use the findings to improve the way the programme is being developed.

<p><a name="50523w02.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The approved budget for the A3 Hindhead improvement is &#163;240 million, which includes an estimated &#163;93.2 million for the costs of the two bored tunnels to take the A3 under the Devils Punchbowl.

<p><a name="50523w02.html_spnew3"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The Department have given &#163;469,947 in grant aid in the last two years to assist the construction of natural gas refuelling stations, bringing the number of these stations built in the last decade to 30. In the same period 13 electricity recharging points have been installed and 1,202 LPG and 106 biodiesel fuelling points have been installed on forecourts, all without Government support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50523w02.html_para4">
That earlier grant programme ended on 31 March. A new programme that would extend grant funding for construction in relation to natural gas, electric, bio-ethanol and hydrogen refueling is under consideration and has been notified to the European Commission in accordance with the state aid rules. The time scale for introducing a new programme will be dependent on the process of review and clearance by the European Commission.

<p><a name="50523w02.html_spnew4"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 Completion of the channel tunnel rail link (CTRL) will have two significant effects on the rail network in the south. First, it will allow the operation of high speed domestic services from Kent to St. Pancras. This will provide some relief to existing capacity constraints at London Bridge. The new service pattern proposed in the specification for the Integrated Kent Franchise will improve operational performance at London Bridge, delivering improved reliability and 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>23 May 2005 : Column 8W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
punctuality for passengers. The high speed domestic services from Kent are expected to begin operation in 2009.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50523w02.html_para5">
Second, international services will no longer require access to the domestic network, except for access to Ashford International, so existing international facilities at Waterloo and at North Pole depot will become available for alternative use. The Strategic Rail Authority, in conjunction with the Department for Transport, has commissioned the first phase of a study to examine the best alternative uses for these facilities. The study is examining the potential impact of options on London Bridge Station, as well as Waterloo station. The phase 1 report, which will be completed this summer, will identify the most promising options for further detailed evaluation.

 A speed cushion was one of the hump types tested in recent research into the impact of road humps on vehicles and their occupants. The results, published in 2004, found:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">no evidence of vehicle damage from repeated traverses, although some small changes in steering geometry were noted;</p>

<p class="tabletext">peak vertical accelerations (which strongly correlate to discomfort ratings) for all vehicles (including an ambulance, bus and minibus) were lower when traversing cushions than when traversing other types of hump;</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">no evidence that alternative hump dimensions to those currently recommended could remove any unnecessary discomfort and maintain safety objectives;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">predicted spinal ligament forces were almost an order of magnitude smaller than the damage threshold for such ligaments and predicted forces transmitted through the spine were at least a factor of four smaller than those generated in discs by heavy lifting. Therefore, although it is not possible to predict the effect of such forces on people with pre-existing spinal conditions, it was considered that vehicle occupants with healthy spines were very unlikely to be injured as a result of single or repeated traversing of road humps (including cushions) constructed to recommended dimensions.</p>

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what steps he is taking to improve productivity in the public sector.  [175]</p>




<p><a name="50523w05.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Des Browne: </b> 
 By implementing the recommendations of the Gershon review of public sector efficiency, the Government will achieve &#163;21 billion of annual efficiency gains by 2007&#150;08 and a gross reduction of 84,000 civil service and administrative posts. The Government have already achieved efficiency gains exceeding &#163;2 billion and a reduction of 12,500 posts. By implementing the Lyons review of public sector relocation over 4,300 posts have already been moved out of London and the south east. These efficiency gains will help to drive increases in Government output and productivity. The Government have previously welcomed the Atkinson review as the first step to improve the measurement of Government output and productivity and to ensure that measures of the impact of increased investment in our schools, hospitals and other public services are informative and robust. In the year to October 2004, measured public sector output grew by just over 5 per cent. nearly twice as fast as during the previous 12 months.

Budget 2005 announced increases in the Schools Standards Grant payment to headteachers of &#163;100 million for 2006&#150;07 and &#163;150 million for 2007&#150;08. These increases were additional to increases already promised for 2005&#150;06. As a result, direct payments to the headteacher of a typical primary school in England will increase from around &#163;30,000 in 2004&#150;05 to &#163;31,000 in 2005&#150;06, rising to around &#163;34,000 in 2006&#150;07 and around &#163;36,000 in 2007&#150;08.

The published figures are given as ranges depending on the degree of certainty attaching to the estimates. The number of months&#039; supply represented by these resources would depend on the month in question, since gas production (like gas demand) is not flat through the year (being lower in summer and higher in winter) or from year to year (production is now generally falling while demand is flat or rising slowly).

The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority which assumed responsibility from 1 April 2005 for discharging the nuclear legacy accepted that figure in its first Annual Plan. A key task now for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is to review that estimate carefully to reduce uncertainty and work on that is now under way with a view to publication in December.

<p><a name="50523w12.html_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Controls are already in place to tackle the misuse of ball-bearing guns which are more accurately known as airsoft guns and which fire plastic pellets. It is an offence to possess them in a public place without reasonable excuse. We wish to go further and will be introducing tougher laws on the sale and manufacture of all imitation firearms in the proposed Violent Crime Reduction Bill.

<p>14. <a name="50523w12.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of public confidence in the British Crime Survey.  [16]</p>




<p><a name="50523w12.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> 
 The Office for National Statistics has recently made an assessment of public confidence in British official statistics. It found that the statistical quality of official publications was considered to be good and to rival the best in the world, and in particular that there was considerable confidence in the methodologies used to produce official statistics and their accuracy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50523w12.html_para0">
The 2003&#150;04 British Crime Survey shows that just under two-thirds (65 per cent.) of the general public thought crime in the country as a whole had gone up in the previous two years. This is lower than found in 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>23 May 2005 : Column 41W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
2002&#150;03, when almost three-quarters (73 per cent.) reported that they thought crime in the country as a whole had increased over the previous two years.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his policy is on requiring young offenders to wear uniforms while on community service.  [18]</p>




<p><a name="50523w12.html_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 It is important that the community are able to see that people who have committed an offence are putting something back into their communities. Offenders wearing bibs or sweatshirts or a plaque highlighting the work could make their activity more visible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50523w12.html_para2">
Community service and reparation is already used for offenders&#151;but is not always visible to the public, and is not always put in place swiftly enough after the offence is committed. This needs to happen if we are to better reassure communities and deter offenders.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he plans to take to encourage communities to tackle antisocial behaviour.  [17]</p>




<p><a name="50523w12.html_spnew4"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The TOGETHER campaign was set up to ensure that antisocial behaviour is dealt with swiftly and effectively by local services. The first phase was about equipping practitioners with the tools and the know-how. We have seen some good results: Nearly 4,000 ASBOs, over 150 crack house closure orders and over 400 dispersal orders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50523w12.html_para3">
As part of the next phase on the campaign, we will ensure we give the right help and support to communities so they know what they can do to tackle problems of antisocial behaviour and what they can expect from local services. More recently, It&#039;s Your Call (launched in 25 areas) means people can access services by dialling a single number. We are encouraging a cultural shift to encourage more people not to put up with antisocial behaviour, to signal that it is not acceptable and take a stand against the minority.

<p><a name="50523w12.html_spnew6"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 Since 2000, we have collected data which can separately track reconviction rates for offenders who have served community sentences. The first results for adults show a reduction of 1 per cent. in the two-year rates and the latest results for young offenders show a reduction of 1 per cent. in the one-year rate. The next results, for adults, are expected to be available in July.
