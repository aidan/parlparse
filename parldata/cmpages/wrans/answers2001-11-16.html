<P>
<a name="11116w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 It will be for the Railway Administrator to put a proposal to the Secretary of State for a scheme to transfer the network operator out of administration. We have indicated that we will be making a proposal for a company limited by guarantee to take over Railtrack's role, but the Secretary of State will consider any proposal put to him by the administrator to transfer the railway 



<P>
<P><I>16 Nov 2001 : Column: 899W</I><P>
assets out of administration as a going concern. The composition of the board of Railtrack's successor will therefore depend on the eventual scheme put to us by the administrator.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We are aware of the desire to improve this service. The Rail Passenger Partnership fund administered by the SRA would be a possible source of support for an increased local service. Bids can be made individually or by consortia which could include the train operator and local authority.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 London Underground is currently negotiating the contracts to deliver this investment. To estimate at this stage of the negotiations what rate of interest the private sector infrastructure companies might be charged on the debt they raise would undermine London Underground's commercial position and jeopardise its ability to deliver best value.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions when he expects the Health and Safety Executive to complete consideration of the safety case for the PPP for London Underground.  [14492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The independent Health and Safety Executive is responsible for the timetable for consideration of London Underground's safety case. They will reach a decision after considering all the relevant issues.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w01.html_wqn17"><B> Ms Buck: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions at what level of cost overrun under the PPP for the London Underground infracos will be able to demand additional financial support; and if he will make a statement.  [14482]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The modernisation contracts provide for an "extraordinary review" if costs are increased by more than &#163;200 million despite the infrastructure company carrying out the investment in an economic and efficient way. This is aimed largely at external events, which the infrastructure companies might be unable to bear and which could arise in any long-term contractual relationship.
<P>

<P>
(4) how many staff will be employed in <i>(a)</i> the inspection team and <i>(b)</i> the maintenance team available to London Underground to carry out its step in powers under the PPP arrangements; and if he will make a statement.  [14513]

<a name="11116w01.html_wqn20"><B> Clive Efford: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how disputes between Transport for London and infracos as to the exercise of step-in powers by London Underground will be resolved; and if he will make a statement.  [14495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w01.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 London Underground will have a range of methods under the contracts for checking whether the infrastructure companies are carrying out their obligations. The contracts will require the private companies to provide asset management plans and detailed information on asset condition on an open book basis. London Underground will have rights to audit or inspect work and records at short notice.
<P>

<a name="11116w01.html_para2">Where London Underground finds a safety concern it will be able either to direct action from the infrastructure company or to step in itself, whether or not the infrastructure company has complied with its obligations. This step-in power allows London Underground to do the work itself or to employ an outside contractor or another infrastructure company. In either case, if the infrastructure company has breached its obligations, the work will be done at the expense of the infrastructure company that failed to meet its obligations. If action is determined by London Underground in these circumstances to be needed, it can be taken immediately with any disputes resolved later. In such cases London Underground does not need to give notice of its intended step-in.
<P>

<a name="11116w01.html_para3">It is for London Underground to determine the appropriate number of staff to be employed for inspection and step-in, and to set the relevant budgets.

<a name="11116w01.html_wqn21"><B> Mr. Coleman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will deem approval by the HSE of the safety case for the London Underground PPP arrangements to be a guarantee that the PPP regime is safe; and if he will make a statement.  [14519]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w01.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 It is the responsibility of London Underground Ltd. under health and safety legislation to ensure safety on the underground network. It is the role of the Health and Safety Executive to assess and consider 



<P>
<P><I>16 Nov 2001 : Column: 902W</I><P>
for acceptance London Underground's safety case, and to inspect for compliance as necessary. Acceptance of London Underground's safety case would mean that London Underground had made a satisfactory case under the Railway Safety Case Regulations 2000 to give confidence to the HSE that it has the ability, commitment, and resources to properly assess and effectively control risks to the health and safety of the public, staff and contractors.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what proposals he has to request the National Audit Office to review, prior to the award of the contracts, the value for money of the proposed PPP for the London Underground; and if he will make a statement.  [14514]

<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w01.html_spnew20"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 As the Duty Holder under the relevant legislation, London Underground is responsible for ensuring that safety risks are reduced to as low as reasonably practical. The independent Health and Safety Executive is responsible for safety regulation of London Underground.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what contingency plans he proposes to put in place in the event of insolvency by one or more of the infracos in the London Underground PPP; and if he will make a statement.  [14487]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w01.html_spnew21"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Greater London Authority Act 1999 contains specific provisions to protect the public interest should an infrastructure company perform poorly and be at risk of becoming insolvent (sections 220&#150;224).
<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w01.html_wqn29"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will indicate <i>(a)</i> for each year of the first seven and a half year period and <i>(b)</i> for the total of the first seven and a half years of the infraco contracts for the PPP of London Underground, what proportion of investment will come from (i) the private sector and (ii) the public sector; and if he will make a statement.  [14484]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w01.html_spnew22"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The plans for the modernisation of the Underground will deliver around &#163;13 billion of investment to improve the underground's infrastructure over the next 15 years. London Underground is in the process of negotiating the contracts to deliver these plans. It is currently estimated that in the first seven and a half years some 25 per cent. of finance for these plans will be provided by the private sector, with the remainder coming from London Underground fares and Government grant.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement as to which risks will be transferred to the private sector under the London Underground PPP, and the extent to which those risks will be transferred.  [14497]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w01.html_spnew27"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In line with Treasury guidance, the Government's plans for the London Underground follow the principle that risks should be allocated to whoever is best able to manage them. The aim is not to transfer risk for its own sake, as this would lead to a decline in value for money, but rather to optimise the transfer of risk.

The average monthly maintenance cost has fallen to &#163;240,000, including security, rates and services.

 The regeneration of the Greenwich Peninsula is a key element in developing this part of east London, and driving the transformation of the Thames Gateway.
<P>

<a name="11116w02.html_para2">The development of the 300 acre peninsula site is creating a template for future mixed use development and is bringing unprecedented regeneration benefits to a part of London which was inactive for many years. In doing so, English Partnerships, the Government's regeneration agency, has transformed one of the largest tracts of derelict land in Europe. The development area, which also contains the new North Greenwich Interchange, includes the United Kingdom's first Millennium Village; Britain's first low energy Sainsbury's food store; Britain's largest B&Q store; Europe's first round multiplex cinema; a fully integrated school and health centre and a 162-bed hotel.

In addition there are 50 acre of parks, open spaces and new river walks and cycle path, together with a new river pier and a new yacht club.
<P>

<a name="11116w02.html_para3">Like many others, including the London borough of Greenwich, the Government are committed to the Dome staying in Greenwich. It is an important landmark on the London skyline which has hastened the regeneration of Greenwich peninsula and more widely and has added to the quality and variety of world-famous structures that were already so prominent in the area. Delivering a successful future for the Dome will build on this, ensuring continued recognition world-wide and enabling the regeneration momentum that has been established to continue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w02.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Over the last six weeks air services across the UK have been in a state of flux. Routes have been cancelled, put on hold, reduced in terms of frequency, moved between airports and put back on by another airline.
<P>

<a name="11116w02.html_para5">BAA reported that at their airports their worst affected routes were the North Atlantic down 25.9 per cent. in September (38 per cent. in the period after the 11 September). However growth has continued in Scotland, figures for October show Edinburgh up 13 per cent. and Glasgow up 7 per cent., Stansted has also recorded growth of 5 per cent. These increases are largely the result of the continued development of low cost airlines.
<P>

<a name="11116w02.html_para6">The Government are working hard to help return the aviation industry to business as usual as quickly as possible. We are carrying out a fundamental review of aviation security to ensure that air travel is as safe from terrorist attacks as we can make it while, at the same time, balancing security with our freedom to travel.

 This is primarily a commercial decision for airlines and airports. The CAA as the economic regulator of airports can also consider complaints. Low cost airlines have no impact on the security of passengers as the security measures required by DTLR do not depend on whether an airline is low cost or high cost.

 As I said in my answer of 6 November 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 138W, to my hon. Friend, the primary responsibility for ensuring that a bus is not overcrowded lies with the driver.

 We have received numerous representations from the airline industry and others on the effects of the events of 11 September.
<P>

<a name="11116w03.html_para5">The Government recognise the importance of the aviation industry to the UK economy and is therefore paying close attention to the industry's current problems. We moved quickly to underwrite, on a temporary basis, third party war risk insurance for UK airlines and service providers to the airline industry. The initiative has subsequently been widely copied elsewhere. The European Commission has set out guidelines on emergency aid measures which were endorsed at the meeting of European Transport Ministers on 16 October. We support the Commission's stance and are actively considering whether further aid should be paid to the British airline industry in accordance with the guidelines.

will announce the results of the consultation exercise on the needs indices to be used in the allocation of 2002&#150;03 housing capital resources to local authorities and registered social landlords.  [15790]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w03.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Decisions have now been taken about the needs indices to be used in the allocation of housing capital resources for 2002&#150;03. I am arranging for details of the indices to be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="11116w03.html_para6">The Department issued a consultation paper in July seeking views on the development of the indices, including some specific proposals for changes to the indices for 2002&#150;03. Some 80 responses were received. A list of the respondents is available in the Library of the House and individual responses can be viewed in the Department's Library.
<P>

<a name="11116w03.html_para7">The responses reflect the difficulty of striking the right balance over the differing housing needs around the country. Responses from London argued that the revised indices would not give sufficient weight to the need to provide additional affordable housing in areas of high demand; those from northern regions raised concerns that the proposed changes do not adequately reflect the problems of area renewal and housing market failure.
<P>

<a name="11116w03.html_para8">The Indices of Deprivation 2000 (ID2000) were adopted last year as the basis for the future allocation of resources to deprived areas. The consultation paper set out a proposal for moving to base the targeting of housing capital resources on the most deprived areas as identified in ID2000. We have decided to proceed with this change. ID2000 is a more up to date, broader based measure and is a clear improvement on the largely, 1991 Census-based Index of Local Conditions on which the targeting is currently based. Work is either planned or being undertaken to address the acknowledged weaknesses in the housing element of ID2000 and the absence of a crime measure.
<P>

<a name="11116w03.html_para9">Most LAs are unaffected by moving to use ID2000 but a small number of authorities face sizeable shifts in index shares. We will, as indicated in the consultation paper, apply transitional arrangements to phase the impact of this change in over three years.
<P>

<a name="11116w03.html_para10">We have also decided to proceed with the three other proposed changes&#151;the introduction of a low demand indicator into the LA index; the increase in the share of the LA index accounted for by the LA stock indicator; and the revised basis for the index used to allocate Disabled Facilities Grant resources. The transitional arrangements will also apply to these changes.
<P>

<a name="11116w03.html_para11">The housing capital resources for LAs for 2002&#150;03 will be allocated through the Single Capital Pot (SCP). The performance-related component (5 per cent.) within this is much less than has applied to housing allocations in earlier years (50 per cent.). The consultation paper indicated that we did not consider it right for the better performing authorities to face the whole impact of this in one year. The consultation paper proposed that the transitional arrangements should be applied in a way which also covered the reduction in the size of the performance element. We have decided to address this in a different way by allocating a part, one third, of the formulaic housing element of the SCP on the basis of performance assessments. This has the advantage of much greater transparency and it also reflects the latest

performance assessments rather than being fixed on the 2000 assessments as would have been the case under the initial proposal.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will estimate the additional average cost of providing pedestrian protection in the Honda Civic car; which car has the best pedestrian protection rating to date in the European New Car Assessment Programme; and which cars have been assessed at 65 per cent. or above in the EEVC Working Group 10 tests.  [15679]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Honda Civic has the best Euro NCAP pedestrian protection result to date, with a score of 72 per cent. We estimate that the additional vehicle manufacturing cost of the Honda Civic relating to pedestrian protection to be around &#163;6.50. We have made no specific estimate of the extra running costs linked to pedestrian protection.
<P>

<a name="11116w04.html_para0">The Euro NCAP pedestrian test currently allows a mix of best and worst positions, chosen by manufacturers and Euro NCAP respectively.
<P>

<a name="11116w04.html_para1">However, we believe that significant further modification would be required for the vehicle to meet the full EEVC WG10 or the later WG17 requirements, resulting in a further increase in manufacturing and running costs. In a separate series of DTLR funded research tests using the EEVC WG17 procedures and criteria, the Honda Civic was subject to 19 tests. The results are summarised below.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w05.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Direct selling is regulated under a range of consumer legislation. The Consumer Protection (Cancellation of Contracts Concluded away from Business Premises) Regulations (The Doorstep Selling Regulations), govern doorstep sales and were strengthened in 1998. New Distance Selling Regulations, governing telephone and internet sales, came into force in October 2000. Local Trading Standards departments are responsible for the enforcement of these regulations. Breaches of the regulations that result in harm to the collective interests of consumers could also be grounds for the courts to make a Stop Now Order requiring the company concerned to cease the offending conduct. Under The Stop Now Order (E. C. Directive) Regulations, which came into force on 1 June 2001, the power to apply for such Orders is held by the Director General of Fair Trading, local authority trading standards officers, and sectoral regulators.
<P>

<a name="11116w05.html_para9">In the case of gas and electricity, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) introduced a Marketing Licence Condition in 1998 that governs the sales and marketing practices of suppliers. The Licence Condition was strengthened in January 2001. Ofgem closely monitors the sales and marketing activities of suppliers, and, where necessary, it will take formal action against individual suppliers.
<P>

<a name="11116w05.html_para10">In addition, I have recently written to all gas and electricity suppliers to express my concern about the distress caused by incidences of sales malpractice and demand that suppliers improve their performances. Consumers affected by sales malpractice not only form a negative view of an individual company, but also of the competitive market as a whole. It is in suppliers' own interests to maintain the highest possible sales standards, to resolve problems rapidly where they occur and to ensure that the consumer is content with the outcome.

 <i>[holding answer 9 November 2001]:</i> Among the Performance and Innovation Unit report recommendations, all of which were accepted by Government, was that there should be a programme of modernisation and reinvention of the urban network. This reinvention programme will not be relevant to community post offices, defined by Post Office Ltd. as small rural offices with restricted opening hours, which fall within the rural network of offices serving settlements with less than 10,000 residents.

 <i>[holding answer 13 November 2001]:</i> I have been informed by Post Office Ltd. that it acts as agent for the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in issuing motor vehicle licences through 4,000 post offices. In order to safeguard the interests of taxpayers, DVLA has to ensure that the relicensing service is cost effective. Under the present arrangements, increasing the number of post offices offering the facility increases the costs without increasing the total revenue collected. With the completion of the Horizon automation programme, we are considering the scope for extending the facility more widely without additional cost to DVLA.

 The civil war in Sudan started decades before the oil project came on stream in 1999. The main fields are in or close to an area of longstanding conflict between pro and anti government Nuer militias. It is not clear that oil has significantly affected this situation. We are engaged, with our EU partners, in an effort to encourage the Government to be more transparent about the use to which it puts its oil revenues. The Government's assurances that the majority are devoted to development expenditure would be all the more convincing if they were backed up by clear data.

<a name="11116w08.html_para2">European Union Heads of Mission held a meeting with the Sudanese Minister of Finance on this subject on 6 November. But the overall objective remains to achieve a lasting peace, which alone will bring an end to suffering in Sudan. In that respect we warmly welcome Senator Danforth's mission to Sudan and intend to work closely with our US and EU colleagues, and interested regional parties, to try to achieve renewed progress.

<a name="11116w09.html_spnew3"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Department has a range of measures to increase access to those without computers particularly for those who live in disadvantaged areas. We are committed to establishing 6,000 UK online centres in England by the end of 2002. There are currently over 1900 UK online centres in operation with more opening each month. They offer access and support to people who have not used, or are not familiar with the internet. In addition we are investing in wiring up communities. Seven pilot projects are exploring how the benefits of access to information and communication technology, including the internet, will help individuals to develop new skills, access job opportunities and become more involved in their communities.
<P>

<a name="11116w09.html_para2">Excellent progress is being made to improve computer/student ratios in schools, further education colleges and higher education institutions. 97 per cent. of all schools are now connected to the internet.

 The educational maintenance allowance (EMA) scheme is still in the pilot stage. There are currently eight different variants of the scheme being tested in a total of 56 local education authorities.
<P>

<a name="11116w09.html_para3">The Department has commissioned the Centre for Research and Social Policy to carry out a rigorous three-year evaluation study of the pilots which is now in its third year of data collection. The study is examining each of the EMA variants to determine their effect upon participation, retention and achievement in further education. It is an extensive study not only of hard figures on take-up of EMAs but also includes interviews with local practitioners and partners. 20,000 interviews will be carried out with young people from both pilot and control areas to examine what factors influence their decisions at age 16 when considering post-compulsory education.




<P>
<P><I>16 Nov 2001 : Column: 930W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11116w09.html_para4">Early findings of the study show that EMAs are having a positive effect not only on participation and retention but also on student behaviour. However, it is important that we do not make any decisions on the future of EMAs until we have received satisfactory evaluation conclusions.

<a name="11116w10.html_para2">Some mountainous areas of Afghanistan may become cut off by snow during the winter months. WFP are in the process of procuring snowploughs and other equipment to support their trucking operations in these regions. They have already begun snow clearance in the Anjuman Pass&#151;the main north-east route into the Panjsheer Valley. As a last resort, WFP are also looking at the possibility of airdropping food to vulnerable people living in snowbound areas of Afghanistan.

<a name="11116w10.html_para3">The changing situation on the ground opens up new opportunities for us to improve humanitarian programmes and give better access to some of the most vulnerable people. Plans are now being made for the international staff of humanitarian agencies to return to parts of Afghanistan as soon as possible. Those agencies should now be able to accelerate deliveries so that winter stockpiles can be built closer to people who need them. However, such progress is dependant on improved security.

 There are no plans to introduce any further restrictions on eligibility for jury service. However, a person suffering from asthma, or any other illness, can apply to the Crown court to be excused from service on the ground of personal hardship. It will ultimately be for a judge to decide whether a person should be excused for this reason.

Ectopic pregnancy can be life threatening. The test described does not involve any form of physical intervention as the child is asked to give samples to enable the tests, and will voluntarily agree to provide these samples. Therefore there can be no question of assault by staff. The potential of pregnancy in a very young child may raise the question of abuse which, once the child's health has been safeguarded, may require further investigation. Following the case of Gillick, the courts have held that children who have sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable them to understand fully what is involved in an intervention will also have the capacity to consent to that intervention.

 <i>[holding answer 14 November 2001]:</i> Composition of the independent reconfiguration panel (IRP) will follow the modernisation board model of one third professionals, one third managers and one third patients' and citizens' representatives. Dr. Peter Barrett has been appointed chair of the IRP. The members are being selected through open competition and the interviews are due to take place shortly. The aim is to complete the appointments process by the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="11116w14.html_para6">The panel's draft terms of reference were outlined in the press release accompanying Dr. Barrett's appointment. These will need to be agreed with the panel membership before being confirmed. The panel will provide authoritative advice to the Secretary of State on referred proposals for national health service service change. The panel will publish the advice it gives in relation to each proposal referred to them by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="11116w14.html_para7">The IRP will have a crucial role in advising on the outcome of significant reconfigurations, making the process more transparent and accountable. It is important to have public confidence in the panel and the processes it will use in its deliberations.
<P>

<a name="11116w14.html_para8">We propose to hold a simulation exercise early in the new year to which all major stakeholders will be invited to participate. We are also committed to consulting widely on the criteria that the panel will use. The simulation exercise will form part of the consultation process.

 The latest evidence suggests that the annual cost of hip fractures in the United Kingdom is in excess of &#163;1.7 billion. Hip fractures are caused mainly by osteoporosis. Through the National Service Framework for Older People we have signalled the importance of addressing osteoporosis. This document sets targets and milestones for local health and social care systems to establish an integrated falls service, which will include appropriate interventions and advice to prevent osteoporotic fracture.
<P>

<a name="11116w15.html_para0">We welcome the National Osteoporosis Society's primary care strategy for falls and osteoporosis. This strategy, involving many different agencies, is an excellent example of the type of integrated approach that is likely to be successful in the long term. We hope that local health care providers make its implementation a priority in their work to develop the osteoporosis aspects of integrated falls services.

<a name="11116w16.html_para0">While it would have been possible to reduce the duration of the now deferred docking period, the optimum solution in the current operational circumstances is to carry out the shorter assisted maintenance period at Ocean's home port of Portsmouth, rather than dock the vessel. This will also maximise the time ships staff can spend with their families before rejoining the vessel if she is required for operational deployment.

There have been no cases in the last four years within defence where it has been decided not to proceed with a project because of financial comparisons with the public sector comparator.

For all of the services there is limited correlation between intake and gains to the trained strength because the date of entry and date of completing training will often fall in different financial years.The figures reflect not just the completion of basic training but also the initial specialist training required to allow each person to join the trained strength of his/her service.<P>

 Informal discussions initially took place between the Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA) and the Welsh Development Agency (WDA) during October and November 2000.

 No formal assessment of the cost of retaining four sites within the Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA) has been carried out. I refer my hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I receive regular Battle Damage Assessment reports and am kept updated on significant developments. The success of missions is not measured in terms of a percentage but against the achievement of military objectives. Our objectives of destroying terrorist camps and creating the right conditions for future action in Afghanistan, including possible humanitarian or stabilisation operations, have been met. As recent events show, we are also making progress on our objective of limiting the Taliban's ability to protect and support Osama bin Laden and the al-Quaeda organisation.

Until the 'Stepping Stone' approach to commissions was introduced on 1 March 1999, short service commission (SSC) officers could convert to regular commission (Reg. C) or special regular commission (SRC). Subsequently, the standard progression has been from SSC to intermediate regular commission (IRC) and then to Reg. C. As a result, fewer officers now go direct from SSC to Reg. C. <P>

 Details of the numbers of domestic violence incidents recorded by police forces, obtained from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary Annual Statistical Return, are given in the table. The definition of domestic violence incidents used for the 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 figures is as follows:
<P>

<a name="11116w19.html_para0">Any violence between current or former partners in an intimate relationship, wherever and whenever the violence occurs. The violence may include physical, sexual, emotional or financial abuse.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what discussions he had with the police prior to the amendment of the Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997 to the effect that only alcohol in unsealed containers may now be seized; and if he will make a statement.  [12092]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 2 November 2001]:</i> Section 29 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 amends section 1 of the Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997 and increases the power of police in respect of under-age drinkers because it now

allows them to confiscate alcohol, and alcohol containers which have been opened, from under-age drinkers in public places.
<P>

<a name="11116w19.html_para4">The 1997 Act was deliberately amended by the 2001 Act to ensure consistency between new police powers to confiscate alcohol (but not sealed alcohol containers) from any person in a public place designated for the purpose by the relevant local authority, and the measures contained within the 1997 Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act.
<P>

<a name="11116w19.html_para5">Prior to the Act discussions on the provisions were held with representatives of the Association of Chief Police Officers and individual forces who had included confiscation powers within the model byelaw on banning drinking in public places.

 I intend to work with service providers on a voluntary code on retention of communications data as part of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill. This is an important element of our drive against terrorism and crime. I propose that compulsory powers should be held in reserve and subject to further consideration by Parliament.

 Officials met representatives of service providers on 24 October to discuss provisions on communications data retention contained in the Anti- Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill. The meeting was a useful opportunity for Government at an early stage of the process to hear the views of industry representatives. The industry has of course been in dialogue with the Department of Trade and Industry over the last two months and we have reflected the representations made. As I said on 15 October in my statement to the House, we are very grateful to the providers. The Government look forward to continuing co-operation with industry on this important issue and to developing a code of practice with industry to implement the provisions of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Next year we will be testing a sample of sheep brains for signs of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) including scrapie. At present the number of sheep to be tested is 23,000 but this may increase. The relevant European Union legislation requires that, if a test performed under that legislation gives a positive result for the presence of TSEs, the sample material must be genotyped. This will reveal any case where the sheep had a scrapie-resistant genotype.
<P>

<a name="11116w21.html_para5">We are also carrying out experiments to see if sheep that are fully resistant to scrapie can be infected with BSE. Over five years the sheep will be culled so that, using a range of available tests, their tissues can be examined for signs of infectivity. Results so far have been very encouraging, as infectivity has not been detected.

<P>

<a name="11116w21.html_para7">One key policy objective is to secure further positive change to the common agricultural policy, framing much of our domestic agriculture policy. In particular, we want to see market price support and production controls phased out, with transitional support payments to help farmers to adjust. This should be complemented by a shift towards the "second pillar" of the CAP, expanding the resources available for targeted support for rural development and agri-environment schemes.

<P>

<a name="11116w22.html_para0">Before a BIP can operate it has to be approved by officials of the European Commission Food and Veterinary Office (FVO). FVO veterinary experts will inspect the facility to ensure that the layout, structure and procedures comply with Community requirements.

<a name="11116w24.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Ann Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list the principal changes her Department is seeking on reform of the common agricultural policy.  [12812]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The CAP needs further reform to deliver better outputs for our farmers, consumers and taxpayers. The Government are committed to striving to secure a more economically rational CAP, and one which is sustainable in relation to the countryside environment and rural economy. In particular, the Government want to see market price support and production controls phased out, with transitional support payments to help farmers to adjust. This should be complemented by a shift towards the "second pillar" of the CAP, expanding the resources available for targeted support for rural development and agri-environment schemes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she will reply to the letter from the hon. Member for West Chelmsford of 29 May on behalf of his constituent Mr. J. Matchett of Langton Ave., Chelmsford; and if she will make a statement about the reason for the delay in replying.  [8266]<P>

<P>
<a name="11116w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 October 2001]:</i> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for the delay in providing a reply to his letter. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Rural Affairs replied to his letter yesterday. We have recently identified a real problem with the correspondence system which has led to a backlog of correspondence which Ministers and officials are working hard to clear. I am sorry the hon. Gentleman's letter was caught in that backlog.

<a name="11116w24.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Liddell-Grainger: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action she is taking to speed up the process of the collection of cattle and assist farmers with welfare problems in Exmoor.  [10778]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11116w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under the animal movement restrictions which apply to control the spread of foot and mouth disease, collection for movement is permitted to only a single destination on any one day at present.
<P>

<a name="11116w24.html_para0">Following representations from Exmoor farmers, veterinary advice is that provided there is proper cleansing and disinfection between batches, it will be possible to allow more than one operation per day of gathering for movement to a single destination, without an undue increase in disease risk. Officials are therefore finalising changes to the collecting centre procedures to allow more than one batch per day subject to cleansing and disinfection between each batch and these should be implemented shortly.
