changes arose from a key recommendation of the 2002 independent review
of the CRB and were supported by the recent Bichard inquiry that
recommended reducing the number of registered bodies from over 14,000

that revealed that up to a third of registered bodies were not fully
complying with the guidance and the code of practice and explanatory

[81120]</p><p><a name="06070447000994"><b><a name="06070447001509">Ian
Pearson:</b> The cause of the green bloom in the waters of the
Hampshire Avon below Amesbury is likely to be a combination of
environmental factors, including high temperatures, low water flow and
consequential increases in the concentration of nutrients. There have
been no significant pollution incidents at this location in the river.
Rainfall and river flows have been significantly depressed over the
last 20 months and, in combination with other environmental factors,
this may create opportunities for algal growth. However, the May 2006
period was characterised by periods of very high rainfall. Urban and
agricultural runoff may lead to direct discolouration and also
contribute to nutrient enrichment in the
river.</p><p><a name="06070447000995">There is, and
has been, significant investment and action to improve the quality for
the Hampshire Avon in recent
years.</p><p><a name="06070447000996">For example,
four Wessex Water sewage treatment works discharging into the River
Avon have had phosphate stripping installed in their treatment process
as part of the previous environmental programme periodic review. Wessex
Water's current water quality environment programme for 2005-10
includes schemes to further reduce nutrient loads from sewage effluent
discharges. By the end of the 2010 period, two additional sewage
treatment works discharging into the River Avon are expected to receive
phosphate stripping and the phosphate limits set for the four original
works are expected to be reduced to half of their currently permitted
limit.</p><p><a name="06070447000997">In
addition, as part of the requirement introduced by the habitats
directive, the Environment Agency have asked Wessex Water to review
their abstractions on the Hampshire Avon and assess their effect on the
ecology of the river. The findings from this project, which will
conclude by March 2008, will contribute to the Habitats Directive
Review of Consents and may result in a requirement to reduce the amount
of water abstracted by the water company, or for other improvements to
be made in the companies&#146; water management
operations.</p><p><a name="06070447000998">Most
recently, the Hampshire Avon catchment has been identified as a
priority catchment under the England Catchment-Sensitive Farming
Delivery Initiative (ECSFDI). The key objective of this initiative is
to raise awareness of agricultural pollution and encourage farmers to
take 
<br><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>4 July 2006 : Column 902W</b><br>action to mitigate the impact of agriculture on the
water environment, including the reduction of nutrient
inputs.</p><p><a name="06070447000999">The water
framework directive (WFD) is a key driver of future action on water
quality. The directive came into force on 22 December 2000 and requires
member states to establish a range of measures to manage water quality
by 2009 and to make them operational by 2012. A central objective of
the directive is that water bodies should aim to reach good ecological
and chemical status by 2015. We are working with stakeholders to
develop mechanisms to tackle pressures, including both point and
diffuse sources, for inclusion in River Basin Management Plans, and aim
to consult on potential options for tackling non-agricultural,
agricultural and hydromorphological pressures in the later part of
2006.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06070447000005">International

(SWAp) is reviewed jointly, twice a year by Government and donors, of
whom DFID is the largest with a commitment of &#163;100 million over
six years.</p><p><a name="06070447001015">Progress
has been good. In addition to the earlier successes of the eradication
of polio and the elimination of neonatal tetanus and the increasing
distribution of bed nets and their re-treatment (up from 7 per cent. in
2002 to 71 per cent. in 2004-05), the health service has taken on a
rapid increase in antiretroviral treatment for HIV and AIDS. 50 sites
have treated 46,000 people up from 3,000 two years ago. This is making
a real difference: both saving lives and improving the quality of life
of those living with HIV and
AIDS.</p><p><a name="06070447001016">Critical
to this success has been the additional resources made available at
hospital and clinic level as a result of the increased aid channelled
through the health SWAp. The Emergency Human Resources Programme has in
its first year recruited an extra 580 Malawian health professionals.
There are 60 volunteer specialists and nurse tutors from overseas
filling key vacant posts. The intake of Malawian trainee nurses and
doctors has been increased in anticipation of the improvements in
infrastructure at training schools that are now under way. New,
internationally recruited senior managers have taken over the central
medical stores management and are charged with bringing to an end the
perennial stock outs that have frustrated the health services. A new
maternal mortality road map offers a way forward to address the
unacceptably high level of maternal deaths in Malawi. The Ministry of
Health is entering service level agreements with private sector
providers, particularly the Christian Hospital Association of Malawi,
that will also provide the basic essential health package
free-of-charge at point of
delivery.</p><p><a name="06070447001017">We are
encouraging the Government of Malawi to plan for universal access for
HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment and to address the further human
resources and management requirements that will create. We stand ready
to help.</p>

it is for directors of each company to determine its content according

formula is used to distribute the vast majority of the funding support
provided for capital highways maintenance. The factors currently
considered in this formula relate to roads and bridges. For roads, they
are the lengths and conditions of an authority's principal, classified
non-principal and unclassified roads. For bridges, they are the size of
the bridge stock and the numbers of bridges requiring strengthening or
major maintenance. A minimum amount for bridges per authority of
&#163;100,000 is applied. The combined roads and bridges allocations
are adjusted to ensure an authority's total allocation does not vary by
more than 25 per cent. from the previous
year.</p><p><a name="06070450000061">Secondly,
a formula is being introduced to influence the distribution of the

and public transport, each of which generally costs less than &#163;5
million). The factors considered in this formula are related directly
or indirectly to the transport shared priorities, as agreed between
Government and the Local Government Association in 2002. The priorities
and variables are shown in the following table. In addition, the
formulaic distribution of funding takes into account previous
ministerial commitments, European Union objective one designations and

Hoyle:</b> To ask the Secretary of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs whether the Government will consider
the forthcoming referendum in Gibraltar to approve the new constitution

[82615]</p><p><a name="06070466000018"><b><a name="06070466000073">Mr.
Hoon:</b> As my right hon. Friend the then Foreign Secretary
(Mr Jack Straw) set out in his written ministerial statement of 27
March 2006, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 44-46W, the new
constitution provides for a modern and mature relationship between the
UK and Gibraltar. I do not think that this description would apply to
any relationship based on colonialism. The constitution confirms the
right of self-determination of the Gibraltarian people. The realisation
of that right must be promoted and respected in conformity with the
provisions of the UN Charter and any other applicable international
treaties. Gibraltar's right of self-determination is not constrained by
the Treaty of Utrecht except insofar as Article X gives Spain the right
of refusal should Britain ever renounce Sovereignty. Thus independence
would only be an option with Spanish consent. Her Majesty's Government
recognise that the act of deciding on their acceptance of the new
constitution in the forthcoming referendum will be an exercise of the
right of self-determination by the Gibraltarian people in that
context.</p><p><a name="06070466000019">The new
constitution does not in any way diminish British sovereignty and gives
Gibraltar much greater control over its internal affairs and that
degree of self-government compatible with British sovereignty and the
UK's continuing international responsibilities. If the new constitution
is agreed the UK will retain its full international responsibility for
Gibraltar, including for Gibraltar's external relations and defence,
and as the member state responsible for Gibraltar in the EU. The UK's
long standing commitment that the UK will never enter into arrangements
under which the people of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of
another state against their wishes will be unchanged. This is also set
out clearly in the Despatch which will be published at the same time as
the Gibraltar Constitution Order and the draft of which I will place in
the Library of the House. I will also send a copy to my hon.
Friend.</p><p><a name="06070466000020">It has also
been the UK's long standing view that none of its remaining overseas
territories, including Gibraltar, should remain on the UN list of non
self-governing territories, despite the different circumstances
affecting Gibraltar, namely the application of the Treaty of Utrecht as
noted earlier. However, the criteria used by the UN are outdated and
fail to take account of the way that relationships between the UK and
its overseas territories have been modernised. The UK does not,
therefore, engage formally to seek the removal of any of the overseas
territories from the UN list.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06070466000005">Gurkha

who rely on this type of fuel. The Department for Social Development
and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive will continue to take action
to mitigate the impact on elderly people through the provision of

Housing Executive is recognised by all sections of the community as
being extremely fair in its allocations, policies. However, applicants
for social housing have a choice of where they wish to live and as a
result less than 10 per cent. of social housing is integrated, the
majority of people preferring to live in areas where they felt
comfortable. The choice of where to live therefore impacts
significantly on the number of allocations that can be made in specific
areas, as this depends on the availability of social housing, whether
through new building or re-letting of existing stock. In some areas
demand is greater than supply, while in others, the opposite is true
and allocations cannot therefore be made at the same ratio for all
areas. This does mean that some people will have to consider other
areas in order to be re-housed or have to wait longer before they are
re-housed. To make allocations on the basis of religious belief would
be illegal under the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and the Fair Employment

are those at Ballygowan Road/Deerpark Road and Ballygowan Road South.
However, a right turn facility at the Ballygowan/Deerpark Road junction
will be constructed later this financial year, and a similar facility
will be constructed at the Ballygowan Road South junction during the
2007/2008 financial year. The only other section of the A8 with no

possibly be aware that the Belfast Metropolitan Transportation Plan
supports dualling this section, including the completion of the
Ballynure Bypass. Subsequently, the Department has sought, through the
Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan, to protect the land required for this
scheme. It is currently expected that the implementation of this scheme
will be outside the 2015 Plan period. On completion of the dual
carriageway, the priority junctions will be reduced to left-in
left-out, without the need to perform right turns, other than at the
main roundabouts.</p></ul><a name="06070476000498"><ul><p class="tabletext">On
the Al Belfast to Newry road, there are currently two junctions which

the west side of the Al, and Cloughanramer Road which is just north of
the Damolly Roundabout and to the east of the A1. However, this section
of the Al will be superseded by the planned Beech Hill to Cloghogue
dual carriageway upgrade, which is included in Package 2 of Roads

Prentice:</b> The Better Regulation Task Force (BRTF) report:
&#147;Better Routes to Redress&#148; published in May 2004 found
that the &#147;compensation culture&#148; is a myth, because the
number of claims and litigation is not in fact rising. But that it is a
damaging myth that needs to be tackled, because the widespread belief
that claims are rising leads to a disproportionate fear of litigation
and risk averse behaviour.</p><p><a name="06070491000016">The
Government are therefore taking forward a wide ranging programme of
work, with the core objectives of preventing a compensation culture
from developing; tackling perceptions that can lead to a
disproportionate fear of litigation and risk averse behaviour; finding
ways to discourage and resist bad claims; and improving the system for
those with a valid claim for compensation.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06070491000003">Departmental

in the UK provides one indicator on the destination of the bulk of
remittance flows out of the UK. Estimates of the size of UK remittance
market can be found in the report of the UK Remittances Working
Group<sup>(1)</sup>, established in 2004 by the Department for
International Development (DFID). This shows that DFID believes the
most reliable estimate for total remittances from the UK to developing
countries to be &#163;2.3 billion in 2005 and that&#151;based on
the size of diaspora communities&#151;the primary developing country
recipients of UK remittances are India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the
