Tackling the deficit is unavoidable and while there will have to be cuts in order to restore health to the public finances, the forthcoming spending review will be a crucial stepping stone on the way to recovery.</p>

 The Academy Model Articles of Association provide for a structure which would allow those who are setting up the academy trust (for example the existing governing body of a converting Catholic school) to decide who should be the members of the academy trust. The members are in turn responsible for deciding who should appoint, and who should be, the governors of the academy trust. Where the school has an existing foundation-for example in the case of voluntary aided faith schools-we would expect that foundation to be the lead member of the new academy trust which could then appoint a majority of the governors. There is no impediment to the members of the academy trust agreeing that a majority of foundation governors be appointed by a religious trusteeship.</p>

 It is possible that any future culling operation will generate policing costs.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many outbreaks of the potato disease Dickeya solani have been detected in England in <i> (a)</i> 2009 and <i> (b)</i> 2010 to date; what the origin is of this infection; and what steps her Department is taking to ensure that the outbreak is contained.

 'Dickeya solani' is a bacterium (not yet officially named) of the Dickeya genus which affects potatoes. It is already present in Europe and is spreading on seed potatoes of Dutch origin. In consultation with industry representatives, it has been confirmed that quarantine status (i.e. exclusion and control through the EU Plant Health Directive (2000/29/EC)) would not be appropriate for 'D.solani' due to its distribution in the EU. It is controlled; like every blackleg (bacterial disease of potatoes), through visual inspections during seed potato classification. Laboratory analysis is necessary to differentiate the 'D. solani' strain from other blackleg causing strains (Pectobactehum atrosepticum and Dickeya dianthicola). The Seed Potato Classification Scheme (SPCS) includes tolerances for blackleg, including 'D. solani' where these are exceeded the crop involved is downgraded or failed.</p>

The origin of the seed stocks involved was the Netherlands.</p>

In 15 of the 18 cases the seed potatoes-involved originated from the Netherlands. In the other three cases the seed potatoes had been multiplied in England,  <br>

This includes a newly proposed three year project funded by the Potato Council and Scottish Executive which incorporates a survey of seed potato crops in England and Wales to further explore the distribution of 'D. solani' within the SPCS.

The model also omits a number of key policy measures that are difficult to assign to households, but which are likely to impact on incomes and/or employment-for instance, changes to corporation tax and capital gains tax.

 Following the extension of the statutory minimum bus concession in April 2008, to provide free off-peak local bus travel anywhere in England to eligible older and disabled people, the Department for Transport has provided special grant funding to local authorities of £212 million in 2008-09, £217 million in 2009-10 and £223 million in 2010-11. This is in addition to the funding that the Department for Communities and Local Government provides each year for concessionary travel through the formula grant process.

Relates to the total cost for (a) leased cars, (b) car hire, (c) vehicle running costs, (d) minor repairs and (e) car maintenance (the DVLA does not own any vehicles). These figures also represent the total for Great Britain (as the agency does not hold such information by individual region) and to perform such an exercise would incur disproportionate costs. The increased forecast costs are due to: leasing contracts due for renewal at increased costs, introduction of new tasks, business adviser trainers numbers reduced resulting in more travelling to cover a wider geographical area, setting up of new Central Processing Unit resulting in initial additional travel costs regarding training etc. Additionally the Central Processing Unit (set up in March 2010) will result in increased travel costs of senior managers covering Swansea and Manchester Central Processing Units. The departments Corporate Assurance Services will be carrying out significantly increased numbers of External Data User Visits to ensure security. The forecast also includes leases for vehicles to replace trucks that were owned. This cost is new to 2010-11.  5. Relates to (a) purchase, (b) leasing, (c) service, maintenance and repair and (d) fuel. The table represents the expenditure for the GCDA fleet which is located in London. Included in these figures are 16 vehicles that operate out of Cardiff and Bradford, these are rotated among the fleet to level out mileage. The cost relating to these could be separated out only at a disproportionate cost."  6. Relates to expenditure on the Traffic Officer Vehicles and Winter Maintenance Fleet (except 2007-08 which relates to Traffic Officer Fleet only). The Traffic Officer Vehicle figures do not include fuel and consumables. Traffic Officer Vehicles are provided on a lease basis and the Highways Agency is charged a combined monthly fee that includes lease and maintenance. The Highways Agency is forecasting to spend £12.5 million on the purchase of new winter service vehicles this financial year, with £5 million spent to date, over the period April to June 2010. The vehicle supply contract for the new winter fleet was not awarded until January 2008 and as such, costs were not incurred under the contract until later in 2008-09 being year 1 of the supply contract. Before this Highways Agency used the old fleet which was purchased a number of years previously.  7. Relates to (a) purchase, (b) maintenance and (c) fuel in England. Further regional breakdown is available only at disproportionate cost.  8. Figures calculated include: fuel service maintenance and repair insurance premium-we have commercial fully comprehensive insurance GCDA fleet management fees capital purchases, including conversion work all vehicles have been included, e.g. Powers to Stop (PtS), High Risk Traffic Initiative (HRTI) PtS, Roadside Check vans (mobile office) pool cars<br>
2007-08-fuel cost has been calculated pro rata using five months recorded data due to a change in how the data were captured. To calculate actuals would incur disproportionate costs. 2008-09 and 2009-10 had major capital investment for HRTI project and replacement Roadside Check vans.  9.

All such units would be expected to have the expertise to identify patients with lower back pain who could benefit from surgical intervention, to carry out such treatments, and to have arrangements for provision of appropriate rehabilitation. Many other clinicians in the NHS are involved in the diagnosis of lower back pain, including clinicians in primary care and in specialist pain management services.</p>

 The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) currently have the governmental lead on fuel poverty. Their main grant-funded programme is the Warm Front scheme, which can provide a package of tailored insulation and heating improvements and energy advice for private sector households across England. The scheme is aimed at vulnerable, fuel-poor households, some of whom may be terminally ill. Eligibility is determined by receipt of certain means-tested and disability benefits, including disability living allowance (DLA). The number of disabled people receiving Warm Front assistance has increased since 2005-typically, approximately 38% of all those receiving help are in receipt of either DLA or attendance allowance (AA).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="101011w0005.htm_para16"><a name="1010129000114">DLA and AA provide people who have severe disabilities with a contribution towards the extra costs they face because of the effects of their disabilities. People who are terminally ill automatically qualify for the highest rate care component of DLA (they do not have to serve the three-month qualifying period and the benefit is usually paid within 10 days from receipt of claim) or the higher rate of AA. Recipients of DLA or AA have the choice to spend their benefit according to their own priorities, and in a way that best suits their circumstances, including meeting the cost of household fuel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="101011w0005.htm_para17"><a name="1010129000115">Terminally ill people may also receive support through employment and support allowance (ESA). While ESA for the most part uses functional descriptors to assess someone's eligibility for the benefit, there are some non-functional descriptors that would find someone eligible-terminal illness is one of these non-functional descriptors. If someone claims ESA under 'special rules', which apply to those who have a life expectancy of no more than six months, they will be fast-tracked to the ESA Support Group and receive the highest rate of benefit. This will be done on paper-based evidence alone without the claimant having to undergo a face-to-face medical assessment or serve any of the normal assessment phase of ESA.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) provides funding for human resources for health as part of our broader support to health system strengthening in our partner countries. DFID are not able to disaggregate expenditure on human resources from broader health system expenditure.

 Former employees of insolvent employers can claim redundancy payments and other contractual debts such as unpaid wages, notice pay and outstanding holiday pay from the National Insurance Fund. The Insolvency Service's Birmingham Redundancy Payments Office (RPO) is liaising with the administrator of Connaught to establish what payments are due. Once the information is obtained to identify what payments are due they will be made without delay. The RPO aims to pay 78% of claims within three weeks of receipt and 92% within six weeks of receipt.</p>

 Significant work is under way across the higher education sector to strengthen future quality assurance arrangements. The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) launched on 1 October a consultation on a new method for reviewing higher education institutions in England and Northern Ireland from September 2011. The proposed new process is intended to encourage constant improvement in the quality of UK higher education while being proportionate in its demand on resources in institutions. The detail of this work is rightly led by the sector but the Government have a legitimate interest, particularly in respect of ensuring value for money for all public spending, and is keeping in close touch with the QAA and others across the sector on this agenda.</p>

 Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) and other local partnerships have played a strong role in preventing crime and we want them to continue to do so. In order to free local partners from central bureaucracy we are considering whether we can repeal some of the more prescriptive elements of CSP regulations. In addition, the new Police and Crime Commissioners will be enabled to play a considerable role in relation to community safety, and the Government are currently consulting publicly on how Commissioners can best work with criminal justice and community safety partners.</p>

 The Government want to support the public to take a more active role in keeping neighbourhoods safe by working in partnership with the police. We have published a consultation document, "Policing in the 21st Century", setting out proposed national changes to policing. These include encouraging citizens to play their part through joint patrols with the police, looking out for their neighbours and passing on safety tips as part of Neighbourhood Watch groups or as community crime fighters.

 Further to my answer of 6 September 2010, officers are required to complete a report for any occasion where a detainee is restrained which must be passed to the relevant UK Border Agency contract monitor. The report requires officers to set out the circumstances of the situation and to justify why restraint was necessary. It does not, however, require them to stipulate the exact holds and techniques used and the information sought is therefore not recorded.</p>

<i> [holding answer 14 September 2010]:</i> The Government are committed to ending the detention of children for immigration purposes. Our aim is to achieve this in a way which promotes the welfare of children while ensuring the return of families who have no right to be in the UK.

 The UK Border Agency has a policy of not separating children from both parents, or from one in the case of a single-parent family, for immigration purposes other than in exceptional cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_534"><a name="101011w0008.htm_para1"><a name="10101213001252">For example, there may be circumstances where a prisoner, who is also a parent, is released from prison and a decision is made to maintain their detention under immigration powers in order to effect their deportation.

<p><a name="stpa_535"><a name="101011w0008.htm_para2"><a name="10101213001253">However, family separations may occur for other reasons, such as for child protection purposes (which would be a matter for local authority children's services) or where the parent has chosen to split the family by deliberately hiding the whereabouts of their children. Where children are missing the UK Border Agency will work with other statutory agencies, such as the police and local authorities, to try to locate the children and reunite them with their parent.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 September 2010]:</i> The police service needs more freedom from central control, fewer centrally driven targets and less intervention and interference from government. That is why the policing pledge has been abolished and the remaining centrally imposed target on police forces to improve public confidence has been scrapped. In line with this approach, the Home Office does not hold information on the continued use of the policing pledge.</p>

Future police funding will be decided by the spending review, reporting on 20 October 2010.

 The current estimated cost of the referendum on the voting system in Scotland is <i> (a)</i> £6.9 million when combined with the Scottish parliamentary election or <i> (b)</i> £9.9 million if held as a standalone poll.

 The Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, as amended by the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill, sets out the process the Boundary Commissions will follow in drawing up the boundaries of parliamentary constituencies. The Bill would require each Boundary Commission to propose recommendations for constituency boundaries that are in accordance with the Rules for the Distribution of Seats set out at the new schedule 1 to the 1986 Act. The Bill requires that the Boundary Commissions take whatever steps they see fit to inform people of their proposals; and to make copies available for inspection. There follows a 12 week period for representations on Boundary Commissions' proposals. A second 12 week period for representations will follow where proposals are revised. Any further revisions would then be final. Under the provisions of the Bill, the Speaker, as the ex-officio chair of the Boundary Commissions, is required to lay before Parliament a "progress report" in the January of the year before a deadline and each subsequent January until a final report containing the recommended constituencies is submitted to Government.</p>

The four Boundary Commissions must use this UK electoral quota, but it is a matter for each Commission to decide how they communicate this information.

 Maintaining a complete and accurate electoral register is the responsibility of electoral registration officers (EROs), in accordance with their duties under section 9A of the Representation of the People Act 1983. In carrying out this responsibility, as with other aspects of their role, EROs are monitored by the Electoral Commission, which sets performance standards and provides guidance on the performance of their duties. In addition, the Electoral Commission runs campaigns to encourage voter registration and provide information on elections as part of its duty under section 13 (1) (a) of the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act 2000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_595"><a name="101011w0008.htm_para62"><a name="10101213001563">The Government are committed to taking steps to support EROs in their work in improving levels of registration. On 15 September I made a statement to the House, outlining the Government's proposed approach to speeding up the implementation of individual electoral registration and as part of this I announced that we will be trialling data matching during 2011-that is, comparing the electoral register with other public databases to find the people missing from the register. The aim is to tackle under registration, including among those specific groups most affected by it, and ensure that every opportunity to register is available to those currently not on the electoral register. I also announced that we will examine how electoral registration can be integrated into people's day to day transactions with government, for example when they move house, or visit the Post Office, or apply for a passport or driving licence.</p>

 The June 2010 Budget announced a £1,000 increase in the personal allowance for under 65s to £7,475 in 2011-12, with benefits focussed on individuals on low and middle incomes through accompanying changes to the basic rate limit and national insurance upper earnings and profit limits.</p>
