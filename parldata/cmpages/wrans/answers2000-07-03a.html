 The practice of distress for rent is currently being reviewed. I am aware that there are some concerns over this practice and, in particular, its compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights. We are investigating these concerns urgently and any problems identified will be addressed promptly.

 My Department is not currently funding relief operations in the Moluccas, but is willing to do so if safe access is obtained to make the necessary needs assessments. The rise in violence is preventing effective and impartial humanitarian access and has forced most relief agencies to evacuate and suspend their operations. We will continue to monitor the situation through our contacts in the few remaining operational agencies and will reassess our inputs once the security situation stabilises and humanitarian access is once again guaranteed.

We reaffirm our support for the peace efforts being made under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and firmly believe that only a negotiated settlement can bring all the people of Sudan the peace and stability they deserve.

 MAFF has received numerous representations from individuals and organisations concerning the pesticide Lindane. Most of these have expressed concern over the possible environmental or human health effects of the use of Lindane in this country.
<P>

<a name="00703w02.html_para4">The Government act whenever necessary on pesticides in order to safeguard health and protect the environment. In the case of Lindane, using a precautionary assessment, independent scientific advice is that the currently approved agricultural uses of lindane do not pose any unacceptable risk to people. Ministers are currently considering the advice from the independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides on the home garden and non-agricultural uses of Lindane and will announce their conclusions as soon as possible.

<P>
<a name="00703w02.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 June 2000]:</i> All EU countries regulate the safety and efficacy of agricultural pesticides on the basis of scientific data under their respective national legislation. However, a gradual transition is already underway to an EC system of regulation which in addition to safeguarding people and the environment is also aimed at freeing the market in agricultural pesticides by achieving consistent standards between member states.
<P>

<a name="00703w02.html_para5">As such it provides for the mutual recognition of pesticide product approvals and uses granted in other member states.
<P>

<a name="00703w02.html_para6">Officials from the various member states are frequently in contact with each other to discuss the issues relating to harmonisation of the authorisation procedures and the regulation of agricultural pesticides.
<P>

<a name="00703w02.html_para7">The EU has established procedures whereby fertiliser companies can seek to have products designated as "EC Fertilisers" thereby enabling those products to be sold in all member states. Non-EC designated fertiliser products may be sold to another member state only where they comply with that country's domestic legislation.

 <i>[holding answer 27 June 2000]:</i> We have no plans at present to undertake such research.
<P>

<a name="00703w03.html_para0">We have received a number of representations concerning the proportion of organic food which is imported, usually coupled with requests that support for organic conversion be increased. The Government have substantially increased funding for conversion: &#163;12 million has been committed in the current financial year and we plan to spend &#163;140 million on conversion aid over the life of the Rural Development Plan for England.

 There have been no recent changes in the way the sheep annual premium is calculated. As part of the Action Plan for Farming, the Prime Minister announced on 30 March that this year sheep farmers will receive &#163;22 million to compensate for the effects of exchange rate fluctuations during 1999.

<P>

<P>
<a name="00703w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 This spring there was evidence of increased activity by Russian vessels fishing for haddock and other demersal stocks in international waters to the west of Rockall. Unregulated fishing of this kind risks undermining EU management measures aimed at conserving stocks. At the Fisheries Council in June we called upon the European Commission to press for the adoption of specific management measures by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) to constrain fishing in the area. We are supported by a number of other member states. The European Commission has undertaken to pursue the necessary action in NEAFC.

 <i>[holding answer 29 June 2000]:</i> Secondments and attachments are part of the Interchange Initiative, which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the Civil Service and other organisations. Before an Interchange can occur all parties must be satisfied that no conflict of interest arises.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how much the Government spent per head of population on supporting sport in <i>(a)</i> England, <i>(b)</i> Wales, <i>(c)</i> Scotland and <i>(d)</i> Northern Ireland in the last financial year; what the planned figure is for 2000-01; and what assessment he has made of such spending in other EU member states.

 The information requested by the hon. Member is included in the table.
<P>

<a name="00703w03.html_para2">Exchequer and Lottery funding for sport is channelled primarily through the four home nation sports councils (Sport England, SportScotland, Sports Council for Wales, Sports Council for Northern Ireland) and the UK Sports Council (UK Sport). Funding is also provided to the Football Licensing Authority, which is charged with ensuring the implementation of Government policy regarding grounds at which designated football matches are played. Support for sport and recreation is also provided by local Government expenditure.
<P>

<a name="00703w03.html_para3">No direct comparison of expenditure on sport by EU member states has been made by my Department or the Sports Councils. Meaningful comparisons are difficult because of the way in which sport is structured and financed from country to country.

 I have received a number of letters from members of the public about historical misrepresentation in Hollywood films, and while it is not for the Government formally to intervene in the creative process of film-making, I have made my personal views on the subject clear and will do so again when appropriate occasions arise.

<a name="00703w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The vast majority of tourists to Britain have a safe and enjoyable visit. Misleading comparisons of crime in Britain with that in the United States are of course unhelpful; but we expect to welcome many overseas visitors to Britain this year, four million of whom are expected to come from the United States alone. The Government are, of course, determined to tackle violent crime and are providing resources to address the issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what is the latest position regarding the payment of Jobseeker's Allowances to school ancillary employees during the school holidays.  [128293]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00703w04.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The current legal position, confirmed by the Court of Appeal in October 1999, is that ancillary workers with an on-going contract of employment, who are not entitled to Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) or Income Support (IS) during term-time because of the hours they work, are also not entitled to JSA or IS during the school holidays. We understand that leave to appeal to the House of Lords against the Court of Appeal decision was granted on 11 April.
<P>

<a name="00703w04.html_para0">Where any doubts exist over entitlement to JSA or Income Support, school ancillary workers may make a claim, which will be decided on an individual basis. School ancillary workers with low incomes may still claim in-work benefits such as Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. Those with children may also be eligible for the Working Families Tax Credit.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00703w04.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Retrospective payments for previous years winter fuel payments started to be paid in the week commencing 26 June 2000 in line with our targets. The payments will be issued as claims are processed and are not defined into postcoded areas. Some customers in West Chelmsford may have already received their payment and the remainder will receive them over the coming months as claims are received and processed.

 <i>[pursuant to his reply, 9 February 2000, c. 213W]:</i> Secondments and attachments are part of the Interchange Initiative which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the Civil Service and other organisations. All Sectors of the economy are involved: Voluntary, Education, Health, Public and Private. Interchange is a key component of the reform agenda. The Modernising Government White Paper committed us to increasing interchange, in particular by bringing in more people on secondment and sending more of our people out.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00703w06.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hilary Benn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assistance his Department is giving to support offshore wind generator research, development and manufacturing; and if he will make a statement.  [128145]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00703w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Government recognise the potential of the offshore wind energy industry both in the UK and internationally. Accordingly, offshore wind energy is a priority area within my Department's research and development programme for new and renewable energy.
<P>

<a name="00703w06.html_para0">The programme has so far committed &#163;790,000 in two projects. One will monitor and evaluate the installation and performance of the UK's first offshore installation of two 2 MW turbines being installed off Blyth Harbour this summer. The other is supporting the development of a new rotor hub, aimed at the offshore market, being assembled in the UK using UK components. In addition, the programme also has several high-value research proposals currently under consideration to develop and evaluate installation systems and techniques for offshore wind farms with prospects for reducing costs.
<P>

<a name="00703w06.html_para1">A further aim of our programme is to establish the environmental effects of offshore wind farms. A project providing an initial assessment of all the potential effects has been completed and is being followed up by scoping studies focusing on the effects on sea wild life, birds and coastal processes such as erosion and deposition.
<P>

<a name="00703w06.html_para2">The Government are also considering the scope for additional support for offshore wind in the context of the new renewables obligation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00703w06.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Hilary Benn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the potential contribution of offshore wind energy to electricity production; and if he will make a statement.  [128146]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00703w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 An analysis of the potential contribution of offshore wind energy and other renewable energy technologies was produced for my Department in March 1999 by the Energy Technical Support Unit (ETSU) and formed the Supporting Analysis to the Consultation Document on Renewable Energy then published. A copy of the Supporting Analysis is in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="00703w06.html_para3">The UK's wind resources are potentially much greater offshore than onshore. They are limited only by practicable working water depths, the use of maritime areas for other activities, and the costs of achieving linkage with the onshore electrical network. Moving from onshore to offshore need not require major changes in the technology, but additional technical problems arise because of the more hostile environment. Offshore installations could increase the contribution from wind power substantially.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00703w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 My Department has commissioned no such technical papers. Government policy is that the owners of spent fuel are responsible for its management subject to meeting regulatory requirements.

<a name="00703w06.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will estimate the net savings to the Exchequer in each of the next 10 years from restricting export credit guarantees to non-military exports; and if he will make a statement.  [127502]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00703w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 June 2000]:</i> If the hon. Gentleman's question is intended to ascertain the effect of a general restriction on export credit guarantees to non-military exports, the answer is that I do not envisage any net savings given that ECGD supported business caught by it would have been priced and managed with a view to at least breaking even. Additionally, while such a restriction would tend to reduce ECGD's exposure to interest make-up risk, it cannot be predicted at the outset whether this would generate net savings or expenditure for the Exchequer.
<P>

<a name="00703w06.html_para4">Indeed there would be a cost to the Exchequer from such a general restriction arising not only from forgone tax revenues which would arise otherwise from business thwarted by the restriction but also from any consequent reduction in employment.
<P>

<a name="00703w06.html_para5">If however the question is intended simply to elucidate the effect of the Chancellor's announcement of 11 January, extending the UK's unilateral ban on export credits in respect of "unproductive expenditure" to include a further 22 countries, then assuming recent trading patterns continue I would not envisage any costs or savings to the Exchequer given that, from information readily available, the &#163;775 million business with these countries supported by ECGD guarantees over the last five years falls within the productive expenditure criteria against which future export credit business will be assessed.

It will have a head office based in London, an office in Glasgow serving Scotland, one in Cardiff serving Wales and further offices in Manchester, Birmingham, London, Newcastle and Bournemouth serving England.

<P>

<a name="00703w07.html_para2">The exercise to establish the 1999-2000 OAT adjustments was led by National Health Service trusts. It was carried out in two stages.
<P>

<a name="00703w07.html_para3">At stage 1, NHS trusts identified their 1997-98 extra contractual referral (ECR) income from health authorities and cost per case income from general practitioner fundholders. They then reduced these amounts to take account of activity that had already been put into contracts or service agreements. The data were validated by health authorities and submitted to regional offices. These data are shown in columns A and B of the table that has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00703w07.html_para4">At stage 2, the amounts established at stage 1 were analysed by NHS trusts. In agreement with health authorities the amounts were further reduced to take account of the activity which would be covered by new or expanded service agreements in 1999-2000. The amounts not covered by service agreements formed the base for the 1999-2000 OAT adjustment. This is shown in column C of the table. These figures, uplifted by 8.5 per cent., comprise the 1999-2000 OATs adjustment.

 In November 1999, the Minister of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), launched a series of standards underpinning the National Health Service Executive's "controls assurance" project. One of the standards outlines a number of key components of an effective system of risk management that all NHS hospitals must subscribe to, including incident reporting. A key criterion contained in the "risk management system" standard requires NHS hospitals to ensure that

 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2000]:</i> The Committee on Dental and Surgical Materials (CDSM) did not impose a ban on the use of bovine materials in the production of surgical materials. Licensable dental and surgical materials were subject to the guidelines on the sourcing and processing of bovine materials for use in medicinal products that were issued by the Committee on Safety of Medicines as a precautionary measure in March 1989. The effect of the guidelines was to require all United Kingdom licence holders to source bovine material from outside the UK.

They advised that, as a precautionary measure, surgical catgut should be subject to the CSM guidelines issued in March 1989 on the sourcing and processing of bovine material for use in medicinal products.

For measles, mumps and rubella, data are collected as both notifications of disease and as laboratory-confirmed cases.

Prior to 1995 confirmation required a blood test; these data are not collated but it was likely to be few. The number of cases of pertussis (whooping cough) is based on notifications; only hospitalised cases are tested and the test is only positive in severe disease and very early in infection.

Copies of the bulletin are in the Library and it can also be found on the Department of Health website www.doh.gov.uk/public/ ab9928.htm.

 It is well known that suicidal ideation is associated with depression. Features of depression, including suicidal behaviour, can worsen after introduction of any antidepressant prior to its beneficial effects being apparent. The British National Formulary, issued to all general practitioners, pharmacists and other health professionals, advises that patients treated for depression should be assessed frequently for suicidal tendencies. The summaries of Product Characteristics (SPCs) for Prozac (fluoxetine) and Lustral (sertraline), in common with those for other antidepressants in the class, warn that the possibility of a suicide attempt may persist until significant remission of depression occurs and that patients should be closely supervised in the early stages of treatment.

 Quarterly reports of figures for all cancelled operations in England, which arise on the day a patient was due to come into hospital, or after they have been admitted, are available in the Library. We do not collect data on the reasons for the cancellation of operations but we have no information to suggest that delays in the procurement of surgical instruments have caused cancellations.

 The Care Standards Bill makes provision for a new independent regulator for care homes, as well as a range of other care services. The National Care Standards Commission will register and inspect care homes against national minimum standards. Statements of these standards will be developed which will be based upon the regulations made under clause 21 of the Bill. We intend to publish the finalised standards for care homes before the end of the summer, and we will be aiming to ensure that residents in care homes have their social, cultural, religious and recreational needs satisfied.

 <i>[holding answer 29 June 2000]:</i> I am informed by the Food Standards Agency that all genetically modified animal feed has been rigorously assessed by United Kingdom and European Union experts for possible effects on the health of consumers of the resulting animal products. Research to date has concentrated on the effects of processing on animal feed materials and the ability of DNA to survive processing and passage through an animal's gut. No incidental ill-effects have been detected in countries where GM crops have been grown and they and their by-products have been fed to animals for a number of years.

 The competition for the Strategic Sealift (RORO) service is very close and more than one bidder has made improved offers which cannot be taken into account under the existing procedures. Moreover, circumstances have changed significantly since the original bids were submitted on 14 January; not least as a consequence of the British Aerospace merger with Marconi Electronic Systems. We have therefore decided that, to ensure the best value for money to the taxpayer, we should conduct a further round of bidding.

 All three Services have a clear policy, which is promulgated to all personnel, that no form of harassment, victimisation or other unacceptable social conduct will be tolerated and all allegations of ill treatment are thoroughly investigated. It is the duty of all those in a position of responsibility to protect others from physical and mental bullying and to report any incident promptly. Appropriate action is taken against the perpetrators. Potential recruits are made fully aware of this policy. The policy of zero tolerance towards ill treatment was re-emphasised when the new code of social conduct was issued to all Service personnel in January. In the last two years, all three Services have set up Confidential Helplines which can be used by any member of the Armed Forces or their families, if necessary anonymously, who believe they are being ill-treated.

 The Army achieved 15,026 soldier enlistments during the last financial year. This was lower than the numbers enlisted in 1998-99 (15,609), but output to the Field Army in 1999-2000, which is the more important figure, was up by over 1,000 on the previous year. This is partly as a result of changes made to the selection criteria for new entrants and other changes introduced in the initial training regime. In respect of Officer recruiting, the numbers entering Sandhurst last year were 646 and output from the College was 534 against targets of 777 and 620 respectively. However, this year, the Army expects that numbers entering Sandhurst will be on target. Also the numbers of inquiries for officer careers are up on previous periods, as is the number of successful candidates at the Regular Commissions Board, which is a precursor to Sandhurst entry. Advertising for Army careers, for both soldier and officer candidates, is being more specifically targeted this year.

 Fitness levels found in the average young person have been in decline for some time. On the other hand, the fitness standards required of armed forces' recruits by the end of their training have not been reduced. Consequently, in addition to tailored fitness training programmes during recruit training, the Services recognise the need to give guidance to initial applicants, who may include the young unemployed, on the issue of physical fitness to enable them to attain the high level of fitness required to pass recruit training. The Naval Service issues a pre-joining fitness programme booklet to all potential recruits. The length of the programme lasts four weeks for officers and ratings, and eight weeks for Royal Marine other ranks applicants. If an Army recruiter believes that a potential applicant should take action to improve his/her fitness, he/she is given a video and a pamphlet which describe the training that should be undertaken. Similarly, all RAF recruits are given a booklet on physical fitness training prior to commencement of Recruit Training.

On 31 May there were 36 curfewees who remained unlawfully at large. This represents fewer than four per cent. of the total number of revocations. In the vast majority of cases, when a curfewee's licence is revoked, he or she can expect to be apprehended quickly and returned to custody. While the priority to be given to pursuing individual cases will be an operational matter for local police forces, Home Office Circular 1/1999 made clear that Home Detention Curfew recalls should be regarded as "urgent" cases. In addition, the National Identification Service at New Scotland Yard issues "The Police Gazette" weekly to all police forces, including details of curfewees who are unlawfully at large. When curfewees are apprehended following a period unlawfully at large, they are required to serve the period of time outstanding at the point their licence was revoked.

 The European Council, in its special meeting at Tampere on 15-16 October 1999, invited the Council of the European Union to extend the competence of Europol to money laundering in general, regardless of the type of offence from which the laundered proceeds originate. A draft amendment to the Europol Convention which would give effect to the Tampere proposal is currently under consideration by member states. We support the purposes of the amendment which would enable Europol to provide member states with more effective support in fighting money laundering which is at the heart of much organised crime. We take the view, in negotiating the budget for Europol, that it must demonstrate that it is using its resources efficiently and cost effectively in discharging its mandate. Any proposed increase to Europol's budget is subjected to detailed scrutiny, including by the United Kingdom's representative on the Europol Management Board.
<P>

<a name="00703w16.html_para0">The European Council at Tampere also attached importance to allowing Europol to ask member states to initiate, conduct or co-ordinate investigations, each involving a single member state, or joint investigation teams involving two or more member states, while respecting national systems of judicial control. A draft recommendation reflecting this Tampere conclusion is also under consideration by the member states. We support the purposes of the recommendation on the basis that any participation by Europol in investigations or joint investigation teams would, as also envisaged at Tampere, be in a support capacity.

 The Prison Service has commercial contracts to supply goods and services to the organisations listed. Contracts with commercial companies to supply work for prisoners may be sourced centrally by the Prison Service's Enterprise and Supply Services, but many are entered into locally by individual establishments. Information on contracts for commercial work is not collected centrally and a comprehensive list could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

 A Prison Service national framework sets the minimum level of pay for employed prisoners at &#163;4.00. The minimum for those in training is set at &#163;2.50. Above the prescribed minimum rates, levels of pay are set at the discretion of the Governor, and will vary depending upon the regime in place, the type of work available and links with other relevant schemes, for example incentives and earned privileges.

 In December 1998, Her Majesty's Treasury announced that, subject to certain criteria, some fine income might be reinvested in law enforcement activity. With Her Majesty's Treasury agreement, pilot schemes involving the use of speed cameras were launched on 1 April this year. The pilots are taking place in eight police force areas: Cleveland,

<P>

<a name="00703w18.html_para0">Local partnerships have been formed to run each of the pilots. These consist of the police, local authorities and the courts. Fine revenue from fixed penalties is being invested into the purchase of additional speed cameras and/or the increased use of existing cameras all to an agreed programme. Surplus fine income will be returned to Her Majesty's Treasury. The success of the pilots will be judged on their road safety benefits, particularly their ability to reduce deaths and injuries.

 The requested details on injuries and deaths resulting from assaults and other violent crimes are not collected centrally. Recorded crime data in relation to certain offences of violence against the person are given in the table. Please note that the offences given as wounding and assault may represent attempts, conspiring, inciting, aiding, abetting, causing or permitting, and not result in an actual injury.

<a name="00703w18.html_para1">The British Crime Survey has estimated that, in 1997, there were 714,000 assaults with more than trivial injury ('wounding'), and 2,276,000 common assaults, ie physical assaults or attempted assault with at most slight bruising. These categories do not necessarily coincide with those from the recorded crime figures.

 The most recently published study of imprisoned mothers was 'Imprisoned Women and Mothers' by Caddle and Crisp. It was commissioned by the Prison Service and published in 1997 (Home Office

Research Study 162). The entire female prisoner population at the end of 1994, comprising 1,766 women, were surveyed. In-depth interviews were conducted with the 61 per cent. of that population who were either pregnant or mothers of children under 18.
<P>

<a name="00703w19.html_para0">In the report of a 'Review of Principles, Policies and Procedures on Mothers and Babies/Children in Prison' (Her Majesty's Prison Service July 1999) and the Prison Service's Response and Action Plan (December 1999), a number of areas of research concerning the children of women prisoners was recommended.

<P>
<a name="00703w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Prison Service places enormous importance on encouraging prisoners to maintain close family ties and to making family visits to prisoners as comfortable and productive as possible. This relates not only to the specific establishment of family visiting areas but also to a range of facilities such as the provision of visitors' centres and play areas. Moreover, there is increasing emphasis on delivering initiatives to fully maximise the potential for allowing prisoners to have extended contact with families through longer visits and temporary release; and facilitating the visits of families from long distances through the provision of financial support and assistance with accommodation.

<P>
<a name="00703w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Government have no immediate plans to make new arrangements for women or men with parental responsibilities to arrange child care prior to starting a custodial sentence. There may be opportunities while pre-sentence reports are being prepared for child care arrangements to be considered.
<P>

<a name="00703w19.html_para1">However, the Government do take seriously the needs of women offenders in the criminal justice system, and a working group has been established to consider a strategy on women offenders, including the range of sentences available. Also, the team undertaking the Review of the Sentencing Framework, which was announced on 16 May, will bear the needs of women offenders in mind in formulating its recommendations.

<P>
<P>

 The report of a study of Psychiatric Morbidity Amongst Prisoners in England and Wales, undertaken in 1997 for the Department of Health by the Office for National Statistics, indicated that in the year before entering prison, 36 per cent. of women on remand and 39 per cent. of sentenced women reported engaging

<P>

<P>
<a name="00703w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Anti-social Behaviour Order Action Group concluded that, in order to give increased impetus to the take-up of applications for Anti-social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs), there was a need to spread the good practice that already existed in certain areas of the country. To achieve this, the Action Group drew up practical guidance on considering and applying for ASBOs, and also set up a series of seminars as a means of consulting on the draft guidance and of providing an opportunity to hear about, and discuss, the experiences of those who had successfully obtained such orders.
<P>

<a name="00703w19.html_para3">Ten seminars were held in all, in each of the Government Regions in England and Wales, between early March and Easter this year. Following the successful conclusion of the seminars, the Action Group held their final meeting in May to complete their work on the draft guidance. I launched the booklet, "Anti-social Behaviour Orders: Guidance on drawing up Local ASBO Protocols", on 28 June. A copy has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00703w19.html_para4">I am grateful to my noble Friend Lord Warner and the Action Group for all their work. I hope that the new guidance, which complements the guidance on ASBOs issued in March 1999, will enable the police and local authorities to make effective use of this important tool for dealing with anti-social behaviour.

<a name="00703w19.html_para5">The Government announced in July 1998 that the annual intake of medical students in the UK would be increased over the period to 2005 by about 1,000 places. In England the Higher Education Funding Council for England has announced the allocation of a total of 1,126 additional places. The funding to the Council takes these new places into account. A further increase in the number of medical students is being considered in recognition of the rapid development of services to underpin modernisation of the National Health Service. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland these matters are for the devolved Administrations.

 The Government recognise that men are currently under-represented in primary schools and would therefore like to see more qualifying as primary teachers. The trial introduction of &#163;6,000 training salaries for postgraduate primary training may well encourage more applications from men for 2000-01. This

will be evaluated. Under-represented groups, including men in the primary sector, will also be a priority target for the new &#163;13,000 grants to schools who accept a trainee on the employment-based Graduate Teacher Programme.
<P>

<a name="00703w19.html_para6">The Teacher Training Agency has asked all providers of initial teacher training to set targets and draw up Action Plans for increasing the numbers of men entering undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Over 90 per cent. have now done so. In addition, more than a quarter of the taster courses funded by the Teacher Training Agency in the period June 2000-August 2001, which are designed to give prospective trainee teachers an insight into what teaching is like, are specifically focused on recruiting men.

 Between 1999-2002, we are making available to local education authorities in England a total of &#163;350 million to meet the cost of recruiting and training the equivalent of 20,000 new teaching assistants and to support the training of more experienced teaching assistants, so that they may develop their skills and further their careers. Of the allocation which they devolve to schools, local education authorities should pass at least 80 per cent. to primary schools.

 The requested information is shown in the following table.
<P>

<a name="00703w20.html_para0">In the Cumbria local education authority area, the number of pupils in key stage 1 classes of 31 or more pupils was 854 in January 2000, compared with 2,572 a year earlier. This means that as few as 5.3 per cent. of these pupils remain in classes of over 30 pupils. Allocations of funding in Cumbria to support reductions in infant class sizes have so far amounted to &#163;3.7 million. This funding has helped reduce the average size of key stage 1 classes in the Parliamentary constituency of Carlisle from 27.6 in January 1997, to 25 in January 2000. Over the same time period, the average size of key stage 2 classes in the constituency has fallen from 27.4 to 26.3; and the size of the average primary class from 27.4 to 25.7.
<P>

<a name="00703w20.html_para1">The Government are well on target to deliver their infant class size pledge in England with some &#163;620 million made available to support the pledge. The number of pupils in infant classes of over 30 pupils has already fallen by 300,000.

<a name="00703w20.html_para2">The Government are well on target to deliver their pledge to limit infant classes to 30 pupils. In Crosby parliamentary constituency, the average size of key stage 1 classes taught by one teacher in maintained primary schools went down from 28.3 pupils per class in January 1997 to 26.2 pupils per class in January 2000. Since January 1997, there were 830 fewer pupils in Crosby schools being educated in key stage 1 classes of 31 or more, which represents a reduction by two-thirds of the number of pupils being educated in such classes.

<a name="00703w20.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 In order to improve standards in inner city schools, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has introduced Excellence in Cities (EiC). This is building on the measures already introduced to raise standards in all schools such as the literacy and numeracy strategies. The programme was launched in March 1999, and initially covered secondary schools in 25 authorities. It expanded in March this year to include a further 22 authorities and

<a name="00703w20.html_para11">The Department has supported bids for capital funding from Hertfordshire which met the published criteria for basic need. The Local Education Authority can make further bids for capital funding if need continues to grow. Such bids will be sought from Local Education Authorities in September through the Annual Capital Guideline process.

<P>

<a name="00703w21.html_para0">The Government are taking a number of steps to encourage service providers to comply with the requirements of Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) and accept the business case for disabled access. On 29 June 1999, we published a Code of Practice 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jul 2000 : Column: 78W</I><P>
which explains the duties under Part III and gives practical guidance on implementation. On 1 October last year, to coincide with further rights under Part III coming into force, we published an information booklet called "An Introduction for Small and Medium-sized Businesses". This explains the duties businesses and organisations have under Part III.
<P>

<a name="00703w21.html_para1">On 1 October 2004, the final stage of rights under Part III of the DDA will come into force. From then, in addition to their current duties, service providers will have to take reasonable steps to tackle physical features which make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to use a service. On 8 May 2000 the Government and the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) launched a joint consultation exercise on a revised version of the Part III Code, a Practical Guide for service providers and the Government's proposals for a small number of Regulations under the Act. The consultation documents have been sent to a wide range of businesses and organisations. The exercise will last for three months. The DRC will consider the views expressed in the consultation before preparing final versions of the Code and Guide.
<P>

<a name="00703w21.html_para2">The DRC also has a part in encouraging employers to accept the business case for disabled people. Part of the DRC's remit is to be a central source of information and advice on the DDA. Employers and service providers are a key target audience and the DRC's Helpline is currently being promoted to business via advertisements in the regional and trade press. An interactive service is available between 8.00 and 20.00, and a range of leaflets and factsheets on all parts of the DDA is available free of charge. An ordering facility is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

The figure for the West Midlands Employment Service Region is 4,021 and the figure nationally is 44,640. Taking into account the earlier phases of NDLP the figure is 50,911.

<a name="00703w21.html_para19">The scheme was formally launched to MPs, local authorities, and the fuel poverty lobby by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on 8 June. Transco subsequently presented the scheme to Welsh housing providers in Cardiff on 26 June.
<P>

<a name="00703w21.html_para20">There are two separate aspects to the scheme--the installation of central heating and insulation in the homes of the fuel poor, and the development of training opportunities for those employed through the scheme. On the first of these, Transco have given 175 presentations about the scheme to social housing providers, and planned installations so far include Inverclyde Council (3,500 homes) and Derby City Council (600 homes). Discussions are proceeding with Leicester City Council (3,000 homes). Many more housing providers--including Blaenau Gwent--have expressed interest.
<P>

<a name="00703w21.html_para21">Transco estimate that at least 3,000 homes will be treated by the end of the calendar year 2000, and perhaps many more than that as the scheme gathers momentum. We expect a million homes to be improved under the scheme over the next five years. This will significantly reduce the incidence of fuel poverty.

 The A130 forms a major North-South route through Essex linking the towns of Great Dunmow and Chelmsford with South East Essex and Basildon. It carries a substantial volume of traffic, passing through communities with consequent environmental and safety problems for the residents.

<a name="00703w23.html_para6">The A130 Improvement, South of Chelmsford, is being constructed as a local bypass for some of these communities and to relieve them of the effects of the traffic.

 Damages for mental injury caused by air accidents are already recoverable in the UK when associated with physical injury. In preparation for the Diplomatic Conference held in Montreal in May 1999, at which the Convention was signed, the UK supported a proposal by Sweden for a separate head of claim for mental injury. Prior to the Conference, however, that proposal was withdrawn from the draft text of the Convention. Our position was that a separate claim for mental injury could be advocated only if there was sufficient support to gain global agreement. There was not

sufficient support so, in the interest of securing the best deal for the UK, it was decided to support the text of the Convention without a separate reference to mental injury. The Conference "travaux preparatoires", nevertheless, indicate that damages for mental injury can be recovered in certain states and that jurisprudence in this area is developing.

 Primary legislation in the form of a new Carriage by Air Act is required before the UK can ratify the Montreal Convention. We aim to introduce that legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows. The Convention requires ratification by 30 states before it can come into force. To date, three states have deposited instruments of ratification.

 There are currently 61 stations accredited under the Secure Stations Scheme (out of approximately 2,800 stations in Great Britain). The Secure Stations Scheme, which was launched in April 1998, is designed 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jul 2000 : Column: 88W</I><P>
to improve and standardise good security practices at all overground and underground stations. To become an accredited Secure Station, each station operator needs to work with their local British Transport Police Crime Prevention Operator to ensure that their station meets the national standards on design and management to cut down crime. The standards relate to such measures as staff training, Help Points, CCTV, lighting and information. Operators also have to conduct an independent passenger survey to see whether passengers feel safe at the station and provide evidence that crime rates are low.

<a name="00703w24.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Safeway's application for grant funding exceeds the &#163;250,000 discretionary cap that may generally be offered by the Powershift programme to a single company. This cap was introduced to ensure that many organisations could benefit from Powershift grants rather than all of the programme's budget being used to support a large order for vehicles from a single company. The cap is discretionary, however, and there will be cases where larger grants can be justified because they will make a significant impact on the market for alternative fuels.
<P>

<a name="00703w24.html_para0">Powershift's advisory panel, comprising officials from my Department, DTI and the Energy Saving Trust, is meeting today to agree the level of grant funding to be offered to Safeway's.

 An individual's income tax liability depends on the levels of income of different types that he or she receives and the tax reliefs due. A husband and wife are each taxed on their individual income.

<a name="00703w27.html_para0">Dividends paid on or after 6 April 1999 are taxed at 10 per cent. below the basic rate limit and carry a tax credit of 10 per cent. which meets that liability. From 1996-97 to that date, they were taxed at the lower rate of 20 per cent., with a 20 per cent. tax credit.
