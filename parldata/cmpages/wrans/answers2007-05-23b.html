 Over the working life, the average net graduate earnings premium is comfortably over &#163;100,000 in today&#146;s valuation, compared to what a similar individual would have earned if they just had A levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"><a name="70523w0004.htm_para0"><a name="07052380000408">The data which underpin this figure are taken from the Labour Force Survey. We estimate the effect on net additional earnings from getting a degree, after allowing for factors like gender, age, and the probability of being employed. The figures are also discounted so that they are in &#145;today's valuation'. Comparing the lifetime earnings profiles of otherwise similar graduates and those with A levels, we find that graduates can expect to earn, after taxation, over &#163;100,000 more than similar non-graduates. Recent research by PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated the discounted gross (i.e. pre-tax) additional lifetime earnings associated with a degree to be around &#163;160,000.</p>

Under paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 1 of the Education Act 2002 the governing body of a maintained school has the legal power to do anything which appears to them to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of, or in connection with, the conduct of the school. Schools must process biometric data in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

 Schools are already required to promote the education and welfare of all their pupils, and they should take pupils' particular circumstances into account. The Government are clear that if a school is concerned that one of their pupils may be a &#147;child in need&#148;, whether as a young carer or for any other reason, they should consider communicating with the child's family and with local children's services.</p>

This guidance includes young carers as one of the groups that is at risk of becoming disengaged from education, and it was revised in October 2006 to reflect comments from the Princess Royal Trust for Carers. Young carers will be mentioned in our revised anti-bullying guidance, Safe to Learn (due to be issued later this term), as one of the categories of pupil particularly vulnerable to bullying. We also plan to ensure that schools are aware of their duties under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (DDA), and to draw their attention to our resource Implementing the DDA in Schools and Early Years Settings. Once this work is complete, we plan to draw the attention of teachers, schools, and local authorities to the specific application to young carers of these resources.</p>

 Strangles is not a notifiable disease or infection, there is no evidence that it has any significance for public health and it is not a listed disease by the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health). There are no plans to make it notifiable or for the Department to take steps to eradicate the disease. The equine industry has the responsibility to control strangles and the Horserace Betting Levy Board (HBLB) publishes a code of practice, updated annually, containing guidelines on the disease. The code is available from the HBLB, the Thoroughbred Breeders&#146; Association and the British Horse Society, and can be accessed via the DEFRA website. Both DEFRA and the industry encourage horse owners to follow the guidelines on strangles contained in the code of practice.</p>

 We are concerned about the security situation in Gaza. The recent intra-Palestinian violence, which started on 13 May, has left 54 Palestinians dead. We welcome the ceasefire, which was agreed on 19 May, to end this violence. However, the on-going launching of Qassam rockets from Gaza into Israel, the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and the resulting Palestinian casualties are of serious concern. As the Minister for the Middle East my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) said on 21 May in a press conference following the Israeli raids on Gaza:</p>
<a name="70523w0007.htm_brev0"><a name="07052380002323"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;For the sake of the people of Gaza and southern Israel, we want to see a complete halt to internal violence in Gaza and to rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel.

The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs has noted that access to parts of the West Bank, such as East Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley, have not improved due to a high number of checkpoints (537 as of April), roadblocks, the barrier and a complex system of permits. In Gaza, the regular closure of the Rafah crossing point and lack of access to the West Bank has had a detrimental effect on the population. We continue to raise our concerns about movement restrictions with the Israeli Government and call upon both parties to implement the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access.</p>

I have enclosed a document &#147;Passport Office Authentication by Interview Network&#148;, which will give you more information on how we decided the locations of the interview offices, The interview office network is intended to provide an office within an hour&#146;s travelling time for over 95% of the UK population. In remote, sparsely populated areas where it is not cost-effective to set up an interview office, we are putting in place videoconferencing facilities to conduct the interview to avoid people having to make long journeys. This will affect a small number of applicants who live more than an hour's journey from an interview office, estimated to be less than 4,000 per year in 25 areas.</p>

 There have been no recent discussions. Operational tactics when using firearms are a matter for the police and the use of firearms is governed by ACPO guidelines. Once authorised to use firearms, it is for the individual officer to ensure they act within the law.
