<p><a name="st_29"><a name="30717w03.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 15 July 2003]:</i> Each application for consent for the release a GM crop into the environment must have a full and thorough risk assessment made of its potential impacts. This assessment is scrutinised by the Government&#039;s statutory Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) and is made on a case-by-case basis according to the characteristics of the particular crop. It includes a consideration of the likelihood and consequences if a GM crop were to spread through cross-pollination (with other crop plants or wild relatives) or through seed movement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w03.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_18">ACRE have considered all the GM crops that have been grown in the UK and consent has only been granted where appropriate measures have been taken to avoid adverse effects on the surrounding environment. In the case of the crops in the farm-scale evaluations, the GM crops were kept separate from commercial crops. The separation distances were based on advice from the National Institute of Agricultural Botany published in August 2000 and are not intended to eliminate any cross pollination with equivalent crops at greater distance, but rather to limit it severely. ACRE advised that the actual occurrence of cross-pollination with other crop plants, or wild relatives in the case of oil seed rape, would present no undue risk to human health or the environment. The potential of such cross-pollination is one of the factors being examined in the Farm Scale Evaluation.

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext"><a name="brev_3">The National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales has been asked to reply to your recent question regarding your concerns about how the 2001 Census was conducted in Sheffield. (126125)</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext"><a name="brev_4">I can assure you that there were no Census forms lost in Sheffield. It seems likely that your reference to &#039;lost&#039; information refers to problems with the Census Coverage Survey for Sheffield. This resulted in us not having information for 36 of the sampled postcodes and meant that we could not use the Census Coverage Survey for Sheffield as we had originally intended.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext"><a name="brev_5">The Census Coverage Survey (CCS) was a key element in the One Number Census process. It was an independent survey conducted shortly after the Census to establish the coverage of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2001 Census. The information obtained from the Census Coverage Survey was used to enable census population counts to be adjusted for unde renumeration at the national, local and small area level. It was therefore important that the Census Coverage Survey was successful in capturing those persons missed in the Census.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext"><a name="brev_6">A quality assurance panel was set up to look at the results of the Census from around the country and also to provide advice as problems arose during the processing. After someconsideration, the quality assurance panel felt that the sample for Sheffield from the Census Coverage Survey was not sufficient to make reliable estimates of underenumeration.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext"><a name="brev_7">However, the methodology for the Census included a contingency strategy that could be used for occasions when it was felt that the Census Coverage Survey had failed to find the people missed from the Census. This contingency strategy involved a method known as &quot;borrowing strength&quot;. This strategy involves using the adjustments made for similar Local Authoritieswhen compared with aggregate administrative data and applying these to the Authority for which the strategy is invoked. The method for selecting Local Authorities from which to borrow strength involved using the ONS classification of Local Authorities to identify the five most similar areas in terms of socio-economic and demographic characteristics. By applying the borrowing strength method, the population of Sheffield was increased by 6,100 over and above what would have been achieved had the borrowing strength method not been used. This accounts for approximately 1 per cent. of the total population estimate.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext"><a name="brev_8">A consultation exercise was undertaken with all Local Authorities in the winter of 2000/1 inviting each Authority to comment on the acceptability of the list of closest Authorities to their own for borrowing strength purposes. Sheffield was given the opportunity to comment at this stage, before the list was finalised and published.</p>

 Staffing matters are the responsibility of the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA). There are 49 civil servants currently in post in the Wales Office and a total of 115 in the Scotland Office, of which 33 are staff of the Advocate-General for Scotland. They are all on loan or secondment principally from the National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Executive respectively. Staff will be offered the options of either transferring to DCA, remaining on secondment or loan or returning to their parent department or organisation in due course. Line management arrangements for these staff will not be affected by the new arrangements and, whilst we would generally expect DCA personnel policies to apply to staff transferring to my Department, this will depend on individual terms of employment. I also hope that all staff working within the DCA may find it beneficial to work within a wider corporate headquarters environment.

 We have no plans to introduce such measures. There is existing case law regulating the relationship between creditors, debtors and their guarantors. The House of Lords has ruled that banks (or a creditor in the same position) should inquire into&nbsp;the status and competence of an individual as guarantor. This is particularly so when the individual is guaranteeing the debts of their spouse or partner. This case applied to a single guarantee, but the principle would extend to joint guarantees.

 On 14 July 2003, the Government published a consultation paper entitled Constitutional Reform: A New Way of Appointing Judges. The paper seeks views on proposals for the establishment of the new Judicial Appointments Commission. Under the Government&#039;s preferred model, the Commission would take responsibility for the entire appointments process prior to the appointment itself. Ministers would not take any part in that process. Under this model, the Commission would generally put forward only one name to the Secretary of State for each appointment. The Secretary of State would either accept that recommendation and make the appointment (or pass the recommendation to the Prime Minister or The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen as appropriate) or formally reject that recommendation and require another to be put forward. The preferred model is described in more detail in paragraphs 42&#150;48 and 52 of the consultation paper (available in the Members&#039; Library and on the internet at www.dca.gov.uk/consult/iacommission).

<p><a name="st_99"><a name="30717w10.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 As stated in the answer of 19 May, the governance of NLIS is not a matter for government. National Land Information Service (NLIS) is a non-statutory service operated by private companies, the Government is not aware of any vires issues affecting NLIS. The review of the CGSG is expected to be completed by October 2003. In relation to the delivery of relevant third party land and property information, it is for the relevant NLIS companies (Local Government Information House and the NLIS hub provider) to enter into agreements with data providers on such terms and conditions as they consider appropriate. Central government is not directly involved. However, the NLIS website (www.nlis.org.uk) states that NLIS obtains land and property data from Land Registry, Coal Authority, Environment Agency, local authorities, Ordnance Survey and the National Land and Property Gazetteer. Further information can also be found on the websites of the individual channel providers.

 A UK citizen living abroad should apply to the electoral registration officer (ERO) for the area in the UK in which (s)he was most recently registered if (s)he wishes to be included on the overseas electors&#039; list.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answer of 25 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 876W, on drugs, what investigations he has conducted to determine why specific army units have yielded relatively large numbers of positive results on compulsory drugs testing; and what steps he has taken to address the drug problem in units scoring highly on CDT.

<p><a name="st_112"><a name="30717w11.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 The Army has vigorous education and training programmes aimed at deterring drug misuse, and steps taken include drugs awareness lectures and regular poster campaigns to promote awareness on the dangers and consequences of the misuse of drugs.

<p><a name="st_113"><a name="30717w11.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Fitting Helmet Mounted Sight (HMS) to Tornado F3 to operate the Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM) could not be achieved before 2005. Carrying out the required integration work would disrupt the aircraft&#039;s operational availability until then. Tornado F3 is expected to retire from service by 2009. It would not, therefore, be cost-effective to fit HMS to Tornado F3 to operate ASRAAM.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 Jul 2003 : Column 479W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="st_114"><a name="30717w11.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM) provides a significant overall improvement in capability to that provided by AIM9 missiles. In particular, ASRAAM flies faster and further and is more agile than AIM9 missiles, enhancing the Royal Air Force&#039;s ability to engage enemy aircraft. ASRAAM also demonstrates greater counter-measures performance, greater lethality and better target acquisition than AIM9 missiles. These are all key factors in enabling our pilots to achieve air superiority, not only now, but also against all known emerging threats.

<p><a name="st_117"><a name="30717w11.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 When Typhoon becomes available for operational deployment in the second half of this decade it will be equipped primarily to carry out air defence sorties but will also have a limited ground attack capability. On current plans, Typhoon will be capable of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delivering both ALARM and unguided bombs at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that stage. Subsequent incremental operational enhancements will develop Typhoon into a truly multi-role weapon system. The content and timing of these enhancements are the subject of ongoing negotiations with industry and partner nations. Our aim, however, is for a fully enhanced multi-role Typhoon to become available for operations early in the next decade. We have no plans for cluster bombs to be fitted to Typhoon.

 The Public Service Agreement (PSA) covering this issue is shared between Department for International Development, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence to reflect the Government&#039;s closely coordinated approach to improving the United Kingdom&#039;s contribution to reducing conflict overseas through the Conflict Prevention Pools for sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world. The information sources we use to derive the number of people affected by violent conflict (the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the Journal of Peace Research, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, UN High Commission for Refugees and the United States Committee for Refugees) report annually and cover the figures collated for the previous year. Therefore, we do not expect to have the details for last year before the end of 2003 and the figures for this year before the end of 2004. Overall assessment of progress will be based on the data, but will also take account of factors beyond UK control, either in-country or within the wider international system.

<p>
<a name="30717w14.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_66">The UK is beginning to make an impact in meeting the PSA targets. Examples of important initiatives include our post-conflict reconstruction work in Afghanistan and the Balkans, our political support to the Middle East Peace Process, our direct assistance to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sierra Leone and our support to African-led peacekeeping missions in general. UK efforts through the Pools to reduce the risk of conflict also include programme and project activities further afield, such as in Sri Lanka and Indonesia. We will continue to evaluate progress and improve the effectiveness of the Pools over the coming years.

<p>
<a name="30717w16.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_75">We recognise that turbulence in pupil numbers can have an impact on school budgets and pupil attainment. A local military presence is one cause, influxes of asylum seekers are another. Local authorities are able to include factors in their funding formulae to provide additional funding to take account of high turnover of pupils during the year. Essex local education authority has such a factor.

<a name="stpa_76">We believe further work on mobility should be done on the basis of data from the Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC) so that it is possible to consider in an informed way whether a mobility indicator might be included in the AEN part of the formula when the three-year formula freeze ends in 2006&#150;07.

 We are encouraging Local Education Authorities (LEAs) to work in partnership with all secondary schools to develop a strategy that enables individual schools to establish a specialism that plays to their strengths but also contributes to achieving a balance of specialisms in their area.

<a name="stpa_77">Many LEAs have drawn up plans with schools for a specialist system across the whole of their local area. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government are encouraging this approach while recognising the final decision on the choice of specialist application lies with the individual school. LEAs adopting a more strategic approach include the Excellence in Cities authorities and the six Diversity Pathfinder LEAs.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what measures she has taken to help intermittent suppliers adversely affected by New Electricity Trading Arrangements.  [126720]</p>








<p><a name="st_210"><a name="30717w20.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 There have been a number of refinements to NETA since its implementation in March 2001 that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should have helped intermittent generators. These include:

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext"><a name="brev_111">Shorter gate closure, implemented in July 2002, has made it easier for all participants to manage their risks, particularly intermittent generators who should be better able to predict their output better one hour ahead of real time.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext"><a name="brev_112">Recent changes to the Balancing and Settlement Code and National Grid&#039;s charging methodology were implemented to help smaller generators (many of which are intermittent) by unbundling so-called embedded benefits further. Embedded benefits are those benefits which accrue through not having to use the high voltage electricity transmission grid. These changes allow smaller generators to be paid these benefits directly from National Grid, rather than have to negotiate with electricity suppliers during contract rounds, which enables smaller generators to receive more of the embedded benefits that they create.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w20.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_108">The Government have always been clear that they support Consolidation and changes which make it easier for larger suppliers to market power on behalf of smaller generators. This gives smaller generators an outlet for their supply, and larger generators have a wider portfolio of power.
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w20.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_109">The way in which energy imbalance prices in the Balancing mechanism are calculated was changed in March 2003 to make them more cost-reflective. This revised the definitions of the System Buy Price and the System Sell Price and has changed the way that National Grid calculates them. Early indications are that it has significantly reduced the spread of imbalance prices, which should be of particular benefit to intermittent generators. The spread of imbalance prices, which was 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 Jul 2003 : Column 512W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
around 20/MWh at the time of the introduction of NETA, was reduced to 0.6/MWh during the week commencing 7 July 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w20.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_110">Outside of NETA, there have also been further changes that have helped smaller generators. Last November the DTI and Ofgem launched a webportal, on the main Ofgem website, which contains comprehensive guidance for smaller generators to help them understand the market. The recent Energy White Paper further committed to making the administration procedures for the Balancing and Settlement Code more accessible to smaller generators to help them participate more effectively in the market.
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w20.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_111">In the Budget 2002 the Chancellor also announced the completion of the exemption of Good Quality CHP from the climate change levy, thus ensuring that Good Quality CHP used on site, sold direct and sold indirect will be exempt from the levy. The decision recognises the environmental benefits of all Good Quality CHP and has given the CHP sector, which has been hard hit recently by falling electricity prices and rising gas prices, a much needed boost. Finally, the Renewables Obligation was introduced in April 2002, which requires licensed suppliers to buy a specified proportion of their electricity from accredited renewables sources every year. Intermittent generators typically fall into this category and many of them have benefited considerably.

 No. Attendance allowance provides a contribution towards the extra costs faced by severely disabled people as a result of long-term disability. The six-month qualifying period helps to establish that the disability, and the resulting personal care or supervision needs which give entitlement to the benefit, are of a long-term nature. However, special considerations apply to people who are terminally ill, and our arrangements recognise the particular difficulties faced by people who have only a short time to live. Such people are awarded attendance allowance automatically without having to complete a qualifying period. The arrangements ensure that claims are dealt with quickly and sensitively. We have no plans to extend this exception to attendance allowance claims generally.

Note:<br>

(a) The figures shown in Table 1 were used as a basis for the Green Paper and are based only on the assumed number of people contracted out, and earning above the Lower Earnings Limit, and hence eligible for a rebate.<br>

(b) They show the average number of people contracted out at any point in the year, rather than the total number of people who have been contracted out some time during the year.<br>

(c) Figures are shown in constant 2002&#150;03 price terms, except the figure for 2001&#150;02 which has not been adjusted.<br>

(d) The projected rebate expenditure for 2011&#150;12 reflects the sharp rise in the cost of rebates between the 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 tax years. This was due to the introduction of the State Second Pension which resulted in a large increase in the amount of rebates paid to Appropriate Personal Pensions.<br>

(e) The figures reflect the analysis of long term economic and demographic developments in the governments long term public finance report presented in November 2002.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;The costs are net of income-related benefit offsets. They are rounded to the nearest &#163;100 million and are given in 2003&#150;04 prices.<br>

2.&nbsp;State pension costs are for the basic state pension only and do not include the state second pension, graduated retirement benefit (GRB) or state earnings related pension (SERPS). It is assumed that all those people of state pension age and above in 2003&#150;04 receive the maximum rate payable of the basic state pension regardless of their underlying contribution record. This is &#163;77.45 in 2003&#150;04.<br>

3.&nbsp;For incapacity benefit (IB) and jobseeker&#039;s allowance (JSA), the costs cover payments which would be made to people who are currently claiming the benefits as credits only (for IB we have assumed SDA claimants would also become entitled to IB). In practice, there would also be costs generated from people who currently satisfy the medical or actively seeking work conditions for IB or JSA, but do not claim because they fail the contribution conditions.<br>





4.&nbsp;For bereavement benefits, the estimate is of the likely cost of paying a full basic or age-related rate of widowed parent&#039;s allowance (WPA), widows pension (WP), widowed mother&#039;s allowance (WMA) and bereavement allowance (BA) to all those who currently receive those benefits. Due to the limitations of the data, the estimate is likely to be an upper limit to the costs of this change. No estimate is available of the numbers of people who would become newly entitled.<br>

5.&nbsp;The costs for all benefits exclude dependency increases.<br>

Sources:<br>

1.&nbsp;Costs for incapacity benefit and jobseeker&#039;s allowance are estimated from a 5 per cent. sample of benefit records taken in February 2003.<br>

2.&nbsp;Costs for bereavement benefit are estimated from a 5 per cent. sample of benefit records taken in September 2002.<br>

3.&nbsp;Costs for the basic state pension are based on estimates supplied by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department. Income-related benefit offsets are calculated using the Department for Work and Pensions Policy Simulation model.<br>

 Operation Gangmaster began in 1998 and, following disruption caused by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, was re-launched in April 2002. Operation Gangmaster brings together representatives from a range of Government Departments and Agencies and, where appropriate, the police to tackle gangmasters operating illegal practices. This group operates in two ways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w32.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_162">The first function is to gather and collate evidence on gangmasters operating in the informal economy. This&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intelligence enables us to ensure that specialist gangmaster compliance activity is better targeted and more effective.
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w32.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_163">The second function of Operation Gangmaster is to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organise specific operations, using appropriate compliance staff drawn from the relevant Departments and Agencies, to tackle particular gangmasters known to be involved in illegal practices. These operations are lead by the Department or Agency that has the major interest in the individual case.
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w32.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_164">Operation Gangmaster does not replace the normal compliance activity taken by each Department or Agency. However, it does provide a co-ordinated approach to tackling gangmasters that may be involved in a range of illegal activity such as breaches of immigration or employment law; tax offences and benefit fraud.
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w32.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_165">Each Department and Agency maintains their own statistics on results of operations. Over the last year Department for Work and Pensions officials have imposed sanctions on 138 people who were involved in benefit fraud, made 18,000 adjustments to benefit entitlements and identified overpayments of benefit in 235 cases.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what policies <i>(a)</i> initiated and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;managed by his Department since 2001 had an impact on Pendle; and if he will make a statement.  [124087]</p>








<p><a name="st_312"><a name="30717w32.html_spnew5"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 Since 2001 this Department has introduced a range of reforms which are delivering opportunity and independence for all. Amongst the major reforms are the introduction of work focused interviews and the New Deal programmes that are helping people return to work and contribute to record levels of employment. To protect today&#039;s pensioners we introduced the Minimum Income Guarantee, which ensures a minimum level of income for all pensioners; and from October this year, the Pension Credit which will also reward modest savings. In addition, the Winter Fuel Payment is payable to all pensioner households and will be increased by 100 from this winter for every household where someone is aged 80 or over. The Child Support reforms will increase the levels of child maintenance paid to parents, and along with the introduction of the Child Tax Credit, are helping to tackle child poverty. We have also introduced a range of policies that protect people from discrimination on the grounds of disability, help more people with disabilities to find employment, or support those who are unable to work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w32.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_167">These policies impact upon the whole of Great Britain. The Departmental Report contains details of all areas of DWP&#039;s work. This can be accessed, via the internet at: http://www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/dwp/2003/dwpreport/index.asp Copies of the Departmental Report are available in the Library.
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w32.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_168">To indicate the impact of some of the policies introduced, unemployment as a proportion of the working age population in Pendle has fallen since 1997 to 2.3 per cent. from 2.8 per cent., with over 20 per cent. fewer lone parents claiming income support. And more than 16,000 pensioners in Pendle will be entitled to the Winter Fuel Payment this year.

 The normal method of payment of Pension Credit will be by direct payment into an account. There are a number of types of account available.

Customers who indicate that they do not agree to their money being paid direct into an account can be paid by order book in the short term. It is explained to them that the Department is in the process of inviting all its customers to convert to direct payment and that order books and giro cheques will eventually be phased out by spring 2005. We have always recognised that there will be a small number of people who we cannot pay directly into an account.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;The figures are in 2002&#150;03 price terms. The totals are rounded to the nearest &#163;100 million, except 2003&#150;04 which is rounded to the nearest &#163;10 million. The totals may not sum due to rounding. Housing benefit and council tax benefit figures are rounded to the 



nearest &#163;10 million. Pension Credit figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;100 million, except in 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 which are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 million.<br>

2.&nbsp;Income related benefit offsets are calculated using the DWP&#039;s Policy Simulation model for 2003&#150;04. Calculations assume Pension Credit is in place for the full financial year 2003&#150;04 and that the starting point of the savings credit increases to the new value of the basic State Pension.<br>

3.&nbsp;The income related benefit offsets are assumed to remain a constant proportion of the additional expenditure on the basic State Pension in future years as a result of introducing an earnings link in April 2003. The split between the guarantee credit and the savings credit is assumed to remain constant in future years.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what proposals he has for addressing seasonal unemployment fluctuations in seaside towns; and if he will make a statement.  [124772]</p>








<p><a name="st_324"><a name="30717w34.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 In a dynamic economy, like the UK, jobs begin and end frequently and we cannot legislate to prevent change. Seaside towns suffer more seasonal fluctuation, but this can be reduced over time as broader employment bases are established. However, where there are job losses, the people affected need help and support to find a new job as quickly as possible&#151;whatever part of the economy they work in.
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w34.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_172">Jobcentre Plus is providing everyone of working age with advice and guidance on the full range of support available to help them move into work, including where this need is as a result of seasonal fluctuations. For those who need more help, we have introduced a wide range of programmes and initiatives designed to tackle the barriers that can prevent individuals from returning to work. We are making sure that people who become unemployed get back into employment as soon as possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w34.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_173">These policies have contributed to a reduction in unemployment across the country. For example, in Torbay, 2,277 people have been helped into work through the New Deals and the percentage of the working-age population in Torbay who were unemployed and claiming benefit has fallen from 5.8 per cent. in May 1997 to 2.9 per cent. in May 2003.

The Government&#039;s policy that its central Departments and agencies should actively seek to buy timber from legal and sustainable sources does not therefore apply to the building of the national stadium.

 Before a country can qualify for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, it must produce an interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) at Decision Point&#151;the first stage of the HIPC process&#151;setting out what action it will take to develop a full PRSP. To reach Completion Point&#151;the final stage when the relief becomes irrevocable&#151;the full PRSP must be in place, and under implementation for at least one year. The PRSP sets out the policy action governments are taking to reduce poverty, and also provides a budgetary framework not only for spending the savings from debt relief but also for allocating all other aid and government revenue so that they have the greatest impact on poverty reduction.

<p><a name="st_358"><a name="30717w38.html_spnew7"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The length of time taken to implement an option will depend on the option chosen and the circumstances of each individual local authority. However the following timescales can be used as a rough guide for future schemes:

 The decisions reached on the issues consulted on in &#039;The Way Forward for Housing Capital Finance&#039; are reflected in &quot;Sustainable Communities: building for the future&quot; and the Local Government Bill currently before Parliament.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how the scheme funding requirements to meet the decent homes standard as a result of the change from fitness standard to the health and safety rating system will be financed.  [126132]</p>








<p><a name="st_360"><a name="30717w38.html_spnew9"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 It is too early to say what will be the financial impact of applying the housing health and safety rating system to the decent home standard when the fitness standard is abolished. The cost of rectifying health and safety hazards will vary, and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects many of them to be put right relatively quickly and cheaply. Guidance to authorities on the assessment of decency using the rating system will be issued.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what estimate he has made of the number of houses which will be brought up to the decent homes standard in each year up to 2010, broken down by the method of finance to be used.  [126133]</p>








<p><a name="st_361"><a name="30717w38.html_spnew10"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The following table shows the estimated year on year change in the numbers of non-decent social sector homes from the baseline date of April 2001 to the target date of December 2010. The extent to which these numbers will be made up of ALMO/PFI/transfer schemes will depend on the results of the option appraisal process that each local authority is currently undertaking. This process is due to be completed by July 2005. In broad terms we have estimated that transfers will tackle between 200,000 and 250,000, ALMOs will tackle between 300,000 and 350,000 and PFI will tackle between 15,000 and 30,000 non-decent homes.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what conclusions he has drawn from the National Audit Office report on the costs of the large scale voluntary transfer programme.  [126163]</p>

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has concluded that the National Audit Office report Improving Social Housing Through Transfer confirms our belief that the benefits of transfer are clearly visible and worth the costs in ensuring tenants gain from faster renovation of, and improvement to their homes; greater tenant participation in decisions directly affecting their homes and surrounding area; and an increased sense of ownership and involvement in the local regeneration of the wider area.

There are several reasons why the projects which constituted pre-payments did not start early enough in the financial year to be counted in resource accounting terms. The start of a research project is often delayed. That might be, for example, because the principal researcher takes longer than predicted to identify research assistants. These delays in turn can mean that potential underspends are identified too late for additional projects to be identified, and the work started, before the end of the financial year.

Advice to NHS personnel on responding to incidents, such as radioactivity released from radiological bombs, is given in a detailed annex &quot;Practical guidance on planning for incidents involving radioactivity&quot; (www.doh.gov.uk/epcu/chp9/rad.htm) within the document &quot;Planning for Major Incidents: the NHS Guidance&quot; (1998). This guidance contains advice on the provision of facilities and equipment for monitoring for radioactivity for people who might have been contaminated. The document &quot;Deliberate Release of Biological and Chemical Guidance&quot; (2000) also gives generic advice on dealing with a Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) incident (www.doh.gov.uk/epcu/cbr/intro.htm).

 All suicides are tragic events affecting families and staff deeply, and reducing prisoner self-inflicted deaths and managing self-harm remains a key priority for Ministers and the Prison Service. The general prison population contains a large number of prisoners with a combination of psychiatric disorders, alcohol and drug dependency, family background and relationship problems, histories of self-harm and previous abuse, all of which raise their risk of suicide. Good care and support from staff saves many lives but such instances go largely unreported. One hundred and forty-one prisoners were resuscitated following self-harm incidents in 2002 and 37 in the first five months of this year.

<a name="30717w44.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_257">The Prison Service is in the final year of a three-year strategy to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and manage self-harm in prisons. Over the next few months the outcome of this will be reviewed taking into account pilot project evaluations and emerging research findings.

As part of this close partnership with other agencies such as the Youth Justice Board and outside organisations such as Samaritans, there has been a particular focus on improvements at six pilot sites in areas such as improved reception, first night and induction areas and mental health in-reach support. The Prison Service is running a series of projects to develop improved suicide prevention and self-harm management policies, concentrating on pre-reception, reception and induction arrangements; inter-agency information exchange; prisoner care; detoxification; prisoner peer support, and learning from investigations into deaths in custody.
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w44.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_258">Additionally, Samaritans are recruiting and training more prisoner peer supporters (known as Listeners) in high-risk establishments. One thousand one hundred and forty new Listeners were recruited between 1&nbsp;October 2001 and 31 December 2002 with further recruitment and training continuing. Listeners are selected, trained and supported by Samaritans to offer confidential support to their fellow prisoners who may be at risk of suicide, otherwise in crisis, or simply in need of someone to talk to. The scheme&#039;s objectives are to assist in preventing suicide, reducing self-harm and to help alleviate the feelings of those in distress.

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext"><a name="brev_250">Livestock in Britain are at risk of poisoning from common ragwort, so the Highways Agency is working to reduce ragwort growth on the verges of England&#039;s motorways and major trunk roads and to prevent the plant from spreading its seed.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext"><a name="brev_251">Ragwort grows through two distinct stages&#151;the rosette stage from germination to the end of May and the stem-flower stage from June onwards. The rosette stage is the early stage of growth where the ragwort is less noticeable but still poisonous with a dense rosette of leaves close to the ground.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext"><a name="brev_252">The Highways Agency is using a two-step attack to deal with both stages of growth. The rosettes are being sprayed with an herbicide during May and June, and later, contractors will return to hand pull the older, more mature plants to prevent their seeds being dispersed.</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext"><a name="brev_254">&quot;Ragwort is a difficult plant to combat as it is almost impossible to eradicate, at best it can be controlled. The seeds are very robust and can lie dormant in the soil for up to 20 years and so Ragwort grows unexpectedly in many different places. They can be carried for miles in the wind, and so as part of our work to control the problem, we encourage landowners to remove Ragwort from their land to try and prevent reinvasion.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext"><a name="brev_255">The Highways Agency takes this perennial problem very seriously as Common Ragwort can pose a serious threat to equines and livestock, and there is no specific treatment once an animal shows symptoms of poisoning.&quot;</p>

<p class "tabletext"><a name="brev_256">The Highways Agency spends in the region of &#163;1 million each year to help control the spread of Ragwort along the 5,841 miles of trunk roads and motorways it operates in England, and supports the British Horse Society&#039;s (BHS) annual &#039;Ragwort Action Week&#039; campaign.</p>

</ul>
<p>

1.&nbsp;The Highways Agency is an Executive Agency of the Department for Transport, which manages, maintains and improves the network of trunk roads and motorways in England on behalf of the Secretary of State. It works closely with other transport operators and with local authorities to integrate the trunk road network with the rest of England&#039;s roads and other forms of transport. More information is available at www.highways.gov.uk
2.&nbsp;Sections of the following route verges will be timetabled for treatment: A27, A249, M20, M23
3.&nbsp;Common ragwort (Senecio jacobaea L.) is one of the five injurious weeds specified in the Weeds Act 1959. Landowners have a duty of care to prevent it spreading.
4.&nbsp;Ragwort is normally a biennial (rosette&#151;spring 1st year; flowering&#151;July/August 2nd year). The rosette stage is the early stage of growth where the ragwort is at its most poisonous and has a dense rosette of leaves close to the ground. In the stem-flower stage, the plant grows between 30cm and 100cm high with clustered bright yellow flowers.
5.&nbsp;Each plant can produce up to 150,000 seeds with a 70% germination rate. Ragworts seeds can be domant in the soil for up to 20 years.
6.&nbsp;Equines and bovines are more susceptible to ragwort poisoning than other livestock. Little can be done for the animal once the symptoms appear. Young animals are more susceptible than mature animals.
7.&nbsp;Ragwort acts as a cumulative poison, eventually destroying the liver. A small intake of ragwort over a long period can be just as damaging as a large intake on a single occasion.

<p>
<a name="30717w50.html_para0">
The SRA advises that implementation of ERTMS Level 1, followed by subsequent migration to Level 2, would reduce network capacity and track worker safety as a result of increased trackside infrastructure and the costs would far outweigh the benefits. The industry recommendation therefore was to focus development and implementation on ERTMS Level 2. This was supported by the work of the Health and Safety Executive that led to the Health and Safety Commission&#039;s recommendation which the Secretary of State accepted in February 2003.

 In March 2002, the Department of Health and the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists&#151;Head and Neck Surgeons (BAO-HNS) carried out a comprehensive review of tonsil and adenoid surgery across the country. This followed advice from the Department that, in the interest of the safety of patients, surgeons should not use single use instruments for tonsil and adenoid surgery. The review found that many National Health Service trusts did not collect the data at the time of the operation and that therefore much of it was unreliable.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the quantity of single <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;measles and <i>(b)</i> mumps vaccines imported by GPs and private healthcare providers in the last year.  [120237]</p>








<p><a name="st_563"><a name="30717w58.html_spnew3"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 During the year ending March&nbsp;2003, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) received notifications to import an average of approximately 10,000 doses of measles vaccine per month and approximately 8,000 doses of mumps vaccine per month. Each notification is an intention to import only and does not necessarily reflect the number of doses actually imported. A survey by the MHRA has indicated that only 34 per cent., and 21 per cent. (for measles vaccine and mumps vaccine respectively) of the doses notified were followed through to importation. It is not known how many of these doses were actually given.
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w58.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_348">The figures are provided following further examination of the MHRA database of import notifications. This has revealed a serious inaccuracy in the reply provided to the hon. Member on 4 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 903&#150;04W.
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w58.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_349">The answer stated that the average number of notifications per month received by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) to import all brands of single mumps vaccine during 2002 was 3,014 doses. The answer at that time should have stated that the average number of doses notified per month to the MCA to import all brands of single mumps vaccine was 8,141 doses (for the 10 months ending October 2002).
</p>


<p>
<a name="30717w58.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_350">This discrepancy stems from the method of estimating the number of doses from the number of notifications of intentions to import unlicensed vaccines. Differences between the pack sizes of products, which had previously been assumed to have been the same as the number of doses, were the cause of these discrepancies. After extensive manual examination of records, these figures have now been corrected and systems have been put in place to prevent their recurrence. I apologise to the hon. Member for this inadvertent error.
