<i> [holding answer 3 July 2006]:</i> The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs does not directly undertake work in this area, but closely monitors research commissioned by the European Union, Research Councils and other Government Departments to identify, characterise, and assess the impact of aircraft emissions on global climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="60704w0001.htm_para0"><a name="06070447000943">A major scientific report assessing the contribution of aircraft to climate change, &#147;Aviation and the Global Atmosphere&#148;, was published in 1999 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). More recently, research carried out under the EU 5th Framework Project, TRADEOFF, has improved modelling techniques and reduced estimates of contrail radiative forcing by two fold compared with the previous estimate from the IPCC. Research carried out under the TRADEOFF project also supported the conclusion that aviation potentially enhances cirrus cloud coverage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="60704w0001.htm_para1"><a name="06070447000944">Aircraft-induced cirrus clouds reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface of the Earth, and so mitigate global warming. However, significant uncertainty surrounding this area of study makes it difficult to assess whether increased cloudiness would reduce or increase global warming trends.</p>

 The rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions between 1997 and 2004 was caused by higher than anticipated levels of economic growth and the recent rise in global energy prices which has altered the relative prices of coal and gas. However, CO2 emissions were still about 5.6 per cent. below 1990 levels and we expect CO2 emissions to fall again in the future given longer term expectations on fuel prices and as a result of policies introduced under the new Climate Change Programme.</p>

<i> [holding answer 3 July 2006]: </i>Defra has assessed research on the value and uses of the gamma interferon (gIFN) blood test in other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Europe. The test is now a standard tool in the cattle testing armoury of European countries with endemic TB problems, like the Republic of Ireland, Italy, Spain, Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="60704w0001.htm_para3"><a name="06070447000948">The gIFN test can detect some infected animals that are negative in the SICCT test (skin test) and may detect animals at an earlier stage of infection. However, the gIFN test is slightly less specific than the SICCT test, which means that it is also more likely to incorrectly identify negative animals as being infected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="60704w0001.htm_para4"><a name="06070447000949">In addition to evidence from overseas research, and in order to further improve bTB diagnostics, the Government have conducted a field trial to assess the potential benefits of using of the gIFN blood test in GB. This helped to establish that the use of this test, in parallel with the skin test, has the potential to significantly increase the detection of infected cattle where TB has been confirmed, and so hasten the elimination of infected cattle. Preparations are now being made for wider use of the gIFN test in prescribed circumstances. The results of the field trial on gIFN usage will be published shortly.</p>

 The cause of the green bloom in the waters of the Hampshire Avon below Amesbury is likely to be a combination of environmental factors, including high temperatures, low water flow and consequential increases in the concentration of nutrients. There have been no significant pollution incidents at this location in the river. Rainfall and river flows have been significantly depressed over the last 20 months and, in combination with other environmental factors, this may create opportunities for algal growth. However, the May 2006 period was characterised by periods of very high rainfall. Urban and agricultural runoff may lead to direct discolouration and also contribute to nutrient enrichment in the river.</p>

By the end of the 2010 period, two additional sewage treatment works discharging into the River Avon are expected to receive phosphate stripping and the phosphate limits set for the four original works are expected to be reduced to half of their currently permitted limit.</p>

 Progress with Malawi health sector-wide approach (SWAp) is reviewed jointly, twice a year by Government and donors, of whom DFID is the largest with a commitment of &#163;100 million over six years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="60704w0002.htm_para1"><a name="06070447001015">Progress has been good. In addition to the earlier successes of the eradication of polio and the elimination of neonatal tetanus and the increasing distribution of bed nets and their re-treatment (up from 7 per cent. in 2002 to 71 per cent. in 2004-05), the health service has taken on a rapid increase in antiretroviral treatment for HIV and AIDS. 50 sites have treated 46,000 people up from 3,000 two years ago. This is making a real difference: both saving lives and improving the quality of life of those living with HIV and AIDS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="60704w0002.htm_para2"><a name="06070447001016">Critical to this success has been the additional resources made available at hospital and clinic level as a result of the increased aid channelled through the health SWAp. The Emergency Human Resources Programme has in its first year recruited an extra 580 Malawian health professionals. There are 60 volunteer specialists and nurse tutors from overseas filling key vacant posts. The intake of Malawian trainee nurses and doctors has been increased in anticipation of the improvements in infrastructure at training schools that are now under way. New, internationally recruited senior managers have taken over the central medical stores management and are charged with bringing to an end the perennial stock outs that have frustrated the health services. A new maternal mortality road map offers a way forward to address the unacceptably high level of maternal deaths in Malawi. The Ministry of Health is entering service level agreements with private sector providers, particularly the Christian Hospital Association of Malawi, that will also provide the basic essential health package free-of-charge at point of delivery.</p>

The modification arises because the state membership of the IAEA is not identical to that of the UN, and developing countries were initially &#147;shielded&#148; from paying the full costs of the safeguards component of the Regular Budget. The UK accordingly, this year, paid 6.137 per cent. of the total Regular Budget. The future level of the annual UK contribution to the IAEA will be determined by UN contribution rates at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="60704w0003.htm_para1"><a name="06070447001066">In addition, the UK has made a number of voluntary contributions to the IAEA since 1997, including contributions totalling &#163;2.6 million to support the Agency's safeguards work, &#163;2 million to the IAEA's Nuclear Security Fund, and &#163;500,000 to support IAEA work to improve internal management processes. Additional non-financial &#147;in-kind&#148; support to help the Agency deliver its safeguards and other activities is provided through the UK nuclear industry, however the financial value of this could be calculated only at disproportionate cost.</p>

Subsection (4) of clause 399 requires that the Review is a balanced and comprehensive analysis of (a) the development and performance of the company&#146;s business during the financial year, and (b) the position of the company&#146;s business at the end of that year, consistent with the size and complexity of the business. The statutory provisions therefore set out the framework of the Business Review, but it is for directors of each company to determine its content according to the circumstances of the particular company. As subsection (6) requires, to the extent necessary for an understanding of the development, performance and position of the company&#146;s business, the review must include analysis using key performance indicators. Such indicators will make it easier for members to assess the development, performance and position of the company from year to year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_387"><a name="60704w0004.htm_para6"><a name="06070447001203">The Arts Council is responding in each of these areas. A new structure and role for the Arts Council's national office will be in place by the autumn. Engagement with its stakeholders will be improved by addressing issues that arise during an extensive consultation exercise with the sector and the public more widely over the coming months. A new Funding Agreement between my Department and the Arts Council will provide a central focus for the way the Arts Council works with Government.</p>

The factors currently considered in this formula relate to roads and bridges. For roads, they are the lengths and conditions of an authority's principal, classified non-principal and unclassified roads. For bridges, they are the size of the bridge stock and the numbers of bridges requiring strengthening or major maintenance. A minimum amount for bridges per authority of &#163;100,000 is applied. The combined roads and bridges allocations are adjusted to ensure an authority's total allocation does not vary by more than 25 per cent. from the previous year.</p>

The factors considered in this formula are related directly or indirectly to the transport shared priorities, as agreed between Government and the Local Government Association in 2002. The priorities and variables are shown in the following table. In addition, the formulaic distribution of funding takes into account previous ministerial commitments, European Union objective one designations and South East growth areas.</p>

<p><a name="st_184"><a name="06070466000018"><a name="60704w0007.htm_spnew8"><a name="06070466000073"><b>Mr. Hoon:</b>
 As my right hon. Friend the then Foreign Secretary (Mr Jack Straw) set out in his written ministerial statement of 27 March 2006, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 44-46W, the new constitution provides for a modern and mature relationship between the UK and Gibraltar. I do not think that this description would apply to any relationship based on colonialism. The constitution confirms the right of self-determination of the Gibraltarian people. The realisation of that right must be promoted and respected in conformity with the provisions of the UN Charter and any other applicable international treaties. Gibraltar's right of self-determination is not constrained by the Treaty of Utrecht except insofar as Article X gives Spain the right of refusal should Britain ever renounce Sovereignty. Thus independence would only be an option with Spanish consent. Her Majesty's Government recognise that the act of deciding on their acceptance of the new constitution in the forthcoming referendum will be an exercise of the right of self-determination by the Gibraltarian people in that context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_432"><a name="60704w0007.htm_para7"><a name="06070466000019">The new constitution does not in any way diminish British sovereignty and gives Gibraltar much greater control over its internal affairs and that degree of self-government compatible with British sovereignty and the UK's continuing international responsibilities. If the new constitution is agreed the UK will retain its full international responsibility for Gibraltar, including for Gibraltar's external relations and defence, and as the member state responsible for Gibraltar in the EU. The UK's long standing commitment that the UK will never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of another state against their wishes will be unchanged. This is also set out clearly in the Despatch which will be published at the same time as the Gibraltar Constitution Order and the draft of which I will place in the Library of the House. I will also send a copy to my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_433"><a name="60704w0007.htm_para8"><a name="06070466000020">It has also been the UK's long standing view that none of its remaining overseas territories, including Gibraltar, should remain on the UN list of non self-governing territories, despite the different circumstances affecting Gibraltar, namely the application of the Treaty of Utrecht as noted earlier. However, the criteria used by the UN are outdated and fail to take account of the way that relationships between the UK and its overseas territories have been modernised. The UK does not, therefore, engage formally to seek the removal of any of the overseas territories from the UN list.</p>

 While the number of elderly households who rely on solid fuel to heat their homes has reduced significantly in recent times, the 6.4 per cent. price increase will have an impact on those who rely on this type of fuel. The Department for Social Development and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive will continue to take action to mitigate the impact on elderly people through the provision of insulation measures and energy efficient central heating systems under the Warm Homes Plus Scheme and by providing financial assistance through the benefits system and the winter fuel payments scheme and by the Housing Executive&#146;s heating replacement programme.</p>

However, applicants for social housing have a choice of where they wish to live and as a result less than 10 per cent. of social housing is integrated, the majority of people preferring to live in areas where they felt comfortable. The choice of where to live therefore impacts significantly on the number of allocations that can be made in specific areas, as this depends on the availability of social housing, whether through new building or re-letting of existing stock. In some areas demand is greater than supply, while in others, the opposite is true and allocations cannot therefore be made at the same ratio for all areas. This does mean that some people will have to consider other areas in order to be re-housed or have to wait longer before they are re-housed. To make allocations on the basis of religious belief would be illegal under the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998.</p>

 Our approach to tackling knife crime has been different to that in other parts of the UK. We have participated in the national knife amnesty, but this has been accompanied by a year-long public information campaign aimed at addressing the culture of knife carrying among young people, which is unique to Northern Ireland. In addition to this, an education package will begin in schools in September and other measures will be introduced, including the raising of the minimum age at which a knife can be legally purchased to 18-years-old. It is our intention to hold a further knife amnesty during 2006, which again is unique to Northern Ireland and this will help us to gauge how effective these initiatives have been.</p>

 There are currently 646 sex offenders in Northern Ireland subject to the notification requirements of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Police collate statistics in accordance with the Home Office counting rules which relate to crime type and not to age of victim. The police estimate that some 60 per cent. of sex offenders have committed sexual offences against children. All offenders are subject to individual risk assessment and management under the multi-agency sex offender and risk management (MASRAM) procedures. At an operational level the police and other agencies are fully aware of the nature of each individual offender's offending behaviour including whether this involved offences against children.</p>

We are also funding a range of projects and materials to promote languages and to develop innovative curricular models which will be show-cased to provide schools with delivery ideas and support. For example, we funded CILT, the National Centre for Languages to produce &#145;Languages Work&#146;, a suite of materials designed to promote the value of language learning, support take-up of languages beyond key stage 3, and how language skills can enhance future employability.</p>

In September 2006, 13 other languages will be made available through the scheme. The scheme differs from existing approaches to assessment in that there are separate qualifications in each language for reading, writing, listening and speaking. To date over 800 centres&#151;including local authorities and specialist language colleges&#151;have registered to take part in the scheme, with over 10,000 learners entered for qualifications across all sectors taking over 26,000 qualifications.</p>

 All maintained schools must provide religious education (RE) which must reflect the fact that the religious traditions in Great Britain are in the main Christian while taking account of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain. This could include Islam. Religious education syllabuses for maintained schools without a religious designation are drawn up by an agreed syllabus conference which advises the local education authority. These bodies represent faith groups, teachers and local schools. For schools with a religious designation the syllabus is drawn up by the governing body according to the trust deed of the school. It is for local authorities, advised by agreed syllabus conferences, and individual faith schools to decide if study of atheism is included as part of the RE syllabus.</p>

All of the major UK faith and belief communities and professional groups were involved in its development.</p>

 To promote the study of foreign languages for learners of all ages, the Government published their National Languages Strategy: &#147;Languages for All: Languages for Life&#151;a Strategy for England&#148; in December 2002. The cornerstone of the strategy is that by 2010 all Key Stage 2 pupils will have the opportunity to study a foreign language in class time. It is for individual schools to decide which languages they offer depending on their expertise and access to resources and support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_592"><a name="60704w0024.htm_para0"><a name="06070542000946">At Key Stages 3 and 4, secondary schools must give access to at least one course in an official working language of the European Union that leads to an approved qualification. The official working languages of the European Union, for which there are approved qualifications, are: Danish, Dutch, French, German, Modern Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish. Once this offer has been made schools may then decide to offer additional languages. Approved qualifications are available in a wide range of languages in the categories raised in the question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_593"><a name="60704w0024.htm_para1"><a name="06070542000947">Ancient languages do not form part of the national curriculum. It is for individual schools and their governing bodies to decide whether to include the classics&#151;including classical languages&#151;in their respective curriculum. Their decision may depend on demand for the subject, having a specialist classics teacher available to teach it, and in meeting the needs of their pupils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_594"><a name="60704w0024.htm_para2"><a name="06070542000948">As part of our Specialist Schools Programme, secondary schools can apply to become humanities colleges. As part of this specialism, schools have the option to focus on the teaching and learning of classical studies (that is, Latin, Classical Greek and classical civilisation) alongside a core humanities option of History, Geography or English.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_595"><a name="60704w0024.htm_para3"><a name="06070542000949">In 2005 the Department launched the Languages Ladder&#151;the national, voluntary recognition scheme for languages&#151;as an alternative qualification route to complement existing qualifications. The Languages Ladder endorses achievement in language skills at all levels of competence for all ages. It is available currently in eight languages: French, German, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Panjabi, Spanish and Urdu. A further 13 languages, in the first three stages of the scheme, will be added in September this year and will include: Arabic, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Modern Greek, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Swedish, Tamil, Turkish and Yoruba.</p>

 The Department has commissioned research to assess compliance with statutory National Nutritional Standards and to measure food consumption in maintained schools in England. A study of &#145;School Meals in Secondary Schools in England&#146; reported in 2004 (DfES Research Report 557). A similar &#145;Study of School Meals in Primary Schools in England&#146; has been conducted, and reported on 29 June 2006 (DfES Research Report 753).</p>

An internal DfES survey of local authorities (LA) was conducted in November 2005 to assess the nature of school meal provision and providers, the patter of commercial provision and contractual arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_605"><a name="60704w0027.htm_para1"><a name="06070542003598">The Department has asked the School Food Trust (SFT) as part of its remit to monitor progress on school meals and report regularly to the Department. The SFT plans to collect information about school meals provision using several approaches. First, they are working with Ofsted and the national Healthy Schools Programme to develop a way of assessing whether or not the new DfES standards for school meals are being met. The intention is for this to be completed by early 2007. Second, they plan to undertake national sample surveys of primary and secondary schools&#146; food provision and consumption, similar to the two studies commissioned by the Department. These provide baseline information against which the change in the national profile of provision and consumption of foods in school meals can be evaluated. The timing and scale of the national sample surveys will be confirmed by the end of August 2006. Finally, the SFT has just completed a survey addressed to all local authority catering providers in England to assess school meal take-up, the costs of providing a school meal, factors believed to be associated with increases or decreases in take-up, and perceived barriers to change. The survey will be published in July 2006 and repeated annually at the end of each financial year.</p>

<i> [holding answer 3 July 2006]:</i> The Department for Communities and Local Government recently published guidance for schools on the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, &#147;Fire Safety Risk Assessment&#151;Educational Premises&#148;. This states that the responsibility for complying with the Fire Safety Order rests with the &#147;responsible person&#148;. With a school maintained by a local authority, the duties of the responsible person are likely to be shared between the local authority, the governing body and the head teacher. One of the prime duties of the responsible person is to appoint one or more competent persons&#151;someone with sufficient training, knowledge and experience to carry out the preventive and protective measures required by the Fire Safety Order. The guidance covers what these are. In Part 1, section 3.41 deals with fire detection and warning systems, and 3.42 with firefighting equipment and facilities. They give advice on what to look for in school premises and provide checklists for both detection and firefighting.</p>

 School security is a local matter. Under health and safety law, it is for individual school employers to determine what measures a school should take to keep pupils and staff safe. In the main, schools are very safe places and the majority of pupils have never carried a knife. It is a criminal offence to carry an offensive weapon on school premises. Where schools have suspicions they can call the police, and should do so if they believe pupils or staff are at risk of serious harm. Schools and local police can agree a Safer School Partnership to prevent crime in and around a school. We also propose a power in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill to enable schools to search, without consent, pupils they suspect are carrying a knife or other weapon.</p>

 It is not possible to give a precise figure but the following table provides a broad estimate of the value of the unpaid work done by offenders since 1995. It takes no account of the costs to the probation service of managing the work. Orders that include unpaid work vary in length but the calculation is based on the average number of hours per order. An allowance has been made for the fact that not all offenders complete their orders. The estimated total number of hours has been multiplied by the national minimum wage for each year. (Because the minimum wage came into force in 1999, the introductory figure of &#163;3.60 has been used for 1995 to 1998.)</p>

 Prisoners and young offenders have a statutory entitlement to domestic or social visits. In addition, many establishments offer extended or family visits. The frequency of these additional visits remains a matter for each establishment, taking account of resources and regime. Statistics on the number of visitors are not routinely collated so there is no recent evidence as to the overall level of take up. However, in order to support and encourage more visitors, the Assisted Prisons Visits Scheme, which provides financial assistance for visitors on a low income, was extended in 2004. Good Practice Guidelines have also recently been issued to enable prisons and YOIs to examine and improve the effectiveness of their visits arrangements.</p>

<i> [holding answer 26 June 2006]:</i> Staff to trainee ratios are difficult to calculate, for a variety of reasons. For example, some staff spend almost all their time dealing with trainees; others, for example support staff, will have less frequent contact. The following figures are indicative:</p>

</ul><a name="60704w0033.htm_brev1"><a name="06070542004357"><ul><p class="tabletext">Secure training centres: the number of staff supervising trainees ranges between two staff to five to seven trainees and three staff to eight trainees. Other staff at the centre include custody officers to supervise visits, admissions and movements in the centre.</p>
</ul><a name="60704w0033.htm_brev2"><a name="06070542004358"><ul><p class="tabletext">Young offender institutions: no simple ratio is available. On each wing, there are between 40 and 60 trainees, under the supervision of between three and six staff. In addition, there are teachers, learning support assistants and support staff.</p>
