<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w01.html_wqn0"><B> Pete Wishart: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office how much the Department spent on advertising in Scotland in each year since 1999 on <i>(a)</i> television, <i>(b)</i> newspapers, <i>(c)</i> radio, <i>(d)</i> magazines, <i>(e)</i> billboards and <i>(f)</i> sporting events.  [102325]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Due to the format in which advertising information is held, to provide the information as requested would result in disproportionate costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w01.html_wqn1"><B> Tony Wright: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what the criteria are for classifying public and advisory bodies as <i>(a)</i> executive non-departmental public bodies, <i>(b)</i> advisory non-departmental public bodies, <i>(c)</i> task forces, <i>(d)</i> ad hoc advisory groups and <i>(e)</i> reviews; and what particular qualities or characteristics distinguish these bodies from each other.  [102521]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Generally, executive non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) operate under statutory provisions and are legally incorporated; their functions cover a national remit (including the devolved assemblies); appointments to the Board of the NDPB are made by Ministers, or by the Queen on ministerial advice; such appointments must be made in accordance with the Code of Practice of the Commissioner for Public Administration (OCPA); the chief executive is accountable to the Board; the NDPB has its own budget; staff are employed directly by the body itself (and are not civil servants); and Ministers are answerable to Parliament for the NDPB and have the powers to wind it up subject to, where appropriate, the approval of Parliament or, where a Royal Charter has previously been granted, of the Queen.
<P>

<a name="30317w01.html_para0">Advisory NDPBs are usually set up administratively by Ministers, or by the Queen on ministerial advice, without the need for legislation; those appointed to the Board are independent of Government and drawn from outside the public sector; the NDPB should be a standing body existing for more than one year and meeting at least annually; the Board has a defined membership and clear terms of reference; as with executive NDPBs, appointments are subject to the OCPA Code of Practice and the remit tends to have a national focus; the Board is usually supported by staff from within the sponsoring department but is not part of a department or agency; generally the NDPB does not prepare its own accounts and instead is accounted for through the books of the sponsoring department; and Ministers are answerable to Parliament for the body and may wind it up.




<P>
<P><I>17 Mar 2003 : Column 500W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30317w01.html_para1">There is little to distinguish between task forces, ad hoc advisory groups and reviews. These bodies can be defined in various ways. However, the Government's response to the Sixth 'Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life' gave 3 criteria as a definition:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Membership drawn from the wider public sector and/or voluntary organisations and/or the private sector
<P>
<BR>
A lifetime normally of less than 2 years;
<P>
<BR>
A remit focused on a single issue.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30317w01.html_para2">Some of these bodies may go on to become classified as NDPBs where the need for the body's advice continues beyond its original life span e.g. the Better Regulation Task Force, Skills Task Force and the New Deal Task Force.
<P>

<a name="30317w01.html_para3">Finally, as their name indicates executive NDPBs will be largely concerned with an operational or executive function while an advisory NDPB would be more likely to provide specific advice in a specialised field. Both executive and advisory NDPBs tend to be more formal and likely to run for longer than task forces, ad hoc advisory groups and reviews. The choice of the most appropriate body to be set up in a given situation will depend upon all of the criteria described here, and ministerial judgment about what would be most suitable for the intended purpose.

<a name="30317w01.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is responsible for policies on sustainable farming and food, including plant health, plant variety rights and all aspects of horticulture. The activities and actions of the Department and its Ministers are aimed at developing and promoting these policies as cost-effectively and efficiently as possible. Defra aims to promote sustainable, diverse, modern and adaptable farming through domestic and international actions and to promote a sustainable and safe food supply chain which meets consumers' requirements.
<P>

<a name="30317w01.html_para4">Defra produces a number of agricultural publications, including "Agriculture in the United Kingdom", which is published annually in association with the devolved administrations. In response to a recommendation of the EFRA Select Committee in its recent report "The Future of UK Agriculture in a Changing World", Defra will publish an annual assessment of the state of the agriculture industry and its future prospects in an international context.
<P>

<a name="30317w01.html_para5">Defra was formed in June 2001. The Department does not maintain records of its publicity expenditure in the categories set out in the hon. Gentleman's question. To undertake attempts to identify the closest equivalents to them would incur disproportionate cost.

<a name="30317w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government will judge the outcome of the public debate on the opportunities that it has presented people to gain a fuller understanding of the wider issues surrounding genetic modification and to reach their own judgement. The Government set up an independent public debate steering board that announced its own indicators against which it would assess the success of the debate. These include the extent to which people felt they were able to participate, their awareness of the debate, whether it was credible and innovative, and whether it improved the present understanding of public views.

 As yet there is no reliable measure of the amount of methane escaping from disused coal mines. Current estimates vary from 0.3 per cent. to 2 per cent. of UK greenhouse gas emissions. My Department, in consultation with the industry, have commissioned an independent study to provide an accurate estimate of methane emissions from this source which will report in two years time.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what the Government's policy is on building new <i>(a)</i> incinerators and <i>(b)</i> waste to energy plants;  [100475]
<P>
<UL>(2) what guidance she has issued to local authorities about building new <i>(a)</i> incinerators and <i>(b)</i> waste to energy plants;  [100476]
<P>
(3) what percentage of UK waste the Government expect to dispose of through <i>(a)</i> incinerators and <i>(b)</i> waste to energy plants in the next five years.  [100474]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Waste Strategy 2000 (Cm4693&#150;2) sets out our policies for sustainable waste management and the steps to achieving them. Minimising waste production and maximising re-use and recycling of waste are central to that policy.
<P>

<a name="30317w02.html_para8">Our policy on municipal waste incinerators or other energy from waste facilities is that they should only be considered where it can be shown that they are appropriately sized so that they would not "crowd out" recycling. They should also include, wherever possible, combined heat and power systems which produce electricity and provide effective heating for homes and businesses.
<P>

<a name="30317w02.html_para9">The Government have no plans for the number of incinerators or other energy from waste facilities that local authorities should provide, nor are there any targets for the production of energy from waste. The Regulatory Impact Assessment of Waste Strategy 2000 (published in Annex C of Part 2 of the strategy) assessed a variety of waste management scenarios and provided broad ranges for numbers of required facilities. Variables included different projections for waste growth, different mixes of waste management facilities, and differing levels of participation in recycling schemes. A similar exercise was carried out by the Strategy Unit and published in their report "Waste not, Want not" in November last year.

 The waste hierarchy, in Waste Strategy 2000 (Cm 4693&#150;1) sets out the order in which options for waste management should be considered based on environmental impact. Following the hierarchy the best option is reduction (waste minimisation) followed in order by re-use, recycling, composting, energy recovery, and disposal.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the environmental impact of <i>(a)</i> burning wood as a fuel and <i>(b)</i> increasing the use of wood as fuel.  [101292]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w03.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Burning of wood from sustainably managed forests for energy production does not contribute to the UK's carbon dioxide emissions as the gas released through combustion will be absorbed by new tree growth. Wood combustion does contribute to the UK's emissions of methane and nitrousoxide. These gases have a global warming potential, but even when this is taken into account, the overall impact, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy input, is unlikely to exceed 15 per cent. of the impact of fossil fuel combustion for wood burnt domestically in open grates, or 5 per cent.of the impact of fossil fuel combustion for wood burnt in combustion plant.
<P>

<a name="30317w03.html_para0">Emissions associated with the management, harvesting and transportation of wood are small relative to total energy content of the wood. Nevertheless minimising transportation distances and improving the 



<P>
<P><I>17 Mar 2003 : Column 508W</I><P>
efficiency of transportation should be included as factors in the evaluation of proposals for new wood fuel developments.
<P>

<a name="30317w03.html_para1">The combustion of wood, as opposed to coal or oil, produces low emissions of sulphur dioxide as wood has a lower sulphur content. Wood also tends to be burnt at lower temperatures than coal or oil which, in general, results in lower emissions of oxides of nitrogen compared to those from other fuels. Burning wood can also produce small amounts of benzene, particles, lead and polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons. Estimates of emissions of the main air pollutants from domestic and industrial wood combustion, compared with the UK totals, are set out in the Appendix.
<P>

<a name="30317w03.html_para2">Depending on the soil in which the biomass is grown, wood can contain heavy metals which on burning are retained in the ash. Inefficient burning can leave some carbon in the ash therefore polyaromatic hydrocarbons must also be considered. If concentration thresholds for either are exceeded, ash should be disposed of in a controlled manner. However a recent compilation of data on UK wood suggests that heavy metal concentration in ash will not constitute a hazard to human health or the environment. Since ash contains a range of important nutrients there is the possibility of returning it as a fertiliser to forests.
<P>

<a name="30317w03.html_para3">An overall assessment of the emissions impact from an increase in the use of wood as fuel depends on the fuel it replaces, the efficiency of the combustion systems and the abatement technology used.
<P>

<a name="30317w03.html_para4">Greater use of wood fuel can assist in limiting CO2 emissions, and other emissions can be minimised by maximising the efficiency of the combustion process, and by installing appropriate abatement control. Increases in the use of wood will be largely based on efficient and environmentally friendly systems

 According to UNHCR reports there are still around 700,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) in Afghanistan. The continuing drought in the South is I understand, causing further displacement.
<P>

<a name="30317w03.html_para10">During 2002, international agencies helped over 250,000 IDPs to return home. And a further 200,000 are estimated to have returned home on their own. In the current financial year we have contributed &#163;5.8 million to UNHCR's programmes for IDPs and returnees, including &#163;1.8 million this month. The continuing challenge in Afghanistan is to help meet the basic needs of the most vulnerable people, whilst building Government capacity for sustainable reconstruction.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w03.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The high cost of drugs is a key barrier to poor people's ability to access essential medicines. The pharmaceutical industry, in partnership with the international community and donor governments, provide some medicines at preferential prices to the developing world. The Government have been working with partners to make a major advance towards the widespread and sustainable access to medicines to the world's poor, including through pharmaceutical companies providing medicines for HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria at close to the cost of manufacture. However there is a risk that such medicines can be diverted and sold by 'middle men' back to developed country markets where they can be sold at a higher price. The extent of this problem can vary. Last year one company reported that roughly 25 per cent. of its preferentially priced AIDS medicines were diverted back to the EU.
<P>

<a name="30317w03.html_para11">Our High Level Working Group on increasing Access to Essential Medicines examined ways of minimising the problem. In the long-term, strengthening developing country health systems will better equip countries to minimise product leakage. DFID has committed over &#163;1.5 billion since 1997 to health systems strengthening in poorer countries. Other strategies to minimise diversion include, developing distinctive packaging and labelling of preferentially priced medicines, and implementing customs regulations in wealthier markets which prohibit re- importation. The European Union is currently discussing a regulation which would include such measures.

 US$196 million was awarded to the Malawi Global Fund Coordinating Committee in August 2002 for HIV/AIDS. This is currently the largest GFATM award in Africa. A further USD 40 million was approved in February 2003 for scaling up prevention and treatment of Malaria.
<P>

<a name="30317w04.html_para0">A review of Global Fund proposals in five countries, including Malawi, was undertaken in August 2002. It highlights the challenge in Malawi to absorb the additional finance given the prevailing health service infrastructure. There are major shortages of

<P>

<a name="30317w04.html_para1">Accordingly the Global Fund is phased so that initial stages concentrate on building capacity for service delivery. The Global Fund proposal is complemented by several other initiatives in the health sector, including work supported by my Department in strengthening essential medical laboratory services, medical supplies management, and improved mechanisms for coordinating donor support. The DFID mainstreaming strategy will help strengthen the institutional framework for a multi-sectoral HIV response by supporting posts in government and key institutions including WHO, UNAIDS and the World bank.

 It is difficult to find clear statistics on access to clean water in Iraq. The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation Coverage, the official UN reference system for monitoring water coverage statistics, provides figures for most of the years in question. (Given the difficulties in routinely measuring safe water, their surveys measure the presence of water facilities of different technology types. Improved water supplies are defined as those inherently safer than other types of supplies. They include: household connection; public standpipe; bore hole; protected dug well; protected spring; or rainwater collection. Not improved water supplies include: unprotected well; unprotected spring; vendor-provided water; bottled water; tanker truck-provided water.) In their estimates for 1980&#150;2000, the following figures for access to improved water supplies in Iraq are provided:

DFID cannot confirm the reliability of these figures.

 Nearly two thirds of the world's population will be living in countries of significant water stress by the year 2025, with the increasing possibility of conflicts over water becoming more common. One in five people in the world lack access to safe drinking water and nearly half lack access to sanitation. Misuse of resources and poor management have resulted in depleted supplies, falling water tables, shrinking inland lakes and stream flows reduced to ecologically unsustainable levels. In addition water pollution, from mainly human activities, is decreasing the amount of water suitable for many uses. At the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development strong commitments were made for better management of water resources and improved access to drinking water and sanitation and these must now be implemented.

The UN World Water Development Report (WWDR)&#151;'Water for People Water for Life' which has just been released, is the first major output from the programme and will be presented at the 3rd world water forum in Kyoto, Japan, this week. The report represents the combined efforts of 23 UN agencies and convention secretariats and is now the most comprehensive and up-to-date information on the state of the world's freshwater resources. The availability of rigorous and authoritative water information at appropriate scales in the public domain will influence actions by others and allow critical issues to be identified.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. In resolution 678 the Security Council authorised force against Iraq, to eject it from Kuwait and to restore peace and security in the area.
<P>
<BR>
2. In resolution 687, which set out the ceasefire conditions after Operation Desert Storm, the Security Council imposed continuing obligations on Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction in order to restore international peace and security in the area. Resolution 687 suspended but did not terminate the authority to use force under resolution 678.
<P>
<BR>
3. A material breach of resolution 687 revives the authority to use force under resolution 678.
<P>
<BR>
4. In resolution 1441 the Security Council determined that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of resolution 687, because it has not fully complied with its obligations to disarm under that resolution.
<P>
<BR>
5. The Security Council in resolution 1441 gave Iraq "a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations" and warned Iraq of the "serious consequences" if it did not.
<P>
<BR>
6. The Security Council also decided in resolution 1441 that, if Iraq failed at any time to comply with and co-operate fully in the implementation of resolution 1441, that would constitute a further material breach.
<P>
<BR>
7. It is plain that Iraq has failed so to comply and therefore Iraq was at the time of resolution 1441 and continues to be in material breach.
<P>
<BR>
8. Thus, the authority to use force under resolution 678 has revived and so continues today.
<P>
<BR>
9. Resolution 1441 would in terms have provided that a further decision of the Security Council to sanction force was required if that had been intended. Thus, all that resolution 1441 requires is reporting to and discussion by the Security Council of Iraq's failures, but not an express further decision to authorise force.

<P>
<a name="30317w05.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has a legal duty to compile and publish lists of buildings of special architectural or historic importance. These lists are in the public domain, and can be accessed through local authorities, records offices, libraries, English Heritage and DCMS. Many other groups will also hold information on listed buildings, including amenity societies and local interest groups.
<P>

<a name="30317w05.html_para2">English Heritage undertook a security review in 2000 which looked into the implications of placing photographs of private buildings on the internet. The review consulted with the police, insurers and technical experts and concluded that no evidence could be found to support a link between the kind of information English Heritage is publishing on the internet and any physical threats to property security.

<a name="30317w07.html_para3">A risk assessment of perchloroethylene (tetrachloro-ethylene), conducted under the Existing Substances Regulation (European Community Council Regulation No. 793/93) is being led by the United Kingdom. The Health and Safety Executive acts jointly with my Department to form the United Kingdom Competent Authority for these activities. The risk assessment will critically evaluate the risks to the environment, workers, consumers and the general public from exposure to perchloroethylene. The risk assessment includes exposure as a result of dry cleaning operations.

<a name="30317w07.html_para5">The Solvents Emissions Directive (1999/13/EC) places limits on emissions of solvents used in a number of processes, including dry cleaning. It also sets timetables for the replacement by less harmful substances of those solvents used in these processes that have been assigned to a risk phrase of R45, R46, R49, R60, or R61. The Directive has already been partly transposed. I expect to begin consultations soon on how the remaining parts of this Directive will be transposed, including the provisions applying to the dry cleaning sector.

 All trials at Aberporth Range are carried out under radar surveillance from fully qualified air traffic controllers. In the event of an infringement which could potentially compromise safety, the trial would be stopped until the incident was resolved. Any such infringements are reported to the regulatory authority for review. In addition, there are arrangements, agreed between the Aberporth Range and the nearby West Wales Airport, which set out the procedures to be used by both parties concerning operations at and around the range.

<a name="30317w08.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 November 2003]:</i> As of July 2002, there were 6,489 regular personnel in the Defence Medical Services (DMS) excluding student nurses and other new entry trainees. Of these, at any one time some will be unavailable for operational duty within the United Kingdom as a result of medical downgrading. As of November 2002, the latest date for which figures are available, 131 were unavailable for such duty as a result of medical downgrading. In practice, the number of DMS personnel available for operational duty in the United Kingdom will depend on other commitments including deployment on overseas operations, training and exercises, and retained tasks.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w08.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 In general, security at Ministry of Defence (MOD) ranges is provided in accordance with their use and purpose, taking account of the prevailing threat assessment. When ranges are temporarily in use by military personnel, the standards for security of personnel and their equipment, is the same as those which apply at permanent MOD establishments and sites. Some ranges, for example the one at West Freugh, are MOD owned but managed by QinetiQ, a commercial company. Security at these sites is the responsibility of the contractor, and is normally implemented by a civilian guard force, supported by the local constabulary. As a commercial company, QinetiQ complies with Government-wide security regulations issued by the Cabinet Office, rather than with MOD security procedures. MOD reserves the right, however, to take such additional measures as we consider necessary to protect our Service personnel and materiel when making use of these ranges.

<a name="30317w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 All NBC respirators issued to service personnel are periodically tested during training in a Hazardous Environment Chamber to ensure they function correctly and are the correct size for the individual concerned. A new Respirator Test System is being delivered into service. It allows respirators&#151;including those issued to deployed personnel&#151;to be tested to an even higher standard.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w08.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We understand that Longcross Tanklands is an informal local term used to describe a former test track, which forms part of what the Ministry of Defence and QinetiQ know as the Chertsey South site. The freehold of the Chertsey site was transferred to QinetiQ when the company was vested as a Plc in July 2001 and is scheduled for disposal. Negotiations are currently underway with potential purchasers.
<P>

<a name="30317w08.html_para7">Under the terms of the deal signed with The Carlyle Group to acquire a stake in QinetiQ, the Chertsey site forms security against an outstanding loan note from QinetiQ to MOD. QinetiQ will receive no proceeds from the sale of the site until the loan note is repaid in full.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w08.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Department places a large number of contracts each year with QinetiQ&#151;in excess of 1,000 in calendar year 2002. These contracts typically cover a number of tasks, which may include the provision of impartial specialist technical and scientific advice, conducting independent research and the supply of testing and evaluation services. There is no centrally held list identifying all the specific instances in which QinetiQ has acted as advisers and such information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what methods are used by the Ministry of Defence to forecast <i>(a)</i> social trends and <i>(b)</i> risks in relation to (i) recruitment and (ii) retention; and if he will make a statement.  [100173]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w09.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The armed forces employ a number of methods to identify and assess factors&#151;including social trends and risks&#151;that impact on recruitment and retention. The Department has its own analytical capability situated in the Defence Analytical and Services Agency, where much of this groundwork is undertaken. Social trends are identified primarily through commissioned research. This provides access to a wide range of research information across Government Departments, for example labour trends, demography, and census statistics. Targeted research 



<P>
<P><I>17 Mar 2003 : Column 533W</I><P>
contracts are also placed, as necessary, to improve our understanding of the employment market in which we compete. Recruiting risks are identified from this research and from very close scrutiny of the emerging performance of the recruiting machine.
<P>

<a name="30317w09.html_para0">As far as retention is concerned, a key part of the pay and workforce strategy for the armed forces is the identification of high level risks and the levers that can be used to ameliorate those risks. Within that strategy, underpinning policies are reviewed in the light of evidence obtained both from routine surveys (for example Continuous Attitude Surveys) and from discrete research on specific topics.

 There are no actual or projected savings for the period 1 April 2001 to 1 April 2010 in the wage bill of the armed forces as a result of the introduction of Pay 2000 for Service personnel. Pay 2000 was introduced in April 2001 to provide a more responsive pay system for the needs of Service personnel&#151;up to and including one-star level&#151;serving in the 21st century. It was not intended to be a cost saving measure.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make it a requirement <i>(a)</i> that vehicles with hydraulic tail lifts should clearly display the weight of such lifts and <i>(b)</i> that notices should be displayed on vehicles warning that the weight of such lifts has to be included in the calculation for the legal permitted weight load capacity; and if he will make a statement.  [103091]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 require that the maximum weight that a vehicle can operate at is to be displayed on a plate fixed to it. This weight will include that of any equipment fitted to the vehicle and load carried on it. The Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 require all lifting equipment and lifting accessories to be marked with a safe working load. Tail lifts do not normally carry any load while the vehicle is travelling on a road.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked by the Transport Minister, David Jamieson, to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking if all the compensation to householders resulting from the construction of the M60 had been paid; if there are any steps in place to reduce fees for agents and if claimants are being paid interest for late pay outs.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I believe that you are referring primarily to compensation under Part I of the Land Compensation Act 1973 (as amended). Such claims, for the depreciation in the value of property arising from the use of a new or altered highway, can be made for a period of 6 years from the first claim date which falls 12 months after the road is opened to traffic. In the case of the M60 Manchester Outer Ring Road construction was undertaken in four contracts, resulting in a variety of claim periods.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The main body of construction work (Contracts 1& 3) led to the road being opened on 30 October 2000 and a first claim date of 30 October 2001. We have received over 14,000 claims to date and continue to receive them at the rate of approximately 300 per month Around 1,000 claims have been settled so far. On Contract 4, for which the claim period closed last month, we have 22 cases awaiting settlement. Another 322 cases remain unsettled on Contract 2, for which the claim period remains open until December 2004. In all cases interest, calculated from the date the claim is received (or the first claim date, if later) until the date that compensation is paid, is added to the compensation.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition to Part I compensation, we have also compensated people for the acquisition of land and property in connection with the construction of the road. Around 200 such cases have yet to be finalised. In these types of cases interest, calculated from the date of entry on to the land until the date that compensation is paid, is added to the compensation.</FONT></UL>

<a name="30317w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The increased timetable which Virgin Cross Country introduced in October 2002 has proved to be unworkable in various respects. The Strategic Rail Authority has agreed timetable changes, including changes affecting Gloucester, and is granting the necessary derogations from the passenger service requirements. The aim is to improve the performance and reliability of services overall. At Gloucester the withdrawal of Virgin Cross Country services (save for one morning and one evening peak service to Birmingham) will be offset by a new, more reliable pattern of services operated variously by Central Trains, Wessex Trains and Wales and Borders.

<a name="30317w11.html_para0">The Government recognise the valuable contribution that voluntary groups and charities make in delivering services, and realise that the question of irrecoverable VAT provides difficulties for some charities. The Review of Charity Taxation looked carefully at the problem of irrecoverable VAT and concluded, for reasons of principle and affordability that no changes should be made. In response to representations during the recent Cross-Cutting Review of the Role of the Voluntary and Community Sector in Service Delivery, the Government considered the issue afresh to determine once and for all whether the obstacles presented by irrecoverable VAT could be overcome. Having considered all the options available, including a targeted compensation fund, the Government concluded that no fundamental change should be made to the way the VAT system operates and the available resources would be better deployed through the new investment fund, 'futurebuilders'. This is a one-off &#163;125 million investment, over the three years of the 2002 Spending Review, specifically to assist voluntary and community sector service-providing organisations in their public service work. The Treasury is leading on the design of 'futurebuilders' in close co-operation with the voluntary and community sector, and the Government intend to conduct wide consultation between April and June this year.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am placing the requested information in the House of Commons Library. The tables provided show median weekly earnings including and excluding overtime and the earnings at which 10 per cent. of people earn more and 10 per cent. earn less. Some of the data requested have been suppressed in the answer. This is because the New Earnings Survey (NES) has not been designed to provide estimates at this very detailed level.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The NES can provide earnings data for small geographical areas. The release of NES data is restricted to figures that are derived from a sufficiently large sample of employees, and have an acceptable level of accuracy and I have provided the available data for Scotland and the unitary authorities in Scotland only for those areas where the samples are large enough. These are based on the 2002 NES, the latest survey for which data are available.</FONT></UL>

 Landfill tax is a tax on waste, and is applied to all waste disposed of by way of landfill at a licensed landfill site, unless that waste is specifically exempted. Recycling plants are therefore not liable to tax. Indeed, landfill tax is designed to encourage recycling&#151;by making the disposal of waste to landfill more expensive, it encourages waste producers to recover more value from waste, for example through recycling or composting. Landfill tax also contains provisions for tax-free areas on landfill sites to encourage site operators to recycle material sent to their sites for disposal.

We intend to do this through improving training and raising awareness amongst the professional judiciary and magistrates.

As a consequence of the ACS 2002, the application form used to apply for contact or residence will be amended so that the applicant can indicate, and give details about, whether abuse has taken place. The respondent will then also have a chance to comment. This will mean that judges will be aware early in the proceedings; that domestic abuse is alleged and findings of fact can be made before contact or residence are considered.

<a name="30317w15.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action he is taking to ensure that local learning disability boards communicate their proceedings to local interested parties; and what plans he has to issue guidance to them on this matter.  [103088]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w15.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Learning disability partnership boards were set up as a key part of the arrangements for implementing the White Paper, "Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century" (Cm 5086), published in March 2001. The role and functions of these boards were described in guidance issued in August 2001 (HSC 2001/016; LAC(2001)23).
<P>

<a name="30317w15.html_para0">The role of partnership boards is broadly to create strong local partnerships between providers of services, learning disabled people and family carers. Their aim is to develop local strategies to improve the opportunities for learning disabled people to be included as fully as possible in society and have greater independence and choice in their lives.
<P>

<a name="30317w15.html_para1">We hope that partnership boards will try to raise the profile of learning disability issues in their local areas, and to encourage their members, such as local authorities and primary care trusts, to do the same. This would support strongly the aim of greater inclusion of learning disabled people. We would therefore encourage boards to let local people know about their activities.
<P>

<a name="30317w15.html_para2">It would not be appropriate to issue specific guidance on this matter, which is clearly a matter for local decision. However, the valuing people support team, which has been set up to promote good practice and share practical experience across the country, has given practical advice to boards in its newsletters of July 2002 and February 2003 on making meetings available to the public. We support these messages. The support team website is at http://www.doh.qov.uk/vpst.

<a name="30317w15.html_wqn2"><B> Tim Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what training is available to NHS staff responding to the mental health needs of <i>(a)</i> current and <i>(b)</i> former servicemen and women.  [101074]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w15.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The mental health needs of current servicemen and women are met under the auspices of the Ministry of Defence, who are also responsible for ensuring that military and medical personnel receive appropriate training. The national health service provides services, by trained staff, to former service personnel alongside the general public according to their needs. Recent additional investment in mental health services and a comprehensive programme of modernisation will ensure that all those who have mental health needs are able to access appropriate treatment more quickly. Further information about this is available on the Department of Health web site at www.doh.gov.uk/mentalhealth. Additional guidance for general practitioners first issued following the events in the USA on 11 September 2001 was re-issued last year; this specifically draws attention to the needs of service personnel.

<P>
<a name="30317w15.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many patients have been treated in <i>(a)</i> the accident and emergency unit at Northwick Park Hospital and <i>(b)</i> in total at Northwick Park Hospital, broken down by clinical speciality, in each of the last five years.  [100597]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The information requested is collected by National Health Service trust and not by individual hospital.
<P>

<a name="30317w15.html_para3">Northwick Park Hospital was part of Northwick Park and St. Marks NHS Trust until 1999, when the Trust merged with Central Middlesex Hospital NHS Trust to form North West London Hospitals NHS Trust. Figures for Northwick Park and St. Marks NHS Trust for 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 are shown in Table 1.
<P>

<a name="30317w15.html_para4">Table 2 shows figures for North West London Hospitals NHS Trust from 1999&#150;2000 to 2001&#150;02. For consistency, figures for 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 are shown for Northwick Park and St. Marks NHS Trust and Central Middlesex Hospital NHS Trust combined.

2. A FCE is defined as a period of patient care under one consultant in one health care provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as one person may have several episodes within the year.<P>

3. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS Trusts in England. The Department of Health and I beg to move, liaise closely with these organisations in order to ensure that data quality is enhanced wherever possible. Inevitably, some shortcomings remain, but our goal is to minimise inaccuracies and bring about improvement over time.<P>

 It is for local purchasers of treatment and care to decide upon the relative priorities of their allocations and assign funding accordingly. &#163;10 million was included in the overall allocation for 2002&#150;03, with the expectation that this would be used to support patient advice and liaison services (PALS) in national health service trusts and primary care trusts.

 On 25 September 2002, my right hon.

The Prison Service funding currently used to provide health care for prisoners will be transferred to the Department of Health from April 2003.

 The Government welcome British higher education's involvement in the deliberations and process arising from the Bologna Declaration.

Representatives of the UK higher educations sector are engaged in discussions on the Bologna process, and an official from my Department represents UK interests at the twice-yearly meetings of the inter-Governmental Bologna follow-up group.

 We are pursuing our plans to publish a consultation paper on Earned Autonomy. This will include proposals on the criteria for Earned Autonomy and on the kinds of flexibility that might be made available. I will write to the hon. Member when we have a firm date for its release and place a copy of the letter in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on his <i>(a)</i> current and <i>(b)</i> future policy on free school meals.  [102858]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Section 512 of the Education Act 1996 (amended by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 and the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999), sets out our current policy on free school meals. Children whose parents receive Income Support, Income Based Jobseekers Allowance and support provided under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 are currently eligible to receive free school meals.
<P>

<a name="30317w17.html_para2">From 6 April 2003, section 201 of the Education Act 2002 and its associated regulations will extend free school meals to children whose parents receive the Child Tax Credit, provided they are not entitled to receive the Working Tax Credit and have an annual income (as assessed by The Inland Revenue) that does not exceed &#163;13,230. This change will protect an estimated 87,000 children in England who would otherwise lose their entitlement because of planned changes to the tax credit and welfare system from April 2003. We estimate that an additional 75,000 children will become entitled to free school meals as a result of this change.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w17.html_spnew6"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Higher Education White Paper sets out the Government's intention to introduce variable fees in 2006&#150;07. A university will be able to set its fee at any level between &#163;0 and &#163;3,000 per year. Universities will have to have Access Agreements approved by the independent Access Regulator before they are allowed to introduce a contribution higher than the current standard fee. We have no plans to apply these proposals differentially to higher education institutions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if the funding mechanisms to deliver the proposals set out in the Future of Higher Education White Paper will encompass institutions whose students are not tied to a specific geographical location.  [100022]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w17.html_spnew7"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Graduate Contribution Scheme described in the White Paper 'The future of higher education' (Cm 5735) will apply to full-time undergraduate students only. The Open University is the main higher education institution providing distance learning for students who are geographically remote from its campus. The majority of such students are part-time and will not, therefore, be affected by the Graduate Contribution Scheme. For part-time students, the Open University will continue to set its own fee levels as now. However from 2004&#150;05 students will benefit from a new package of support for part-time students. For those on courses which are equivalent to 50 per cent. or more of a full-time course, there will be means-tested tuition fee support, applied for through LEAs. This replaces the current discretionary fee waiver scheme and doubles the number of part-time students eligible for help with their fees. Students who get fee support will also be able to apply for a &#163;250 grant from their LEA instead of a loan. And students entitled to fee support who have children will get help with their child care from the Access to Learning Fund. Also from 2004&#150;05, we are extending discretionary fee waivers and hardship support for the first time to certain students on courses which are equivalent to at least 10 per cent. of a full-time course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many children from refugee and asylum-seeking families in schools in England do not have English as a first language; if he will list the schemes to teach them English; and how much the Department has spent and will spend on such teaching in each year from 2001&#150;02 to 2005&#150;06.  [102289]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Approximately 632,000 (9.3 per cent.) of pupils in maintained schools in England are recorded as having a mother tongue other than English although it is not possible to determine how many of these have an asylum seeking or refugee background as Local Education Authorities (LEAs) are not required to provide such information.
<P>

<a name="30317w17.html_para3">Support for bilingual learners is through mainstream provision rather than separate schemes to teach English. There is no separate funding for teaching English as an additional language, but the Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant worth &#163;154 million in 2001&#150;02 and &#163;155 million in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 provides support for minority ethnic pupils at risk of underachievement and for those whose first language is not English. This includes British born children as well as those from asylum seeking and refugee families. From April 2003 the Vulnerable Children Grant worth &#163;84 million for the next three years will provide support to help schools and LEAs meet the needs of a range of vulnerable pupils including those from asylum seeking backgrounds.

 Since August 2002 the approval of external qualifications under Section 96 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 are agreed monthly. Until then approvals were published on an annual basis.

<P>
<a name="30317w18.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 We expect all higher education institutions to have a role in delivering the aims of the White Paper (Cm 5735). The Open University is particularly well placed to deliver the flexible teaching and learning which is vital to an inclusive higher education sector. Such flexible learning helps attract people with different demands and commitments. In addition, the Open University's modular approach to assessment and accreditation supports the aim of increasing credit based study.
<P>

<a name="30317w18.html_para1">From 2004&#150;05, students at the Open University will also benefit from a new package of support for new and existing part-time students. For those on courses which are equivalent to 50 per cent. or more of a full-time course, there will be means-tested tuition fee support, applied for through LEAs. This replaces the current discretionary fee waiver scheme and doubles the number of part-time students eligible for help with their fees. Students who get fee support will also be able to apply for a &#163;250 grant from their LEA instead of a loan. And students entitled to fee support who have children will get help with their child care from the Access to Learning Fund. Also from 2004&#150;05, we are extending discretionary fee waivers and hardship support for the first time to certain students on courses which are equivalent to at least 10 per cent. of a full-time course.

 Because of the bureaucratic burden it would impose both locally and centrally, we do not collect information annually on the number of schools that have received substantial repairs to buildings. As part of asset management planning, we will be asking local authorities in the spring for data from condition and suitability surveys of all their schools, which will show the needs of school buildings.

However, we are content that our targets will be met: private finance initiative investment on its own will support the renewal of 426 schools in that period. Local education authorities have received over 3 billion of formulaic funding for their investment priorities. All maintained schools in England receive their own direct capital funding: for example, over the period 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 a typical secondary school of 1,000 pupils will have received more than &#163;146,000 for its priority building needs.

<P>
<P>

 We are in regular contact and meet regularly with both the Scotland Office and the Scottish Executive. As the White Paper 'The future of higher education' (Cm 5735) states, there will be discussions with the devolved administrations about the impact on the other UK countries of the proposals for student and institutional funding for higher education institutions in England. I expect those discussions to take place over the coming months.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much funding is being provided by the Government to schools to carry out sex education programmes in 2002&#150;03.  [101966]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Funding for personal, social and health education (PSHE), which includes sex and relationship education, falls within a larger funding stream for school improvement which is distributed through the Standards Fund. The total fund for 2002&#150;03 is &#163;190 million. It is for individual schools to decide how to allocate these resources to best support their PSHE programmes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w18.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The responsibility for determining a school policy on sex and relationship education rests with governing bodies and head teachers. In July 2000 we provided sex and relationship education guidance to maintained schools which sets out the requirement for 



<P>
<P><I>17 Mar 2003 : Column 570W</I><P>
schools to develop their policies in consultation with parents and to make them available for inspection. That guidance was developed in consultation with a wide range of bodies such as the Sex Education Forum, the National Health Education Group and the Teenage Pregnancy Unit.
<P>

<a name="30317w18.html_para2">The Department has not consulted on the policies of sexual education taught in independent schools. Independent schools are free to determine their own education programmes. However, they do have to meet minimum standards in relation to the quality of education provided. We would encourage them to have regard to the sex and relationship education guidance for maintained schools, but there is no requirement for them to do so.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills who is responsible for setting policy on sexual education curriculum and standards in schools <i>(a)</i> in England and <i>(b)</i> in each region.  [101968]<P>

<P>
<a name="30317w18.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The responsibility for determining a school policy on sex and relationship education rests with governing bodies and head teachers. This applies to maintained schools throughout England.
<P>

<a name="30317w18.html_para3">In July 2000 we provided sex and relationship education guidance to maintained schools which sets out the requirement for schools to develop their policies in consultation with parents and to make them available for inspection. Students are monitored through inspection undertaken by OFSTED.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what studies he has commissioned into the effect on <i>(a)</i> rates of teenage pregnancy, <i>(b)</i> abortion rates and <i>(c)</i> the rate of sexually transmitted diseases, with particular reference to HIV, of abstinence-only forms of sexual education.  [101970]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w18.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Skills has not commissioned any studies into the effect of abstinence only education on the rates on teenage pregnancy, abortion or the rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
<P>

<a name="30317w18.html_para4">The Department of Health has commissioned the Health Development Agency to review the evidence of effectiveness of interventions to reduce transmission of STIs and HIV. This concluded that there is no strong evidence for the effectiveness of abstinence only education approaches. The findings will be published later this year.

<a name="30317w19.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Higher Education Funding Council for England published "Outcomes of 2002 financial forecasts and annual operating statements" in January 2003. This report is based on information provided by higher education institutions in July 2002. The forecasts were based on assumptions reflecting the prevailing general economic climate and the funding announcements made at the time and so do not take account of the Spending Review settlement for 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="30317w19.html_para1">The table is at Annex D of that report and shows the balance sheet for universities in England based on actual figures as at 31 July 2001 and forecasts to July 2006. Debt is some &#163;4.5 billion as at end July 2001, significantly below the total funds for the sector of &#163;11.69 billion overall. (Debt is quantified by adding 4d and 7d from the following table.)

 Crime statistics for South Tyneside are recorded at Basic Command Unit level (BCU). At BCU level, data has been collected from police forces since 1 April 1999, therefore figures are available only for the last three financial years. Detection rates and numbers of offences per 1,000 households for domestic burglary are given in the table.

 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) are required to conduct an audit of crime and disorder in their area and every three years, publish a strategy to tackle problems in their area. The CDRP is required to implement the strategy and keep it under review to monitor its effectiveness and make any necessary changes. Recorded crime figures at CDRP level are published in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin.
<P>

<a name="30317w20.html_para1">Measures in the Police Reform Act 2002 maintain the requirement for CDRPs to monitor their own progress and introduce new reporting mechanisms for CDRPs to advise progress on the implementation of their strategy to the Secretary of State. The new reporting process will be introduced during 2003&#150;04 and will look for CDRPs to monitor progress on reducing crime and disorder and the misuse of drugs and on the effectiveness of local partnership working arrangements.

 The percentage changes for total recorded crime between the 12 months to March 1997 and the 12 months to March 2002, by police force area in England, are given in the table.
<P>

<a name="30317w20.html_para2">There was a change in counting rules for recorded crime on 1 April 1998 which increased the total number of crimes recorded in England and Wales as a whole by 14 per cent., although this varied for individual police forces and offence types. Comparisons between the old counting rules and the new rules for the year ending March 1999, as well as the effects of the boundary change involving the Metropolitan Police on 1 April 2000, are included in the table. The percentage change in the number of recorded crimes given in the table is calculated so that the effects of these changes are excluded.
<P>

<a name="30317w20.html_para3">As a result of several forces adopting the principles of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in advance of its official introduction across England and Wales on 1 April 2002, numbers of offences recorded for 2001&#150;02 may have been inflated for those forces, and in total. Unlike the changes described above, this effect has not been factored out of the calculation of the percentage change in recorded crime given in the table.

The Prison Service model for delivering druges services is CARATs (Counselling, Assessment, Referral, Advice and Throughcare services).

<P>
<a name="30317w22.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 All prisons are linked to the Inmate Information system (IIS). All historical information is retained on IIS and is accessible from all prisons. There is currently no automatic method of linking prisoners' records, but this will be a component of a replacement system that is now being considered.
<P>

<a name="30317w22.html_para8">Currently, manual linking of previous custody information is required as there is no reliable unique identifier (a new prison number is allocated at the beginning of each period of custody) and the National Insurance number is not always available. Inevitably, this means that details of previous custody may not always be available. This limitation in the current IIS system will be addressed in the replacement system now being considered.

There was also a change in counting rules for detections on 1 April 1999.

 A performance bonus can be paid to Premier Prison Services Ltd if the contractor reduces recidivism in respect of the proportion of prisoners at the therapeutic community at Dovegate prison who have undertaken at least 15 months therapy in the community. They must also not have committed an offence within 12 months of release from custody; There has been insufficient time for a bonus to become payable because the therapeutic community only opened in November 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the average cost per year of a prisoner held in <i>(a)</i> PFI funded and <i>(b)</i> non PFI funded prisons in each of the last three years; and if he will make a statement.  [101764]<P>

<P>
<a name="30317w23.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The average cost per prisoner held in Private Finance Initiative (PFI) funded and non PFI funded prisons in each of the last three years is shown, in the table.
<P>

<a name="30317w23.html_para0">These figures are establishment costs only and exclude any share of Headquarters overheads. Establishment cost per prisoner figures cannot therefore be compared with the overall Prison Service cost per prisoner figure, which includes all expenditure.
<P>

<a name="30317w23.html_para1">The figures for 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 are expressed in cash terms, with those for 2001&#150;02 expressed in resource terms.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to the Answer of 24 February 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 2, on police pensions, what he estimates the cost to public funds would be of establishing a pay-as-you-go police pension scheme applying to new recruits only.  [101926]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 I understand that my hon. Friend means what we estimate the cost would be of establishing a funded pension scheme applying to new recruits only. As stated in the National Policing Plan we are considering options for modernising police pensions to make them more flexible and affordable for future entrants. As part of this reform, we will also seek to meet the needs of police authorities and chief officers for a scheme which brings greater certainty about the financial impact on individual police forces. Unlike in a pay-as-you go scheme, the employer pays contributions into a pension fund at the same time as the employee. The eventual pension is then paid out of the fund. In a pay-as-you go scheme the employer's costs are deferred until the pension comes into payment. The rate of employer's contributions in a funded police pension scheme for new entrants would depend mainly on the value of the pensions and other benefits provided, and the share borne by the officers. The immediate effect of introducing a funded scheme for new entrants, while keeping the existing scheme on a pay-as-you go basis, would be to increase costs. This is because the cost of paying employer contributions in respect of contributing members of a new funded scheme would be added to the continuing cost of paying the pension benefits of retired members of the current pay-as-you go scheme.

New standards for eyesight have been agreed by the Police Advisory Board for England and Wales. The new standards which take account of our intention to extend the employment provisions of the Disability and Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) to the police service will be put in place on 1 April 2003.
<P>
<BR>
Research has been undertaken to develop new job-related medical standards. A draft report by QinetiQ will be subject to consultation with the police service between April and June. The views of UK Diabetes and other interested groups will inform the consultation. We aim to put new standards to the Police Advisory Board in late summer.
<P>
<BR>
A national application procedure has been developed with the police service. This includes a national application form and recruitment material designed to attract hard to reach groups. A police recruitment website has been developed to support the new procedures. The website will provide applicants with all the information they need about joining the police service and will enable them to apply on line.
<P>
<BR>
A national procedure for assessing and selecting new recruits has been piloted in five forces and trialled by three forces. These procedures will be introduced in all forces over the next year.

<a name="30317w24.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 A survey of mental ill health in the prison population of England and Wales, undertaken in 1997 by the Office for National Statistics, showed that some 10 per cent. of remanded men, 7 per cent. of sentenced men and 14 per cent. of all women prisoners had suffered from a functional psychosis in the past year. Some 59 per cent. of remanded men, 76 per cent. remanded women, 40 per cent. of sentenced men and 63 per cent. of sentenced women had a neurotic disorder in the week prior to being interviewed for the survey. These rates are considered to be still representative of the prison population. Applying them to the current population would indicate that, on any one day, there would be over 5,500 prisoners in England and Wales who would have suffered from symptoms of a functional psychosis in the previous 12 months and over 32,000 who would have suffered symptoms of a neurotic disorder in the previous week. Some prisoners will fall into both categories. All Prison Service establishments and their NHS partners are working to implement the improvements to mental health services set out in 'Changing the Outlook, a Strategy for Developing and Modernising Mental Health Services in Prisons' published in December 2001. Prisoners who need in-patient treatment for mental disorder may be transferred to psychiatric hospitals. The care and treatment of mentally disordered prisoners who do not need to be admitted to hospital is generally undertaken by prison healthcare staff under the supervision of NHS specialists and increasingly, in establishments with the

greatest mental health need, by NHS-funded multi-disciplinary in-reach teams. The commitments made in the NHS Plan (2000), for an additional 300 staff to be employed by 2004 to provide such in-reach services to prisoners, are being implemented. Mental illness in the prison population of Scotland is a matter for the Scottish Executive. While the institutions in Northern Ireland are dissolved, responsibility for this subject rests with Ministers in the Northern Ireland Office.

In addition, independent evaluation of the YIP programme showed that between January and March 2002 around 70 per cent. of YIP areas showed reductions in overall crime, with reductions up to 40 per cent. We consider these to be more reliable measures of success than attempting to assess the extent to which the programme has reduced the risk that individual participants will subsequently offend.

We have also made it clear that in the forthcoming age legislation compulsory retirement ages are likely to be unlawful, unless employers can show they are objectively justified.

Evaluation shows that from 1999 to 2001 the number of companies using age in recruitment had already fallen from 27 per cent. to 13 per cent. and the number of companies having a policy against employing older workers had dropped from 14 per cent to 7 per cent.

This increase has been faster than the increase in the overall employment rate. Under New Deal 50 plus 92,000 people aged over 50 have moved off benefits and gone back to work from April 2000 to December 2002, claiming the programme's cash employment credit. We will build on this support to further increase the employment rate of older workers who have a wealth of skills and experience that can benefit individual businesses and the economy as a whole.

Opra have stressed that this is a temporary measure until amendments to the Transfer Value regulations come into force. Views are currently being sought on the amendments. The consultation period ends on 28 March and we will seek to bring these changes into force as soon as possible once responses have been considered and any necessary redrafting in the light of them completed.

This contains provisional rates of the customer's individual pension components based on the National Insurance contribution information available at that time. The annual process required to collect National Insurance contributions and post them to the National Insurance Recording System means that in a number of cases details covering the final income tax year are not available when the provisional rates are issued. Where an Occupational Pension is involved, details are required from the employer or pension provider before the Additional Pension component can be calculated.

Where appropriate, it informs the customer of occasions where Home Responsibilities Protection has been applied. Further, in divorced and widowed cases, the forecast shows where a spouse's contributions have been used to calculate an individual's likely state pension. All the information used is exact information on state pension at "today's" rates based on current national insurance record(s) at the time the forecast is provided.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what steps he has taken since the publication of "Update 1&#151;Calculation and payment of cash equivalent transfer values" by the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority to <i>(a)</i> ensure that pension scheme members' rights under the (i) Pension Schemes Act 1993 and (ii) Pensions Act 1995 are protected, <i>(b)</i> monitor the numbers and circumstances of scheme members whose position may be adversely affected by the OPRA guidance and <i>(c)</i> ensure that the consultation being carried out in respect of the draft Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Values) (Amendment) Regulations 2003 is not prejudiced by OPRA's interim guidance pending the proposed introduction of the regulations; and if he will make a statement.  [102472]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w27.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The aim of both update 1 and the amendments to the regulations is to maintain fairness between those who transfer out of schemes and those who remain. Reports in the press imply that the measures would lock individuals into their pension schemes. That is not true.
<P>

<a name="30317w27.html_para0">The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA) will not be preventing members from transferring out of pension schemes, nor are they endorsing such an approach. OPRA have made it clear that it is up to trustees to decide whether to delay quotes of transfer values. In doing so trustees will want to take into account the funding position of the scheme and the effect of transfers on members who remain in the scheme. The measures are short term and will only apply until the amended regulations come into force.
<P>

<a name="30317w27.html_para1">There is no central record of members who apply for a transfer value and it is therefore not possible to monitor those who may be affected by OPRA's guidance. It is important that the calculation of transfer values is fair to all, to those who leave and those who stay. If a scheme is underfunded and an unreduced transfer value is taken, it affects all members who remain in the scheme. On the whole, it is likely that more members will benefit from OPRA's measures than be adversely affected.
<P>

<a name="30317w27.html_para2">The timing and process of the consultation on the regulations is not affected by OPRA's interim guidance; how respondents reply to the consultation is of course a matter for them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30317w28.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The cost to local authorities of collecting the council tax in England is estimated to be &#163;319 million for the year 2002&#150;03. The main cost to central Government is incurred by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) which administers the council tax valuation list and is a party to appeals. The VOA budget for council tax work in 2002&#150;03 is about &#163;14 million. Central Government also supports the costs of the independent Valuation Tribunals which hear appeals. The part of the Valuation Tribunals budget for 2002&#150;03 relating to council tax work is approximately &#163;0.7 million. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is responsible for the policy and legislation rather than the administration of council tax.

Figures are not readily available by class of authority, or for England before 1997&#150;98.

1,027 regeneration schemes were successful under the six rounds of the Single Regeneration Budget. Over &#163;5.7 billion of SRB funding was allocated over their lifetime of up to seven years. The names of the schemes with lifetime funding, by each round have been tabled in the House of Commons Library.<P>

<i>Local strategic partnerships (LSPs)</i><P>

The 2002 survey of all English principle local authority areas found that as of summer 2002 there were:<P>

294 LSPs in operation<P>

35 partnerships functioning as LSPs (though not formally an LSP)<P>

39 LSPs in the process of being formed<P>

1 local authority area with no plans to form an LSP<P>





<P>

All LSPs operate on a voluntary basis and are not formally accountable public bodies. Hence, for the most part they cannot receive direct government funding. For instance, the neighbourhood renewal fund is allocated to the local authority but they must collaborate with the LSP to agree how it is spent.<P>

 The Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) is the only funded local authority pension scheme in England and Wales.

The most recent triennial valuation exercise was concluded in 2001. Then, total assets were valued at &#163;85.3 billion with liabilities amounting to &#163;91.5 billion. All the LGPS funds met the specific requirements of the Scheme's regulations concerning solvency, in particular, the need to maintain as constant a rate of employers' contributions as possible.
