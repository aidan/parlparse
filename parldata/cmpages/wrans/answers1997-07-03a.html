<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Martyn Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales when he expects his review of economic regeneration in Wales to be completed; and if, and in what form, he intends to publish the results. [5161]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend and I intend to publish our proposals for an economic powerhouse for Wales in the White Paper which will issue before the summer recess and certainly well before the referendum. I will also be setting out my strategy for the Welsh economy in the coming months on which I will be consulting widely.

<a name="70703w01.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>Welsh Assembly</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if there will be a requirement in job advertisements for the Welsh Assembly that fluency in Welsh would be essential or desirable. [5299]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 That will be a matter for the Assembly to decide.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Barry Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will make a statement on the date of the Welsh Assembly referendum. [6103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Davies: </B> 
 The Welsh referendum will follow shortly after the Scottish. Announcements will be made in due course about the precise dates of each referendum.

<a name="70703w01.html_sbhd2"><H4><center>School Polling Stations</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Denzil Davies: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what plans he has to avoid the need to close schools for use as polling stations in the forthcoming referendum on devolution. [6073]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 The organisation of the poll in each local authority area is a matter for the relevant returning officer. Polling places to be used in the referendum are to be the same as those used in council elections, but the returning officer has discretion, if he considers special circumstances exist, to designate some other place for taking the poll. In areas where schools are used for polling, it is therefore open to returning officers, if they consider special circumstances to exist, to designate other places as polling places for the referendum.

<a name="70703w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Transport Policy</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Barry Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what plans he has to integrate transport in Wales; and if he will make a statement. [6099]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 I welcome my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister's announcement on 5 June honouring our election manifesto commitment to 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jul 1997 : Column: 218</I><P>
developing an integrated transport policy. This will, of course, embrace Wales and Welsh Office Ministers and officials will participate fully in drawing-up proposals for implementing the new policy, taking into account the views of a wide range of interested organisations.
<P>

<a name="70703w01.html_para0">We will, in any case, be looking closely at all transport issues in Wales during the course of the next few months, including priorities for the roads programme as part of the strategic review promised in the Welsh election manifesto. I intend to set the strategic review of the roads programme in the broader context of the development of a balanced, integrated transport policy for the Principality. The review will, therefore, consider not only the relative priority of particular routes and schemes within the programme, and the scope for altering those priorities, but wider issues including the need to manage the network more effectively and the scope to promote alternative transport modes where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="70703w01.html_para1">The review will consider afresh all schemes currently in the Welsh roads programme with the exception of the A55 dualling across Anglesey. In that case, I have decided that the strategic importance of the improvement is so great that it must proceed without delay subject, of course, to the successful completion of the legal and statutory procedures.
<P>

<a name="70703w01.html_para2">I will be initiating a process of wide public consultation on the review, and will publish a consultation document shortly. This consultation document will set out the present position, summarise the issues for consideration and suggest possible options for change, and will invite views from the widest possible range of organisations. I hope to announce the conclusions of the review next spring.

<a name="70703w01.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Referendum</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Opik: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if postal votes will be available in the proposed referendum on devolution in Wales; and if he will make a statement. [6347]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 Postal votes will be available in the usual way for those voters who need them for the referendum.

<a name="70703w01.html_sbhd5"><H4><center>Public Bodies</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Opik: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what has been his Department's expenditure in each of the last five years on the boards of non-departmental public bodies; and if he will make a statement. [6323]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 Details of expenditure are published annually in the Cabinet Office publication, "Public Bodies", copies of which are available in the Library of the House.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Opik: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will list the non-departmental bodies which will be abolished in the event of a Welsh Assembly; what will be the savings to public funds of this process; and if he will make a statement. [6325]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Davies: </B> 
 Details of our proposals will be included in the White Paper on a Welsh Assembly which we shall be publishing shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will list by name and rank the Indonesian military, police, security and paramilitary police officers in respect of whom visa applications have been made to attend the International Police and Security Expo 97; and if he will identify those which were granted.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Fatchett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 June 1997]:</i> The British Embassy in Jakarta issued 29,931 visit visas for the United Kingdom last year. Statistics are not kept for the different categories of applicant and the information requested could therefore only be produced at disproportionate cost. All visa applications are processed in accordance with the criteria contained in the Immigration Rules.

 Negotiations on the level of assessed contributions to be paid by Member States to UN budgets for 1998 and beyond will resume at the UN General Assembly in October. It is therefore too early to predict what change, if any, there might be in the level of the United Kingdom's assessed contribution.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the relationship between United Kingdom membership of <i>(a)</i> the WEU and <i>(b)</i> NATO in respect of United Kingdom security policy. [5723]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 NATO is the foundation of our defence and security. The Western European Union (WEU) is developing its capacity to contribute to European security and plays a key role in building the European Security and Defence Identity (ESDI) within the Alliance. It is pursuing its operational development as a means for Europeans to run crisis management operations, including operations using NATO assets and capabilities. The requirement that full members of the WEU are also NATO members, and the role of WEU in the arrangements for ESDI in the Alliance, mean that action taken by the WEU must be consistent with obligations in NATO.

<a name="70703w02.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 The Government is committed to making government work better. My Department's White Paper on 'New Government', to be published later this year, will set out a unified programme for the renewal of government. Better regulation is an integral part of this renewal. Our aim is to ensure that regulations are simple, helpful and fair for business and the citizen.
<P>

<a name="70703w02.html_para1">It is essential that we involve those who are affected by regulation. We are committed to giving small business and ordinary citizens a greater voice on the Better Regulation Task Force. I have today appointed Christopher Haskins, Chairman of Northern Foods plc, to chair the Task Force. Their terms of reference are to advise the Government on action which improves the effectiveness and credibility of government regulation by ensuring that it is necessary, fair and affordable, and simple to understand and administer, taking account of the needs of small business and ordinary people.

<P>

<a name="70703w02.html_para2">We will find practical measures that will respond to people's needs. For example, I have set up a cross-departmental initiative called 'Access Business' to assist small business. This will draw together regulatory advice and forms into a simpler, more unified service, in particular using modern technology. For the citizen we will look at key groups like the elderly, the young and the voluntary sector and identify how we can make improvements.
<P>

<a name="70703w02.html_para3">I will take the opportunity presented by the EU Presidency next year to promote better quality regulation at the European level. I am planning a centrepiece Better Regulation Presidency event in March looking at improving access to Government for citizens and business, keeping legislation simple and improving consultation. And we are working with the Austrian government to provide a sustained push to improve the quality of EU legislation throughout our consecutive Presidencies.

 The Commission maintains and enforces a code of advertising standards and practice for broadcasters, which includes detailed guidance on advertising and children, and which is from time to time reviewed to ensure it reflects current best practice. I understand that the Commission has no plans to revise the code in light of the judgment referred to, though it would naturally consider carefully any complaints made to it concerning particular advertisements and their potential impact on children. The Government recognise their special responsibility to protect children from exploitation, but the existing Code allows the ITC scope to act in their defence.

 No such assessment has been made by the Department of Health. The Health and Safety Executive estimate that the total cost to the economy of <i>work- related</i> ill health was between &#163;2 billion and &#163;2.5 billion in 1990. The next updating of these costs by the Health and Safety Executive will be in 1998. The updating will cover costs for 1995-96, using the necessary data from the Labour Force Survey.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make representations to the Independent Television Commission urging it to give prominence to public health considerations in its code of programme sponsorship. [5853]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w04.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Independent Television Commission's code of programme sponsorship already takes account of health considerations and the Commission keep the code under regular review. For instance, companies are prohibited from sponsorship if their name is known to the public chiefly through their tobacco business, even if they also market other non-tobacco goods and services. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for National Heritage, whose Department has policy responsibility for broadcasting, has noted the hon. Member's suggestion on public health considerations for programme sponsorship.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w04.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 We understand that the workshop on sexuality was a project submitted in 1993 to the European Commission by a Spanish non-governmental organisation, and that it received funding in 1994 of 61,301 ECU (&#163;43,830 at current exchange rates). From the information available, the purpose of the project was to train instructors in providing sex education for 13 to 21 years olds with the aim of preventing HIV/AIDS and of enabling young people to discover values to assist them in their personal sexual development. The materials used included three videos about love and sexuality and a guidebook for trainers. We are informed that 56 people were trained under the project in Spain, and 10 in the United Kingdom.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his answer of 10 June, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>427-28,</i> if he will make a statement about the PFI in the NHS. [7128]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 In my answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggant) I announced my intention to review the 43 major acute sector Private Finance Initiative (PFI) schemes in the National Health Service. I have today arranged for copies of the full results of the review to be placed in the Library. I have also written to all Members and stakeholders in health PFI, enclosing copies of the results. Fourteen major acute schemes have been selected, representing almost &#163;1.3 billion of new capital investment in NHS hospitals.
<P>

<a name="70703w04.html_para2">The review was undertaken by officials and all schemes were graded according to three criteria: (i) their service need; (ii) status--how far and well negotiations have progressed and (iii) "PFI ability"--how well the scheme fits with the PFI process and hence its likelihood of delivering a successful outcome.
<P>

<a name="70703w04.html_para3">This process was both fair and open. Officials from the Department shared with the trusts the criteria against which the projects were judged and their relative markings. I, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health as far as the schemes in the Northern and Yorkshire region are concerned, examined the gradings and the reasons why officials recommended schemes either be included or excluded. We also received representations from many Members.
<P>

<a name="70703w04.html_para4">The 14 schemes which most successfully met the three criteria will be asked to continue with their PFI proposal, with the objective of reaching an early and acceptable financial close over the next 18 months. A complete table listing all the scores, along with a note explaining the criteria, has been placed in the Library. We have instructed officials to prepare programmes and milestones for every successful scheme. The schemes will be subject to the normal rigorous approval processes and any of these 14 schemes that subsequently fail to deliver to time or price will be cancelled.
<P>

<a name="70703w04.html_para5">Those schemes not selected will be asked to cease any further action on their contract. They should stand down their partners if they have selected one and cancel all tendering procedures.
<P>

<a name="70703w04.html_para6">Any trust or consortium whose scheme has to met the three criteria and which wishes to make representations to the Secretary of State should do so within the next 10 days. Otherwise such trusts should now take steps to stand down their partners or cancel the tendering procedure.
<P>

<a name="70703w04.html_para7">Those schemes not selected will be eligible for consideration as part of a national capital prioritisation exercise by the NHS Executive's Capital Prioritisation

Advisory Group. This group will review major acute schemes for health service need and will recommend those which should go forward either as part of the next tranche of PFI schemes which we plan to announce in spring 1998, or for funding from the public sector capital that is available.
<P>

<a name="70703w04.html_para8">The exercise did not consider the schemes affected by the London review which is due to report in the Autumn. These schemes are also listed in papers deposited in the Library.

<P>
<a name="70703w05.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Corbett: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the outcome of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Sustainable Development. [6460]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w05.html_spmin6"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Special Session reviewed the progress made on sustainable development since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. One of the most important problems discussed was the need to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and thus limit the problems caused by climate change. In my address to the General Assembly, I urged other developed countries to recognise their responsibilities in this area, by pointing to the example that the United Kingdom and other European Union countries have already set. Later in the week, President Clinton acknowledged the role of the European Union in focusing the debate on this issue, and gave his personal commitment of significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I expect this to be translated into action at Kyoto. Unfortunately, the agreement at Special Session on climate change did not have the specific commitment to reductions that we had sought. Much hard negotiating work remains to be done, but the UK will continue to make every effort to get developed countries to agree legally binding targets for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions at Kyoto in December.
<P>

<a name="70703w05.html_para0">I also emphasised the UK Government's commitment to reversing the decline in Britain's development assistance and improving its quality by refocusing our efforts in eradicating poverty. Although some other developed countries could not go as far as the UK, the meeting stressed the need to increase aid towards the UN target of 0.7 per cent. and pledged to negotiate a satisfactory replenishment of the Global Environment Facility. We cannot expect the poorest countries to take action themselves, if the developed world is not more constructive about its aid programmes.
<P>

<a name="70703w05.html_para1">The continuing threat to the world's forests was a key issue for the Special Session. Although the European Union pressed hard for a Convention on forests, we were unable to secure agreement from other major countries. 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jul 1997 : Column: 234</I><P>
Nonetheless the establishment of an Intergovernmental Forum on Forests is a good step forward. The Forum will report in 1999 on the possible elements of a Forest Convention, and will also consider finance and trade issues. In addition it will monitor implementation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests 1997 report, which contained over a hundred action points. As the United Kingdom's contribution to this effort, I announced that the United Kingdom intended to adopt a new Forest Standard to provide a benchmark for the regeneration of our forests. I also promised an increase in our development assistance for forestry management.
<P>

<a name="70703w05.html_para2">Together with our partners from the European Union, we have secured agreement for a plan of action to provide universal access to clean water and sanitation. One fifth of the world has no access to clean water and one half has no proper sanitation, so a new initiative is urgently needed. A series of meetings will take place to prepare for the 1998 meeting of the Commission on Sustainable Development when there will be negotiations on the plan. A successful outcome of these negotiations will be a key objective for our presidency.
<P>

<a name="70703w05.html_para3">The European Union pressed for international action on sustainable energy management, and was successful in securing commitment to preparatory discussions in advance of the debate on energy in the 2001 session of the Commission on Sustainable Development. There was also agreement on the importance of energy management for both developed and developing countries, and on the need for energy prices to reflect their true environmental costs, as well as a gradual elimination of subsidies that inhibit sustainable development. The Special Session confirmed the importance of promoting integrated transport policies, since transport is the largest end user of energy in developed countries and the fastest growing one in most developing countries.
<P>

<a name="70703w05.html_para4">Under strong pressure from the European Union the Special Session agreed that the possibility of an aviation fuel tax should remain on the international agenda. Studies will continue in international fora, especially the International Civil Aviation Organisation, on the use of economic instruments for the mitigation of the negative impacts of aviation.
<P>

<a name="70703w05.html_para5">Lastly, the European Union ensured that there would be further work at a global level to address the problems facing the world's oceans, especially the depletion of fish stocks.
<P>

<a name="70703w05.html_para6">There were also discussions on the financial implications of the Convention on Desertification. We supported the conclusion that the Convention should help channel existing resources more effectively, but should not create a new and dedicated fund.
<P>

<a name="70703w05.html_para7">In conclusion a number of modest but positive steps were made at the Special Session. Nevertheless much remains to be done, and the UK will continue to use its best endeavours to pursue these issues in the months to come.

 The Government are committed to improving the position of victims and those who give evidence to the police and in court. Our election manifesto said: "Victims of crime are too often neglected by the criminal justice system".




<P>
<P><I>3 Jul 1997 : Column: 236</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70703w06.html_para2">Therefore, I am pleased to announce today the following measures which will give victims a greater priority within the criminal justice system:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
an extra &#163;1 million to Victim Support to provide further court-based and local scheme support for victims of crime and for witnesses, and to provide a national telephone helpline for victims:

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70703w06.html_para3">
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
an inter-departmental review to look at further ways of assisting vulnerable witnesses--such as victims of rape or of domestic violence--and providing witnesses with greater protection from intimidation;
<BR>
an examination of measures to ensure that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is more responsive to the needs of victims as part of the independent review of the CPS under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Glidewell.
<i>Victim Support</i>
Victim Support receives the Government's full support for the dedicated work it does helping victims of crime. Its 365 local schemes and branches support more than a million victims a year, and there is now a witness support service at all the 77 Crown court centres in England and Wales. Despite this, the previous Government froze the &#163;11.7 million grant to Victim Support and made it clear that no more money would be forthcoming. However, support for victims of crime is a top priority for this Government. I have therefore decided to make an additional &#163;1 million available to Victim Support to re-inforce both its court-based and local scheme support for victims and witnesses. It will also establish a new national telephone helpline to provide an easy source of help and information to victims of crime.
<i>Vulnerable witnesses and witness protection</i>
Many victims and witnesses find the criminal justice process daunting and stressful, particularly those who are vulnerable because of personal circumstances or the nature of certain serious crimes, such as rape. Some witnesses are not always regarded as capable of giving evidence while others are in fear of intimidation. Our manifesto stated that "greater protection will be provided for victims in rape and serious sexual offence trials and for those subject to intimidation, including witnesses". The Government have therefore established an inter- departmental group to undertake a wide-ranging review. It will have the following terms of reference:
<BR>
to identify measures at all stages of the criminal justice process to improve the treatment of vulnerable witnesses, including those subject to intimidation;
<BR>
to encourage such witnesses to give evidence of crime and enable them to give best evidence in court;

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70703w06.html_para4">
<P>
<BR>

to consider which witnesses should be classified as vulnerable;
<BR>
to identify effective procedures for applying appropriate measures in individual cases; and
<BR>

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70703w06.html_para5">The group will have regard to the interests of justice, the importance of preventing and detecting crime, the needs of witnesses and cost effectiveness; and take into account the National Standards for Witness Care in England and Wales.
<i>Crown Prosecution Service</i>
Our manifesto also said:

"We will ensure that victims are kept fully informed of the progress of their case, and why charges may have been downgraded or dropped".

My right hon. Friend the Attorney-General has already announced the creation of local Chief Crown Prosecutors for each police force area as part of his reforms to the CPS. The Government believe this will ensure that prosecutors are more sensitive to the needs of victims, particularly on decisions to discontinue or downgrade cases. My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General has also established an independent review under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Glidewell which will examine how the CPS can be made more aware of the needs of victims and witnesses.

<P>
<a name="70703w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Sex Offenders Act 1997 requires people convicted of serious sexual offences to register their address and any change of address with the police and we are working on plans to ensure that this information is used effectively, principally for the protection of children and vulnerable adults. In addition, part V of the Police Act 1997 provides a statutory basis for criminal record checks to be carried out on any person applying for a position, paid or as a volunteer, which will involve regular contact with children and young people under the age of 18. We are currently considering how best to implement the provisions of this part of the Act. In addition, a consultation paper was issued in January 1997 setting out options for making it an offence for a convicted sex offender to seek work with or offer services to children. The responses are currently being analysed. It is intended that new vetting arrangements should complement good practice in respect of the recruitment, supervision and management of volunteers set out in the Home Office guidance "Safe from Harm".

<a name="70703w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Government are committed to ensuring, as a priority, that courts have appropriate powers to deal with the small group of persistent young offenders who wreak havoc in their communities. Our aim is to provide the courts with a more coherent and flexible set of powers to deal with persistent juvenile offenders than those left by the previous Government.
<P>

<a name="70703w06.html_para6">In the meantime, the Government have inherited a contract signed by the previous Government in March 1997 for a secure training centre at Cookham Wood, Kent, for persistent offenders aged 12 to 14. The contract involves significant monthly payments to the contractor from April 1998 whether the facility is used or not.
<P>

<a name="70703w06.html_para7">To avoid the waste of public money which would be involved in withdrawing form the previous Government's commitment, and to enable the courts to deal with those persistent young offenders who fail to respond to community sentences, I intend to continue with the contract to develop Cookham Wood. This will involve introducing the secure training order provided in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 and taking forward plans to procure four other centres to provide facilities across England and Wales. However, I am determined to ensure that Cookham Wood provides a high standard of education and training and that it helps young offenders to face up to their crimes and address their offending behaviour.
<P>

<a name="70703w06.html_para8">I am commissioning a review of the whole range of secure accommodation for young offenders, and I will be receiving advice on this issue, and on the nature of the custodial penalties available to the courts, from the new Youth Justice task Force. I shall ensure that plans for the four other secure facilities, and the use of Cookham Wood, are sufficiently flexible to be consistent with the outcome of this review.
<P>

<a name="70703w06.html_para9">The Government remain committed to ending prison remands for 15 and 16-year-old boys as quickly as possible and hope that their review of secure accommodation will help in this regard. The original commitment was made in February 1991. Although a building programme of 170 new secure local authority places is nearing completion, the number of 15 and 16-year-old boys held in prison has increased substantially since 1991. This makes implementation of the provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 for court-ordered secure remands, which would end the need for prison remands for juveniles, much more difficult.

 European Structural Funds, including the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), make an important contribution to economic development in the regions. The issues behind matched funding requirements for ERDF and the need for synergy between European and domestic regeneration programmes are being considered in the comprehensive review of regeneration expenditure in England now underway. However, as a net contributor to the EU budget, the UK also has an interest in ensuring that the best value for money is obtained from Structural Funds' expenditure. Requiring applicants to provide some level of matching funding gives them a strong incentive to produce projects which do represent good value for money and to make a real choice between competing priorities.

 My Department has not commissioned any research on these subjects. However, both the recovery of solvent waste to make fuel and the burning of secondary liquid fuels (SLF) are regulated by the Environment Agency under the Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) regime. Each application for authorisation to burn SLF requires assessment of the likely environmental impacts. Details of these assessments must be placed in public registers in the relevant locality.
<P>

<a name="70703w07.html_para0">In addition, on 14 June, the Agency published the results of an extensive air monitoring study in the Clitheroe area of Lancashire.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 July 1997]:</i> Part M of schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 1991, which is applicable to most new building work other than dwellings, requires that reasonable provision shall be made for access and facilities for disabled people. Building work to which the regulations apply will be subject to building control by either the local authority or an approved inspector. With regard to these approving bodies, the Building Act 1984 provides for action to be taken against an approved inspector who recklessly gives a final certificate. Section 113 of the Act allows proceedings in respect of an offence under the Act to be taken by a party aggrieved. Whilst there is no parallel provision to challenge local authorities within the Building Act, they are subject to action for judicial review.

<P>
<a name="70703w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 July 1997]:</i> Part M of the Building Regulations applies only to the control of new building work. The DDA places duties on employers and service providers to make adjustments to existing premises which are reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. There is no requirement for such adjustments to comply with Part M.
<P>

<a name="70703w08.html_para1">Under the Disability Discrimination (Employment) Regulations 1996 employers cannot be required to alter any physical characteristic which satisfied the requirements of Part M of the Building Regulations at the time building works were carried out, and which continues to meet those requirements. This protects employers against being required to meet differing requirements in respect of the same physical feature under different regulations. Similar protection for service providers will be considered when regulations for implementing that part of the Act are prepared.

<a name="70703w08.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the planning appeal decisions by his Department in the last three years where his inspectors have upheld a planning authority's decision to refuse permission for drive-through, fast food restaurants; and what planning reasons were upheld in each case. [6052]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The provision of information on planning appeals is the responsibility of the Planning Inspectorate. I have asked the Inspectorate's Chief Executive, Mr. Chris Shepley, to write to the hon. Member.
<i>Letter from C. J. Shepley to Mr. Paul Burstow, dated 3 July 1997:</i>

The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your Question about appeal decisions for drive-through, fast-food restaurants.
<BR>
I enclose details of 9 planning appeals for such developments which have been dismissed, i.e. the decision of the local authority upheld (except in one case which the local authority failed to determine), since 1 April 1994. I believe this list to be exhaustive but I cannot be certain, especially when such uses may have been combined with others. The details include the issues considered to be relevant to the inspector's decision.

I am arranging for copies of the inspector's decision letters to be sent to you. From these you will be able to see whether the inspector agreed or disagreed with any reasons for refusal by the local authority.

<a name="70703w08.html_para4">My Department recently published information showing that the major man-made sources of sulphur hexafluoride in the United Kingdom contribute just 0.1 per cent. to the current global warming from all national greenhouse gas emissions. Any additional contribution due to emissions of sulphur hexafluoride from the disposal of training shoes is likely to be very small, but this source will be evaluated in more detail in the near future.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what evaluation has been undertaken by his Department of the effects of HFC coolants in pressurised drink containers. [6343]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Last month's meeting of the EU Environment Council noted with concern reports about the development of self-chilling drinks cans using certain substances which have a high global warming potential, including HFC--134a which has a global warming potential 1,300 times greater than carbon dioxide. The Council invited the European Commission to investigate this situation and its possible implications for global warming and to bring forward proposals for appropriate action.
<P>

<a name="70703w09.html_para0">My Department has estimated that if self-chilling drink cans using HFC--134a captured 10 per cent. of the UK market by 2000, they would produce emissions equivalent to around 43.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide: equivalent to over half the projected reduction in UK greenhouse gas emissions by 2000.

 Global surface temperature records are maintained by the Hadley Centre, on behalf of the Government. They take account of the effects of Arctic warming when calculating world temperatures by including long-term observations from nearly 60 land-based monitoring stations in the Arctic in their records. Additional ship-borne measurements from the Arctic are also incorporated.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he intends to issue new regulations to govern the local government pension scheme in England and Wales; and if he will make a statement. [6495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w09.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 I have placed in the Library of the House today new regulations for the local government pension scheme (the LGPS) to apply in both England and Wales with effect from 1 April 1998. They provide less central control of pension arrangements, increase the scope of local decision-taking and offer improved flexibility in pension provision.
<P>

<a name="70703w09.html_para2">The Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations 1997 are the product of careful preparation, consultation and discussion with many interested parties. They provide a modernised legal framework and give local government employers greater scope to manage pension scheme benefits. They offer new pension flexibility to both employers and employees while continuing to provide secure, statutory-based pensions for all scheme members and pensioners. Employers will be able to offer members a shared-cost additional voluntary contributions arrangement to improve their pensions. Improved death benefits and spouses pensions have been added to the scheme's benefit package and new options have been added to allow employers and employees greater scope in the provision of retirement benefits, including new criteria to decide when pension benefits may be paid early. New standardised employees' contribution rates, to apply from 1 April 1998, are also included in the package.
<P>

<a name="70703w09.html_para3">The improved regulations ensure that the scheme provides the right qualities and benefits to meet the pension needs of local government employees and pensioners into the next century. The new regulations create a more accountable administrative and benefit framework for local authority employers who are responsible for the scheme's day to day management. They also provide a basis for considering with all the interested parties further scheme developments.
<P>

<a name="70703w09.html_para4">To allow scheme managers and other interested parties sufficient time to adapt their existing policy and administrative procedures to the new arrangements, the regulations come into force on 1 April 1998. My Department's Local Government Pensions Unit will continue to work closely with the interested parties to explain the purpose and operation of the regulations and to monitor their effectiveness. The unit is producing guidance material for scheme members to explain the new provisions and assisting the United Kingdom Steering Committee on Local Government Pensions in the production of explanatory material for local authority employers and other LGPS users.
<P>

<a name="70703w09.html_para5">New regulations governing transitional arrangements to protect the benefit rights for existing scheme members and draft proposals for the management and investment of local authority pension funds will be issued shortly.

<P>

<a name="70703w09.html_para8">The Government's view is that the action plan approach provides a real opportunity to improve the administration of the structural funds in England. Action plans will allow partnerships to bring together individual projects in a way which reflects regional priorities, tackles issues in a coordinated way and streamlines bureaucracy. However, we recognise that circumstances vary across the country and between regions and we do not wish to impose a uniform system. We have decided, therefore, that it will be for each programme monitoring committee to decide to what extent it wishes to adopt the new action plan approach.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what was the length of time before <i>(a)</i> the loss of a door and <i>(b)</i> the collision between another train and the door, referred to in paragraph 75 of the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority Report 1995-96, were reported; and what factors underlay the length of time taken. [5873]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70703w09.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Channel Tunnel Safety Authority Report for 1995-96, paragraph 66, says that arrangements for formal reporting by Eurotunnel of incidents and accidents were concluded during the year covered by the report. These arrangements cover the detailed circumstances where Eurotunnel is required to make immediate reports, reports within 72 hours or regular daily, monthly, half yearly and annual reports.
<P>

<a name="70703w09.html_para11">The incident involving the loss of the emergency door from a tourist shuttle on 28 April 1995 occurred before the formal reporting arrangements were in place. The incident was reported in Eurotunnel's daily report received on the day following the incident and a detailed report was received from Eurotunnel on 2 May 1995.

 Failure to have proper control of a vehicle is already an offence and the police can and do successfully prosecute driving offences that arise from the use of mobile phones while driving. My noble Friend Baroness Hayman will be meeting representatives of the police this month to consider whether additional measures are required. These are likely to include strengthening the advice in the Highway Code and good practice guidelines for drivers and for employers. Discussions are also being held with the mobile phone industry on how best to publicise the potential dangers of this practice.

 Where the driver of a UK registered vehicle is found to have exceeded permitted driving hours, or taken inadequate rest, he or she would normally be advised to take the rest or face the prospect that any refusal to do so would be reported to the court in any subsequent prosecution, or cause possible further charges to be brought.

<P>
<a name="70703w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government believe that all industrial fisheries should be subject to the same requirement as other fisheries to operate on a sustainable basis. We remain concerned that the present restrictions on industrial fisheries may not adequately protect some particularly sensitive areas. As there have been no meetings of the Council of Fisheries Ministers since 1 May I have not had the opportunity to raise this issue there. However, discussions at official level with the Danish Ministry led to their facilitating scientific observation by the Scottish Office Marine Laboratory of this year's sand eel fishery by the Danish fleet off the British East Coast, where the observed catch was more than 99.6 per cent. sand eels.
<P>

<a name="70703w12.html_para3">The Sea Mammal Research Unit, along with the Danish Institute of Fisheries Research, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Scottish Office and others, is undertaking a collaborative three-year project (ELIFONTS), ending in 1999, to examine the impact of industrial fishing on sand eel abundance and the effects of variations in that abundance on predators in the Wee Bankie and neighbouring fisheries. The contractors have undertaken to give early warning of any interim results which show that the fishery is having adverse effects on the various species. We are also funding Newcastle University's research vessel to carry out sampling of sand eel populations within the study area as part of the project.
<P>

<a name="70703w12.html_para4">Section 9.2 of the Statement of Conclusions of the Intermediate Ministerial Meeting on the Integration of Fisheries and Environmental Issues, invites the competent authorities to consider (inter alia) restrictions on fishing in any areas where it is judged the ecosystem requires protection. The European Commission will decide in the light of the ELIFONTS project and other research, what action is appropriate to propose to the Council of Ministers. We would expect them to consider options for introducing quantitative restrictions or complete bans in particularly sensitive areas, always bearing in mind the need to avoid displacing fishing effort in a way that has a net adverse effect.
<P>

<a name="70703w12.html_para5">The Wee Bankie lies outside UK territorial waters and the Government are unable to take unilateral action to restrict fishing there.

<a name="70703w14.html_para0">The Transdepartmental Group numbers include the secretariat of the Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA) and the Management Support Unit for all of OST, and reflect the initiation and development of the Foresight Programme, the transfer of a section from elsewhere in DTI into the Group's International Directorate, the establishment of the secretariat for the Human Genetics Advisory Commission and, in 1997, a temporary increase in staff for the 1988 UK presidency of the EU and Framework V negotiations. The Science and Engineering Base Group includes the Director General of Research Councils (DGRC) and is responsible for the Science Budget and the Research Councils. Its numbers take into account the transfer in January 1996 of the Development Unit for Women in Science, Engineering and Technology from the Transdepartmental Group, and an increase in the number of Research Councils from six to seven.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) is committed to the sustainable eradication of poverty. Protection of the environment is an essential requirement for this. All bilateral DFID projects are appraised to ensure they take full account of environmental issues and many directly contribute to environmental protection. In 1995-96, expenditure on projects which contributed to conserving the environment as an objective totalled &#163;196 million.
<P>

<a name="70703w15.html_para0">DFID seeks to ensure that, through their enhanced participation, indigenous people and ethnic minorities benefit from those projects and programmes, including mineral projects, which affect them and that any adverse effects upon them are minimised.

<a name="70703w15.html_para1">DFID also seeks to ensure that multilateral organisations such as the EC and the World Bank pursue development policies consistent with our own objectives.

The previous government also continued the policy of forgiving the development loans of the poorest countries, a policy introduced under the last Labour government in 1978.

<i>Letter from H. R. F. Plester to Mr. Robert McCartney, dated 30 June 1997:</i>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
The Secretary of State has asked me to reply your recent Parliamentary Question asking what percentage of properties in Northern Ireland and North Down have water meters, how many were charged for excess use and how much was collected in each of the last three years, and when water metering is expected to become universal.
<BR>
In Northern Ireland domestic properties are unmetered. Domestic customers pay for water and sewerage services through their contribution to the regional rate. Water supplies to non-domestic properties, mainly in the commercial, industrial and agricultural sectors, are metered where it is assessed that consumption may exceed the domestic property allowance of 100 cubic metres in any six month period. A farm with a metered supply, which also includes 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>3 Jul 1997 : Column: 276</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a domestic household, is given the domestic usage allowance for that proportion of the property comprised by the household. All supplies serving properties on which full rates are not payable are also metered.
<BR>
There are currently 68,787 metered water supplies in Northern Ireland of which 51,562 are chargeable. There are a number of reasons why a property may be metered but not charged including usage recorded below the domestic allowance level, test metering for leakage control purposes, etc. Income received in the last three financial years was &#163;26.5 million in 1994-95, &#163;27.7 million in 1995-96 and &#163;29.4 million in 1996-97.
<BR>
There are no charges levied for excess use. Metered water customers are responsible for paying for all water recorded by their meters as passing from the public water supply network to their private pipework. If a metered water customer encounters very high demand because of a burst, or fittings failure, or their private pipework, they may apply for a reduction on their bill. Such an allowance is, however, granted on a strictly 'once only' basis. The experience of one such episode of exceptional use or wastage is considered to have put a customer on guard that they are in future responsible for all water their meter records as being used on their property. They should, thereafter, put in place appropriate monitoring to identify at an early stage any unexplained rise in consumption on their premises.
<BR>
Records maintained by the Water Service relate to the numbers of metered supplies rather than properties supplied. A metered supply may service more than the property to which it was initially provided and, therefore, it is not possible to determine the number of individual properties which are provided for by metered supplies. The North Down constituency boundaries do not equate to Water Service metering areas and information on the number of water meters in this area, or on the income received from them, is not available.
<BR>
The Water Service has no plans to introduce universal water metering in Northern Ireland.

<a name="70703w16.html_para1">The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has asked the Chief Executive to respond to your recently tabled PQs about traffic reduction on the Rathgael and Balloo Roads and car parking in Bangor. In the Chief Executive's absence, I will reply on his behalf.

Rathgael Road/Balloo Road acts as a distributor road serving the housing developments on the eastern side of Bangor. It is complementary to, rather than an alternative for, the Bangor Ring Road and there are no plans to reduce traffic on it.
<BR>
Roads Service has 393 car park spaces in close proximity to Bangor Station (232 free) and is working closely with Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company to encourage the use of bus and train.
<BR>
Finally, charging is being introducing at the Castle Square car park (Bangor Market) before the end of July. Charging will be implemented in approximately 50% of the car park with the remainder being free.

 A total of six pupils applied as new entrants for places in Scrabo High School in the 1997-98 academic year. All the applicants would have been accepted if the school had remained in operation.
<P>

<a name="70703w17.html_para0">I have recently approved a proposal by the South Eastern Education and Library Board to close Scrabo High School. This decision was taken after very careful consideration of all relevant information, including the school's existing and projected enrolments, the enrolment capacities of neighbouring schools, and financial, community and educational factors. Account was taken also of the various representations which were made to the Department of Education during the statutory objection period. I concluded that the school was financially and educationally unviable and that closure was in the long-term interest of the children concerned.

 The targets are in line with the objective of improving the service provided to customers and fully support the standards established in the Northern Ireland Citizen's Charter. I am satisfied that the targets represent a demanding challenge for the Agency. The targets will be included in the Agency's 1997-98 Strategic and Business Plan, which is due for publication in July. A copy of the Plan will be placed in the Library. The targets are as follows:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
1. <i>Benefit clearance times <sup>1</sup> </i>
<BR>
Jobseeker's Allowance claims:
<BR>
71 per cent. in 10 days
<BR>
93 per cent. in 21 days.
<BR>
Faster Family Credit:
<BR>
93 per cent. in 5 days.

<BR>
2. <i>Benefit accuracy</i>
<BR>
Income Support:
<BR>
to pay the correct amount in at least 87 per cent. of cases.
<BR>
Incapacity Benefit:
<BR>
to pay the correct amount in at least 98 per cent. of cases.
<BR>
Family Credit:
<BR>
to pay the correct amount in at least 93 per cent. of cases.
<BR>
Disability Living Allowance:
<BR>
to pay the correct amount in at least 99 per cent. of cases.
<BR>
Jobseeker's Allowance:
<BR>
to pay the correct amount in at least 87 per cent. of cases.
<BR>
3. <i>Customer satisfaction <sup>2</sup> </i>
<BR>
90 per cent. of customers to regard the Agency's service as satisfactory or better.
<BR>
4. <i>Financial recovery</i>
<BR>
recovery of Social Fund loans--&#163;27.17 million
<BR>
recovery of overpayments--&#163;4.6 million <sup>3</sup> 
<BR>
benefit savings from detection and prevention of fraud--&#163;15.00 million sign-offs as a result of anti-fraud activity--5,500
<BR>
sign-offs as a result of anti-fraud activity--5,500
<BR>
Class I contributions identified as underpaid to the National Insurance Fund--&#163;1.65 million
<BR>
Collection of Contributions owing to the National Insurance Fund <sup>4</sup> --&#163;1.4 million
<BR>
Contributions identified as underpaid to the National Insurance Fund--to provide a return on Challenge Fund investment of 9:1 <sup>5</sup> .
<BR>
5. <i>Resource Management</i>
<BR>
to live within a gross allocation of &#163;40.34 million for Social Fund loans and Community Care grants
<BR>
to live within the Agency's gross running cost budget allocation
<BR>
to achieve cash efficiency savings of the order of &#163;5.50 million.
<BR>
 <sup>1</sup>  Clearance time is measured from the date of receipt of a claim or application in the office to the date on which the claim or application is decided. The measure, therefore, excludes the time taken to issue notification of the decision and any payment.
<BR>
 <sup>2</sup>  The customer satisfaction target is presently measured by independent survey and usually covers a two year period, in this case 1997-98.
 <sup>3</sup>  It has been decided to combine the previous figures for Income Support Centralised Benefits and Unemployment Benefit with the new figure for Jobseeker's Allowance into one overall Overpayment Recovery Target. This target is based on a percentage of the overall outstanding debt, which will be much more challenging than the existing system. The yield in 1996-97 was &#163;2.56 million.
 <sup>4</sup>  This was an internal target in 1996-97, but has been raised to Ministerial status in line with the Contributions Agency in GB.
 <sup>5</sup>  This is a new target for the Agency.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
<i>Financial Performance</i>
<BR>
To meet the challenge of managing the Agency's workload by:
<BR>
(a) absorbing a 13.3 per cent. reduction in staff numbers;
<BR>
(b) providing for an estimated 4 per cent. increase in readers;




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>3 Jul 1997 : Column: 280</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
(c) maintaining extended opening hours;
<BR>
(d) ensuring that expenditure is within the financial limits approved.
<BR>
<i>Output</i>
<BR>
1. To appraise at least 4,000 linear metres of records, including the reappraisal of records so as to eliminate low-grade material.
<BR>
2. To list and index at least 500 linear metres of records, including ensuring that 100 per cent. of all new "open" material is thus processed within one year of receipt.
<BR>
<i>Quality of service</i>
<BR>
1. To survey the conditions in which 10 per cent. of 33,360 metres of records are stored; and, in a related exercise, to take remedial action on upgrading c.1,800 linear metres of records as presently stored on mobile shelving at Balmoral Avenue so as to bring them up to defined standards of archival protection.
<BR>
2. With the help of the computerised document request system, to improve the speed of on-site production to the public by reducing waiting time from 40 minutes to 37 minutes or less in 90 per cent. of cases.
<BR>
3. To process customer queries within 10 working days of receipt in 90 per cent. of cases and within 14 working days in 96 per cent. of cases, thus improving PRONI's Citizen's Charter commitment.
<BR>
4. To ensure the smooth completion of the annual release for 1998--c.680 files, but with the possible addition of court records--as well as the ongoing release of identified blocks of records at earlier than 30 years.
<BR>
<i>Efficiency</i>
<BR>
1. To reduce PRONI's composite Unit Cost in the areas of selecting and accessioning, records listing, records storage, document production and reader service by 3 per cent., from &#163;99.95 to &#163;96.95.

<BR>
The guidance followed by Child Support Officers in cases where paternity is disputed is contained in the Child Support Agency Paternity Guide (which will shortly be available in the Library of the House). Officers are first advised to interview the parent with care; this is necessary to establish certain facts and whether the parent with care is willing to undergo DNA testing to resolve the dispute. Depending on the outcome, an interview with the alleged absent parent is arranged.
<BR>
If the alleged absent parent continues to dispute paternity, it is then considered whether the case is suitable for court proceedings and whether the alleged absent parent should be offered a DNA test to be arranged through the Agency.
<BR>
Once the issue of paternity has been satisfactorily resolved, then a maintenance assessment is completed as soon as possible.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
The Agency Charter sets out the standards the Agency aims to achieve for answering the telephone, written enquiries and visits to local offices by customers and their representatives. I have listed below the targets and the Agency performance against each standard during 1996/97.
<BR>
We aim to answer general telephone enquiries (through the Agency's National Enquiry line) within 20 seconds during normal working hours. Performance against this standard was 64%. Case specific enquiries are handled through the Agency's Client Helplines. The Agency has no target which covers this area, but it is clear that this is an area where the service offered by the Agency has not fully met its customers needs.
<BR>
I am committed to improving this and plans are in place to improve the service. The Agency plans to employ staff to work a wider more flexible range of working patterns over six days a week. This will provide more opportunities for customers to contact the Agency and vice versa, and will enable the Agency to deliver a better standard of customer service through greater use of the telephone. The Agency has also recently initiated an Early Positive Customer Contact project which will increase the use of the telephone by Agency staff at an early stage in our dealings with customers. The aim is that much more of our business will be conducted over the telephone rather than by correspondence, giving customers more opportunity to raise any issues or concerns earlier than at present.
<BR>
We aim to reply to letters within 10 working days of receiving them. If we cannot send a full reply within 10 days, we aim to send an initial reply within 10 days and confirmation of when we can send the full reply. Performance against this standard was 52 per cent.
<BR>
We aim to see customers within 10 minutes of their appointment time. Performance against this standard was 100 per cent.




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>3 Jul 1997 : Column: 283</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
We aim to acknowledge complaints within two working days and aim to send a full reply within ten working days. Performance against this standard was 92 per cent. for acknowledgements and 62 per cent. for full replies.
<BR>
Whilst some of the results against our Charter Standards are encouraging, I am very conscious that there are still far too many justified complaints about the standards of basic customer contact and the service we provide. Over the next few years, I am committed to bringing high quality levels of performance to every part of our operation as a matter of routine, thereby reducing the number of complaints received and enhancing the public perception of the Agency.

However, the Benefits Agency has a duty to ensure that confidential customer information is not disclosed improperly. In dealing with any enquiry from a customer's representative, Agency staff should confirm that both the enquiry and the person making it are genuine, and that the enquiry is being made on behalf of the customer. However, the method by which this is achieved is subject to local procedures, forming part of local liaison arrangements between the Benefits Agency and other welfare organisations.
<BR>
I meet the Chief Executive of the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux on a six monthly basis. Local managers are also encouraged to maintain regular liaison with local Citizens Advice Bureaux and the Agency has produced guidance for field staff entitled 'Building Effective Relationships with Citizens Advice Bureaux'. Using their established liaison channels, the Benefits Agency will keep under review the operation of the arrangements for the disclosure of information to Citizens Advice Bureaux.

In addition following the Home Secretary's declaration on 1 July 1997 of Sierra Leone as a country of upheaval, a Sierra Leonean national who entered the country previously and applies for asylum within three months of the declaration being made is eligible to claim income support, income based jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit while their asylum application is considered by the Home Office. Zaire was also declared a country of upheaval on 16 May 1996 and Zairean nationals have three months from the date of the declaration to apply for asylum and thereby become eligible to claim benefit.
