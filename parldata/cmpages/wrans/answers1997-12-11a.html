<a name="71211w01.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Gibson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many United Kingdom bathing waters pass the <i>(a)</i> mandatory standard and <i>(b)</i> the guideline standard of the European Union Bathing Waters Directive. [19241]

<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Hunter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action he will take to encourage water companies to ensure that the supply of water for domestic use satisfies the projected housebuilding programmes in Hampshire. [19472]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w01.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Water companies are subject to a statutory duty to develop and maintain efficient and economical systems of water supply within their areas. In respect of residential development, water companies have a duty to provide supplies of water sufficient for domestic purposes. This duty extends to all new premises. Current planning guidance advises local authorities to consult infrastructure providers such as water companies when drawing up their development plans, to ensure that the demands of new development do not exceed the capacities of existing or planned water supply systems.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Stunell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress has been made in establishing an interdepartmental working group on fuel poverty; which individuals and Government departments will be represented on the working group; which non-governmental organisations will be invited to participate in the work of the group; and if he will make a statement. [19701]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w01.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 At my request, officials from my Department have set up an informal group to examine the issue of fuel poverty. In particular, the group will look at the impact of current policies and programmes and consider whether existing expenditure could be made more effective. Other Departments represented are Social Security, Health, Trade and Industry and Treasury, together with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices. The group has met once so far. Non- governmental organisations may be invited in future to contribute to the work of the group as it progresses.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received about changes to leasehold legislation; and what plans he has in this area. [19514]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I have had a number of representations from organisations and individuals. We have a commitment to bring forward a package of reforms to assist leaseholders, and are currently considering the scope and practicability of possible measures. An announcement and public consultation are scheduled for the spring.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Martyn Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress he has made towards implementing European Council Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources; and if he will make a statement on the establishment of draft action programmes. [19667]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w01.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Government have implemented all of the Directive's requirements, except the establishment of action programmes. We expect to issue draft action programme regulations for consultation before the end of 1997, with the aim of laying them before Parliament early in 1998.
<P>

<a name="71211w01.html_para0">The Government are currently finalising the detailed assessment of the monitoring data required by the first review of designations, which forms the next phase of the Directive's implementation. Any changes proposed as a result will be issued for public consultation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Stunell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will publish an analysis of work carried out since revisions to the home energy efficiency scheme showing the numbers of different measures installed, the average cost of individual measures and the average value of a home energy efficiency scheme grant; and if he will make a statement. [19699]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w01.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The latest data available cover the period from 1 July 1997, when the revisions to the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme took effect, until 30 September 1997. Forty thousand and seven grants were paid for work under the revised scheme. Some work carried out during this period will not be included because the claims for payment will have been processed in the following quarter. An additional 52,308 grants were paid during this period in respect of work carried out under the preceding scheme, which contained a more limited range of energy efficiency measures.
<P>

<a name="71211w01.html_para1">The breakdown of these 40,007 grants, by the main measure installed, was:

<a name="71211w01.html_para3">I am very pleased to announce that this information, updated quarterly, will become publicly available from early 1998. Our managing agent, Eaga Ltd., will place detailed reports about the scheme on the Internet. The address will be www.eaga.co.uk.
<P>

<a name="71211w01.html_para4">I propose, in the near future, to review this scheme, which is intended to help people on low incomes keep their homes warmer and use less fuel, to find out if it is helping the right people in the most effective way.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Stunell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what financial resources will be available to fund the cost of energy efficiency work carried out under the Environmental Task Force Programme; and if he will make a statement. [19697]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w01.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Environment Task Force is one of four options available to the young unemployed under the New Deal for 18 to 24-year-olds, and will be funded from the windfall levy on the excess profits of the privatised utilities.
<P>

<a name="71211w01.html_para5">The level of funding available for projects carried out by the Environment Task Force, including energy efficiency work, will vary according to the administration and material costs of the placements, and will be subject to a competitive tender process, managed by the Employment Service.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Alan Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the carbon savings that will occur each year as a result of the reduction in the level of VAT levied on activities undertaken under the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme; and what estimates he has made of the carbon savings that would have occurred each year, had the same reduction in the level of VAT been levied on all purchases and installations of such energy-saving items as are deemed eligible under the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme, but currently undertaken outwith that scheme. [18544]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="71211w01.html_para6">Customs' recent report on the scope of a reduced rate of VAT for energy-saving materials concluded that a reduced rate of VAT targeted through HEES and similar grant-funded schemes would help more of the less well-off keep warm. The report also suggests that the environmental benefits of such a limited reduced rate would be small, because the benefit to such households may be taken in warmer houses rather than reduced fuel consumption.




<P>
<P><I>11 Dec 1997 : Column: 632</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71211w01.html_para7">The Government have said that they will explore with our European partners the scope for a reduced VAT rate on a broader range of Energy Saving Materials because this would have a larger environmental effect.
<P>

<a name="71211w01.html_para8">Applying a reduced rate of VAT of 5 per cent. to all supplies to domestic consumers of the sort of energy saving measures that are available under the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (including for DIY installation) might result in an initial annual saving of 3,000 tonnes of carbon, accumulating to 40,000 tonnes annually by 2010.

 The Government welcome the publication of "Due for Renewal". We recognise the importance of the public library sector, and are committed to its future. However, we also recognise that there are a number of challenges that public libraries are having to face as they approach the Millennium. "Due for Renewal" usefully identifies some of the main issues, and provides valuable advice about service planning and the scope for achieving further efficiency savings. This work complements the Government's requirement for library

<a name="71211w02.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans he has in respect of the level of next year's television licence fee; what account this level takes of the five year formula announced by the previous government; and if he will make a statement about future licence fee levels. [20737]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 In December 1996, following a report by independent consultants, Braxton Associates, on the BBC's expenditure needs, the previous Government announced a television licence fee formula for the five years from April 1997. Under this formula, licence fee increases for the period as a whole were set just below inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index (RPI). However, the increases from 1 April 1998 were set at RPI plus 3 per cent., reflecting primarily the additional costs faced by the BBC in launching its new digital services.
<P>

<a name="71211w02.html_para4">The Government have carefully considered the five year formula and have concluded that it remains appropriate. It allows the BBC to plan its business properly for the period as a whole and is based on an independent assessment of its financial needs. The real-terms increase this year is paying for new digital services for licence fee payers. The 1999-2000 increase under the formula will also be marginally above inflation, at RPI plus 0.5 per cent. However, the formula specifies changes in the licence fee in 2000-01 and 2001-02 at RPI minus 1 per cent. and RPI minus 2.5 per cent. respectively. Application of the RPI figure of 3.6 per cent. for the year to September 1997, plus 3 per cent., to the current unrounded licence fees produces new rounded totals of &#163;97.50 for a colour licence and &#163;32.50 for a black and white licence. The necessary regulations to bring these fees into force will be laid before the House in due course.
<P>

<a name="71211w02.html_para5">The Government's existing Agreement with the BBC guarantees the licence fee until the end of the five-year period (i.e. until the end of March 2002). The Government intend to conduct well before then a wide-ranging review of the future level of the licence fee.

<P>
<a name="71211w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 November 1997]:</i> In view of the situation in Sierra Leone, following the overthrow of the democratically elected government by rebel soldiers, we decided to declare that the country had undergone such a fundamental change in circumstances that we would not normally order the return of a person to that country for the time being. The declaration was made on 1 July 1997.
<P>

<a name="71211w03.html_para1">The situation in Sierra Leone remains uncertain and it is being monitored closely in co-operation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Although the positive developments following the Conakry Accord are encouraging and we are looking forward to further improvements, no-one will be returned to Sierra Leone unless we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.
<P>

<a name="71211w03.html_para2">The effect of making such a declaration is that a Sierra Leone national who was stranded in the United Kingdom and applied for asylum within three months of the declaration being made also became eligible to make a claim for social security benefits while his application was being considered by the Home Office, providing that claim for benefits was lodged within the three-month timescale.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Around 500 complaints have been received about the timescale for compensation payments, and the need to respond to these complaints, proving a substantial distraction from the main work of the Firearms Compensation Section. The section is endeavouring to process claims as quickly as possible but complaints and other specific inquiries are factors slowing the rate of payments.
<P>

<a name="71211w03.html_para4">I appreciate that the time taken to settle compensation claims is irritating to those who are opposed to the legislation and that all individuals who have handed in their weapons would like to be paid without delay. However, it was made clear at the outset that the number and difficulty of the claims received would make delays inevitable. All efforts are being made to complete the task as quickly as possible, and this would be achieved much sooner if there were fewer inquiries about the progress of individual claims.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w03.html_spnew11"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 In a statement to the House on 18 November 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 155-163, I set out the progress that had been made by firms in redressing victims of mis-selling up until the end of October. I have now received an update from the 41 firms whose progress I have been monitoring, and these are set out in the table. For those firms that fail to make sufficient progress, regulatory discipline is a real prospect. For most of these 41 firms, the regulators' deadline of 31 December, by which 90 per cent. of the most urgent cases must be resolved, is fast approaching. It is now up to each firm to make every effort to make rapid progress so that disciplinary action against them is not called for.
<P>

<a name="71211w03.html_para5">In general most firms have improved their performance over the month. Once again however, the figures show a wide divergence in performance, with some firms making good, if belated progress, and others that still have a disgracefully large task which remains to be tackled.
<P>

<a name="71211w03.html_para6">Of course many firms other than the 41 listed have cases to review. These, too, must be completed within deadlines set by the regulators. Of these firms, the vast majority are independent financial advisers (IFAs), ranging from large firms, employing hundreds, if not thousands, of people, to small sole traders. Few firms are innocent, and no firm will be let off the hook: the customer who has been disadvantaged by the mis-selling of a small IFA has as much right to speedy redress as the customer of the largest pension provider. All firms must complete their reviews without delay, and to the standards set out by the regulators.

<P>
<a name="71211w03.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 Legislation governing public service pensions requires public service pensions to be increased annually by the same percentage as State earnings related pensions (additional pensions). My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security announced on 2 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>186</i> that additional pensions will be increased by 3.6 per cent., in line with the annual increase in the Retail Prices Index up to September 1997. Public service pensions will therefore be increased by 3.6 per cent., from 6 April 1998, except those which have been in payment for less than a year, which will receive a pro rata increase.

 IMF financing under Korea's Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) is conditioned on a strong programme of adjustment. This involves a tight macroeconomic framework; a comprehensive strategy to restructure the financial sector; further trade and capital account liberalisation; and improvements in corporate structure and governance. The Presidents of the World Bank and Asian Development Bank have also indicated that they are both ready to provide financial support to Korea, conditioned on strong programmes of reform. It is expected that these programmes will focus on financial sector restructuring and institutional reform.
<P>

<a name="71211w04.html_para0">Full implementation of these programmes will help restore market confidence and provide Korea with a solid foundation for more sustained growth. Programmes will be reviewed regularly and future disbursements of funds will be linked to successful completion of the reviews.

The latter three countries have in addition agreed, or are negotiating, programmes with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (AsDB). The financing to be provided by international financial institutions (IFIs) is likely to amount to the following:

<P>
<a name="71211w04.html_spnew9"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 I have received a number of representations on this issue. Value-shifting by travel agents and tour operators does take place on non-EU holidays but since such holidays are not subject to VAT there has never been any question of a VAT motive or a VAT effect in this area. On grounds of simplicity, efficiency and effectiveness it was nevertheless considered right that insurance sold with all holidays should be made subject to the higher rate of insurance premium tax.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w04.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Pendry: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is the Government's current position and timetable on their review of the differential between the rate of insurance premium tax currently levied for policies sold by tour operators and travel agents and for similar travel insurance policies sold through building societies, BUPA and other retailers.

<P>
<a name="71211w04.html_spnew10"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 I have asked officials in Customs and Excise to monitor the effect of the introduction of the higher rate of insurance premium tax. It is too early yet to draw any conclusions from this monitoring process.

 There are no Commission proposals before the Council at present to end the current exemption of aviation fuel used in international commercial traffic. The Commission has been asked by the ECOFIN Council, on 9 June 1997, to study the environmental and economic effects in Europe of ending the current exemption of aviation fuel. The study is not likely to be completed before May 1998.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w04.html_spnew12"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Aviation turbine fuels for aircraft use are not subject to excise duty. Aviation gasoline is charged at the rate of &#163;0.2255 per litre (&#163;1.025) per gallon). Supplies of both types of fuel for commercial flights within the United Kingdom and for all private flights are liable at the standard rate of Value Added Tax.

<a name="71211w04.html_wqn13"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how much revenue would be raised if aircraft fuel was taxed at the same rate as commercial fuel for road transport assuming no alteration in demand. [19744]

<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w04.html_spnew13"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The estimate requested by the hon. Member on taxing aviation fuel at the same rate as diesel would raise approximately &#163;4 billion, assuming no alteration in demand.

When appraised in 1995, the programme was considered to be of high developmental value. A second proposal is now under appraisal. This involves support for construction or replacement of bridges located on national highways and our support will depend on whether such bridges bring significant benefits to poor people.

<P><I>11 Dec 1997 : Column: 648</I><P>
Forty-eight of these have been destroyed by UNSCOM. In addition, UNSCOM have been responsible for the destruction of 30 warheads, 690 tonnes of chemical weapons, 38,537 filled and empty munitions and more than 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals, as well as the main biological weapons production plant at Al Hakm, and large quantities of growth media. Further details can be found in the latest report by the Executive Chairman of UNSCOM, placed in the Library on 10 November 1997. UNSCOM have not published estimates of quantities of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) which may still be held by Iraq. Iraq has worked on a large number of agents including VX, Sarin, Botulinum toxin, Aflatoxin, and Anthrax. UNSCOM remain seriously concerned that they have not been able fully to account for Iraq's known imports and production of material for chemical and biological weapons, and that Iraq retains the expertise and capability to re-commence its WMD programmes at very short notice.

 The higher education funding plans for 1998-99 assumed that institutions in England would collect &#163;130 million from private contributions to fees, and allowed for an additional &#163;165 million for the sector, including a &#163;36 million package for access.
<P>

<a name="71211w08.html_para0">Decisions about funding for 1999-2000 and beyond will have to await the outcome of the Government's Expenditure Review. The Government will take account of the income that universities and colleges collect from the student contribution to tuition fees, the needs of the higher education sector and wider public expenditure considerations.
<P>

<a name="71211w08.html_para1">We have made clear that the savings from the introduction of tuition fees will be used to improve quality, standards and opportunity for all in further and higher education.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w08.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Contributions to tuition fees in 1998-99 will be calculated in the same way as in previous years, that is on the basis of residual income (gross income after certain allowable deductions). These arrangements will be reviewed for the academic year 1999-2000.

students entering university in 1998 will remain constant for the remainder of their degree course; [19136]
<P>
<UL>(2) on what percentage of average course costs future charges to full-time undergraduates will be based; and what steps he will take to restrict universities in the increases they make to the charges upon which that percentage is based. [19137]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w08.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 It is for universities themselves to determine the level of fees that they charge students. Our proposals assume that full-time undergraduates will contribute up to &#163;1,000 towards tuition fees in 1998-99: this represents around 25 per cent. of the average course cost, which was the percentage the Dearing Inquiry recommended for private individual contributions. The Teaching and Higher Education Bill, currently before the other House, contains provisions requiring that the maximum financial support from Government for tuition fees, and hence by implication the maximum contribution from students, parents or spouses towards tuition fees, cannot increase by more than inflation without Parliamentary approval. Further provisions in the Bill gives the Secretary of State a reserve power to control top-up fees, if necessary.

<a name="71211w08.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment he has made of the effect of the announcement of the introduction of tuition fees on applications for university places in 1998. [19191]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w08.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 None. It is too early to estimate the number of education applicants for 1998-99. Applicant numbers are at present slightly down compared with last year; but, by this stage last year, fewer than half of the final number of applications had been submitted.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w08.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The maximum tuition fees contribution, subject to assessment against family income, will be &#163;500 in a year when a student spends the entire year of a course on a sandwich placement. This contribution is towards the cost incurred by the institution of administrative and pastoral arrangements relating to the placement.
<P>

<a name="71211w08.html_para2">Where sandwich or other elements form less than a full year away, the &#163;1,000 fee will be payable, subject to the family income assessment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if students presently studying HNDs and due to finish in summer 1998 who go on to a one year top up degree as part of a profession pathway to degree status, will be expected to pay tuition fees on that year. [19188]

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w08.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Universities and colleges already have administrative arrangements in place to collect tuition fees from part-time students, overseas students, self-funding students, and many postgraduates. They will be able to build on these arrangements in collecting private contributions to tuition fees from full-time undergraduate students under the new funding arrangements for higher education and in deciding what action to take if students fail to make the private contributions.
<P>

<a name="71211w08.html_para3">The higher education funding plans for 1998-99 assumed that institutions in England will collect &#163;130 million from private contributions to fees. This figure allowed for some 5 per cent. for collection and any default.

Gentleman believes that disabled people seeking to take legal action under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 face particular problems, I would be grateful if he could let me know what they are so that consideration can be given to this during the consultation process.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated on the impact of fixed costs on existing legal expenses insurance premiums; and if he will make a statement. [19339]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 None. My Department is, however, in close contact with the insurance industry. A fixed costs system would necessarily make the task of matching the risk being insured to the appropriate level of premium easier. The level of premiums must be a matter for each company offering policies.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what steps he will take to ensure that lawyers will not seek to recover from their clients more than the fixed costs in privately funded personal injury actions valued at less than &#163;15,000. [19321]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The arrangements that clients make with their lawyers are essentially private contractual arrangements. I would wish to give effect to the proposal made by Lord Woolf, that the fixed recoverable costs should apply between the client and the solicitor unless there was a written business agreement to the contrary.

 The procedures are currently being developed which will achieve the Civil Justice reforms and work is underway to identify the IT support required. The IT solution will be developed by our private sector partner and we plan for them to be in place for 1 April 1999.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what assessment has been made of the training needs of judges following the introduction of the Woolf reforms; what is the budget for judicial training; and if he will make a statement. [19332]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Judicial training is the responsibility of the Judicial Studies Board (JSB), which is a non-departmental governmental body. The JSB has assessed the training needs of judges in anticipation of the introduction of the Woolf reforms. During 1997 a series of seminars on the principles of the Woolf reforms were delivered to all full-time judges who hear civil matters. More detailed training will be given to all full-time judges who hear civil matters. More detailed training will be given to all full-time and part-time judges who hear civil matters once the new rules have been finalised. The financial allocations for the JSB for 1998-99 have not yet been finalised.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w11.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what estimate he has made of the training costs involved in using the new information technology systems required by the introduction of the Woolf reforms. [19326]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 No detailed estimates have yet been made. The scope of training cannot be established until the IT system to support the reforms has been specified and the systems design has commenced. This will not be until 1998, after final rule changes have been agreed. Once the specification has been agreed, the costs associated with the provision of training can be more accurately predicted.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There are currently no special advisers employed in this Department. As announced on 9 December 1997, the Lord Chancellor has decided to appoint Mr. Garry Hart as a Special Adviser. Mr. Hart's appointment will not, however, take effect until 2 March 1998.
<P>

<a name="71211w11.html_para0">No-one from outside the Department is currently employed in a task force or review body. The total fees and benefits paid to review body members from outside the Department in the year to 1 May 1997 was approximately &#163;37,500. Since 1 May 1997, such expenditure has totalled approximately &#163;24,700. These figures include payments for travel and subsistence. It is not possible to distinguish the cost of ministers' and officials' time spent on task force and review-related work.

 It is not clear why it is thought that "fixed costs on conditional fees" should result in savings to the Government. Nor is it clear on what the hon. Member thinks such cost would impact. As to research into legal costs, my Department is currently funding the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies research into the amount of work needed to take a case through the Fast Track.

 I am publishing today a summary of the responses received to the Green Paper "Improving the Payment Culture: a Statutory Right to Claim Interest on Late Payment of Commercial Debt".

More than 450 responses were received. I am very pleased that so many people have taken the time to contribute views.

These discussions will not prejudice the outcome of the review and are designed to ensure that valuable time is not lost if the scheme remains in the programme following the review. It would not, of course, be appropriate to reveal details of these negotiations.

 The Government recognise that the meat supply chain, including butchers and other small businesses, has suffered as a result of the BSE crisis. Substantial support has been provided since April 1996 to prevent the disorderly collapse of the chain. This is now being phased out to allow the industry to adjust to the changing economics. However, the Government cannot continue to shield the chain from the post-BSE economics of meat production in the United Kingdom.<i></i>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The rendering industry plays a vital part in ensuring that the essential elements of the meat chain continue to function. Support to the rendering industry in 1996-97 allowed them to maintain pre-crisis prices and charges to suppliers of animal waste. The Scheme provides for support to be phased out during 1997-98 to enable the meat chain, including the renderers, gradually to adjust to the changing economics.
<P>

<a name="71211w15.html_para0">In terms of the slaughterers, it is widely accepted that there is substantial over-capacity in the red meat slaughtering sector, particularly in respect of abattoirs slaughtering cattle and sheep. There is intense competition between slaughterhouses, both for throughput and for customers and profit margins are low. The UK needs a modern financially viable slaughterhouse sector and in this context rationalism is highly desirable. However, we believe it is for the industry itself and not Government to address this issue.

A wide range of industry bodies and representatives were involved in drawing up the Schemes, which were always intended to cover only the financial years 1996-97 and 1997-98, and to provide reduced support in the second year to allow the meat chain to adjust to the post BSE economic and regulatory realities.

The principal reason for the decision was that the conditions last year which gave rise to the threat of collapse of the meat chain no longer exist. The support has served its purpose and there are no plans to continue the support into 1998-99.

 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1997]:</i> Compensation under the over-30-months scheme is payable only on animals over thirty months of age on the date of slaughter. Producers are therefore required to complete a declaration for each animal presented on which they must confirm that the animal is over thirty months of age and declare the date of birth or number of teeth. This requirement was introduced in June 1996.
<P>

<a name="71211w16.html_para1">If a producer chooses to enter the date of birth, the year and month of birth are often sufficient to confirm that the animal is over thirty months of age. The date becomes an issue only when the month and year of birth entered on the declaration by the producer makes it unclear whether the animal is over thirty months. On these relatively rare occasions, the date of birth is required to establish whether the animal was over thirty months of age on the date of slaughter and therefore eligible for compensation.

 I refer the hon. Member to the reply I gave him on 22 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>566</i>. The routine financial statistics provided by the former Wiltshire County Council wrongly included expenditure on independent sector provision along with that on local authority homes. This means that it is not possible to calculate the unit costs requested, as there is no way of separating the reported gross expenditure by sector. Expenditure data for 1996-97 for the new authorities formed out of the former Wiltshire county are not yet available.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A member who retires from pensionable employment because of physical or mental infirmity that makes him permanently incapable of efficiently discharging the duties of that employment shall be entitled to a pension under this regulation if he has at least 2 years qualifying service...".

that patient related activity in connection with PFI projects with a capital value over &#163;10 million will remain constant over the life of the project. [19863]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71211w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 No. Value for money (VFM) calculations are based on a number of assumptions including expected levels of patient activity and are carried out for all National Health Service capital projects. These levels are determined by a comprehensive analysis of current activity levels, expected changes in activity levels, patient flows and lengths of stay. Sensitivity analysis around these central assumptions is also undertaken to assess the effect on the VFM calculation of any changes. This includes an analysis of the impact of alternative levels of patient related activity.
<P>

<a name="71211w17.html_para7">Private Finance Initiative projects are expected to have a flexibility of design to allow for different types of care should future healthcare requirements alter. This flexibility of design is one of the factors looked at during the approval process of a PFI project and helps give hospitals an in-built capability for coping with changes to patient activity.

<P>

<a name="71211w18.html_para1">A sum of &#163;300 million has been made available for patient care this winter as a result of reordering spending priorities; &#163;270 million was found from cuts in other spending programmes. A reduction in provision for the Ministry of Defence of &#163;168 million related to overspending in 1996-97 and &#163;102 million of provision no longer needed by the public sector nuclear industry as a result of their improved performance. The remaining &#163;30 million will be from efficiency savings within the NHS.
<P>

<a name="71211w18.html_para2">The money will specifically help hospitals cope with emergency admissions, reduce delays in discharging patients and strengthen primary and community services to reduce the need for people to be admitted to hospital in the first place.
