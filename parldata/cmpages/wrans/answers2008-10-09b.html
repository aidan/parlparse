 This Government are firmly committed to the importance of the EU in delivering on 21st century challenges. The EU is of central importance to the work of HM Government across all Departments.

As such, the specific information requested is not held centrally, and to provide it would involve disproportionate costs.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what opportunities exist for demonstration projects to develop solutions to downstream flooding problems; what criteria are in place for funding support either by his Department or the Environment Agency; and what particular assistance may be available to communities in the Gloucestershire area because of the floods in July 2007.

 The Government's budget for flood management is targeted to achieve the maximum possible benefit. DEFRA guidance directs delivery bodies to consider all options at a catchment scale to reduce downstream flooding problems. In order to encourage the adoption of such projects at a local scale, on 4 July, I announced that &#163;500,000 will be made available to fund a project to demonstrate how land management change can reduce downstream flooding. Outline proposals were invited by 29 August with a view to selecting a number of projects for more detailed assessment before committing funding for implementation. The criteria for this project are that:</p>

For example, the Environment Agency recently assisted Water 21, an environmental organisation engaged by local residents, which was looking to secure funding for works in the wider Slad Brook catchment in Gloucestershire. The Environment Agency provided river and general catchment data, gave advice on the technical aspects of its work and guidance on proposed actions. The project covers a number of aspects including measures to reduce flooding downstream in Stroud.</p>

The &#163;500,000 proposal has recently been submitted to the Severn Trent Regional Flood Defence Committee for local funding in 2009-10. The project is competing against a number of other projects in the region and elsewhere. Funding is limited and the projects supported will be selected on their merits against the criteria above. We expect to make a decision in October on which project or projects will taken forward for further assessment before confirming funding for delivery in the new year.</p>

However, DEFRA has had no discussions with Network Rail specifically about controlling invasive non-native pests and plants or the five injurious weeds covered by the Weeds Act 1959 on its land.</p>

 The planning system provides strong protection for open spaces that communities need. Planning Policy Guidance Note 17; &#145;Open Space, Sport and Recreation&#146; states that existing open spaces and land should not be built on unless an assessment has been undertaken by the local authority which has clearly shown the open space or land to be surplus to the requirements of the local community, taking into account all the functions that open space can perform.</p>

On the basis of these assessments and audits, local authorities should plan to meet future needs of their population (e.g. linked to new housing developments) and can place standards of provision in their development plan. &#145;Planning Policy Statement 3 Housing&#146; says that local planning authorities should have clear policies for the protection and creation of open space, and new housing developments should incorporate sufficient provision where such spaces are not already adequately provided within easy access of the new housing.</p>

 The Rural Payments Agency Inspectorate plans to complete the majority of sheep and goat inspections during the winter months when livestock are more readily available for inspection. However, due to the number and geographical distribution of inspections required to be completed and competing scheme inspection pressures, a minority of inspections will be completed during the summer months. In these instances the inspectorate endeavours to work with the keeper to minimise any disruption to other farming operations. All sheep and goat identification inspections must be undertaken unannounced, in practice this means an inspector can provide a maximum of 48 hours&#146; notice.</p>

 The Government-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) sets itself targets&#151;which are agreed with its funders, DEFRA and the devolved Governments&#151;and these are written into each of its business plans. WRAP&#146;s fourth business plan was published earlier this year, and sets out its targets for the three-year period from April 2008 to March 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="81009w0008.htm_para0"><a name="08100960000721">The extent of WRAP&#146;s delivery against its targets is set out annually in reports which are published by WRAP, and are publicly available on its website. The next such report will be published in October, and will set out how WRAP has performed against the targets contained in its third business plan, which covered the period April 2006 to March 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="81009w0008.htm_para1"><a name="08100960000722">Prior to the publication of that report, it is possible, on the basis of WRAP&#146;s annual review for 2006-07, to report that WRAP has made it possible for the recycling industry to process an extra 5.8 million tonnes of materials per year. This consists of 4.17 million tonnes of aggregate; enough to build 83,000 new homes, 507,000 tonnes of wood, constituting 42 per cent. of the UK&#146;s domestic capacity, 495,000 tonnes of paper, 349,000 tonnes of compost, 137,000 tonnes of glass and 130,000 tonnes of plastic, enough to make 2.8 billion milk bottles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="81009w0008.htm_para2"><a name="08100960000723">The benefits of WRAP&#146;s work in terms of the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) are also significant. Since WRAP started work in 2001 it is estimated that the combined impact of its activities has saved over 1 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases&#151;the same as taking 316,000 cars off the road. Over the lifetime of the projects that WRAP has directly supported, over 12 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases will be saved.</p>

 The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) commissions external public relations agencies to communicate its research, advice and consumer campaigns to a wide range of target audiences, both business and consumer. The expenditure is predominantly in support of WRAP&#146;s national consumer behaviour-change campaigns: Recycle Now, Love Food Hate Waste and the programme to support home composting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="81009w0008.htm_para3"><a name="08100960000728">WRAP ensures that public relations activity is a cost-effective use of taxpayers&#146; funds. For example, public relations spend of &#163;36,000 to launch The Food We Waste report in May this year delivered national and regional media coverage with an advertising value equivalent of &#163;1.995 million, equal to the entire annual communications budget for WRAP&#146;s Food Waste campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="81009w0008.htm_para4"><a name="08100960000729">Public relations material produced for the consumer campaigns provides local authorities with valuable free support to help them meet recycling and waste minimisation targets. These campaigns have been highly successful over this period: the number of &#145;committed recycler&#146; households in England has increased by 3.9 million, unnecessary food waste has been reduced by more than 100,000 tonnes and almost two million compost bins have been sold through the home composting programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="81009w0008.htm_para5"><a name="08100960000730">It is only possible to express expenditure by financial year, and the following figures therefore relate to the two financial years between April 2007 and March 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="81009w0008.htm_para6"><a name="08100960000731">During 2007-08, expenditure on external public relations agencies was &#163;3.1 million, representing 4.3 per cent. of WRAP&#146;s budget for that year. In the current financial year (2008-09), the planned expenditure in this area is &#163;2.9 million, representing 5 per cent. of the overall budget for the year. It should be noted that WRAP&#146;s 2008-09 budget is significantly lower than the budget for 2007-08, which is why the expenditure on PR agencies in 2008-09, although lower than the figure for 2007-08, represents a higher proportion of this year&#146;s budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="81009w0008.htm_para7"><a name="08100960000732">The firms employed to support WRAP over this period who are currently on the roster are 3 Monkeys, Ptarmigan, Tri-Media Harrison Cowley, Camargue, Bray Leino PR, and Fishburn Hedges. Firms no longer on the roster are Pelican PR, Lawton PR, Grayling, Proteus PR, Consolidated PR, and Kinross and Render.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="81009w0008.htm_para8"><a name="08100960000733">During this period WRAP commissioned one piece of external public affairs support. Now completed, this six-month project was to engage public policy makers and opinion formers from outside WRAP&#146;s established stakeholder groups to discuss a range of developing resource efficiency issues on which WRAP is working. Chelgate Ltd was engaged at a cost of &#163;25,000.</p>

 Places of public religious worship were traditionally zero rated, and therefore by default were not charged for surface water drainage under the rateable value system of charging.</p>

The guidance stated that those making similar demands on a service should be charged on the same basis. It also made clear that where premises impose customer-related costs in line with or lower than those of typical households, they should be able to benefit from tariffs which reflect their small demand on the water system. It also stated that the phasing in of any large, sudden changes in charges should be considered.</p>

Advice has also been issued on handling affected plots to speed up the decomposition of the grass in the manure. For example rotavating or digging over affected plots a number of times and ensuring the manure is turned readily. Providing this advice is followed, the risk to next year's crops should be low.</p>

 It is recognised that manure may become contaminated by aminopyralid following the approved use of products which contain this substance. The labels of such products therefore include conditions regarding the use of manure, to avoid damage to other crops. That other crops appear to have been damaged by manure contaminated with aminopyralid indicates that these conditions may not have been observed in all cases. The Pesticides Safety Directorate suspended authorisations for the sale, supply and use of aminopyralid products from 23 July 2008, while it carries out further investigations into this problem.</p>

 We are maintaining very good completion rates for first degrees with the latest statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showing that the UK ranks 3rd of the 27 countries reporting data in this area.

HEFCE held regional workshops last spring to examine these issues and they are joint funding seven projects with the Paul Hamlyn Foundation over the next three years to inform better targeting of institutional support for students.</p>

 New academies are eligible for two types of start-up grants. Start-up grant (a) is for books, materials and equipment. It is based on the expected pupil capacity of the academy and most of the  total grant is paid in the first year after opening, although smaller amounts are payable in later years if pupil numbers are initially below 90 per cent. of capacity. Its value depends on whether there is a predecessor school and whether the academy has a sixth form. The average awarded to academies opening in 2008/09 was &#163;873,601.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="81009w0020.htm_para6"><a name="08100960002759">Start-up (b) grant is paid for two main purposes: to cover senior management overhead costs while an academy is building to capacity, and to meet transitional costs, for instance those arising while building work makes some facilities unusable, or meeting curriculum commitments for students of predecessor schools. It is mostly paid in the first two or three years after opening but will continue for longer if an academy has no predecessor. Because the grant (which is partly formulaic and partly assessed from bids) depends on the circumstances of each academy, the amounts awarded vary considerably. For academies opening in 2008/09, the average awarded has been &#163;969,104 (the median was &#163;780,335, with sums ranging from &#163;122,740 to &#163;3,203,252).</p>

 Eligibility for the education maintenance allowance (EMA) is based on household income. The Department for Children, Schools and Families does not hold information on household income for every eligible 16 to 18-year-old who participates in a course that meets the EMA valid provision criteria. Therefore it is not possible to calculate the number of students who were entitled to EMA in each local authority area, or what percentage of students took up their entitlement.</p>

 The Primary Framework for literacy and mathematics offers access to a broad range of guidance and resources to support teachers in planning and ensuring their teaching is personalised to the needs of every child. In addition to this we have established the Every Child a Writer and Every Child Counts programmes. Our Children&#146;s Plan commitment is to ensure each programme reaches every local authority by 2010/11, and alongside Every Child a Reader we will invest &#163;169 million in ensuring every child masters the basics. All local authorities and schools must have regard to the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice which provides advice on their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for pupils&#146; special educational needs.</p>

 The most recent Children in Need (CIN) census showed that approximately 120,000 children aged less than 11 years received services from social care in England during a census week in February 2005. This equates to approximately 2 per cent. of all children aged less than 11 years in England.</p>

 Schools do not have to apply to the Department for Children, School and Families to become a trust or foundation school. A change of school category to foundation and the acquisition of a trust are &#145;prescribed alterations&#146;. To make such a prescribed alteration, the governing body must publish statutory proposals in accordance with provisions set out in the Education and Inspections Act 2006 and regulations made under that Act. Since 25 May 2007, proposals are decided by the governing body (or the schools adjudicator where proposals to acquire a trust have been referred by the local authority).

 No formal assessment of the effectiveness of the Community Investment Tax Relief (CITR) scheme has been made.

 Social enterprises are not defined by particular legal forms. Rather, they are defined by their nature: their social/environmental aims and outcomes; the basis on which their social mission is embedded in their structure and governance; and the way they use the profits they generate through trading. Social enterprises are not, therefore, required to register with any one body. Information on the number of registered social enterprises in any particular area is consequently not available.</p>
