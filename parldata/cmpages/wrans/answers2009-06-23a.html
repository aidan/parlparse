To enable this strategy, it is planning to move OPG business progressively out of London in order to meet its customers&#146; needs on a more efficient, effective and sustainable footing in the medium to long term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="90623w0001.htm_para11"><a name="090623100000150">The correct categorisation and allocation, balancing security issues and the needs of the prisoner, helps prisoners to use their sentences constructively, to tackle their offending behaviour and to prepare for their eventual release. All prisoners must be placed in the lowest security category consistent with the needs of security and control and the need to protect the public. Prisoners of a higher security category would not, as a matter of course, be held in an establishment of a lower category. The only exceptions to this will be where prisoners are re-categorised, and then await a move to a different establishment.</p>

 The most relevant measure on referral orders is reoffending rates. Data on reoffending rates for 2007, the most recent year figures are available, show that the proportion of juveniles that reoffended following a referral order was 40.5 per cent. The frequency rate of reoffending shows that these offenders committed an average of 117.6 offences per 100 offenders. These are the lowest reoffending rates of all juvenile court imposed sentences.</p>

 The provision of services to victims of domestic violence is a local issue; local decision makers are best placed to assess local needs. The majority of services are delivered through local providers who are supported and funded by local bodies, such as local councils and health organisations.

The Government are funding a Men's Advice Line (0808 801 0327) which has been specifically set up to support male victims of domestic violence.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 11 June 2009]:</i><i> </i>The Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) (1 April 2008-31 March 2011) is the third three-year cycle of the supplier obligation which began on 1 April 2002 (then known as the Energy Efficiency Commitment). This policy places a carbon saving obligation on the main household gas and electricity suppliers. Suppliers are obligated to achieve a percentage of their carbon saving target (this is at least 40 per cent. in CERT) in a priority group of low income and elderly households. The priority group includes all households with a person aged 70 and over. We do not have powers to oblige suppliers to report their expenditure. However, through independent studies commissioned for cost benefit purposes, we estimate that 60 per cent. of suppliers&#146; expenditure goes to the priority group. We estimate that over the nine years of the obligation, some &#163;2.7 billion will be invested by suppliers in meeting their priority group obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_453"><a name="90623w0005.htm_para6"><a name="090623100000527">The Warm Front is the Government&#146;s main scheme for tackling fuel poverty and was instituted in 2000. The Scheme has spent in excess of &#163;2 billion on a range of energy efficiency measures including insulation and central heating. Since 2005, over half of the scheme&#146;s total budget has been spent on assisting those over the age of 60. The table shows the breakdown of spending in each year for this phase of the scheme. Figures for the last scheme year (2008-09) are not yet available. It is worth noting that in the 2007-08 scheme year alone, over &#163;37 million of the total was spent on helping those over the age of 81.</p>

1. Figures for carbon dioxide include the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry sector (LULUCF), but exclude emissions from UK Overseas Territories.<br>
2. The Kyoto basket total differs slightly from sum of individual pollutants above as the basket uses a narrower definition for the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry sector (LULUCF), and includes emissions from UK Overseas Territories.<br>
3. The entire time series is revised each year to take account of methodological improvements in the UK emissions inventory.<br>
4. Emissions are presented as carbon dioxide equivalent in line with international reporting and carbon trading. To convert Carbon dioxide into carbon equivalents, divide figures by 44/12.<br>
 5. Figures shown do not include any adjustment for the effect of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EUETS), which was introduced in 2005.<br>

The Department for Transport operates a programme of ramp checks to ensure that ICAO standards are being adhered to and we are currently increasing our number of annual checks to some 1,000 in 2009-10. Where foreign aircraft are found to fall short of ICAO standards, we will take action to ensure that they remedy the deficiencies, up to and including removing their permission to fly here. We will also refer such airlines to the European Union's Air Safety Committee, which has the power to impose a Europe-wide ban.</p>

 It is already our clear policy to do so.

Information is provided directly to the media through dedicated services such as the Highways Agency&#146;s website&#151;Traffic England&#151;which carries comprehensive and up-to-date information, and the agency now operates its own DAB radio service&#151;Traffic Radio&#151;giving continuously updated news and information about the network.

 The April 2009 Budget confirmed levels of UK official development assistance originally laid out in the comprehensive spending review of 2007. The Department for International Development&#146;s (DFID) expenditure in Africa is now projected to be &#163;3.4 billion in 2010-11. This ensures that the UK will deliver on its commitments to Africa made at Gleneagles in 2005.</p>

 According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) there are 83 international NGOs and UN agencies working in Darfur. 13 NGOs were expelled on 4 and 5 March 2009. The UK Government have repeatedly called on the Government of Sudan (GoS) to allow all expelled NGOs to return.</p>

GoS has committed to filling medium-term gaps in life-saving sectors such as health and water and sanitation.

 Over the period 2002-03, 2007-08 the Department for International Development (DFID) has more than doubled bilateral support to education in fragile states. In 2007 DFID outlined further plans for increasing support to education for children affected by conflict or living in fragile states. This 2007 announcement by Gordon Brown included commitments to provide financial support for education in specific conflict and post-conflict states. Significant progress gas been made in these countries. In Afghanistan DFID has contributed &#163;60 million to the Afghanistan reconstruction trust fund that meets the costs of 100,000 teachers. DFID's total contributions in Afghanistan to date have helped increase the number of pupils in school from two million in 2002 to over 5.4 million. In Somalia, DFID's is supporting to date some 18,500 boys and girls in school through partnerships with UNICEF and non governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>

 Zimbabwe's social and economic decline has forced many Zimbabweans to leave the country during the last few years.

<i> Guide to Quality:</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV - for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5% we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>
<i> Key Coefficient of Variation (CV) (%) Statistical Robustness</i><br>
* 0 = CV&lt;5 Estimates are considered precise<br>
** 5 = CV &lt;10 Estimates are considered reasonably precise<br>
*** 10 = CV &lt;20 Estimates are considered acceptable<br>
**** CV 20 Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes<br>
<i> Note:</i><br>
It should be noted that the above estimates exclude people in most types of communal establishment (e.g. hotels, boarding houses, hostels mobile home sites etc.)<br>

 Statutory codes of practice on communications data, covert surveillance and covert human intelligence sources are made under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers 2000. These require each public authority to have arrangements in place for the handling, storage and destruction of material.

1. Data are unrounded.<br>
2. Care should be taken in interpreting time-series data; changes to Jobcentre Plus vacancy handling procedures have led to a major discontinuity in the vacancy statistics pre and post May 2006.<br>
3. These are not whole economy figures. Coverage relates just to vacancies notified to Jobcentre Plus and as such represent a market share of vacancies throughout the whole economy. This proportion varies over time according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer and by the local area. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>
4. Notified vacancies: monthly data on the inflow of newly notified vacancies to Jobcentre Plus.<br>
5. The stocks of live unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies) and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br>

We have also taken action to prevent unsuitable people from working with children by strengthening requirements for CRB checks in education and establishing the Independent Safeguarding Authority, and we are introducing a new, tougher vetting and barring scheme under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006. We have introduced statutory Child Death Review processes, a world first, so that local safeguarding children boards and their partners look across all child deaths in the local area, with the aim of reducing preventable child deaths and we have invested &#163;30 million in the expansion and modernisation of the NSPCC&#146;s helpline services.</p>

All of these programmes build on the significant investment committed to other wider prevention programmes which make a contribution to preventing young people&#146;s involvement in criminal activity in deprived areas. Key examples of this are the work done to help young people take part in structured positive activities and to improve facilities in deprived areas through the Positive Activities for Young People and Myplace programmes and additional parenting support such as the Parenting Early Intervention Programme, Family Intervention Projects and expert parenting practitioners.</p>

 The UK entered the global economic crisis with low public debt, which has given the flexibility to allow debt to rise in the short-term to support the economy. In the current environment of economic uncertainty, the Government's approach is to ensure that debt is on a downwards path in the medium term. The Budget set out plans that are consistent with debt falling as a share of GDP by 2015-16, in line with the temporary fiscal operating rule.</p>

 Since 1997, the Government&#146;s savings strategy has focused on developing better incentives for saving, ensuring people have the capability to make the right savings decisions for them, and that they have access to appropriate savings opportunities. To support this strategy, the Government have introduced a range of incentives to save, including ISAs. ISAs are extremely popular and are held by over 18 million people. The tax relief given through ISAs amounted to an estimated &#163;2.4 billion in 2007-08.</p>

To provide additional support, Budget 2009 announced a package of measures to support pensioners who receive income from savings. From October 2009 the annual ISA investment limits will rise for people aged 50 and over to &#163;10,200, of which up to &#163;5,100 can be held in cash. In November 2009 the capital disregard in pension credit and pensioner-related housing and council tax benefit will increase, meaning the first &#163;10,000 of capital will not be included when calculating someone&#146;s entitlement for these income-related benefits. Budget 2009 also announced a new &#147;tax back&#148; campaign to contact pension credit recipients to encourage them to claim back tax they may have overpaid on their savings income and, where possible, register to receive interest on their savings tax-free in future.</p>

The consultation document also seeks views on whether environmental criteria other than &#147;inertness&#148; should be taken into account when deciding whether a waste might be lower rated. It identified used foundry sand as a waste that would cease to be lower rated if inertness were the only criterion.

 The Department does not itself directly take steps to match demand for social rented housing in local authorities.

This has already delivered &#163;1.296 million of funding in 2008-09 for two schemes in Tamworth for rent and low cost home ownership.</p>

The funding, announced in the 2009 budget, will allow councils to bid to deliver up to 900 new homes, building on their own land. Homes will be for social rent, built to high environmental standards. The first bidding round for this is currently under way and successful bidders will be announced in September. Tamworth could submit a bid for their funding if they so wished.</p>

 The United Kingdom medical work force is moving towards greater self-sufficiency as the increase in medical school places produces more UK trained doctors year on year. The medical profession is internationally mobile and the number of non-UK trained doctors finding employment in the UK will vary by specialty and geography, reflecting service demands and the flows of UK doctors. The Department has worked with the UK Borders Agency to ensure a number of routes are available through the points based system to allow the national health service to recruit the doctors it needs. This includes recruitment through the tier 5 medical training initiative.</p>

 The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), within their guidance, recommends that a registered nurse, midwife or specialist community public health nurse in advising, treating and caring for patients/clients, has professional indemnity insurance. This is in the interests of clients, patients and registrants in the event of claims and professional negligence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_680"><a name="90623w0030.htm_para2"><a name="090623115003407">While employers have vicarious liability for the negligent acts and/or omissions of their employees, such cover does not normally extend to activities undertaken outside the registrant's employment. Independent practice would not be covered by vicarious liability. It is the individual registrant's responsibility to establish their insurance status and take appropriate action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_681"><a name="90623w0030.htm_para3"><a name="090623115003408">In situations where an employer does not have vicarious liability, the NMC recommends that registrants obtain adequate professional indemnity insurance. If unable to secure professional indemnity insurance, a registrant will need to demonstrate that all their clients/patients are fully informed of this fact and the implications this might have in the event of a claim for professional negligence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_682"><a name="90623w0030.htm_para4"><a name="090623115003409">Although such standards are not binding, registrants breaching them risk being sanctioned under their regulator's fitness to practise procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_683"><a name="90623w0030.htm_para5"><a name="090623115003410">The NMC have also been working closely with the Department, Devolved Administrations, employers, Trades Unions and patient representatives on draft proposals, which would require compulsory indemnity as a condition of registration. However, following concerns expressed by nursing and midwifery unions, the former Secretary of State has recently announced a review of policy on indemnity insurance. The NMC have been advised the proposals have been put on hold pending the outcome of the review.</p>

 Hydrolysed animal proteins, such as from beef or pork, can legally be used as ingredients to retain added water in meat products and preparations.

 No estimate has been made because there is a lot of uncertainty as to what tariff and non-tariff barriers UK exporters to the EU would face if the UK were not a member. It is likely that even the UK was not a member, it would have some preferential access to EU markets, but this could be in several forms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_707"><a name="90623w0032.htm_para1"><a name="0906246000093">In the extreme or worst case scenario UK businesses could be forced to pay the most favoured nation tariff (the tariff applied to countries with no preferential access) to export to the EU. Higher tariff and non tariff barriers in this scenario would decrease the competitiveness of UK exports in the EU, and therefore would likely reduce the volume of trade taking place&#151;meaning a greater loss of jobs and business opportunities for UK companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_708"><a name="90623w0032.htm_para2"><a name="0906246000094">The UK would therefore have the incentive to enter some sort of free trade agreement with the EU. Such agreements remove tariffs for the majority of goods but vary greatly in the extent to which they remove non-tariff barriers. These include differences in regulations (health and safety regulations for example) which make exporting to the EU more costly. They vary also greatly in the extent to which they cover other areas of great economic importance like trade in services, investment, intellectual property matters, migration, competition issues as well as public procurement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_709"><a name="90623w0032.htm_para3"><a name="0906246000095">In the best case scenario, the UK would still enjoy full access to the single market like the members of the European free trade area. That would mean however that it would have to take on board all EU regulations  <br>

 My noble Friend the Minister for Trade, Investment and Business visited Jerusalem and Ramallah on 20 May 2009, sharing ideas on boosting bilateral trade and economic links with Palestine's Minister for National Economy, the Governor of the Palestine Monetary Authority and senior members of the Palestinian business community. UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) has worked closely with the Palestine-Britain Business Council since its launch in December 2008, and continues to provide a range of support services to British companies through teams based in both the UK and the British Consulate General in Jerusalem. Follow-up to December 2008's London Business Forum on Trade and Investment with Palestine includes a visit by Google to the West Bank in March 2009 to explore the potential for IT development and to give two training courses for Palestinians working in the ICT industry.  <br>

 It is important for the sale of any Government asset to provide value for money for the tax payer. This applies to the sale of any stake in Royal Mail as much as any other transaction.</p>

 The exact percentage required to cement a partnership for Royal Mail is a matter for negotiation with any partner. The Department believes a 30 per cent. stake would ensure that a partner has the right incentive to take forward the modernisation of the business and to align their interests with those of Government.</p>
