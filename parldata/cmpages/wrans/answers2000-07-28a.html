 The first UK drugs strategy "Tackling Drugs Together" was launched in May 1995 and allocated &#163;8.8 million over three years to Drug Action Teams, &#163;5.9 million on schools drug education for 1995-96, and &#163;1 million in the same year for services for young people at an early stage of drug misuse.

<a name="00728w01.html_para0">The Government's Comprehensive Spending Review 1998 estimated drug related spending across the UK to be in the region of &#163;1.4 billion per annum, over &#163;1 billion of which was spent on law enforcement measures.
<P>

<a name="00728w01.html_para1">Under the present strategy, "Tackling Drugs To Build A Better Britain", the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review settlement provided an additional &#163;217 million of resources over three years, as follows:

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what is the effect of the outcome of Spending Review 2000 on funding for the United Kingdom Anti- drugs Strategy; and if she will make a statement.  [133800]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w01.html_spnew4"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 The Chancellor last week announced, as a result of Spending Review 2000, increased funding over the next three years to support the delivery of the Government's challenging targets for tackling drug misuse. This means that expenditure targeted at the causes of drug misuse will increase from some &#163;700 million in 2000-01 to &#163;870 million in 2001-02, &#163;931 million in 2002-03 and &#163;996 million in 2003-04. This funding will enable the Government to secure implementation of the plans and targets developed from the recommendations of the cross-departmental review of action against illegal drugs, led by myself and the UK Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator.
<P>

<a name="00728w01.html_para9">This increased investment will be centred around treatment and prevention and will allow us to underpin the initiatives outlined in the Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator's second Annual Plan, which is published today. These include measures such as funding increased provision of drug treatment to underpin the work of the new National Treatment Agency and increasing provision of treatment for drug misusing offenders. We will also continue to support work with our international partners to reduce the availability of drugs, as outlined by the Prime Minister at the recent G8 conference. The UK law enforcement and intelligence agencies will work closely with their counterparts in the key drug producing and transit countries, seeking to tackle drugs trafficking as close to source as possible and disrupt the international flows of money which support the drugs trade.
<P>

<a name="00728w01.html_para10">These plans will make a major contribution to addressing the Government's wider agenda of tackling crime, social exclusion and ill health and will help drive down the huge costs to society caused by drugs.




<P>
<P><I>28 Jul 2000 : Column: 905W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00728w01.html_para11">The National Plan preserves the balance of objectives across all the four aims of our Strategy; helping young people to avoid drug misuse through education, protecting communities from drug-related anti-social and criminal behaviour, enabling people to receive treatment for drugs problems as well as reducing the availability of illegal drugs.

<P>

<a name="00728w01.html_para14">From 1 April 1998 the Department started to use the Central Office of Information's News Distribution Service to issue press releases directly and quickly to fax machines. While the system is considerably faster and more efficient it is also more expensive. Prior to this system press releases were issued by post and the costs were met centrally within the Department.
<P>

<a name="00728w01.html_para15">The costs of producing a press notice are not recorded separately and are part of the routine duties of departmental press officers.

 The introduction of the SMART Procurement Initiative (SPI) and the formation of Integrated Project Teams (IPTs) across the Ministry of Defence has changed the strategic conduct of the Ministry of Defence's procurement business. We have decided that the Agency in its current form is not consistent with the far-reaching changes demanded by SPI. Accordingly DCTA is to be reorganised along IPT lines and will cease to be a Defence Agency on 1 October 2000. The Planned collocation of staff at the Caversfield site will continue and should be completed in March 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress has been made on the MR TRIGAT Anti-Tank Guided Weapon programme; and if he will make a statement.  [133931]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The UK signed the Memorandum of Understanding for the Industrialisation and Production phase of MR TRIGAT in June 1999 in the expectation that we would shortly proceed to contract and maintain the programme to deliver a modern Anti-tank Guided Weapon capability by 2005 (when stocks of the existing MILAN system start to run down).
<P>

<a name="00728w04.html_para0">Regrettably, MOU signature by all five participating nations has still not been achieved. Some 12 months after our MOU commitment we are no nearer to contract placement than we were then. This additional delay, to a programme that is already 10 years behind its original schedule, and the additional risk and uncertainty it creates is unacceptable. The UK's priority has to be to deliver the capability and equipment needed by our armed forces in an acceptable timescale.
<P>

<a name="00728w04.html_para1">I have therefore decided that the UK should withdraw from the MR TRIGAT Industrialisation and Production programme and will pursue an alternative national procurement of an Anti-tank Guided Weapon system. We plan to use an Invitation to Tender in the next few weeks for the supply of commercially available systems to meet the requirements of our Infantry Light Forces by 2005. In parallel, we are reviewing our requirements for an Anti-tank capability for mechanised and armoured Infantry units prior to determining whether these too could be met by similar commercially available systems. Our initial assessment is that the alternative systems now available will be in many ways more capable than MR TRIGAT and offer significant financial savings.
<P>

<a name="00728w04.html_para2">I recognise that this decision will be a disappointment to our partners and to those areas of UK Industry that had 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jul 2000 : Column: 914W</I><P>
expected to benefit from MR TRIGAT. The UK remains committed to the principles of European collaboration provided it is in the UK's best interests. Regrettably it was not possible to proceed on this basis with MR TRIGAT, but there are a range of other programmes on which we remain engaged to good effect with our European partners.

 The UK currently contributes some 3,300 personnel to KFOR. We have maintained that flexibility and capability are the keys to successful operations in the Balkans.

They checked criminal legal aid applications made in respect of defendants, including Kenneth Noye, at the central criminal court over the past year. They have reported to the Permanent Secretary at the Lord Chancellor's Department, in his capacity as Accounting Officer. The auditors found that the proper procedures for granting legal aid were not followed in this case. As a result, additional training, checking and controls are being introduced across the court Service to ensure that the correct procedures for the granting of legal aid by the Crown court are followed.

<a name="00728w06.html_para7">Leakage rates were subsequently updated for the hydrofluorocarbon emissions estimates published in the draft Climate Change Programme, March 2000.

Copies of the report have been placed in the Library. However the proportion of hydrofluorocarbons used to <i>(a)</i> replenish existing systems and <i>(b)</i> as original charges is not explicitly provided in the report and could not be collated without incurring disproportionate cost.

<a name="00728w06.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government's policy for reducing emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) is set out in the draft climate change programme. We recognise that HFCs are necessary replacements for ozone-depleting substances in some applications. However, we are concerned that emissions from these sources are forecast to grow strongly in the near future as ozone-depleting substances are phased out. This trend is unsustainable in the longer-term and action needs to be taken to limit the projected growth in emissions. We are sending a clear signal to industry and users to look closely at all alternatives and to select those that are more environmentally acceptable where they do exist. Safety, technical feasibility and cost effectiveness should be taken into account before investment decisions are taken.
<P>

<a name="00728w06.html_para9">We are exploring with industry how the voluntary agreements on HFCs might be strengthened to reduce the projected growth in emissions. Emissions from industrial processes have already been substantially reduced and will continue to be regulated under the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regime.

 The 1976 Act originally implemented the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in the UK.

The 1984 legislation was then itself replaced by revised EC Regulations which came into force on 1 June 1997.

<a name="00728w07.html_wqn10"><B> Mrs. Gilroy: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the impact which VAT on bridge tolls will have in respect of new and current businesses which use the Tamar Bridge and the development of integrated transport facilities between Cornwall and Plymouth.  [133095]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w07.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 A judgment of the European Court, on whether or not toll charges should attract VAT, is expected in September. The impact of a judgment that required VAT to be charged would, in the first instance, be for the local authorities of Cornwall and Plymouth to assess, since they own and operate the Tamar Bridge and are responsible for the development of the local transport and commercial infrastructures.

 Our 10-year strategy for transport, "Transport 2010--The Ten Year Plan", has been published and sets out proposals for dealing with road noise, including the provision of quieter surfaces on over 60 per cent. of the network, including all concrete surfaces.

[133463]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 As announced in March in our road safety strategy "Tomorrow's roads--Safer for Everyone", we propose to abolish that rule in the context of improved training arrangements. Learner riders will have to hold a training certificate, and these certificates will have a two year validity period after issue.




<P>
<P><I>28 Jul 2000 : Column: 934W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00728w09.html_para5">Most learner riders pass their test within six months, and we want to encourage learner riders to reach test standard within a reasonable period. But we think a further training requirement for anybody who has not passed a test within two years is preferable to a one year disqualification, during which riding skills are likely to decline rather than improve. We hope to bring these new arrangements into force around the end of the year.

 Data are not collected centrally in the precise form requested. Available information on households accommodated under statutory homelessness provisions in England is published in a quarterly Information Bulletin, "Statistics of local authority activities under the homelessness legislation: England". Table 3 of the Bulletin presents a summary of those households accepted as unintentionally homeless and in priority need under the homelessness provisions of the 1985 and 1996 Housing Acts, identifying which category was most crucial in determining priority need. Cases where domestic violence was the exclusive reason are identified separately, but further cases may also exist where, for example, the presence of dependent children was the crucial determining factor. Table 4 further summarises acceptances by reason for loss of the household's last settled home and the category "Violent breakdown of relationship" will include all instances where domestic violence was the cause of homelessness. In both tables, cases involving racial harassment or violence are not separately distinguished, but would be reported under "Other".

The Housing Green Paper, "Quality and Choice; A decent home for all", sets out the Government's proposals for reform of homelessness legislation. As part of these proposals we will consider the introduction of arrangements to monitor reviews of homelessness decisions made by local authorities, and will consider responses to the Green Paper before deciding whether to develop this further.

<a name="00728w09.html_para9">The Department has commissioned research on local authority policy and practice on allocations, transfers and homelessness. The research will provide information on how local authorities apply the homelessness legislation, and look at definitions of the vulnerability dimension of priority need. This will include victims of violence and abuse; racial harassment; people with mental health problems; 16 and 17-year-olds and people leaving care. The research will also look at outcomes of allocation schemes for different groups such as homeless acceptances.

Inner London Boroughs have a discretionary power to provide allotments. Section 8 of the Allotments Act 1925 requires local authorities to obtain the Secretary of State's consent for the sale or appropriation of statutory allotments. Consent can be granted only where adequate alternative provision is made for any affected plot holders, and the number of people on any waiting list is taken into account when making this decision.

 I refer to my earlier answer, <i>Official Report,</i> column 937W, given today. Advertising is an option within developing effective choice based systems. We will shortly be inviting expressions of interest from local authorities in bidding to develop schemes which achieve our aims of choice. These pilots will look at how extra support can be given to those who may need it, such as those whose first language is not English, those with mental health problems, and those who are hospitalised.

<a name="00728w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 There are no plans to introduce a performance target on meeting housing need--which I understand to mean here the need for affordable housing. While the Government have from time to time commissioned studies of the extent and nature of housing need to inform their views on the need for affordable housing in England, they believe that neither national or regional estimates can adequately reflect the diversity of needs and priorities which exist at the local level. For these reasons the Government believe that local authorities are best placed to carry out robust assessment of housing need in their areas.

 Following our recent Spending Review, we are providing nearly &#163;1 billion extra for investment in affordable housing through the Approved Development Programme over the four years 2000-01 to 2003-04.

 The Code of Guidance on Parts VI and VII of the Housing Act 1996 applies only to local authorities. Following the transfer of their housing stock, local authorities must continue to keep a register of applicants seeking social housing in their area and continue to have obligations towards homeless households under Part VI and Part VII of the Housing Act 1996. To ensure that they have access to accommodation to enable them to discharge their housing functions, they generally negotiate nomination rights of between 50 per cent. and 75 per cent. of the transferred stock with the transfer landlord. RSLs are regulated by the Housing Corporation which has the power, under s.36 of the Housing Act 1996, to issue guidance with respect to the management of housing, including the allocation of housing.

Summary statistics of such incidents are published annually in HSE's Pesticide Incidents Report. I have asked officials to compile a table listing, for each year since 1995-96, the pesticide active ingredients involved in such incidents, the number of people concerned, and whether or not the Panel assessed the case as having a confirmed or likely link with pesticide exposure.

<a name="00728w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The objective of the evaluations is to test the null hypothesis that there are no significant differences between the biodiversity associated with the management of genetically modified herbicide tolerant crops and comparable non-GM crops at the farm scale. In practice, the variation in biodiversity can not be recorded for all species. The approach is to compare key indicators of biodiversity between the GM HT and non-GM HT cropping systems. In reporting these effects, they will be placed into the context of national recording schemes that can help to show the relationships between the biodiversity associated with the study sites and arable areas in general.

<P>
<a name="00728w14.html_wqn6"><B> Ms Buck: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) if he will place in the Library the ward level data on ranks and scores for the Index of Deprivation 1999, already given to individual authorities, in <i>(a)</i> hard copy and <i>(b)</i> electronic format;  [132892]
<P>
<UL>(2) when a full underlying data set for the Index of Deprivation 1999 will be made available.  [132893]

<P>
<a name="00728w14.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 For the last 18 months, my Department has undertaken a review of the 1998 Index of Local Deprivation. The technical side of the review has been carried out by a team from the University of Oxford led by Dr. Mike Noble and has included four public consultations. I am very grateful to Dr. Noble and his colleagues for their hard and excellent work.
<P>

<a name="00728w14.html_para4">There has been considerable interest in the review and quite rightly so, because the Index is one of the main instruments used to allocate resources to the most disadvantaged communities. The review process has taken a long time. This has been necessary if only because the numerous detailed responses received during the consultations have meant that the Oxford team needed to examine and test what were very technical suggestions. I will shortly be issuing a paper that responds to all of the technical points that were raised.
<P>

<a name="00728w14.html_para5">I shall also be publishing the indices, that is the scores and ranks at the ward level which is available for each domain of deprivation and the district level measures.
<P>

<a name="00728w14.html_para6">Hard copies of the technical paper and the summary which will include the scores and rankings on the district level measures will be placed in the Library of the House along with a CD-ROM containing all of the ward and district scores and rankings. The summary report will provide details of where to obtain, subject to any confidentiality constraints, the underlying raw data.
<P>

<a name="00728w14.html_para7">However, the indices are not a definitive instrument and will need to be revised when further substantial small area data streams become available and could be incorporated into the indices. For example, while the review of the Index has been going on, the Social Exclusion Unit's Policy Action Team (PAT) 18 on Better Information has reported. This report of PAT 18 recognised that its recommendations for increasing the availability and coverage of small area data would be useful for the Indices in the longer term. One of its key outputs would be a national ward-level data set which would include as much as possible of the data on which the Indices scores and rankings are based. In the longer term the 2001 Census data will also be relevant. We will also be looking at the way social housing conditions could be incorporated into the indices.
<P>

<a name="00728w14.html_para8">In the meantime, the Government have decided to use the new indices rather than the old Index of Deprivation as the primary but not the sole basis for the allocation of resources for deprived areas. This will not rule out the possibility of other areas being offered regeneration assistance. However, I fully realise that whenever a change of this kind is made, there is the risk that authorities that would have benefited on the old basis for allocations might not do so under the new one. We therefore intend to set up transitional arrangements that make allowances for authorities that had been among the most deprived areas on the old Index and are not among the most deprived areas on the new indices. We will also be considering how areas that have pockets of deprivation can be eligible for help. We will be detailing these transitional arrangements when we publish any proposals for allocating resources that make use of the new indices.

[132850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Each chapter of "Tomorrow's Roads--Safer for Everyone", copies of which are in the Library, includes an "implementation timetable" which tabulates all the proposed actions and shows which ones will require primary legislation. The timetable also indicates whether each action will be implemented "now" or "in the next 2-3 years" or whether it is a "longer term intention". We are still developing a more detailed implementation plan.

<a name="00728w15.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Wigley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many bridges there are in England on recognised public highways; how many of these were strengthened to current standards by 31 December 1999; and what is the estimated cost of strengthening the remainder of these bridges to the new standard of weight which will come into force next year.  [133122]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 There are some 60,900 bridges in England on roads maintainable at the public expense. 8,500 are on trunk roads and 52,400 on local roads.
<P>

<a name="00728w15.html_para0">EC Directive 85/3/EC requires the United Kingdom to allow the use on principal routes of vehicles of 40 tonnes weight with 11.5 tonne axle loads from 1 January 1999. Of those bridges requiring to be strengthened to take these vehicles, some 4,450 were strengthened by the end of March this year. We estimate that about 3,400 remain to be strengthened, at a cost of some &#163;800 million.
<P>

<a name="00728w15.html_para1">Consultation will take place soon on whether to allow 44 tonne vehicles, subject to certain technical constraints. Any decision would depend upon the results of that consultation. These 44 tonne vehicles would not require extra bridge strengthening above that necessary for the 40 tonne vehicles already permitted.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what regulations govern the clamping of vehicles; and who monitors local practice by those agents responsible for this.  [133224]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Under the Vehicle Excise Duty (Immobilisation, Removal and Disposal of Vehicles) Regulations 1997, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency has powers to clamp road-going vehicles that are unlicensed and on a public road to enforce the payment of vehicle excise duty. Under the Refuse Disposal (Amenity) Act 1978, the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 and the Road Traffic Act 1991, local authorities have powers to remove unlicensed vehicles abandoned on a public road or to clamp licensed vehicles which are unlawfully parked on a public road. In all these circumstances the operation of clamping is closely regulated, with a right of appeal and a maximum release fee specified by the Secretary of State.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For the year 1999-2000 planning inspectors decided 12,411 planning appeals in England. Of these 4,485 were allowed and 7,926 dismissed. To date, 84 decisions have been the subject of a legal challenge and of these 17 have been withdrawn. In a further 11 cases we have accepted that the decision contained an error in law and the appeals are being reconsidered. 11 cases have been heard in court and we wee successful in resisting all but one challenge.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how many colonial and overseas pensioner schemes are still in existence; how many British residents are <i>(a)</i> current or <i>(b)</i> potential beneficiaries of such schemes; and what steps she is taking to align benefits with comparable domestic public sector schemes.  [133293]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 There are 104 colonial pension schemes still in existence. Some 26,700 pensioners currently receive benefits under the differing provisions of those

schemes, of whom 17,214 reside in the UK. There is no record of how many British residents are potential beneficiaries.
<P>

<a name="00728w16.html_para0">The colonial pension arrangements are unique, and cannot be compared with those of domestic public sector schemes. The Government therefore have no plans to bring them into line.

 As my right hon.

We have not received any specific requests to help with legislative aspects; but we would be ready to consider these, should they be made.

 The Pakistan Government has embarked upon a very ambitious timetable for local elections and has requested Britain's assistance in this process. A DFID Senior Governance Adviser is visiting Pakistan at present to formulate detailed proposals for possible support by this Department for preparations for these elections and electoral reform more generally.

 In 1998-99, the latest year for which complete figures are available, DFID's total bilateral expenditure on projects and programmes was &#163;1,176 million 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jul 2000 : Column: 960W</I><P>
and total bilateral expenditure on HIV/AIDS was &#163;43 million. This sum excludes multilateral contributions to organisations such as Joint United Nations Programme in HIV/AIDS(UNAIDS) and United Nations Population Find (UNFPA), support to vaccine research and development initiatives, and funding of projects costing less than &#163;100,000. Thus some 4 per cent. of total bilateral expenditure was spent on HIV/AIDS related projects. We will forward the 1999-2000 figures to the Library of the House as soon as they have been prepared.
<P>

<a name="00728w16.html_para1">The total number of active bilateral projects for 1999-2000 was 1,832 of which 194 were related to HIV/AIDS projects. Thus some 10 per cent. of projects supported by the Department are related to HIV/AIDS. These figures do not include projects containing elements of HIV/AIDS work which are deemed too small to be reported or activities costing less than &#163;100,000.

 We have been supporting work on disability for a long time. The issues paper "Disability, Poverty and Development", has put this work on a more strategic footing. Published earlier this year (February 2000), it has been circulated to all our offices and will be an influence in the future development of country programmes. It recognises the importance of ensuring the full inclusion of people with disabilities in the fight against poverty. To achieve such an aim, we do not view disability equality checklists as the most appropriate tools, and will not be requiring their use.

Additionally there are many initiatives at country level which either specifically target the needs of disabled people or incorporate their concern in wider development projects.

<a name="00728w17.html_para4">So far nine countries have reached their decision point, of which eight owed money to the UK. For these countries all payments to the UK Government have already ceased. In total the debt relief to these countries afforded by the HIPC initiative and the Government's 100 per cent. debt relief policy will add up to &#163;241 million.

If they did the total amount that the UK Government would be writing off for these 20 countries would be &#163;659 million. The total due for payment between 2000 and 2003 depends entirely on how quickly countries reach decision point, and hence how many benefit from the UK's policy of 100 per cent. debt relief.

<P>
<a name="00728w20.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Blizzard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the incidence of tuberculosis among homeless and poorly housed people.  [130728]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w20.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Certain parts of the community--certain ethnic minority populations including immigrants from areas with a high prevalence for tuberculosis, older white people who were exposed to TB when they were younger, homeless people and HIV infected individuals--are at an increased risk from TB.
<P>

<a name="00728w20.html_para3">Information on tuberculosis rates in homeless people, along with recommendations for prevention and control, is contained in the June 1996 report of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Tuberculosis entitled "Tuberculosis and Homeless People, A review and recommendations for health professionals, local authorities and voluntary and support groups". Copies are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00728w20.html_para4">The Department has also funded The Passage Day and Nightshelter for the homeless to write a project on TB control and prevention, which we hope will be available soon. The aims of the report are to improve identification and cure rates for TB in homeless people and to develop 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jul 2000 : Column: 980W</I><P>
a proactive education and awareness programme of TB aimed at homeless individuals and voluntary sector workers and volunteers.
<P>

<a name="00728w20.html_para5">Information on the incidence of tuberculosis among poorly housed people is not collected.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w20.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Gibson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he has plans to restore TB vaccination.  [132428]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w20.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) the vaccine used to protect against tuberculosis has been and is still used to protect those most at risk from TB such as health service and veterinary staff, contacts of people known to be suffering from active pulmonary TB, immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of TB and their children and infants wherever born, including this country. However, due to severe manufacturing problems encountered by the sole United Kingdom licensed source, Celltech Medeva, routine immunisation of 10 to 14-year-olds was suspended nationally in September 1999.
<P>

<a name="00728w20.html_para6">The Department did try to obtain UK licensed and batch released BCG vaccine from elsewhere before suspending the schools BCG immunisation programme. However, only Celltech Medeva vaccine meets these requirements at present. The Department has identified 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jul 2000 : Column: 981W</I><P>
other manufacturers of BCG vaccine worldwide and is investigating these possible sources together with experts from the National Institutes for Biological Standards and Control, the Medicines Control Agency and NHS Purchasing Supply Agency. Products from different manufacturers vary in their composition and side effect profile, and we will need to be assured of the safety and efficacy of these products and that they satisfy current UK requirements.
<P>

<a name="00728w20.html_para7">Suspending the schools programme has allowed us to maintain supplies of the vaccine for all those at a higher risk of TB mentioned above. However we have remained committed to restarting the schools programme as soon as sufficient supplies of the vaccine were available. On 19 July 2000, the Department announced that there is now sufficient supply of vaccine to restart the routine schools programme initially in the London area, where the highest rate of TB in the country currently occurs. We hope to announce, by the end of the summer, when we will have enough vaccine to start the schools programme again in the rest of the country. Copies of the Department's press release of 19 July are available in the Library.

 None, because there is currently no proposal before the European Union Council of Ministers to alter the EU legislation on meat inspection charges. However, my right hon.

A medicinal product may contain some ingredients which would not, if sold separately without making medicinal claims, be classified as medicinal products. It may also contain ingredients which are herbal remedies and would, if sold separately and subject to certain conditions, be classified as medicinal

 We announced yesterday in the National Plan for the National Health Service that, in addition to extending routine invitations to women aged 65 to 70 within the NHS breast screening programme, the current service will also be upgraded by offering two view mammography at all screening rounds leading to an estimated improvement of some 40 per cent. in detection rates.

 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2000]:</i> The evidence on the relationship between sodium consumption and blood pressure was considered by the Government's advisory committee, the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy in its 1994 report entitled "Nutritional Aspects of Cardiovascular Disease." COMA concluded that sodium intake appears to be an important determinant of blood pressure in the population as a whole at least partly by influencing the rise of blood pressure with age. A diet lower in common salt, which is a major source of sodium, and higher in potassium would be 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jul 2000 : Column: 993W</I><P>
expected to result in lower blood pressure and a smaller rise in blood pressure with age. COMA recommended a reduction in the average intake of common salt by the adult population from the current level of about nine grams per day to six grams per day.
<P>

<a name="00728w24.html_para0">Recognising that there are differences of opinion in this area, a workshop was organised at the Department's request by the Faculty of Public Health Medicine (FPHM) in collaboration with the British Heart Foundation in December 1997 to consider the issues surrounding salt consumption and its effect on blood pressure and subsequent cardiovascular disease. The workshop endorsed COMA's advice, concluding that salt intake was one of a number of dietary and other lifestyle factors influencing blood pressure and that reducing salt intake would be an appropriate public health measure. We do not intend to review the evidence at this stage and therefore will not be accepting the offer of the Salt Manufactures Association.

 <i>[holding answer 27 July 2000]:</i> The launch of the Department's Osteoporosis Strategy in June 1998 provided evidence-based clinical guidelines for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. These should provide the basis for health authorities wishing to develop their own strategies. It is for local health authorities to decide what services to provide taking into account resources available and the needs of the local population.

<a name="00728w24.html_para4">Some 30 per cent. of each annual intake is made up of in-service professionals from nursing and other clinical or health-related backgrounds.

In the last round of recruitment, 18 per cent. of the applicants were in-service: 30 per cent. of those awarded places on the Scheme were in-service. There would therefore appear to be some advantage in having service experience, regardless of graduate background. Although applications are accepted from holders of an appropriate HND qualification, no such applicants have been successful in the last three years.

 <i>[holding answer 27 July 2000]:</i> The Department collects information on cochlear implant operations by the hospital episode statistics (HES) system. HES contains details of patients admitted to, and treated in NHS hospitals in England. More detailed information about extra-contractual referrals, long term service agreements and out of area treatments is collected locally. Guidance in Health Service Circular 1998/198 and Health Service Circular 1999/244 set out arrangements for commissioning specialised services through service agreements. These new arrangements for specialised services require National Health Service trusts and commissioners to draw up service agreements with agreed levels of activity and funding. By March 2001, there should be no cochlear implant operations funded as out of area treatments (OATs) because OATs are primarily intended to cover situations where a patient requires emergency treatment away from home.

 The number of recorded child and adult registrations in the General Dental Service (GDS) in the North Yorkshire Health Authority area is shown in the table at 31 March in each of the years 1993 to 2000. Data for March 1991 and 1992 are not comparable because registration numbers were building up following the introduction of the new dental contract in October 1990.
<P>

<a name="00728w25.html_para11">Changes in administration procedures by the Dental Practice Board throughout the period, in particular improvements in the removal of duplicate registrations, have acted to reduce recorded registration numbers.

<P>

<a name="00728w27.html_para1">It makes a number of very valuable recommendations that will assist the Prison Service to focus more clearly on the outcomes it will need to achieve.

There are also important recommendations covering closer co-operation with the probation service and with neighbouring prison services.

 There are no plans for an independent review of the provisions. However, under section 126 of the Terrorism Act the Government are required to lay a report on the working of the Act before both Houses of Parliament at least every 12 months. The report will be completed by an independent reviewer. Part VII of the Terrorism Act contains temporary measures for Northern Ireland only including the Diplock court system provisions. All these powers are subject to annual review and renewal by affirmative order taking account of the Government's overall objective, under the Belfast Agreement, to remove the powers as soon as it is safe to do so.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Information on economic activity at parliamentary constituency level can be derived on an annual basis from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), which is National Statistics' main source of labour market data on individuals. The latest estimates cover the year from March 1998 to February 1999. These show that the employment rate in 274 our of 659 constituencies was lower than in the year from March 1997 in February 1998. In 238 constituencies the rate was lower than in the year from March 1996 to February 1997, the earliest period for which estimates are available.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>National Statistics' preferred measure of unemployment is the International Labour Organisation (ILO) unemployment rate, derived from the LFS. As with any sample survey LFS estimates are subject to sampling variability. The smaller the estimate, the larger the variability relative to the size of the estimate. Unfortunately analyses of unemployment at parliamentary constituency level only provide reliable estimates for a small proportion of constituencies. So it is not possible from the LFS to provide a total of those constituencies where both employment and unemployment have fallen.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>People aged 16 or over are classed as in employment by the LFS if they have done at least one hour of paid work (as an employee or self-employed) in the week prior to their LFS interview or if they have a job that they are temporarily away from. People who do unpaid work in a family business and people on Government- supported training and employment programmes are also included according to the International Labour Organisation convention.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer in which year he expects to be able to judge that the trend rate of growth had increased from 2.5 per cent by 2004; how the Inland Revenue will judge total compliance costs to business; how compliance costs are defined in his document entitled "Prudent for a Purpose", Cm 4807; and if he will make a statement.

 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2000]:</i> The total amount received from HIPCs in 1996-97 was &#163;29.4 million. Under the UK's policy of 100 per cent. debt forgiveness once countries have reached decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, they can immediately stop making payments on all their debts outstanding to the UK Government.
<P>

<a name="00728w34.html_para1">So far nine countries have reached their decision point, of which eight owed money to the UK. For these countries all payments to the UK Government have already ceased. In total the debt relief to these countries afforded by the HIPC initiative and the Government's 100 per cent. debt relief policy will add up to &#163;241 million.
<P>

<a name="00728w34.html_para2">A further 11 countries are expected to reach decision point by the end of 2000. If they did the total amount that the UK Government would be writing off for these 20 countries would be &#163;659 million. The total payments due for payment in 2000-01 depends entirely on how quickly countries reach decision point, and hence how many benefit from the UK's policy of 100 per cent. debt relief.
<P>

<a name="00728w34.html_para3">Under the enhanced HIPC initiative, debt relief is tied much more closely to poverty reduction. Countries are developing national poverty reduction strategies as part of their qualification for debt relief. Countries will examine causes of poverty and opportunities for tackling it. The Poverty Reduction Strategy of an individual country will often identify primary healthcare and HIV/AIDS as priority areas for government action and increased resources. But many competing claims for additional resources, and it is up to the governments of the HIPC countries themselves to decide how to balance these, in discussion with key stakeholders.

 The latest available data show that infant classes had been reduced to 30 or below in 24 of the 27 relevant schools in the constituency. Since 1997, 840 five, six and seven-year-olds have benefited from the Government's infant class size initiative. In January 2000, as few as 3.4 per cent. of the relevant age group remained in an infant class of 31 or over. The Government is well on target to deliver its infant class size pledge. Some &#163;620 million is available to support the pledge, and allocations so far to Telford and Wrekin LEA amount to some &#163;1.8 million. This has helped to reduce the size of the average infant class in The Wrekin to 24.7. The figure in January 1997 was 27.2

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many <i>(a)</i> full-time and <i>(b)</i> part-time nursery places there were in the Suffolk Local Education Authority area in (i) 1996-97, (ii) 1997-98, (iii) 1998-99 and (iv) 1999-2000 for (A) three-year-olds, (B) four-year- olds and (C) all children aged under five years.  [130521]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w39.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 The available information on the numbers of under fives in Suffolk Local Education Authority area who are in some form of early years education is shown in the following tables. Table 1 gives the number of children in early years education places in Suffolk Local Education Authority area from 1997 to 2000.
<P>

<a name="00728w39.html_para13">Since September 1999, we have invested substantially in the creation of new, free early education places for three-year-olds. During 1999-2000 funding, via the Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships, was focused on 65 authorities based on social need. From summer 2000 this extra funding will also be available in Suffolk and the other remaining LEAs. Table 2 shows 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jul 2000 : Column: 1048W</I><P>
current estimates of the number of new funded places of three-year-olds being created in all sectors in Suffolk for summer 2000, autumn 2000 and spring 2001.
<P>

<a name="00728w39.html_para14">Currently, all eligible four-year-old children in England are now in some form of early education, including 16 per cent. in private and voluntary places. Funding is provided through the early years partnerships for LEA, voluntary and private provision. In England, there are now 120,000 more free places for three and four-year-olds compared with 1997.

 <i>[holding answer 20 July 2000]:</i> A number of indices are used by the Department to measure social deprivation in local education authorities: the proportion of children in one parent families; the proportion of children of Income Support and Job Seeker's Allowance claimants; the numbers of conceptions per 1,000 girls aged 15 to 17; and the Index of Local Deprivation. The last of these is used to distribute funding to enable the creation of new early education places for three-year-olds. As part of the Government's expansion of three-year-old provision, in 2000-01 Somerset was given an initial allocation of &#163;130,000 to enable it to create 112 new free places. The authority has also bid for a number of further places which have been funded in full. It can now provide up to 250 new free places for each of the autumn 2000 and spring 2001 terms.

Our publicity strategy is to raise awareness of the whole range of support available to disabled people and their employers from our disability services.

<P>
<a name="00728w40.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what the percentage change was between January 1997 and January 2000 in the number of pupils in classes taught by one teacher with 31 or more pupils in <i>(a)</i> primary and <i>(b)</i> secondary schools.  [131679]<P>

<a name="00728w40.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The number of pupils in primary classes of 31 or more pupils taught by one teacher in January 2000 was 1,072,000 (26.5 per cent.) compared with 1,344,000 (33.4) in January 1997. The number of pupils in secondary classes of 31 or more pupils taught by one teacher in January 2000 was 334,200 (11 per cent.) compared with 245,400 (9 per cent.) in January 1997. This reflects a general upward trend that dates back to 1991 when the figure was 6.4 per cent. However, 90 per cent. of secondary pupils are still being taught in classes of 30 or below.
<P>

<a name="00728w40.html_para1">The average size of secondary classes in January 2000 was 22.0, and the pupil-teacher ratio was 17.1. In the Budget earlier this year, secondary headteachers received between &#163;30,000 and &#163;50,000 each to spend as they choose. If they spent it on teachers, they could reduce the secondary pupil:teacher ration by 0.4.
<P>

<a name="00728w40.html_para2">In the meantime, the number of pupils in infant classes over 30 pupils has already fallen by 300,000 and the Government are well on target to deliver their infant class size pledge. Some &#163;620 million is available to support the pledge. In addition the average class size in maintained primary schools went down for the second year running--from 27.5 in January 1999 to 27.1 in January 2000, after rising for the previous 10 years. The average size of junior classes also fell, from 28.4 in January 1999 to 28.3 in January 2000.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Employment Service aims to make a major contribution to an efficient and flexible labour market and to the Government's objectives of high and stable employment growth, equality of opportunity and social inclusion. ES works closely with employers and with its private, voluntary and public sector partners to provide a quality service for all people without a job and to promote employment opportunities for all who can work. It aims to attract a diverse range of vacancies and to fill those vacancies quickly by matching the right people and skills with the right jobs. Its chief priority is to help individuals facing particular difficulty in the labour market to move from welfare and economic inactivity into sustainable employment. It does this through correct application of the Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) regime, delivery of the New Deals and the pilot ONE service, and provision of appropriate information, advice, training and support. The Agency has achieved much over the past three years. The challenge and opportunity now facing it is to sustain continuous improvement in its services to jobseekers and employers and to make those services more accessible and relevant to customer needs, through effective use of modern technology and close working with a wide range of partners.</FONT></UL>

 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2000]:</i> Comprehensive information on whether young people left their options having completed them or before having done so is not collected in that form. The New Deal aims to help unemployed people to move as quickly as possible from welfare into a job. Many young people will leave their New Deal options before completing them because they have found jobs in the regular labour market and are no longer unemployed. Young people do not therefore need to complete their New Deal options in order to succeed in the programme.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Winter Fuel Payments (WFP) were introduced in the winter of 1997/98. For the winters of 1997/98 and 98/99 eligible people receiving Income Support (IS) or income based Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA (IB)) which included a pensioner premium, who were not living in residential care or a nursing home received payments of &#163;50. All other eligible pensioners received &#163;20 or &#163;10 depending on their household circumstances. Where only one eligible pensioner lived in the household they would receive &#163;20, otherwise they would receive &#163;10 each. Last winter, 1999/00 the amount of the payment increased to &#163;100 for all eligible households.</FONT></UL>

 Last winter (1999-2000) 16,715 clients in the Mid Worcestershire constituency and 15,040 in the Worcester constituency, qualified for Winter Fuel Payment of either &#163;100 or &#163;50, dependant on their circumstances. This figure includes those in receipt of one of the qualifying benefits as well as men from age 60 who qualified through receipt of either Income Support or income-based Jobseekers' Allowance.

 No part of the British Indian Ocean Territory, including Diego Garcia, has been leased to the United States and no rent or similar payment is made in respect of their right to use the territory for defence purposes. However, in 1965 when it became clear that the costs of setting up the territory as a separate dependency would exceed original estimates, the US Government agreed to contribute &#163;5 million towards these costs.

<a name="00728w46.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 An initial study to consider the possibility of settlement on the outer islands only of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) has already been undertaken. It was funded by the Government of the BIOT. The funding of future stages is yet to be decided.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps Her Majesty's Government are taking to monitor the environment of the British Indian Ocean Territory on a regular basis following its commitment to treat the area with no less strict regard for natural heritage considerations than for places nominated as World Heritage sites.  [133457]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w46.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Government of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), who made this commitment, employs a Conservation Consultant who makes annual visits to the territory to assess the state of the environment and report to the Commissioner. The last such visit was in March 2000. The BIOT Government also employs fisheries consultants who likewise assess the state of the fishery. Additionally, it sponsors ad hoc environmental research projects.

 After consultations with the Home Office, I can announce that we are unable to proceed with the scheme for the present.
<P>

<a name="00728w47.html_para1">Developmental work on detailed proposals for the pilot study has identified a number of difficult practical issues. In particular, moves toward a more flexible approach to the operation of the immigration control--including the introduction of new IT systems for issuing visas at posts overseas--have frustrated attempts to design a simple and effective scheme for providing a bond facility for visitors, and for recording their entry to and departure from the UK.
<P>

<a name="00728w47.html_para2">The planned pilot study in Manila and Casablanca will therefore not proceed.

<P>
<a name="00728w47.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We are in regular contact with our friends and allies about all aspects of Pakistan. We are aware of inter-community violence, including sectarian attacks, and regularly raise the position of religious minorities in discussions with Pakistani authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w47.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We are deeply concerned about the position of women in Pakistan, particularly the practice of "honour killings". We have joined our EU partners in condemning the practice, and, in that context, we welcome General Musharraf's announcement condemning "honour killings" as pre-meditated murder and establishing the Commission on the Status of Women. We have urged the Pakistani authorities to implement the 1995 Beijing Platform and the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). We continue to monitor the situation closely.

[133363]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w47.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Cross-cutting Review on Nuclear Problems in the Former Soviet Union proposed a new expenditure programme which will subsume all existing UK efforts in this field. This programme will take the form of a ring-fenced fund within the Department of Trade and Industry's Departmental Expenditure Limit. Overall priorities for the programme will be set on the advice of an interdepartmental committee. DTI will have responsibility for ensuring that this money is spent properly, and for day to day management of this new programme.
<P>

<a name="00728w47.html_para3">The review identified the management and disposition of weapons-grade plutonium surplus to military requirements as a key priority for the UK.

 The Government have decided to introduce a control on individual "bracelet" cuffs having an internal perimeter when fully locked in excess of 165mm and shackles (i.e. including handcuffs) made therewith. This will be made by an amendment to the Export of Goods (Control) Order. Companies wishing to export such equipment will need to apply to the Department of Trade for an export licence. Such applications will be judged on a case by case basis against the national criteria and those in the EU Code of Conduct.

 The UK has consistently called on Iraq to end the suffering of the relatives of the 605 Kuwaitis and others missing since the Gulf War. The UK plays an active role in the Tripartite Commission process, chaired by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which seeks to account for the whereabouts of the missing. The process has been hampered, however, by continued Iraqi obstruction and since early 1999 Iraq has refused to attend Commission meetings. At the latest Consultation Meeting in Geneva on 21 June 2000, the UK delegation stress the urgent need for Iraq to return to the process. The UK has also sought to give added impetus to the process through Security Council resolution 1284 which provided for a high-level UN co-ordinator on this issue. I offered our full support to Mr. Yuli Vorontsov, who has taken up this post, which he called on me on 29 June.

 It is unlawful for employers to dismiss employees in connection with a transfer within the meaning of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 (TUPE), unless the reason for doing so is an economic, technical or organisational reason entailing changes in the workforce. It is similarly unlawful for employers to change employees' terms and conditions of employment in connection with a TUPE transfer. The Government have made clear in the Cabinet Office Statement of Practice "Staff Transfers in the Public Sector" its policy that all transfers from the public sector to the private should be conducted on the basis that TUPE applies unless there are genuinely exceptional reasons for it not to do so.

 The Government have taken a number of steps to strengthen the process of risk assessment at the licensing stage and continue to consider ways of further improving procedures in this area. We rigorously assess export licence applications to determine the risk of the proposed export being misused in contravention of our national export licensing criteria and those in the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, including for internal repression or international aggression, or through diversion or re-export to undesirable end-users.
<P>

<a name="00728w50.html_para3">The DTI's Export Control Organisation (ECO) introduced a new computerised database in 1999 which has increased consistency in the assessment of licence applications and reduces the risk of errors. Further enhancements to this system are planned over the next two years. ECO has also increased the number of senior managers with oversight of the licensing process, and applications to export goods to destinations where there may be risk of diversion are considered with particular care. Applications are refused if it is assessed that an unacceptable risk of diversion exists.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made no orders to date using section 8 of the Electronic Communications Act 2000. It is likely that orders will be made to enable companies to file information electronically at Companies House, and in respect of the Petroleum Act 1998, in order to allow the electronic submission of information by oil companies and consequent electronic delivery of consents and approvals by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="00728w51.html_para2">DTI remains committed to removing barriers to the effective use of electronic communications and will consider making such orders in appropriate cases.

 I am pleased to confirm that the study has now been completed and I have today placed in the Library of the House a paper containing detailed information on past withdrawals of nuclear material from safeguards. The paper includes tabulated data which show advance notifications of such withdrawals made pursuant to the UK/Euratom/IAEA safeguards agreement, broken down by year, material type and quantity, along with information on the reason for withdrawal. This information represents the outcome of the study of data on withdrawals from safeguards prior to announcement of the outcome of the Strategic Defence Review (SDR). Information is also included on withdrawals which have taken place since the SDR announcement in July 1998 and shows that such withdrawals have comprised only small quantities of material for use in instrument calibration or radiation detectors or as analytical tracers or radiological shielding. Information on future withdrawals will be made available on an annual basis.

 Mr. Graham attended a spirometry testing appointment in October.

 Further to the reply I gave to the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) on 28 June 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 518W about the review of the National Weights and Measures Laboratory, Ministers have now considered the reviewer's report. The reviewer has recommended that the policy part of NWML should be taken back into the Department organisationally and that the operational part should be contractorised by merger with the National Physical Laboratory, which is already contractorised. However, he accepted the view of the Review Steering Board that this option should not be pursued until a business plan for the merger could be prepared and until Ministers had assessed its value for money and feasibility. Ministers recognise that the recommended course of action has disadvantages as well as advantages. Nothing will be decided until further studies are complete. The reviewer's report will be published shortly. A copy will be placed in the Library of the House and on the Department's internet website.

<P>
<a name="00728w52.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Tamar Bridge is owned and operated jointly by Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. It would be for them, in the first instance, to make such an assessment in setting toll charges. This Department has supported the Government's vigorous defence of its policy of not levying VAT on toll charges, in the proceedings before the European Court of Justice.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what proportion of bills were paid on time by Government Departments and their Agencies during the financial year 1999-2000.  [133786]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w52.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that there has been a further improvement in the payment performance of central Government as a whole. The overall payment performance shows that 97.8 per cent. of suppliers' bills were paid on time and Departments are making good progress towards meeting the 100 per cent. target set for this financial year.
<P>

<a name="00728w52.html_para2">There is no room for complacency. It is particularly important that the public sector sets an example to business and is seen to pay its bills on time. I am disappointed to see that a number of Departments and Agencies failed to meet this year's target of 100 per cent. I have taken steps to remind all Departments and Agencies of the importance of paying suppliers' bills on time and meeting the target.
<P>

<a name="00728w52.html_para3">I am particularly disappointed at my own Department's failure to meet the target. It is unacceptable that the Department which has overall responsibility for the Government's policy on prompt payment should itself fail to meet the target. My officials are introducing new measures designed to ensure that the DTI meets the target as soon as possible next year.
<P>

<a name="00728w52.html_para4">The Government are committed to improving the UK's payment culture. Late payment is a serious problem, particularly for small businesses. Not knowing when customers' bills will be paid means uncertain cashflow, increased borrowings, higher costs and reduced profits.

So far as implementation periods are concerned, we aim where possible to give at least three months' notice of entry into force, in line with the Government's response to the Better Regulation Task Force's report "Helping Small Firms Cope with Regulation--Exemptions and Other Approaches".

<P>
<a name="00728w53.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Under the Network Code, if the major public gas transporter, Transco, is responsible for an interruption of gas supply to domestic gas consumers, it compensates domestic households at a standard rate of &#163;20 per day if the interruption exceeds 24 hours. If, as in this case, the gas supply is interrupted because of damage to the gas main caused by a third party, Transco declares force majeure, which means it is under no obligation to pay compensation. If the third party refuses to accept liability, consumers are obliged to wait until any legal dispute between Transco and that company has been resolved. It is for the company concerned to consider whether, while liability is being established, it should itself make an ex gratia, interim payment to residents. Where residents have suffered loss or damage as a result of an interruption to supply, it is also open to them to seek payment from their own insurers.

 The Spending Review 2000 settlement will enable the Department to provide the highest-ever levels of public support for sport and the arts, as well as a financial boost for the Department's other sectors. The key funding priorities will be nurturing talent, supporting excellence and creating opportunities for more people than ever before--especially children--to enjoy and participate in culture and sport. The arts and many other cultural activities are devolved topics and so the Department does not generally fund activities in those areas within the Devolved Administrations. Where money is allocated to UK-wide bodies, three-year funding agreements between the Department and each body will help ensure that the interests of all parts of the UK are taken into account in the use of resources.

 Some historic seaside piers have been protected by listed building legislation. Otherwise the development of seaside piers is largely a matter for the owners subject, of course, to the requirements of the law.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimate his Department has made of the badger populations in each of the three sites in the triplet areas which form part of the MAFF bovine TB trials.  [131761]<P>

<a name="00728w58.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2000]:</i> The number and distribution of badger setts is surveyed across all three treatment areas within a triplet, but area-wide population estimates are made only in proactive culling areas. This

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimate he has made of the cost of compensating beef farmers for consequential losses due to restrictions placed on their herds as a result of TB outbreaks.  [131808]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 28 July 2000]:</i> MAFF has commissioned an independent study of the consequential losses to cattle farms resulting from outbreaks of bovine TB. The study was presented to the TB Forum on 13 July and comments were invited. I am placing copies of the study in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w58.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2000]:</i> MAFF will provide compensation in the form of interest to farmers who received late payment of their 1995 claims under the Arable Area Payments Scheme for the reasons highlighted in the report referred to by the hon. Member. As agreed with the Ombudsman, and in line with common practice across Government Departments, the compensation payments will be subject to a de minimis level of &#163;50. MAFF has a full list of all the AAPS applicants that were affected, and work is in progress to calculate the compensation to which they are entitled. When that work has been completed the applicants will be notified of the amount of compensation to which they are due. There is no need for individual farmers to apply to the Ministry for payment.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will give details of the information measures relating to the Common Agricultural Policy referred to on page 50 of Cm 4762; and if he will make a statement.  [130832]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w58.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The European Commission's proposals to co-finance information projects aimed at improving the understanding, development and implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy were considered at the Special Committee for Agriculture in November 1999, and adopted by the Agriculture Council on 17 April 2000 as an A point (Council Regulation (EC) No. 814/2000).
<P>

<a name="00728w58.html_para9">A wide range of organisations representing farming, environmental and consumer interests are eligible to apply for funding for such measures as talks, seminars, information visits, publications and participation in international events.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many cases of pig products being sold in a way which misleads the consumer into believing they contain pigmeat of British origin have been identified by the verification officer in the last three years; and how many staff are employed to assist the officer in fulfilling his duties.  [130752]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w58.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Out of the number of labels examined, the verification officer has brought to the attention either of the retailer or the manufacturer concerned over 20 cases considered to be misleading. In most cases the product has been withdrawn or the label altered. Staff resources have not limited his activities as Trading Standards Officers have statutory authority to pursue individuals cases where appropriate.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in respect of implementation of the Burns report and banning hunting with hounds, what estimate he has made of the cost of disposing of fallen and other stock.  [129126]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w59.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 July 2000]:</i> A small and limited survey, carried out by MAFF, suggested that in 1999 around 40 per cent. of calves, 32 per cent. of adult bovines and 15 per cent. of sheep were disposed of to hunt kennels. No estimate has been made of the cost to the livestock industry of using outlets other than hunt kennels to dispose of carcases. However, the safe disposal of fallen stock in an important issue and officials will continue to liaise with the livestock and disposal industries to examine the best approaches to this issue.

 <i>[holding answer 25 July 2000]:</i> Decisions on whether to publish the results of all research projects, and whether to place a copy in the House of Commons Library, are taken on a case-by-case basis, as some reports may contain, for example, commercially confidential information. Some of the market research projects commissioned by this Ministry since May 1997 are therefore already held in the Library. Copies of the publicly available research projects may be provided on request and a summary of these will be placed in the Library.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will list the amount of agrimonetary compensation for which farmers were eligible in each year since 1979 in <i>(a)</i> Scotland, <i>(b)</i> the UK and <i>(c)</i> Dumfries and Galloway region, broken down by farming sector; and how much was paid.  [127695]<P>

<P>
<a name="00728w59.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Agrimonetary compensation has been available since 1993. Until the introduction of the euro, it was triggered when national currency strengthened against the ECU sufficiently to outweigh the effects of previous devaluations (an appreciable revaluation). The UK first became eligible following appreciable revaluations in 1997. Compensation was also made available following the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999, and in 2000 following exchange rate fluctuations.

<a name="00728w59.html_para0">Figures for compensation are available on a member state basis and cannot be broken down except at disproportionate cost. Compensation paid between 1997 and to the end of June 2000 in <i>(a), (b)</i> and <i>(c)</i> is set out in the tables.

Many of the regulations have been time limited and routine such as those related to the setting of annual TACs and quotas and EU agreements with third countries or have concerned supplementary measures or amendments to basic regulations dealing with matters such as technical conservation, marketing and control.
<P>

<a name="00728w60.html_para0">Additionally more than 30 Statutory Instruments have been introduced primarily concerned with the enforcement of regulations or the closure of UK fisheries once quota allocations have been taken. This is normal practice where fisheries measures are likely to have a material impact on industry costs a regulatory impact assessment is prepared by the Ministry and placed in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w60.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 July 2000]:</i> There are currently some 460,000 tonnes of Over-30-Months scheme meat and bonemeal (MBM) in store at 15 sites in the UK; two in Devon, two in Lincolnshire, one on Merseyside, three in Lancashire, one in Cheshire, two in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland. There are 10,000 tonnes of Selective Cull Scheme MBM at one site in Shropshire.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in what conditions meat and bonemeal from cattle is being stored; and whether such storage is <i>(a)</i> in containers and <i>(b)</i> open in warehouses.  [133154]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w60.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 July 2000]:</i> Meat and bonemeal (MBM) produced from the rendering of carcases of cattle slaughtered under the Over-30-Month and Selective Cull schemes is stored in bulk heaps in warehouses. The storage is carried out safely and securely in compliance with waste management licensing legislation enforced by the Environment Agency, and its equivalent in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w60.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Grieve: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for how long it is expected that meat and bonemeal from cattle will have to be stored pending its intended disposal through incineration; and when it is expected that all such material will have been incinerated.  [133155]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w60.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 July 2000]:</i> The Intervention Board has a target in its Service Delivery Agreement with the Treasury to incinerate 60 per cent. of Over-30-Months (OTMS) and Selective Cull Scheme meat and bonemeal (MBM) produced by March 2002. Recent forecasts indicate that the number of cattle entering the OTMS in future years, and the amount of MBM which will be produced as a result, will be greater 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jul 2000 : Column: 1128W</I><P>
than previously expected. Nevertheless, MBM stocks are expected to be at very low levels by March 2004, after which MBM will be incinerated as it is produced.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w60.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Grieve: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the practicability of disposing of meat and bonemeal from cattle by mixing it with lime and cement and depositing it in landfill sites.  [133153]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w60.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 July 2000]:</i> The Government have made no assessment of the practicability of this method of disposal of meat-and-bonemeal (MBM). Commission Regulation 716/96, under which the over-30-months scheme (OTMS) operates, requires these cattle to be directly incinerated or rendered and destroyed. Incineration with energy recovery remains the method of destruction preferred by both Government and the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee. The Intervention Board which operates the scheme has signed contracts with three companies for large-scale incineration facilities (subject to the companies obtaining the necessary consents) and these are expected to reduce stocks of OTMS MBM to very low levels by March 2004.

<a name="00728w60.html_para2">We have received no proposals to merge the role of Official Veterinary Surgeons (OVSs) and meat inspectors in overseeing the slaughtering of animals. The Food Standards Agency advises me, however, that the Report of the Meat Industry Red Tape Working Group (the Pooley Report) recommended that discussions should be held with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons about the feasibility of providing appropriate training to enable non veterinarians to carry out some work done by OVSs. These have taken place and it has been concluded that further consideration should be postponed until the future arrangements for meat inspection under the Commission's recent food hygiene proposal are clearer. The Pooley Report also recommended that where economically beneficial to the plant (mainly small, isolated premises), the OVS should undertake the post mortem inspection of carcases. This has been implemented.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. FWPS claims--Under certain circumstances, FWPS agreement holders may count some or all of their FWPS land towards their AAPS set aside requirement. The AAPS set aside payment rate (to which the FWPS payment is 'linked' in these cases) fell below the FWPS rate for the first time in 1999, and the associated payments had to be restricted. Problems/delays were encountered both by the Information Technology Division in amending the payment system, and also by the RSCs in identifying the agreements/land involved. Regrettably, this resulted in a significant number of Charter failures.<P>

2. FWPS applications--The FWPS is one of a number of measures which were notified under the new EC Rural Development Regulation (RDR), which took effect on 1 January 2000. The majority of 'failures' reported relate to applications submitted on or after that date, which cannot be approved until the England Rural Development Plan (ERDP) has received Commission approval.<P>

3. The high failure rate for Agricultural Wages Inspections arose primarily because of difficulties at one RSC where most of the complaints were sent for investigation during a short period when the wages inspectors' time was already fully taken up carrying out IACS Arable Area Payments Scheme inspections needing urgent completion to protect the Department from EC disallowance.<P>

4. The relatively high failure rates for the ESA Scheme were due primarily to the introduction of new and complex EC Regulations, uneven workloads and staffing difficulties.<P>

5. The number of claims processed for the Farm and Capital Grant Scheme 1991 is insignificant compared to most other schemes. Staffing problems at the two RSCs with the largest number of claims has distorted an otherwise excellent success rate.<P>

6. The 80 per cent. response rate to complaints is explained by the fact that often cases require referral to HQ or the National Scheme Management Centres and thus take longer than 10 days to resolve. In all cases where the deadline was not met, a holding letter was issued to the complainant detailing the reason for delay.<P>

7. The total percentage has been calculated by setting the entire number of applications or claims cleared within the target time, against the total number received. Applications and claims not cleared due to reasons beyond our control (incorrect information supplied by applicant, etc.) are not included as failures to meet target.<P>

8. The Farm Conservation Grant Schemes 1989 Claims and Pilot NSA Claims have been omitted from the table since these schemes are now closed.<P>

9. Forty four complaints were referred to the MAFF Adjudicator during the year. Ten of these were upheld and four were partly upheld. Twenty seven were not upheld. Three cases were dealt with outside of the Citizen's Charter.<P>

 The separation distances currently applied for GM crops are set out in guidelines issued by the industry group SCIMAC (the Supply Chain Initiative on Modified Agricultural Crops). These reflect existing knowledge and experience in the production of certified seed, and they specify various distances according to the crop species and whether the conventional crop is for seed, organic or ordinary production.

 A rigorous assessment of applications for new GM plants is undertaken by the Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs, including any implications for animals. There is no evidence that the introduction of the current generation of GM crops into animal feedingstuffs has caused any harm to farm animals. My Department is not currently funding research in this area, but the need for research will be kept under review.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if, in his review of separation distances, he will take account of Advanta's statement concerning the distance between their GM rape seed crop and their conventional rape seed crop which was contaminated.  [132653]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w62.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 July 2000]:</i> The review will consider all the relevant information which is available on the Advanta incident. But no conclusion can be drawn yet on how Advanta's conventional seed came to include a low level of GM seed. The Canadian authorities are still investigating this.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w62.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) what steps the Government have taken to identify which farms have been contaminated with GM products through the planting of oil seed rape;  [123763]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to ensure that there is proper monitoring of crops contaminated with GM products through the planting of oil seed rape.  [123765]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="00728w62.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 June 2000]:</i> The Government has written to all farmers who may have sown the affected seed varieties giving details of the relevant arrangements which have been made under the EU Arable Area Payments Scheme and warning them that it would be an offence to market crops grown from the affected seed lots. Government inspectors are auditing the arrangements put in place by Advanta Seeds (UK) Ltd. to identify the affected farmers and compensate them for the losses associated with crop destruction. We have also alerted processors of oilseed rape to the need to ensure that the affected crops are not marketed and do not enter the food chain.

 The issuing of fixed penalties for cycling offences is an operational matter for individual chief officers of police. Data from Essex have now been received and show that 76 fixed penalty notices were issued for cycling on the pavement in the period August to December 1999. I have no plans to call for reports in this instance from Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Humberside and Gwent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w63.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The newspaper article in the <i>News of the World</i> was regrettable. It may undermine the valuable work done by the police and probation services in monitoring the activities of sex offenders in the community.
<P>

<a name="00728w63.html_para0">We do not know how many offenders have left, or may leave, their homes or are in the process of changing their identities, or will do so in anticipation of the newspaper identifying them. Such moves add to police work.
<P>

<a name="00728w63.html_para1">I understand from inquiries my officials have made, that the police are currently putting their resources into monitoring, supporting or protecting identified sex offenders and their families, and in at least one case, to handling an attack on an innocent man and women.
<P>

<a name="00728w63.html_para2">I am sure that forces will keep under review whether they need to put further resources into this area.

<a name="00728w63.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I have asked a representative of the Starting Price Executive to meet me in September to discuss public concerns. I am also hoping to meet a representative of the Betting Office Licensees Association. I am maintaining a keen interest in the progress being made on the review of the impact of recent changes to the arrangements for establishing starting prices.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what arrangements are in place within the police for encouraging graduate recruits to the Management Training Scheme.  [132929]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w63.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 July 2000]:</i> The police service is one of the largest employers of graduates: figures from Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary indicate that over 500 graduate entrants were appointed as police officers in 1998-99. There is also a national accelerated promotion scheme for graduates (APSG) which offers accelerated promotion and management development opportunities for those who have the potential to rise to the highest ranks within the service.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many and what proportion of police officers in each rank are from minority ethnic communities in each force and in total <i>(a)</i> now and <i>(b)</i> in the two previous years; how many additional officers will be needed to reach the 10 year targets set for recruitment and retention (i) in total and (ii) on average each year; and if he will make a statement.  [133152]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w63.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 July 2000]:</i> Tables 1 to 3 show the number of officers from minority ethnic communities by rank and police force areas for the year to March 2000 and the two preceding years.
<P>

<a name="00728w63.html_para3">The proportions given are not exact as the figures for officers from minority ethnic communities are in terms of number of people and the total used to calculate the proportion is based on full-time equivalents. This means that the proportion of officers from ethnic minority communities will be over estimated.
<P>

<a name="00728w63.html_para4">Table 4 sets out numbers of ethnic minority officers which need to be recruited to meet my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary's race equality recruitment targets. These are to be met over the period 1999 to 2009--there is no requirement for this to be achieved through equal annual increments. The target for retention is that the percentage of ethnic minority officers leaving the service through resignation or dismissal should equal the percentage of white officers leaving under similar circumstances.
<P>

<a name="00728w63.html_para5">Progress against targets will be monitored by the Home Office.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will estimate the cost of the Public Safety Radio Communications System, and provide a breakdown of the way in which the costs of the system will be divided between his Department and the police; and if he will make a statement.  [133287]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w65.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The overall cost of the Public Safety Radio Communication Service (PSRCS) is approximately &#163;1.3 billion over the lifetime of the project. This is based on the Net Present Cost (ie today's value of a series of future payments) and is for the Private Finance Initiative element of the service. This is the equivalent of &#163;2.3 billion in cash terms. In addition to the service tariffs, forces will pay for costs outside of the scope of the PSRCS contract to cover the purchase of control room terminals and their integration; and the purchase and replacement of radio terminals during the life of the PSRCS. An estimate of these costs is about &#163;300 million over the whole PSRCS contract life.
<P>

<a name="00728w65.html_para1">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced on 19 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 376-79, that the Government were making provision to meet the costs of PSRCS. This will amount to around &#163;500 million over the three years of the Spending Review Settlement: the "Core" costs will be paid centrally by the Home Office, and the total provision should also be sufficient to cover expenditure by police forces on local service requirements ("menu costs") and installation and equipment costs.
<P>

<a name="00728w65.html_para2">This settlement will ensure that the police service has the latest and best technology without having to reduce manpower to fund it. It should meet all the concerns some forces have expressed about the system's affordability.

 The report by the Performance and Innovation Unit published on 14 June envisages the establishment of a National Confiscation Agency (NCA) with responsibility for bringing confiscation proceedings in criminal cases, initiating civil proceedings for forfeiture of criminal assets under new powers, and raising tax demands on suspect gains. The NCA will also operate a financial investigation centre of excellence, with responsibility for training and accrediting financial investigators in the criminal justice system. The director of the NCA will report to the Home Secretary and be responsible for drawing up an Asset Confiscation Strategy in consultation with other authorities in the criminal justice system. It is my intention to bring forward legislation at the earliest opportunity to implement the report's conclusions.

<a name="00728w65.html_para4">For the current financial year, police revenue grant to police authorities of &#163;3,823 million is matched by police standard spending assessment (SSA) provision of &#163;3,533 million. These sums exclude police special grant and the funds being provided to police forces under the crime fighting fund and for DNA. For police service capital expenditure, police capital grant of &#163;91 million will be paid to police forces, accompanied by Supplementary credit approvals of &#163;53 million.

However, the Spending Review 2000 White Paper did show police SSA figures for England for each of the next three financial years. These plans would deliver provisional police SSA figures (for England and Wales) for the years 2001-02 to 2003-04 of &#163;3,842 million, &#163;4,040 million and &#163;4,204 million respectively although actual SSA provision may be adjusted to take account of expenditure on behalf of forces to be incurred centrally.

 There is no proposal to build a category A unit at Ashford.

In order to meet the security requirements for holding category A women, it is proposed to make one small design change, a facility to hold dogs in kennels. The remaining upgrade will be procedural, including extra patrols (with or without dogs), additional searching and close monitoring of the movement of the individuals concerned. The existing proposal for internal and external physical security are considered sufficient for use with category A prisoners.

Annes Gate Property PLC has been selected as the Preferred Bidder for the project which is going forward as a public private partnership competition. The demolition of the existing building on the Marsham Street site will commence after contracts are exchanged. This depends on progress with further negotiations but is unlikely to be before Spring 2001. Completion of the new development is expected to be in 2004.

 The Government's proposals for those who are dangerous and severely personality disordered--published in a consultation document in July 1999--deal with a longstanding challenge to public safety. The proposals will ensure that individuals who fall into this group whether in prison, high security hospitals or, as in the case of a very small number, at large in the community, are in future detained in circumstances where they will be subject to a range of high quality interventions designed to manage the consequences of their disorder and released only when they are assessed as being safe to be re-integrated into the wider community. The consultation period for these proposals ended on 31 December 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to extend to adults the changes to the release on temporary licence scheme introduced for young offenders in September 1998.  [133796]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00728w68.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In September 1998, following a review initiated by the then Director General of the Prison Service, a number of changes were made to the release on temporary licence scheme. The changes were designed to given prison governors greater flexibility to extend the range of constructive and challenging activities for which prisoners can be released, and to improve their chances of getting a job and somewhere to live when they are released. The majority of the changes were introduced only in the young offender estate.
<P>

<a name="00728w68.html_para3">Implementation of the changes in respect of young offenders suggests that this more constructive use of the scheme is valuable in helping prisoners reintegrate into the community. The scheme's success rate has remained high. After careful evaluation of performance in the young offender estate, I have decided to extend the majority of the changes introduced there to open prisons and women's prisons as of 1 September 2000. The changes will mean that prisoners in the open and women's estate will be eligible for release on facility licence for interviews to arrange employment or accommodation (if they are serving under one year). Overnight stays will be permitted for community reparational activities for prisoners who have successfully completed a period of day-release facility licence. Governors will also be able to grant overnight release on facility licence for hostel assessment purposes to inform parole consideration. Facility licence will also be available to help prisoners resolve urgent housing issues, for example possible loss of accommodation.
<P>

<a name="00728w68.html_para4">Two further changes will be made to resettlement licence arrangements. The purpose of release on resettlement licence is to enable prisoners to maintain family ties and links with the community and to make suitable arrangements for accommodation, work and training on release. Prisoners in the open and women's estate serving a determinate sentence of four years or over and who are refused parole at the first opportunity, at the half way point of their sentence, will be eligible to be considered for resettlement leave after three months rather than six months as at present, subject to passing a further rigorous risk assessment. In the open estate only, the maximum frequency of resettlement licence will be increased from every eight weeks to every four weeks.
<P>

<a name="00728w68.html_para5">No changes will be made to their stringent risk assessment process which all prisoners must pass before being granted temporary release. The Prison Service is 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jul 2000 : Column: 1169W</I><P>
committed to keeping the number of temporary release failures at the current low level, in order to ensure protection of the public. In April the Prison Service introduced a Key Performance Target which measures the success rate of the release on temporary licence scheme. The performance in the open, women's and young offender estate will be monitored carefully against that target. Consideration will be given to extending the changes to other adult prisoners only if the further evaluation suggests it is safe to do so.

<P>
<a name="00728w68.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I am today placing copies of the Final Report of the Metropolitan Police Committee in the Library. The report is also being published on the Metropolitan Police Committee (MPC) website, http://www.mpc.homeoffice.gov.uk/. My officials will write to representatives of the wide range of interested people and organisations who have previously received MPC publications, drawing their attention to the report's availability on the internet, and offering to provide hard copies where necessary.
<P>

<a name="00728w68.html_para7">The report covers the last period of the life of the Committee, from April 1999 to 2 July 2000, when I ceased to be the Police Authority for the Metropolitan police, with that role being taken by the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) from 3 July. The main part of the report is a record of advice on priorities, opportunities, challenges and context which the Committee offered as briefing to the incoming members of the MPA.
<P>

<a name="00728w68.html_para8">The Committee has played a major part in transforming the accountability of the Metropolitan Police Service. I believe it secured the respect and trust of successive Commissioners and their colleagues, who benefited from the variety of perspectives which the Committee brought to bear on their work, and from the objective and constructive way in which members explored, assessed and offered advice on the Metropolitan police's performance and plans.
<P>

<a name="00728w68.html_para9">The Committee's work and advice were, therefore, a great help to me, as Police Authority. Members engaged with the detail of the Metropolitan police in a systematic fashion which no Home Secretary could achieve alone.

<P>

<a name="00728w68.html_para10">The Committee has also been an invaluable bridge into the reformed arrangements for the governance of the Metropolitan Police Service. I am especially grateful for their work in preparing for the transition to the MPA, including in the formulation of the Policing and Performance Plan for this financial year. The Commissioner and his colleagues are keen to meet the challenges and the opportunities offered by the greater accountability which the MPA has brought with it. Working with the MPC helped very much in preparing for this.

 The Government intend to press ahead with obtaining Royal Assent in the spill-over and putting the controls in place at the earliest opportunity. I said on second reading of the Bill on 10 January 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 45, that I wanted the Electoral Commission established before the end of the year with the aim of having the new regime operating early next year. I believe that timetable can still be met. To that end urgent expenditure estimated at &#163;1.5 million will be met by repayable advances from the Contingencies Fund. This is in addition to the sum of &#163;300,000 I announced in my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) on 27 March 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 3-4W.

<a name="00728w69.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We have consulted widely on the recommendations in the prior options review of the Fire Service College and considered carefully all the representations we have received. I have noted in particular, the value that fire service interests place on the work of the College and their wish that it should continue. The Government's objective is to secure both in the short and longer term efficient and effective central training arrangements for local authority fire brigades which meet their operational needs and fully accord with the principles of Best Value.
<P>

<a name="00728w69.html_para0">We believe this is most likely to be achieved by drawing from the skills of both the public and private sectors. There have been widespread agreement that in continuing to assess the available options and deciding how best these diverse skills can be harnessed, the essential next step is to draw up in outcome terms a clear operational specification of the fire service's future central training requirements. I am asking for this work to be put in hand straight away. The work will be done in consultation with the Fire Service and the College and we will use consultants to assist in the task and to ensure it is completed by this autumn.

<a name="00728w69.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The provision of communications data is not covered by the Interception of Communications Act 1985. The law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies currently rely on arrangements governed by the Data Protection Act 1998. A central record of requests is not kept by the Home Office. In order to provide greater safeguards for the provision of communications data Part 1, Chapter II of the Regulation of the Investigatory Powers Bill ensures that requests for such data are made in a closely controlled manner and for a number of limited specific purposes.

<P>

<a name="00728w69.html_para5">Part II of the Bill has been introduced as a result of the incorporation into United Kingdom law, in the form of the Human Rights Act 1998, of the European Convention on Human Rights.

 The Forensic Science Service was established as a trading fund on 1 April 1999 by the Forensic Science Service Trading Fund Order 1998. As a trading fund it operates off-Vote and uses its trading receipts to meet outgoings. However, as allowed by the Government Trading Funds Act 1973, provision has been made in the Supply Estimates to make a repayable loan of &#163;3 million to the Forensic Science Service in 2000-01. There are no further loans or subsidies to the Forensic Science Service planned in the years 2001-02, 2002-03 and 2003-04.
