 Studies such as the European CabinAir project have shown that normally the levels of chemical and biological contaminants in aircraft are less than in many ground based work environments. The independent Committee on Toxicity completed a substantial review of evidence in September 2007 and concluded that it did not establish (or rule out) a link between cabin air and pilot ill health. The Committee recommended research to sample cabin air during &#145;fume events&#146;, which it estimated occur on 0.05 per cent. of flights overall. Such sampling has not been done before.

 The Department has not conducted or evaluated research specifically on this subject.

These include testing under relatively constant speed driving conditions from around 58 miles per hour to 70 miles per hour.

The criteria used to set the network are that the Primary Routes must be the most satisfactory routes for through traffic between places of traffic importance in the opinion of the Secretary of State (although for non-trunk roads this opinion will be formed after consultation with the traffic authority for the road).</p>

PPS3 on &#145;Housing&#146; sets out national planning policies for achieving high quality housing which make the most efficient and effective use of land to meet identified needs for new housing. PPS3 is not prescriptive in terms of directing housing to particular areas but asks local planning authorities to identify, through the preparation of strategic housing land availability assessments, specific, suitable sites in their plans which may include sites within the urban fringes and existing urban areas. A site is suitable if it offers a suitable location for housing development and would contribute to the creation of sustainable, mixed communities.</p>

The policy statement suggests that the zero carbon standard should be achieved through measures on the site of the dwelling or development, or through a low or zero carbon energy source connected to the development using a private wire. However, this will be the subject of a consultation process in the summer when we will be consulting on how the zero carbon 2016 standard should be achieved with a view to finalising the definition by the end of 2008.</p>

The purpose of this is to identify those fisheries responsible for high levels of cetacean by-catch and mitigation measures that are effective at deterring cetaceans over the long-term and safe and cost-effective for the industry.</p>

It also increases consumer choice and raises awareness and interest in local food by helping to improve consumers&#146; links with, and understanding of, the rural economy and food production.

Friend the Secretary of State (Hilary Benn) on 8 October 2007, <i> Official Report</i>, column 39, in which he announced a package of measures to help those farmers most affected by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. This included &#163;2 million for the promotion and marketing of lamb, beef and pork both at home and in our export markets. The domestic promotional activity carried out by the English Beef and Lamb Executive (Eblex) and the British Pig Executive ran from October 2007 to March 2008 and, during the specific periods of promotion, four week volume sales increased between 2 and 14 per cent. compared to the previous year.</p>

Our funding of this initiative has helped support workshops for buyers and suppliers, regional pilot projects to develop the supply side, and a range of guides aimed at both food producers and public sector buyers.

However, the Curator of a Regimental museum, Miss Moreno, wrote to the NAM Director on 1 February seeking information in a private capacity as part of her studies for her degree. It was standard practice therefore for her to be charged for the information. The NAM Director replied to Miss Moreno on 18 February outlining the charging policy and offering a twenty five percent discount in recognition of the inconvenience the delay in providing the information had caused.

 The EU Council Decision on the stepping up of cross-border co-operation (also know as the Pr1/4m Council Decision) provides improved arrangements for the sharing of fingerprint, DNA and vehicle registration data by law enforcement authorities. For example, where a DNA sample retrieved from a crime scene is searched against a national database and no match is found, the Council Decision permits for that data to be transmitted and searched through member states' national databases. A notification is sent to the requesting member state notifying of a hit or no hit i.e. matching profile.

The package includes increasing age-related allowances by &#163;1,180 above indexation, meaning that every person qualifying for these allowances will pay no more tax than without the reforms announced in Budget 2007 and removing 600,000 pensioners from paying tax.</p>

<i> [holding answer 3 April 2008</i>]: Successive Governments have regarded Tibet as autonomous while recognising the special position of the Chinese authorities there. We have consistently informed the Chinese government of our view that greater autonomy should be granted to the Tibetans. But like all other EU members, we do not advocate Tibetan independence. We have emphasised that the current political difficulties in Tibet can best be resolved through dialogue between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama has stated publicly that he opposes violence and does not seek independence, but greater autonomy for Tibet. We consider that this provides a basis for a negotiated settlement to the issue of Tibet.</p>

 The Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007 (the Act) contains provisions relating to three distinct policy areas&#151;Consumer Voice, estate agents and contracts concluded away from business premises (&#147;doorstep selling&#148;)&#151;which are being commenced and implemented to different timetables:</p>

The new National Consumer Council, Scottish Consumer Council, Welsh Consumer Council, Northern Ireland Postal Services Committee, and new statutory redress schemes for gas, electricity, and postal services consumers, are planned to be operational on 1 October 2008. Work is well under way on the development of these new arrangements. Commencement of the relevant provisions of the Act reflects both the progress and the needs of the implementation programme. The Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007 (Commencement No. 2) Order 2007 (SI 2007 No. 3546) brought into force on 21 December 2007 the provisions which enabled the appointments of Chairs and Members to be made formally to the new bodies, and for the new bodies to make an important contribution to the implementation process. That Order also commenced provisions relating to the new redress schemes. The Commencement No. 4 Order (SI 2008 No. 905), which was made on 26 March 2008, commenced with effect from 1 April 2008 the provisions which made the new National Consumer Council responsible for maintaining accounts. The Commencement No. 3 Order has been published in draft, and is subject to approval by a resolution of each House of Parliament. The draft Order seeks to commence the provisions relating to the requirement on the new National Consumer Council to publish and consult upon a forward work programme.</p>

Once the Office of Fair Trading has approved a redress scheme open to all estate agents, an order requiring estate agents to belong to an approved scheme can be made. Subject to OFT approving a scheme, the Government expects this requirement to be in force with effect from 1 October 2008. Provisions in the Act that amend the Estate Agents Act 1979 by expanding the grounds for the issue by the OFT of prohibition and warning orders and increasing the investigatory powers of enforcement officers, were included in the Commencement No. 4 Order and will come into force on 1 October 2008.

 The information requested is not available. A jobseeker can be treated as actively seeking work while away from home, for example on holiday, for up to two weeks in any 12-month period. As they do not need to look for work during this period no proof of job search is required, but they must remain in Great Britain and be available for work during this period in order to continue receiving jobseeker&#146;s allowance. However, jobseeker&#146;s allowance is terminated when someone goes outside the country for more than a day, unless it is for an interview.

 This Government launched a radical programme of reform in response to Lord Laming&#146;s Inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbi&#233;. Through the Children Act 2004 we have put in place a much stronger framework for children's services and particularly for safeguarding children. The Government&#146;s detailed response to the recommendations of the Victoria Climbi&#233; Inquiry Report was set out in &#147;Keeping Children Safe&#148; which was published in 2003, alongside the Green Paper &#147;Every Child Matters&#148;. The actions the Government committed to undertaking in response to Lord Laming&#146;s recommendations have been carried out or are ongoing, an exception is the revision of guidance on the Children Act 1989. Volume 1, on Court Orders, has been revised and published, and many of the key messages which &#147;Keeping Children Safe&#148; said were to be incorporated in the revised Children Act 1989 guidance have been incorporated into other guidance documents and standards.
