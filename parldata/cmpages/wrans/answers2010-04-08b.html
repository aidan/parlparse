 Widespread implementation of audio visual systems presents some significant technological challenges. The Department for Transport is conducting research to assess whether these challenges can be overcome before it considers whether to make amendments to the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000 to include a requirement for such systems to be fitted to buses. The research has brought together a cross-section of stakeholders, including Guide Dogs, Royal National Institute of Blind People and Royal National Institute for Deaf People. The project is scheduled to report in summer 2010.</p>

 The Department for Transport is not responsible for issuing passes and so does not hold information on the time taken for Travel Concession Authorities (TCAs) to process applications and renewals of concessionary travel passes. The Department has not had any recent discussions with Transport for London, local authorities in England or other TCAs on this issue.</p>

The maximum life of a pass is five years from the date of issue but there is no recommended minimum life. TCAs are therefore free to set the expiry dates, and renewal arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="100408w0001.htm_para1"><a name="10040861000015">All English concessionary travel passes must now conform to a standard design and be ITSO smartcards. London was given until 1 April 2010 to meet these requirements which is why they have recently renewed all of the Freedom Passes in the capital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="100408w0001.htm_para2"><a name="10040861000016">The Department would expect TCAs to process routine applications for concessionary travel passes within a reasonable time frame although it is understandable that a bulk reissue of all passes may take slightly longer.</p>

PPL have now indicated that they charge most commercial organisations like hairdressers, pubs and offices between £50 and £120 per year and it is likely that most third sector organisations would be charged at the lower end of this range. This would reduce the original estimate of £18.7 million. But the actual cost of repeal would be dependent on the tariffs agreed through negotiation between PPL and the third sector organisations.</p>

(iii) the Capital Enterprise Scheme, (iv) the Regional Loan Transition Fund and (v) the Phoenix Fund since each scheme's inception. [325338]</p>

<p><a name="st_47"><a name="10040874000075"><a name="100408w0004.htm_spnew0"><a name="10040874000196"><b>Ms Rosie Winterton:</b>
 The information is as follows:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="100408w0004.htm_para0"><a name="10040874000076">(i) The Working Capital Scheme (WCS) has provided guarantees to two banks on portfolios of short-term loans with good credit risk in order to release regulatory capital to enable those banks to increase lending to businesses. The two banks with WCS guarantees, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, have made lending commitments of £39 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="100408w0004.htm_para1"><a name="10040874000077">Public Borrowing Review 2009 announced that as the broader Asset Protection Scheme now provides banks with considerably greater capital release, so new portfolios will not be guaranteed under the WCS although existing portfolio guarantees will remain until March 2011. Companies' access to the WCS was through the banks; they did not apply for it directly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="100408w0004.htm_para2"><a name="10040874000078">(ii) The Enterprise Finance Guarantee is open to SMEs with a turnover of up to £25 million, rather than large businesses. A total of 142 loans worth £16.16 million have been offered to Birmingham businesses under the Enterprise Finance Guarantee, of which 118 loans worth £11.40 million have been drawn down. Loans under the scheme are available to firms with a turnover of up to £25 million and are not therefore available to large businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="100408w0004.htm_para3"><a name="10040874000079">(iii) The Capital for Enterprise fund provides support to SMEs rather than large businesses. To date the appointed fund managers have made offers totalling £98.7 million to 66 businesses, including three in the West Midlands worth £4.8 million. 26 businesses have received investment, including one in the West Midlands with a value of £2 million. I am not providing this breakdown by parliamentary constituency as this could make it possible to identify the individual companies that have received, or are under consideration, for support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="100408w0004.htm_para4"><a name="10040874000080">(iv) The Advantage Transition Bridge Fund (ATBF) provided loans worth £2,677,000 to 18 companies in Birmingham. Information breaking these loans down by the size of the businesses is not available. The fund closed for new loans from 1 December 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="100408w0004.htm_para5"><a name="10040874000081">(v) During the Phoenix fund (which ran from 2002-06) Government provided £1.886 million to Community Development Finance Institutes (CDFIs) operating mainly in the Birmingham area. This capital was onward lent to 130 start up and existing businesses (the vast majority of these will have been in the Birmingham area).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="100408w0004.htm_para6"><a name="10040874000082">Since the end of the Phoenix fund Advantage West Midlands has provided support to CDFIs and other lenders under the Advantage Small Loan scheme and more recently the Small Business Loan programme. Both have drawn on ERDF funding as well as funds from AWM and local authorities. Between 1 April 2007 and 31 December 2009 Aston Reinvestment Trust (ART) and the Arrow Fund (two of the alternative lenders which have received funding under these programmes) made 235 loans totalling £3.574 million to businesses in Birmingham and Solihull.</p>

the Angolan Government's wish to diversify the economy, UK investment is broadening in this, the third-largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa. The new constitution in February and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos' zero-tolerance policy on corruption make it particularly timely to be deepening the relationship. The UK has an important role in supporting Angola's development, building on traditional links but also uncovering new opportunities. Beyond inter-governmental cooperation, UK-based non-governmental organisations and the private sector are key parts of this process. We hope also to develop ideas for working with key constitutional bodies, including the National Assembly, in which support from Members of the House would be valuable.</p>

 The National Equine Database shows that as of 25 March 2010, 1,204,833 passports have been issued by UK Passport Issuing Organisations (PIOs). Of these, 342, 242 were Weatherby's Thoroughbred passports.

 More than 300 species are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010, including all species of bats. These will benefit from a diverse range of funding streams and conservation effort involving the DEFRA network of organisations and with the exception of any species-specific projects, figures are not accounted for in this way. I refer to my previous answer of 22 Mar 2010, <i> Official Report</i>, column 138W, on overall biodiversity expenditure, which would include conservation of protected species.</p>

In addition the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) contributed £87,000 to the National Bat Monitoring Programme in 2009-10. Natural England estimates that it has spent approximately £370,000 on work intended to protect bats in 2009-10.</p>

Secondly, since the publication of the Data Handling Review and Burton Report, the MOD is now auditing its holdings of both personal data and removable media. This has identified a number of instances where the location of data could not be verified and has therefore been reported as a possible loss-even though in many cases they may have merely been unaccounted for or incorrectly disposed of.</p>

 In addition to the answer I gave to the hon.

Summary offences without injury are "assault without injury on a constable", "assault without injury", and "racially or religiously aggravated assault without injury".

When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.<br>

However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces.

 The Targeted Mental Health in Schools Programme (TaMHS) builds on the existing universal approaches to supporting emotional well-being that schools are already using, such as SEAL, by offering targeted therapeutic interventions for individuals or groups of children at risk of developing mental health problems. Funded by the DCSF by £60 million from 2008 to 2011, all local authorities are now involved in offering the programme within school clusters that are participating. The inclusion of special schools is particularly encouraged within the conditions of grant.</p>

While the programme is not designed to replicate or replace other funded support (such as through a statement of SEN) all children's needs should be considered equally when identifying who should be offered targeted interventions through TaMHS. Each child's individual circumstances, including whether they have additional needs, and any funded support that they already receive, will be taken into account when deciding what additional support or interventions might be most appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="100408w0022.htm_para15"><a name="10040885000169">On 16 March, the Prime Minister announced that Government had met its target for 3500 Sure Start Children's Centres. It is important that all families with young children are aware of the range of services available, and where their local children's centre is. The Department undertook analysis in early 2009 of current research which highlighted a lack of awareness about the range of services available or that it is a universal service. The Department has therefore run the first ever national communications campaign to boost awareness of children's centres which commenced September 2009 and early evaluation is positive-with an increase of over 40 per cent. in the number of parents (in areas targeted by the campaign) who know about their local children's centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="100408w0022.htm_para16"><a name="10040885000170">The amount spent on communications and publicity for children's centres in each year is set out in the following table. It is not possible to provide figures back to 2004, because children's centre communications activity was incorporated into wider communications budgets covering early years and childcare. The amount spent in 2009-10 is higher than previous years as 2009-10 is when the Department ran its first national communications campaign for Sure Start Children's Centres, and represents 0.29 per cent. of the total 2009-10 programme budget for Sure Start Children's Centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="100408w0023.htm_para1"><a name="10040885000178">Since 2004, there have been two updates to the branding guidelines for Sure Start Children's Centres, both of which set out expectations for how external signage should look. The first update was in March 2006, which established Sure Start as the overall brand for all services for 0 to 5-year-olds and created a new SureStart logo. A further update to branding guidelines was made in March 2009, to reflect the establishment of the national network of Sure Start Children's Centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="100408w0023.htm_para3"><a name="10040885000180">As part of the national communications campaign an estimated 2,400,000 leaflets advertising Sure Start Children's Centres were sent to specific postcodes via door drops (see Tables 2 and 3). The postcodes in Table 2 were selected according to population density and deprivation and those in Table 3 according to rurality and deprivation. We do not hold details of which local authority wards these postcodes represent and have supplied details of the upper tier local authority in Tables 2 and 3. A copy of tables 2 and 3 will be placed in the Libraries. Local authorities and individual centres may have conducted their own door drop leaflet distribution, but this information is not collected by the Department. Door drop leaflet distribution is an effective way of targeting potential users of children's centres among families who may be less likely to access children centres.</p>

The total amount spent on radio advertising in 2009-10 was £951800. Radio advertising is effective at building awareness on a national level and reaching out to parents who may be unaware of children's centres and the services they offer.</p>

The total amount spent on press advertising in 2008-2009 was £150,000; and in 2009-10 it was £831 600. Press advertising is particularly useful in conveying the range of services available at children's centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="100408w0023.htm_para9"><a name="10040885000186">The Department commissioned specialist creative development of advertising for Sure Start Children's Centres in 2009-10 only. The total amount spent was £87,300 in 2009-10. The creative development is a crucial part of the planning process. This research helps us to understand whether the advertisements are clear and engaging for the audience before they are rolled out nationally. This ensures that we can receive the optimum return on investment.</p>

Kirklees Safeguarding Children Board hopes to complete it shortly and to publish the executive summary as soon as they are able to do so, after evaluation by Ofsted.</p>

<i> [holding answer 30 March 2010]:</i> Ofsted is required to carry out regular inspections of all maintained schools under section 5 of the Education Act 2005.

Any remedial action or deregistration would take place on the basis that one or more standard had not been met.

There is no statutory definition of extremism or extremist organisations other than those proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. Therefore neither Ofsted nor DCSF are able to keep systematic central records of allegations about extremism, nor of alleged links between schools and extremist organisations.</p>

Giving young people a real say over the issues that affect them leads to better decisions and outcomes, promotes community engagement and helps overturn negative perceptions. Youth Parliaments are one of a number of ways that young people's voices can be heard by local and national decision makers. Many local authorities choose to support Youth Parliaments as part of their overall arrangements for taking account of young people's views.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="100408w0031.htm_para11"><a name="10040892000849">(i) Table 8.2 on page 100 of HM Revenue and Customs' (HMRC) 2008-09 Annual Accounts sets out the amounts of revenue that HMRC remitted and wrote off in 2007-08 and 2008-09. HMRC's Annual Accounts are available at:</p>
<a name="100408w0031.htm_brev2"><a name="10040892000898"><ul><p class="tabletext">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/about/hmrc-accs-0809.pdf</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="100408w0031.htm_para12"><a name="10040892000850">(ii) Tax debts are remitted where they are capable of being recovered but HMRC decides not to pursue a liability. It does this: when the value of a debt is small compared with the likely cost of recovering it; when enforcing payment would cause an individual, or his or her dependents, to suffer financial hardship; or where an earlier error by HMRC would make it inappropriate or unfair for it to enforce payment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="100408w0031.htm_para13"><a name="10040892000851">HMRC writes off debts when they have become irrecoverable because there are no practical means for pursuing the debt. This applies where taxpayers have gone missing and HMRC has not been able to trace their current whereabouts or where they have moved overseas to a territory outside the European Union with which the UK has no reciprocal recovery rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="100408w0031.htm_para14"><a name="10040892000852">Debts are also written off where individuals or companies have become insolvent. When this happens, HMRC aims to recover a proportion of what it is owed consistent with its legal rights as a creditor, and it writes off the tax that cannot be recovered in this way. Around 90 per cent. of all HMRC remissions and write offs come from this last category.</p>
