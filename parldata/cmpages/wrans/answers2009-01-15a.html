 Over the last 12 months, the rural development agencies have begun delivering a &#163;300 million programme of investment in improving the competitiveness of farming and forestry under the Rural Development Programme for England. The Rural Payments Agency's continued progress in making payments under the single payment scheme has helped farmers' cash flow. Reducing trade distorting subsidies helps farmers better respond to the demands of the market; the recent common agricultural policy health check took another step by reducing coupled payments and regulatory burdens on farmers.</p>

 While the Government believe that buying locally produced food is a matter of personal choice for consumers, we recognise that it can bring benefits to producers and consumers alike.

 The Government have set a deliberately stretching target that all new homes must be zero carbon by 2016. The stamp duty land tax relief (SDLT) for zero carbon homes was introduced to help kick-start the market for new highly efficient technologies in homes, both for the fabric of the building and in the use of microgeneration, and sets a gold standard for green homes. Few currently exist, but the purpose of the relief is to act as signal We have always made it clear that the SDLT relief for zero carbon homes would evolve and we expect to see more of these homes built in the future. Eighteen homes have qualified for the zero carbon homes relief since October 2007, broken down by month and stamp duty band as follows. The total amount of relief given since October 2007 is around &#163;70,000.</p>

 The Department, and its agencies, use 42 0845 telephone numbers to provide a range of services to the public. These include IT support for online enquiries, customer service inquiries, contact with the jury summoning office and a small number of courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="90115w0011.htm_para0"><a name="090115121000625">The 0845 numbers were introduced because, at the time, calls from anywhere in the UK were charged at a local rate making it cheaper for people to make contact rather than using the exchange number. With the expansion of the telecommunications markets, call charges are now set by the individual phone companies, often as part of wider service packages. The charges vary, and are outside the control of the Department. Where possible, customers are also given the exchange number, as depending on the individual inquirer&#146;s telephone plane, 0845 may not now be the cheapest option.</p>

 Data reported to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform can confirm that the number of offenders cautioned in 2007 were as follows; 10,209 in the Devon and Cornwall police force area and 344,890 in England. From 1 June 2000 the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 came into force nationally and removed the use of cautions for persons under 18 and replaced them with reprimands and final warnings. These figures have been included in the above data. The cautions statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been cautioned for two or more offences at the same time the principal offence is the more serious offence.</p>

In the last 12 months (from January 2008 to December 2008) the Children's Society has received &#163;204,067.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="90115w0012.htm_para3"><a name="090115121000747">The grant was awarded to enable the Children's Society in partnership with the Princess Royal Trust for Carers to draw together resources and guidance on good practice in supporting young carers and their families and, on the basis of that, to help train and inform social workers, health workers, teachers and voluntary groups in meeting their needs. The project also supports local authorities to take a whole family approach in the delivery of their support services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="90115w0012.htm_para4"><a name="090115121000748">Funding for the project as a whole covers three financial years running from April 2007 to March 2010.

 We envisage that the majority of the funding supporting individual budgets in the pilot areas will be sourced from local budgets available to the Director of Children's Services and PCT managers rather than specific grants from DCSF. Determination of these budgets will be a local matter for both local authorities and partnering PCTs. There are however some local authority grants from Government which pilot areas may wish to incorporate. We will indicate in guidance to pathfinder areas that we would like them to explore how the Area Based Grant and the Aiming High for Disabled Children block within the Sure Start Early Years and Childcare Grant can be utilised within individual budgets. Further funding streams may also be indicated at a later date.</p>

 The &#147;Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives&#148; strategy, published in January 2008 set out the Government&#146;s comprehensive plans to reduce obesity&#151;initially focusing on children. Every child should grow up eating well and enjoying being active and we want parents to have the knowledge and confidence to make this happen. There is no single, simple solution to reducing rates of overweight and obesity and therefore Government are taking action on a number of fronts.</p>

We are working to support as many mothers as possible to breastfeed and to continue to breastfeed for longer&#151;helped by schools, children&#146;s centres, health and other services, all promoting healthy weight. The introduction of the Early Years Foundation Stage for 0 to 5-year-olds means that all early years education providers must promote the good health of children, by providing healthy, nutritious food and active play. The Play Strategy, launched in December 2008, sets how Government will invest &#163;235 million over 2008-09 to 2010-11 to develop play facilities for children of all ages.</p>

Nearly all schools are currently participating in the National Healthy Schools Programme with over two-thirds with full National Healthy School Status, having demonstrated they have in place the minimum evidence for 41 criteria across four themes: emotional health and well-being; healthy eating; physical activity and personal, social, health and economic education.</p>

 The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) is responsible for the delivery of National Curriculum tests. The QCA Board took decisions on the procurement and award of contracts. Throughout the procurement process, officials from the Department for Education and Skills (DFES) participated as observers, commenting and asking questions. QCA shared copies of documentation with officials who offered comments. DFES observers did not have voting rights or decision making powers in relation to the procurement. The QCA Board approved ETS as preferred bidder on the 14 December 2006. Ministers were informed of the QCA's choice of preferred bidder on the same day, prior to the commencement of contract negotiations. Ministers were not consulted on the terms of the contract between QCA and ETS. Lord Sutherland has found that the procurement was sound but the QCA did not manage the contract it held with ETS effectively.</p>

 The Care Matters White Paper sets out our plans for improving the training and support to foster carers and residential care workers. This commitment is also being taken forward by the Children's Workforce Development Council (CWDC) who introduced training, support and development standards to support foster carers from approval through the first two years of service. These give fostering providers a framework for their foster carers&#146; training and professional development. CWDC are currently working with stakeholders to develop a professional development framework for social care workers, this will incorporate the foster care training support and development framework. CWDC are also developing core standards specific to residential care workers that will raise the quality of care and support a child can expect to receive in the home. We will be linking this work to the National Minimum Standards (NMS) as part of our review of the NMS. We will be consulting on changes to these during 2009.</p>

 Communities and Local Government do not require the public to make telephone calls on numbers which charge more than the national rate. Neither Communities and Local Government or its service provider (Siemens) generate any income from calls. The only 0845 number used is the Neighbourhood Renewal helpline (0845 0828383). However, calls to this number are diverted to the main Communities and Local Government switchboard and are charged at a local rate to the caller. Later this year, CLG will introduce the new 0300 number range when it commences a new contractual telephony arrangement.</p>

 Provisional figures show that in 2007 there were 190 accidental dwelling fire deaths in England, down 18 per cent. from the 2006 figure of 233 accidental dwelling fire deaths. This is the lowest figure for accidental dwelling fire deaths in England since 1981.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="90115w0016.htm_para0"><a name="090115122000171">The fire safety campaign has been running under the Fire Kills brand for the last 10 years and has been a pivotal part of the Government's success in reducing domestic fire deaths. The success of the Fire Kills campaign has been largely due to a series of national advertising campaigns, focused on the use and maintenance of smoke alarms. There is strong evidence that the public respond positively to the campaign's messages, and have bought smoke alarms as a result of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="90115w0016.htm_para1"><a name="090115122000172">The most recent campaign, &#145;Pull Your Finger Out&#146;, first ran from January to March 2008. The smoke alarm industry reported a significant increase in sales during this period, while pre- and post-tracking research has shown that the percentage of people who could recall fire safety advertising without being prompted rose from 46 to 64 per cent.</p>

This showed that local housing authority homelessness acceptances fell compared to the previous quarter and year, with 14,340 during the quarter, and the number of households placed in temporary accommodation has continued to fall, for the twelfth consecutive quarter, to 72,130 by the end of September.</p>

 The national health inequalities public service agreement target (PSA) aims to reduce inequalities in health by 10 per cent. by 2010, as measured by infant mortality (by socio-economic group) and life expectancy at birth (by geographical area).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="90115w0021.htm_para5"><a name="0901162000568">Since the 1997-99 baseline the infant mortality gap has widened, and latest 2005-07 data show the infant mortality rate among the Routine and Manual group was 16 per cent. higher than in the total population. However, the gap has narrowed in recent years and if the rate observed since 2002-04 continues, the infant mortality element of target will be met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="90115w0021.htm_para6"><a name="0901162000569">Life expectancy in England and in the Spearhead Group (the 70 local authority areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators, and the 62 primary care trusts mapping to them, and a focus of action for this element of the target) is at record levels. If the rest of England still had the life expectancy it had in 1995-97 (the target baseline), Spearhead areas would not just have narrowed the gap by 10 per cent., they would have closed it completely. However, the increase in Spearhead areas is not as great as in non-Spearheads so the gap has not narrowed. The latest 2005-07 data show that the percentage gap in life expectancy between the Spearhead Group and the England average has increased to 4 per cent. above baseline for men and 11 per cent. above baseline for women (the target is a 10 per cent. narrowing for both).</p>

It identified that there are a number of challenges to improving vaccine uptake in younger at-risk groups and that because the use of the term &#145;flu&#146; and &#145;cold&#146; had become almost interchangeable, flu was not regarded as a serious concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="90115w0021.htm_para11"><a name="0901162000602">The Department is planning to introduce a new flu vaccination advertising campaign for the 2009-10 flu season. One of the aims of the new advertising approach is to improve targeting of the message to people aged under 65 with long-term conditions, while maintaining uptake rates among those aged 65 and over. These research findings are being fed into the development of the new campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="90115w0021.htm_para12"><a name="0901162000603">Uptake among health care workers is low in most developed countries and this is a concern that is not specific to the UK. To address low uptake in health care workers, the Department held a flu conference in June 2008 for flu leads working in PCTs and also in occupational health. The conference focused on sharing ideas for improving vaccine uptake among health professionals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="90115w0021.htm_para13"><a name="0901162000604">We also launched a new flu vaccine leaflet for health care workers and are currently working on a communications strategy that will provide support to occupational health departments in delivering all occupational health vaccinations, because immunising health care workers with the flu vaccine is the responsibility of the employer.</p>

Its purpose is to reduce the risk of a poultry worker being exposed to an avian flu virus at the same time as they were infected with seasonal flu virus. It is theoretically possible that the two viruses could mix to produce a new strain of flu virus which could possibly lead to a pandemic. This programme is primarily aimed at reducing the risk of a pandemic virus emerging in this country.</p>

Notes:<br>
1. Individuals and decisions based figures are rounded to the nearest 10. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>
2. The most recent adverse sanction is shown for each individual.<br>
3. Figures include all individuals who have had all or just part of their JSA payments sanctioned or withdrawn.<br>
4. Varied length sanctions are sanctions of between one week and 26 weeks imposed for leaving employment voluntarily without just cause, refusing employment without good cause, or losing employment through misconduct. The actual period in each case is at the discretion of the Adjudication Officer who makes the decision.<br>
5. Fixed length sanctions are sanctions of two weeks (four weeks if repeated within 12 months, and 26 weeks if already received a four week sanction within last 12 months) imposed for refusal, without good cause, to attend an employment programme or carry out a Jobseeker&#146;s direction. Payment of benefit continues in full pending the Adjudication Officer&#146;s decision on a sanction question.<br>
6. Entitlement sanctions apply to questions on which entitlement to JSA depends. For example, if there is doubt around whether the Jobseeker&#146;s agreement (JSAg) is suitable, whether they are actively looking for work or making themselves available for work. In most cases payment of JSA will be suspended by benefit processing until the doubt is resolved.<br>

 The Compensation Recovery Unit have not identified any cases where insurance companies failed to report settlement of a claim. The Social Security Administration Act 1992 Section 110, gives DWP inspectors the right to examine the records of compensators and employers to verify that they are complying fully with the provisions of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997. We work closely with the Association of British Insurers and other insurance associations and we scrutinise claims. There has been nothing to date to indicate enforcement action is required on compliance, although we continue to monitor the position.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. These statistics are based on households below average income data which is sourced from the Family Resources Survey.<br>
2. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. The reference period for households below average Income figures is single financial years.<br>
4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or "equivalised") for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living. Median incomes are used as the national average in the publication.<br>
5. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br>
6. Figures have been presented on a before housing costs basis. For before housing costs, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for after housing costs they are.<br>
7. Numbers of disabled children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 children.<br>
8. The disability definition up to 2001-02 defines disability as having a long-term illness, disability or infirmity that limits the activity of the individual in some way. This definition changed from 2002-03 to be more in line with the Disability Discrimination Act's definition of disability which defines disability as having a long-term illness, disability or infirmity that leads to a significant difficulty with one or more areas of the individual's life. The change in the definition has only a very minor impact on the statistics.<br>

 The available information relates to offences recorded by the police and data is given in the tables for 1998-99 to 2007-08. A number of changes have been made to recorded crime in response to suggestions in the two reviews of crime statistics. One such change is that the term &#145;violent crime&#146; is no longer used in connection with the recorded crime statistics and we now provide figures for violence against the person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="90115w0026.htm_para0"><a name="0901162001131">In 1998-99, the recorded crime coverage was extended and substantial revisions were made to the counting rules. Figures prior to that date are therefore not directly comparable and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 Data relating to the transfer of cases from the Assets Recovery Agency to the Serious Organised Crime Agency was not collated to this level of detail, as there would be no operational value and some cost in doing so. This information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost (through manual collation from case files). SOCA has terminated one case without recovering assets, where civil recovery proceedings had been initiated as at 31 March 2008. The reason for terminating the case was that there were no assets left to recover. As regards the value of civil recovery orders and tax settlements, figures for SOCA's UK-wide performance on asset recovery for the financial year 2008-09 are subject to internal validation and will be included in its Annual Report for 2008-09, when published.</p>
