 The Advisory Group on Listed Events announced its recommendations to me on 20 March. These recommendations included the proposal

<P><I>8 Apr 1998 : Column: 230</I><P>
that the list maintained under Part IV of the Broadcasting Act 1996 should be made up of Group A and B events, these classifications defining the extent of the protection for television coverage of these events on generally available, terrestrial channels. I shall make my final decisions on this proposal, and on the events to be included on the list, when I have fully considered the implications of the Group's report. I hope to do so around the middle of May.

 I have been informed by Sir Richard Eyre that his review of the future of lyric theatre in London will be submitted to me by mid-May; the slight slippage on the original timetable is due to Sir Richard's work commitments. I have undertaken to publish the report shortly after I receive it. Publication will then be followed by consultation.

 The Independent Television Commission maintains and enforces a code of advertising standards and practice for commercial broadcasters, which includes detailed guidance on advertising and children. This guidance is reviewed by the Commission from time to time taking into account representations and available research as appropriate. The most recent review was conducted in 1997.

To ask the Attorney-General what consideration the Crown Prosecution Service has given to the implications of the judgment of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in R v W and another; and what arrangements exist for liaison with the Inland Revenue about criminal cases with a tax aspect.  [38837]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80408w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 In the proceedings to which my hon. Friend refers the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) examined the respective of the Crown Prosecution Service and the Inland Revenue to pursue criminal proceedings. It confirmed that the Inland Revenue's common law power to prosecute is ancillary to, supportive of and limited by their duty to collect taxes. In contrast, the Crown Prosecution Service's statutory duty to take over and conduct criminal proceedings is free-standing, unconfined (for the purposes of the particular case) and reflects much wider public interest concerns and objectives. Accordingly, there is no logical inconsistency in the Crown's position if the Crown Prosecution Service prosecute in circumstances where the Revenue have decided not to.




<P>
<P><I>8 Apr 1998 : Column: 231</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80408w01.html_para2">This ruling accorded with the existing understanding of the Crown Prosecution Service and Inland Revenue as to their respective roles in relation to criminal investigation and prosecution and does not require any change of policy or practice on the part of either. Nor does it affect the position of those individuals who co-operate with the Inland Revenue on what is commonly referred to as 'the Hansard practice' or otherwise. Primary responsibility for investigation and prosecution in relation to alleged tax evasion rests with the Inland Revenue; proceedings brought by the Crown Prosecution Service will ordinarily encompass charges relating to tax evasion only in circumstances where that is incidental to allegations of non-fiscal criminal conduct. In such circumstances the Crown Prosecution Service and Inland Revenue liaise closely together. The arrangements for such liaison have recently been strengthened by the establishment of the 'Convention between Prosecuting Authorities to provide arrangements for ensuring effective co-ordination of decision making and handling in related cases which are the responsibility of different authorities'. Both the Crown Prosecution Service and Inland Revenue became signatories to that Convention when it was established on 11 February 1998. A copy of the Convention has been lodged in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="80408w01.html_para3">In R <i>v</i> W and others the applicants were charged on 27 July 1995 with offences of conspiracy to obtain property by deception (later changed to conspiracy to defraud) and conspiracy to commit false accounting in connection with the affairs of companies with which they were associated. The proceedings were transferred to the Crown Court on 6 November 1995. The prosecution case at this stage was that the motive for the alleged false accounting was partly to conceal the removal of company funds for purposes other than tax and partly the evasion of tax. The case in relation to false accounting was subsequently narrowed to allege only tax evasion. The Inland Revenue had, prior to the institution of the criminal proceedings, decided that its own inquiries should be pursued in relation to unpaid tax. This in turn led, in 1997, to a negotiated settlement of unpaid tax with the companies concerned.
<P>

<a name="80408w01.html_para4">The negotiation between Inland Revenue and the companies concerned was quite independent of the criminal proceedings although all parties were aware of their existence. Lord Justice Rose said in giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In any event we reject the suggestion that, because the prosecution case against both applicants on false accounting was previously based partly, but is now based solely, on tax evasion, this constitutes such a change that [the applicant], at the time of settlement by the companies was misled".</FONT></UL>

<P>
<a name="80408w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="80408w01.html_para5">The Audit Commission Bill [<i>Lords</i>] consolidates the existing legislation on the Audit Commission. Auditors and the Commission have a power to obtain access to all such information including medical files, as they may reasonably require for the performance of any of their statutory functions, including studies into the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of bodies subject to audit. They must comply with Data Protection legislation, and the Commission has drawn up and published a Code of Data Matching Practice, endorsed by the Data Protection Agency, which it and auditors follow when data matching techniques are used.

 The Permanent Secretary has not given such an assurance. However, in the event of relocation of the CSL Norwich to York, consideration would be given as to whether medium term assurances of continued employment should be offered to staff who transferred.

<a name="80408w04.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 April 1998]:</i> There were no specific measures in the Budget targeted at motorists in receipt of mobility allowances. Some motorists in receipt of Disability Living Allowance will benefit from the freeze in Vehicle Excise Duty, as well as the new reduced rate of &#163;100 for the smallest and least polluting cars that will be introduced from next year. The uprating of bus fuel duty rebate, and the &#163;500 million additional funding for public transport, will help provide affordable alternatives to the car for all motorists. In line with the Government's existing commitment, road fuel duties were increased by at least 6 per cent. in real terms on Budget day. These increases are expected to save 1.7 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010, and all motorists will be affected by these changes.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what will be the combined marginal withdrawal rate faced by someone who is receiving partial help with childcare costs under the proposed tax credit scheme and who is also <i>(a)</i> paying basic rate tax and NICs or <i>(b)</i> paying basic rate tax and NICs, and receiving housing benefit and council tax benefit.  [36026]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80408w04.html_spnew8"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 March 1998]:</i> The Working Families Tax Credit will provide substantially more financial support than is available at present under Family Credit and hence will significantly improve the reward for working. For example a two-child family with an after income tax of &#163;250 and &#163;60 a week in childcare costs will receive &#163;36.70 more a week in WFTC than under FC.
<P>

<a name="80408w04.html_para11">All those above the income threshold and still receiving the WFTC, including the childcare tax credit, will face marginal deduction rates of:

<P>

<a name="80408w04.html_para12">However, due to the increased income from the Working Families Tax Credit, very few families will face the combined tapers of WFTC, housing benefit and council tax benefit. About 20,000 families, 0.1 per cent.

of those paying tax or NICs will face combined marginal deduction rates greater than 90 per cent. Less than 2 per cent. of families on WFTC will face all three tapers.

 The Treasury has received numerous visits and expressions of interest regarding the PFI from countries worldwide keen to learn of our experiences, and UK firms would of course be entitled to bid for PFI contracts abroad just as foreign companies are entitled to bid for contracts let here.

 Today, I have placed in the Library a table showing what progress has been made by the 41 firms the Government have been monitoring in the period up to 31 March 1998. The table shows that,

<a name="80408w06.html_para1">The Government continue to look to firms for their ongoing commitment to deliver the priority targets. I hope they will also work constructively with the regulators on the second phase of the review, building on the consultation launched by the Financial Services Authority and the Personal Investment Authority last month. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has set the right tone at the start of the process, and I hope that its pragmatic approach to the issues raised by phase 2 of the review will continue over the months ahead.
<P>

<a name="80408w06.html_para2">I have raised in this house on a number of occasions my concern that all pension firms, not just the large firms I am monitoring, must get on with the personal pensions review. Ultimately, responsibility for conducting the reviews rests with the firm concerned--be it a large company or a small IFA. However experience does show that cooperation and collaboration between firms can lead to progress in finding solutions to technical problems which are widely encountered. Recently, ABI announced an initiative to assist and to encourage IFAs to carry out their reviews. These proposals give welcome recognition to the fact that each and every firm's good name is dependent on the reputation of the industry as a whole, and I hope that early implementation of the proposals is achieved.

 Owners' compliance with their undertakings relating to tax exempt land and buildings is regularly monitored on behalf of the Inland Revenue by the appropriate heritage advisory agency. As part of this monitoring, owners have to submit annual reports which include matters regarding the provision of public access, and there are on-site inspections every five years. In addition, the Inland Revenue separately review all cases at five yearly intervals.

 The value of an asset is not a relevant factor in deciding a claim for conditional exemption from inheritance tax (or its predecessor, capital transfer tax). When an asset ceases to be conditionally exempt, tax is charged on its market value at that time. For this purpose, the Valuation Office Agency advises on the value of land and buildings, and the Heritage Section of the Capital Taxes Office deals with valuation of works of art and other chattels.

As these projections exclude windfall tax receipts and associated spending and the UK definition of GGFD is slightly different from the Maastricht version, the following small adjustments are necessary to produce figures on a consistent basis to those set out in Table B24: the current balance should be adjusted downwards by 0.1 per cent. of GDP throughout; the PSBR should be adjusted upwards by 0.2 per cent. of GDP in 1999-2000 and 0.1 per cent. of GDP in later years; and GGFD should be adjusted upwards by 0.2 per cent. of GDP in 1999-2000, 0.1 per cent. of GDP in 2000-01, 0.2 per cent. of GDP in 2001-02 and 0.1 per cent. of GDP in 2002-03.

<a name="80408w08.html_para5">We have decided to proceed with a thorough overhaul of fire safety legislation along the lines set out in the consultation document.

However, I can say that, in broad terms, the Commission's concerns relate to the need to justify the exceptions we have made from the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997, (among them, one for fire certificated premises). They are also concerned that the duties placed on employers by these Regulations should fully reflect the unconditional nature of the responsibilities and obligations imposed on employers by the Framework Directive.

<a name="80408w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) provides national information services to all forces through the Police National Computer (PNC). The PNC is expected to be millennium compliant by early 1999.
<P>

<a name="80408w09.html_para2">Individual chief officers are responsible for ensuring that their local force Information Technology (IT) and communications systems continue to operate beyond the millennium. At the request of chief officers, PITO is supplying advice and guidance to forces to help them in the discharge of that responsibility.
<P>

<a name="80408w09.html_para3">In addition, PITO is responsible for co-ordinating the development and delivery of local IT systems under the National Strategy for Police Information Systems. Three such systems--the HOLMES 2. Custody and Case Preparation applications--will be available by March 1999. A number of forces are expected to take delivery of these applications as replacements for existing non-compliant systems.

 We are developing a voluntary national standard on access to polling stations for disabled voters and guidance will be issued on this in due course. The Society of Local Authority Chief Executive Officers is also reminding its members to pay particular attention to this matter at the May local elections in the light of recent recommendations by organisations such as SCOPE. We will not, however, be carrying out a specific monitoring exercise this year.

<a name="80408w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Information collected centrally on court proceedings is not held in sufficient detail to distinguish domestic violence from other violent offences. Information held centrally on the Home Office Court Proceedings database does not record the relationship between defendant and victim. In some circumstances, this may be implicit through legislation, for instance the offence of infanticide under the Infanticide Act 1938, but this is the exception rather than the rule.

[36571]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80408w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Government recognise the valuable contribution of the Deakin Commission Report to the debate about the relationship between the Government and the voluntary sector. The majority of the Report's recommendations were directed not to the Government but to others, particularly voluntary organisations themselves. The document, "Raising the Voltage", published in November 1996, was the previous Government's response to the Deakin Commission Report. It rejected a key recommendation that a 'concordat' between central Government and the voluntary sector should be drawn up, as a code of good practice, for future relations.
<P>

<a name="80408w09.html_para4">The conclusions of the Deakin Commission Report helped inform the policies contained in the document, "Building the Future Together", published in March 1997 by this Government when in Opposition. "Building the Future Together" proposed the establishment of a compact as a framework for future relations between Government and the voluntary sector. Policy towards the voluntary sector will be developed within that framework.

 None. Feltham provides under school leaving age remand prisoners with at least 15 hours' education per week. This equates to the hours it is required to provide, under the Young Offender Institution Rules, to convicted inmates aged younger than 17.
<P>

<a name="80408w10.html_para0">All education delivered in Prison Service establishments is based on a core curriculum of basic educational skills, basic Information Technology skills and life and social skills.

This will provide a broader curriculum and more hours of education for Young Offender Institution inmates, both on remand and convicted. It will take account of the National Schools Curriculum, but will be tailored to the needs of the majority of such young offenders, whose schooling histories are usually poor.

 CS spray is bio-degradable and does not require any special decontamination procedure. Normal ventilation will remove CS from the environment in approximately 45 minutes, although this might take a little longer depending upon the amount of CS spray used and the level of ventilation. Normal washing of clothing will be sufficient to remove CS from it, although sometimes it may take several washes depending upon the amount of CS used.

 The Government are currently considering the desirability and practicality of introducing a 16 year age limit on the sales of gas lighter refills. The consultation process is at an early stage, and no full assessment of the effects of such a measure has yet been made; but Home Office officials have recently met representatives from local authorities, and have sought the views of other government departments on the proposal. Consultation with other interested bodies will take place shortly.

 There are no centrally held statistics about criminal investigations which are still in progress or which have not been resolved or concluded. It is not clear to me what purpose would be served by any such statistics.

<a name="80408w11.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The primary concern when considering the early release of offenders is risk to the public. While educational achievements in prison may suggest that an offender is making an effort to equip him/herself for life in the community, they will play only a small part in the assessment of the level of risk which early release may pose. Among the proposals in the Crime and Disorder Bill is a Detention and Training Order for juvenile offenders. One of the features of the Order is the provision for early

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made a statement to the House on the Narey Inquiry report on 2 April 1998.
<P>

<a name="80408w11.html_para4">Mr. Narey has made 59 recommendations, many of them relating to the personal security of prisoners. It is our intention to take forward as many of these as possible now that the report is published, but other recommendations require detailed consideration and project teams are being put in place to address these.

<a name="80408w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Given an uncertain political situation, which has a considerable impact on tourism, it is difficult to make projections for tourism revenue and numbers of visitors to Northern Ireland. However, forecasts for 1998 suggest modest growth in terms of revenue to &#163;215 million and overall visitor numbers are anticipated to increase to 1.45 million.

 The budget's measures for small firms, which include a reduction in Corporation Tax rate and generous first year capital allowances will encourage growth and investment by small firms in Northern Ireland, as in the rest of the UK. They are, however, particularly welcome in Northern Ireland where small firms represent a greater proportion of the economy.

 The Northern Ireland Economic Council is a useful and comprehensive survey of the extent and nature of low pay in Northern Ireland. It has been submitted to the Low Pay Commission which I am sure will find it very helpful. The report shows Northern Ireland to be significantly more affected by low pay than other UK regions. The National Minimum Wage will therefore have particular importance for Northern Ireland.

Repeated investments in Northern Ireland by companies such as Nortel, Fujitsu and Emerson reinforce the continuing competitiveness of the Northern Ireland business opportunity.

<a name="80408w13.html_para0">On 7 October 1997 the Royal Ulster Constabulary submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions (Northern Ireland) a police investigation file relating to 30 persons with a view to possible prosecution for offences arising out of events at Mountfield, County Tyrone on 22 June 1997. An interim direction issued to the Chief Constable on 16 October 1997 to arrange a consultation with the investigating officer and a number of police witnesses and for certain additional inquiries to be made. A second consultation was held on 18 December 1997 with investigating police and other senior officers. It was concluded that, in respect of the persons reported, the evidence was insufficient to afford a reasonable prospect of obtaining a conviction. Accordingly, a direction for no prosecution was issued to the Chief Constable on 22 December 1997.

 I have decided that Britannia should be preserved in Edinburgh, in the Port of Leith. Subject to a satisfactory conclusion to negotiations, the former Royal Yacht will be sold to an independent charitable trust being promoted by Forth Ports plc. The trust will take responsibility for the preservation of Britannia, and for running the Yacht as a visitor attraction and as a venue for conferences and other functions. Both Forth Ports and the Manchester Ship Canal Company offered very good ideas; either would have allowed Britannia to be preserved successfully and with dignity. It has been a difficult choice, but a good outcome for Britannia. I am grateful to both for having put forward such excellent proposals.

 The consultation process on the conclusions of the Army's storage rationalisation study, which recommended the closure of the Army Base Storage and Distribution Agency (ABSDA) sub-depots at Thatcham in Berkshire and Old Dalby in Leicestershire, has now ended. A number of representations were received from the trades unions, local councils, individual employees and hon. Members. Having considered these representations very carefully, I am satisfied that no issues have arisen which would call into question the study's recommendations. I intend, therefore, to proceed to implement these recommendations with the objective of ceasing operations at the sub-depot at Old Dalby by 1 April 1999 and that at Thatcham by 1 April 2000.

The costs for 1996/97 also include those for divisional management (Defence Research Agency, Defence Test and Evaluation Organisation, Protection and Life Sciences Division and Centre for Defence Analysis) which were abolished as a result of the reorganisation on 1 April 1997.

 All three Services run comprehensive education packages to combat alcohol misuse. In addition, each of the Services have in place arrangements for treating and rehabilitating those who display signs of alcohol dependency. These measures are kept under review and amended and re-focused as necessary. To this end, the individual Service authorities are free to initiate or commission research as necessary. The most recent such commission was made by the Army in late 1995 when a pilot study was undertaken by a civilian company into the use and misuse of alcohol. A fuller study was 



<P>
<P><I>8 Apr 1998 : Column: 279</I><P>
subsequently conducted by the same company during 1996-97. The study found that the incidence of problems of alcohol misuse among Army personnel was broadly similar to that experienced by an equivalent section of society of the same demographic and socio-economic make up. The report highlighted areas where improvements could be made in education and awareness and these are being addressed. The report is an internal management document and is being used in the development of alcohol policy and awareness training; the interviews on which its conclusions are based were given in confidence. There are therefore no plans to publish the report.

<P>

<a name="80408w16.html_para1">The Government are funding two major epidemiological studies to investigate the health of Gulf veterans and their families. A further epidemiological study into UK Gulf veterans is being funded by the US Department of Defense.

 The information required to provide the lists requested is not available.

Priority is given to sites identified or being considered for disposal and sites in environmentally sensitive areas where a known threat of potential contamination exists, or is strongly suspected. Initial results from these surveys indicate that few MOD sites are affected by radioactive contamination but only some of the highest priority sites have been assessed to date.

Contaminated material arising from the remediation procedure is subsequently disposed of in accordance with letters of agreement issued by the environment agencies.

 Advice to seafarers on how to protect themselves against acts of piracy is available from:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Piracy and Armed Robbery Merchant Shipping Notice (No. 1517) which is being revised and re-issued shortly. This gives practical advice on how to deter and deal with acts of piracy and armed robbery and will be widely disseminated throughout the industry and to seafarers.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="80408w16.html_para6">The Government have always considered the best and most sensible way to combat the problem is through concerted international action through the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and we will be supporting any appropriate counter piracy initiatives that are put forward there.
<P>

<a name="80408w16.html_para7">We have agreed to contribute financially to a series of counter piracy seminars being organised by the IMO; and are considering whether we might be able to send experts to problem areas overseas to offer advice.
<P>

<a name="80408w16.html_para8">The Government share the concerns of the shipping industry and seafarers and accept that piracy is a problem, particularly in some areas of the world where attacks continue and British ships and seamen are at risk. I raised this concern at the Ministerial Conference on Port State Control held in Vancouver at the end of last month and was supported by the delegates from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, the European Commission, Norway, New Zealand, Canada and the IMO.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80408w16.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for what reason the UK delegation to the 10th session of the negotiations for a UN Economic Commission for Europe Convention concerning public participation in environmental decision making, held in Geneva on 3 to 6 March, did not support provisions giving the same rights for the public to participate in decisions relating to GMOs as for other proposed environmental activities; and if he will make a statement.  [37249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80408w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 April 1998]:</i> The Government are committed to a policy of increased transparency and enhanced public participation in decision making in relation to the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms and, as such, supported the inclusion of a provision applying the requirements of the Convention in this context. Our current legislation has such provisions. The drafting of the Convention provision was the subject of considerable debate during the negotiations and the UK was concerned, particularly in view of our role as EU Presidency, to secure a workable 



<P>
<P><I>8 Apr 1998 : Column: 286</I><P>
provision which provides a basis for further development. For that reason, we support a proposal for the first meeting of the Convention Parties to develop the application of the Convention in this field, taking into account work under the Convention on Biological Diversity to develop a protocol on biosafety, in which the United Kingdom is playing a leading role. The provisions of the Convention will be taken into account when the EU revises its own Directive on deliberate releases to the environment later this year.
<P>

<a name="80408w16.html_para9">We do not, however, consider that public participation is practical in all decisions on contained use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). There are estimated to be 20,000 contained use activities underway in GB, in about 450 notified premises. The vast majority of these (estimated to be about 95 per cent.) employ non-pathogenic organisms, such as disabled bacteria or yeasts. The remaining 5 per cent involve work with potentially harmful organisms, such as genetically modified pathogens, and work with these must all be notified to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).
<P>

<a name="80408w16.html_para10">Contained use activities are typically small scale (often in volumes of 100-200 millilitres) and short lived (research projects are often of between 6 months and 3 years duration). These activities are highly controlled and contained using tried and tested methods. The Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 1992 require that physical barriers, supplemented as necessary with biological and chemical barriers, are used to limit the contact of GMOs with the environment and the general population.
<P>

<a name="80408w16.html_para11">Although it would be disproportionately cumbersome to the scale, nature and large number of contained use activities to include them in the Convention, it is clearly important that information be available to the public. In addition to requiring the HSE to keep a public register of information relating to notifications of proposed activities, the legislation also has provision for disclosure of information by HSE when requested to do so.

 Jet Ski is a trade name for one of a variety of personal watercraft (PWC). There are no safety regulations which apply to the use of personal watercraft but consideration is being given to the results of consultation on ways in which the safety of such craft

and other non-regulated pleasure vessels can be improved. A decision on the way forward will be made in the next few months. At the International Boatshow in January, I helped to launch the Royal Yachting Association's (RYA) Personal Watercraft User Training Initiative.

 No proposal has been received from Eurotunnel to replace fire crews from the Kent Fire Brigade with Eurotunnel fire crews at the Channel Tunnel. If such a proposal is made, it will be considered by the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority who will advise the Intergovernmental Commission. Any such correspondence between the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority and Eurotunnel is covered by Clause 33.3 of the Channel Tunnel Concession Agreement of 1986.
<P>

<a name="80408w17.html_para0">Eurotunnel has employed a consultant, Dawsons International, to assist in conducting a review of the staffing of the First Line of Response (FLOR) teams. We understand Eurotunnel has given notice of termination to the current providers of its FLOR personnel--Kent Fire Brigade and the Sapeurs Pompiers of Calais--as a precautionary contractual measure which would take effect only if the results of the study into the staffing of FLOR teams conclude that it would be better to have directly employed labour.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the reply given by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister on 27 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>295-96</i>, in which my right hon.

<P>

<a name="80408w17.html_para3">The review will be conducted in two stages. The first will be a "prior options" study focusing on whether the functions carried out by the Audit Commission are needed and, if so, whether those functions are best undertaken by the Audit Commission or some other body.

 There is, as yet, no specific definition of 'brown field' land, but it is usually taken to mean land previously developed for urban uses, as defined for the Department's Land Use Change Statistics. These uses include residential, transport and utilities, industry and commerce, community services, previously developed vacant land and derelict land. There is also no specific definition of 'green field' land. However, it is usually interpreted as 'land not previously developed'. This includes the Land Use Change 'rural uses' categories, such as agriculture, forestry, open land, water, minerals and landfill, outdoor recreation, defence together with vacant land in urban areas that was not previously developed.

 No, I will not. The European Commission is responsible for proposing European legislation; and while Member States can encourage it to bring forward particular measures, we have no intention of doing so for a measure along the lines suggested by the hon. Member. A significant increase in capacity for incineration with energy recovery is likely to be necessary both to move towards a more sustainable waste management system and to meet the requirements of the draft landfill directive. However, we have made it clear that incineration with energy recovery needs to be considered within a framework that favours waste minimisation and recycling.
<P>

<a name="80408w19.html_para2">The hon. Member may wish to be aware that the European Commission is currently working up a proposal for a new draft directive on emissions from waste incineration. It will replace the existing directives on incineration of municipal waste, with which full compliance has been achieved in England and Wales, and is likely to cover a broad range of other incineration plant. We support the need for strict emission standards for incinerations and welcome the consideration being given by the Commission to detailed issues.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the membership of the taskforce, headed by Lord Rogers of Riverside, set up to look at the use of recycled land; and if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> its powers and <i>(b)</i> the relationship between the task force and (i) regional development agencies, (ii) Government regional offices, (iii) SERPLAN and (iv) county structure plans.

 The membership of the Task Force is currently being finalised. It will incorporate members with a range of backgrounds, including local authorities, the planning, architectural and development professions, interest groups and others with an interest in making the best use of previously developed land. The Task Force will be an advisory body, taking forward its objectives as set out in "Planning for the Communities of the Future". The role of the Government Offices for the Regions, SERPLAN and county structure plans, and the future role of Regional Development Agencies, will not be affected, although I hope that the work of the Task Force will assist these bodies in carrying out their responsibilities.

<P>
<a name="80408w21.html_spnew12"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has recently reviewed in detail the scientific evidence on potential health effects of occupational exposure to ozone. The evidence was presented to the Working group on the Assessment of Toxic Chemicals (WATCH) committee, a tripartite committee of experts in occupational health, in 1995.
<P>

<a name="80408w21.html_para6">WATCH agreed that the lead health effect of ozone is irritation of the upper respiratory tract. Based on the results of studies in human volunteers, WATCH recommended that an Occupational Exposure Standard (OES) of 0.2 ppm (15-minute reference period) should be established in the UK for ozone. This recommendation was endorsed by ACTS (Advisory Committee on Toxic Substances). Thus, within the UK there is now an OES for ozone of 0.2 ppm (15-min reference period).
<P>

<a name="80408w21.html_para7">In relation to exposure to ozone from photocopier machines, short-term (i.e transient) exposures of far below 0.1 ppm occur in normal circumstances. At these levels there is no risk of development of any health effects in office workers in the vicinity of photocopier machines. However, if there is inadequate general ventilation, it has been estimated that exposures up to 0.5 ppm can occur. As long as photocopiers are situated in locations which have adequate general ventilation, ozone concentrations will remain far below the level at which there might be any risk of irritation in office workers.
<P>

<a name="80408w21.html_para8">HSE has issued guidance on ozone (EH38 revised, published 1996), which indicates that working with photocopy and laser printer machines is a low risk activity. As long as there is adequate general ventilation, there will be no risks to health from emissions of substances from these machines.
<P>

<a name="80408w21.html_para9">Photocopy toners are fine powders which have a faint plastic odour. There is an extensive body of experimental research results from studies conducted at a number of laboratories throughout the world, into the potential health effects of a range of 16 different commercial photocopy toners. This research has been evaluated within HSE. This evaluation indicates that photocopy toner dusts are lacking in any specific toxic properties.
<P>

<a name="80408w21.html_para10">Occupational exposure to photocopy toner dusts has been assessed by HSE. This report indicated that even under worst-case scenario conditions (a print-shop operator working continuously for 8-hours and carrying 



<P>
<P><I>8 Apr 1998 : Column: 305</I><P>
out two maintenance procedures during that time), the total exposure to respirable photocopy toner dust would only be 0.0014 mg/m3 (the term "respirable" indicates the airborne fraction which is capable of reaching the lungs).
<P>

<a name="80408w21.html_para11">Overall, it can be concluded that working in close proximity to photocopy machines including carrying out maintenance procedures involving changing toner cartridges etc, will carry no risks of lung damage or other effects on human health in relation to the inhalation of toner dust.
<P>

<a name="80408w21.html_para12">As with other forms of electrical machinery, frequent use generates heat. Thus, photocopy machines should be kept in well ventilated areas as a common sense precaution to prevent the build up of heat which might lead to discomfort in workers in close proximity to such machines.
<P>

<a name="80408w21.html_para13">Emissions from laser-printers are anticipated to be similar to those from photocopy machines, and hence the information provided above should be of relevance in this regard.

<a name="80408w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I am today setting in hand a review, jointly with the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Secretary of State for Wales and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. It will examine the legislation relating to the Environment Agency in England and Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, with a view to identifying any barriers preventing the Agencies from taking an integrated approach to the environment. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution recommended in its nineteenth report (Cm 3165) that such a review should be carried out within three years of the Agencies' taking up their functions, in April 1996.
<P>

<a name="80408w22.html_para1">The terms of reference of the review are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To investigate the possible rationalisation of the regulatory mechanisms which the Environment Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency operate, and the opportunities for integrating regulatory regimes which currently operate on a similar basis but under different legislation, so as:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to identify any significant barriers to integration within each of the Agencies, whose removal would improve the quality of regulation by producing worthwhile improvements in environmental protection and enhancement, customer service and business efficiency,</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to establish whether such barriers could be overcome by administrative means or management action by the Agencies; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>insofar as this is not the case, to recommend legislative changes to enable them to be removed.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>8 Apr 1998 : Column: 307</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80408w22.html_para2">The review is not intended to consider the integration of the philosophical approaches underlying the different regulatory regimes, which are often bound up with European Union legislation. Nor is the review considering integration of the Agencies themselves.
<P>

<a name="80408w22.html_para3">The review will be carried out by the relevant Government Departments and the Agencies. Interested bodies will be invited to contribute their views at an early stage. We envisage that the review will take about a year to complete.
<P>

<a name="80408w22.html_para4">Any legislative changes in England and Wales arising out of the review would be considered by Parliament. Since the results of the review will be submitted around the time of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, it would fall to Scottish Ministers to consider whether to put corresponding proposals to the Scottish Parliament.

<a name="80408w22.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made an Order increasing London taxi fares by 3.67 per cent. on average with effect from Saturday 25 April 1997. The new tariff will incorporate a minimum charge of &#163;1.40 (including a hire charge of &#163;1.00) for the first 462 metres (505.4 yards) or 102 seconds. The rate will then be 20p for every 231 metres (252.7 yards) or 51 seconds until the fare exceeds &#163;9.40 and 20p for each 154 metres (168.5 yards) or 34 seconds thereafter.
<P>

<a name="80408w22.html_para5">The Secretary of State has also approved an increase in the London taxi driver licence fee for &#163;87.00 to &#163;103 (for a three year licence). There will be no increase this year in the fee for a London taxi vehicle licence which has stood at &#163;78 since 1992.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he intends to issue a revised circular on planning and affordable housing; and if he will make a statement. [38755]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80408w22.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 My Department has today issued Circular 6/98: Planning and Affordable Housing, which replaces Circular 13/96. The Circular is intended to provide a clearer framework for preparing plan policies on affordable housing. It should help local planning authorities adopt a more consistent, plan-based approach, which will facilitate speedier and more effective negotiations and decisions on planning applications involving affordable housing.
<P>

<a name="80408w22.html_para6">The Government wish to optimise the contribution that the planning system can make to the overall supply of affordable housing. However, they also want to ensure that affordable housing policies in development plans are consistent with Government guidance and that they are consistently applied.
<P>

<a name="80408w22.html_para7">The new Circular lowers and further revises the existing thresholds, confirms a preference for providing affordable housing as part of the proposed development, and clarifies further the use of financial contributions in 



<P>
<P><I>8 Apr 1998 : Column: 308</I><P>
lieu of on-site provision. It also clarifies that the policy in the Circular applies to all types of new housing proposals.
<P>

<a name="80408w22.html_para8">The Circular revises the existing threshold arrangements so that local planning authorities should only seek an element of affordable housing in:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) housing developments of 25 or more dwellings or residential site of 1 hectare or more, irrespective of the number of dwellings; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) in Inner London, in housing developments of 15 or more dwellings, or to residential sites of 0.5 hectare or more, irrespective of the number of dwellings.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="80408w22.html_para9">In settlements in rural areas with a population of 3,000 or fewer, the local planning authority should adopt appropriate thresholds. The new arrangements also provide, in exceptional circumstances, for local planning authorities in those areas where the higher threshold at (a) would apply to seek to adopt a lower threshold, through the local plan process. These threshold arrangements should be based on assessments which include local needs and available supply of land for housing, and adopted only through the local plan process.
<P>

<a name="80408w22.html_para10">Where a local planning authority has not yet adopted its local plan or UDP it will have to have regard to Circular 6/98 in preparing its plan. However, PPG1 makes it clear that where development plans are very close to adoption at the time that new information (including guidance) becomes available, it may be preferable to adopt the plan and then start an immediate review. Therefore, in cases where plans are close to adoption (for example where a modifications stage has already been held and no further modifications on other issues are proposed by the local authority), it may be appropriate, in order to prevent further delay, for the local planning authority to adopt its plan and to prepare proposals for early alterations to the plan having regard to the policy guidance in Circular 6/98.
<P>

<a name="80408w22.html_para11">Local planning authorities should prepare such proposals for alterations expeditiously and agree timetables for alteration with the Government Office for the Region. In cases where local planning authorities fail to take such action promptly, the Secretary of State may well consider it appropriate to direct them to prepare alterations to their adopted development plans within a specified period.
<P>

<a name="80408w22.html_para12">All local planning authorities will have to take into account the policy guidance in the new Circular in determining application for planning permission.
<P>

<a name="80408w22.html_para13">The Government will monitor the implementation of the affordable housing policy and intend to incorporate the advice in the new Circular in the future revision of PPG3: Housing.

 The British Steel industry as a whole, like other parts of the manufacturing sector, is affected by the current strength of sterling.

 Maintenance activities are currently planned to minimise traffic congestion. The use of overnight and off-peak working whenever possible together with an embargo on all but essential works during Bank and school holiday periods ensures that full road capacity is available for peak flows. Future proposals include the provision of enhanced driver information and traffic management systems with longer term proposals for capacity enhancement improvements at critical points on the network. These proposals are being assessed as part of the ongoing review of the Welsh trunk road programme. Details of the strategy for and role of the programme will be included in the report on the roads review to be published later this year.

 Alyn and Deeside does not currently meet the eligibility criteria for Objective 2 or 5(b) funding. There will therefore be no financial loss to the area under the new Objective 2 criteria post-1999.

<P>
<a name="80408w24.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 I have taken a strong policy line on the appointment of women in Wales. I have set a goal of increasing the proportion of women in public appointments to over 30 per cent. by the year 2001. I have put new procedures for public appointments based on open competition and appointment on merit in place.
<P>

<a name="80408w24.html_para8">General practice is that appointments are now advertised publicly and widely, nominations are accepted from a variety of sources such as self nominations, professional and representative associations. I have personally ensured that all shortlists for appointments for which I am responsible include women candidates.
<P>

<a name="80408w24.html_para9">My Department is developing a programme with representative organisations to increase the pool of good candidates from a variety of backgrounds. As part of this programme my Department has developed proposals for innovative public appointment pilot projects. I will be making an announcement about the detail of these pilot projects in June.
<P>

<a name="80408w24.html_para10">Alongside of this my Department is constantly seeking ways to improve the public appointments process and to raise awareness with different representative groups of women. Greater media cover both in newspapers and the radio have already been put into place, and presentations being given to key audiences.
<P>

<a name="80408w24.html_para11">My policy is already seeing results with a 2 per cent. increase of women in appointments from 26 per cent. to 28 per cent. since last year.

 Information on expenditure on anti-drugs education and other drug reduction initiatives in each of the past 14 years is not held centrally. Similarly, the costs of any similar campaigns in each of the next five years are unlikely to be available from a central source.
<P>

<a name="80408w25.html_para0">In 1997-98 the Department spent &#163;1 million on combating drug and alcohol misuse, &#163;500,000 of which was used to operate the Welsh Drug and Alcohol Unit, &#163;100,000 to support Drug and Alcohol Action Teams and the remainder was used towards other drug and alcohol initiatives.

<P>
<a name="80408w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 This information is not available in the form requested. However, there is evidence that anti-drugs education campaigns are effective in reducing drug misuse. For example, positive results in delaying the onset of illegal drug use were demonstrated in "Project Charlie" (Home Office report). this used multi-faceted interventions which addressed knowledge, skills and attitudes within the context of a range of background factors such as price, availability, peer pressure, curiosity, incomes, unemployment, life events etc.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he made of progress towards <i>(a)</i> multi-party democracy and <i>(b)</i> protection of human rights in Kenya (i) prior to and (ii) since the Kenyan elections in 1997; and if he will make a statement.  [37985]

<a name="80408w27.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> Following pressure, both internal and from the UK and other donors, the Kenyan Parliament approved reforms in late 1997, which among other things allowed 26 parties to stand in the elections in December 1997. The EU statement of 6 January made the point that these elections were a further step towards greater democracy but noted that there were still shortcomings. The results are still being contested. Ten parties are represented in the new Parliament. On 2 April, the Attorney-General announced a cross-party Committee to take forward the constitutional review process. We welcome efforts to ensure that this process remains broad-based and inclusive.
<P>

<a name="80408w27.html_para0"><i>(b)</i> We receive reports from a variety of sources about human rights in Kenya. We are particularly concerned about evidence of persistent police brutality, torture and extra-judicial killings.

<a name="80408w28.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Standard numbers are set on the basis of the capacity of the school as a whole. The organisation of pupils within a school is a matter for LEAs, governors and headteachers. This may mean that a school is able to adapt to class size policy without needing a reduction in standard number. The measures we are taking in the School Standards and Framework Bill will require each Authority to produce a statement setting out how they intend to implement limits on class sizes including the need for any variation to standard numbers. The Bill also provides that in deciding a proposal to reduce the standard number at a primary school the School Organisation Committee shall have regard to any limits imposed on class sizes. It further provides for the Secretary of State to suspend for a specified period the requirement to recruit up to the standard number for the purpose of enabling any limit on class sizes to be met.

 The Export Control Organisation's computer databases have been interrogated and the results are as follows. Between 14 November 1997 and 6 March 1998 inclusive, 29 Standard Individual Export Licences were issued to export to end-users or consignees in Indonesia goods subject to export control by being listed in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order (the so-called "Military List"), and none was revoked; two applications for such Licences were refused. This information is summarised below, broken down according to the entries in the Military List under which the goods on each licence are controlled (known as their rating). It could not be broken down in the manner requested as the equipment covered by most entries in the Military List could be used by military, paramilitary or police end-users. Standard Individual export licences can cover a range of goods, controlled under several entries

in the legislation. Where this is so the licence is included in the Table in the total shown against each of the relevant ratings.

This does not include Media OIELs, which are Open Individual Export Licences authorising the export to any destination of protective clothing, mainly for the protection of aid agency workers and journalists when working in areas of conflict.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what impact the criteria set out in the written answer of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of 28 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>26-29</i>, have had on the <i>(a)</i> number and <i>(b)</i> proportion of export licences circulated to other departments by the Export Control Organisation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80408w31.html_spnew10"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The criteria announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs are intended to ensure that arms transfers are managed responsibly and that they do not contribute to internal repression or international aggression. Therefore, the announcement did not result in any change to the arrangements by which DTI circulates applications. Irrespective of whether or not they have to be circulated, the number of applications received by the Department at any time is affected by many factors, and any change could not be ascribed to any one factor alone.

 The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) set up a working group, chaired by Professor Bernard Atkinson, with the following terms of reference:
<P>

<P>

<a name="80408w33.html_para4">It is for the BBSRC Council to take decisions on the future of the IFR, and subsequent action as necessary. The Council considered the working group's report on 10 February, and issued a press release the following day giving details of its conclusions to date.

<P>

<a name="80408w33.html_para5">I understand that the report was in the nature of advice to the Council and Chief Executive, and contained commentary that would be commercially damaging if published, as well as references to individuals. The BBSRC is therefore not inclined to publish the report. However, once final decisions are taken in the light of the further analysis of options for the future development of the IFR, currently being undertaken by the Chief Executive, BBSRC intends to publish the rationale for those decisions.
<P>

<a name="80408w33.html_para6">The White Paper "The Food Standards Agency: A Force for Change" made it clear that basic and strategic research into food would continue to be funded by the Research Councils and carried out by Research Council institutes, other institutes and universities as at present. The Institute of Food Research (IFR) will continue to be sponsored and funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.
<P>

<a name="80408w33.html_para7">The Food Standards Agency will be responsible for determining its own research needs and commissioning research where it thinks best. I understand that the BBSRC working group, chaired by Professor Atkinson, recommended that a new strategic plan should be established in close partnership with the major users and beneficiaries of the IFR's research, and in particular that discussions should begin as soon as possible with the Agency to ensure that the IFR's research effectively underpins the Agency's work. The BBSRC Council agreed that the future development of the IFR and its scientific programme should be considered in the light of this and other recommendations from the working group, and the further analysis is proceeding accordingly.

The purpose of the Act is to ensure that funds are available to pay any compensation awarded where an employee (or dependant) has been successful in a civil action brought to establish an employer's liability for the injury or disease suffered by the employee.

 Following wide consultation in 1993/94 in the run-up to coal privatisation, arrangements were put in place to safeguard the interests of members of the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme (BCSSS). In exchange for providing a comprehensive guarantee that pension and deferred pension entitlements will rise at least in line with the retail prices index (RPI), the BCSSS Trustees agreed that the Government should receive 50% of any surpluses identified at periodic Scheme valuations.

 <i>[holding answer 6 April 1998]:</i> I am determined to ensure that UK consumers are able to buy cars at the lowest possible prices. The European Commission, in January, announced its decision to fine Volkswagen ECU 102 million (about &#163;67 million) for prohibiting its Italian dealers from selling cars to buyers from Germany and Austria, who wished to take advantage of the lower prices in Italy. DTI officials are currently discussing with the Commission what the implications of this case are for UK consumers wishing to buy right-hand drive cars at the lowest possible cost.
<P>

<a name="80408w35.html_para0">At the Government's initiative, the Commission are also undertaking studies of price differentials in EU markets, and the Government are keen for this work to be pushed forward.

 My right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade made it clear when announcing the Government's plans for a major review of company law on 4 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>636-37</i>, that, while she did not rule out legislating to improve standards of corporate governance, she was in the first instance looking to companies and institutional investors to deliver improvements based on the best practice recommendations made by Cadbury, Greenbury, Hampel and others. The text of my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade's speech, which was made at a conference organised by Pensions Investment Research Consultants Limited (PIRC), is available on my Department's web site at http://www.dti.gov.uk/Minspeech/pircfin.htm.

 There is no evidence that products have been marketed in the United Kingdom which breach the internationally accepted levels for phthalates. Under the Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995 and the General Product Safety Regulations 1994 suppliers are under a statutory obligation to supply safe toys and other products intended for children and action can be taken against a supplier of such articles found to release unacceptable levels of phthalates.

 On 6 March the Department complied with a Court Order giving it four weeks to send detailed proposals to solicitors acting on behalf of the plaintiffs to settle the over 20,000 current claims and thousands more which are expected. We believe these proposals are fair and sensible and provide the quickest way of ensuring valid claims are settled. At a further hearing on 27 March the solicitors acting for the plaintiffs requested a three month adjournment which the Court granted, to allow for further discussions to take place with the Department's agents to seek to agree settlement arrangements.
<P>

<a name="80408w35.html_para2">We welcome this opportunity to further refine our proposals and hope that agreement can be reached quickly so payments can begin. However, we are also conscious that a further 3 month delay may be unwelcome to some claimants, particularly those who are severely disabled. We have therefore offered to make interim payments of &#163;2,000 to a minimum of 5,000 elderly claimants currently in receipt of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit for chronic bronchitis and emphysema. We will begin making such offers as soon as the claimants' solicitors, whose co-operation we require, are able to submit evidence of receipt of the benefit. I am sure they will do all they can to assist this process to ensure that payments can be make quickly to their injured clients.
<P>

<a name="80408w35.html_para3">Some of the claims are expected to be from those miners who suffered from chronic bronchitis, alone. We are seeking to agree sensible payment arrangements also for those in this group. However none of the lead cases included in the judgment provided clear guidance on an appropriate level of damages for this condition.
<P>

<a name="80408w35.html_para4">Therefore, if it is not possible to reach agreement, it may be necessary, while accepting the liability established by the Court, for a further case to be run to establish a level of damages against which other similar claims can be assessed. We believe that such a case could, if need be, be brought to trial quickly and we would do everything possible to ensure that this happened.
<P>

<a name="80408w35.html_para5">I have said already that we have a duty to deal promptly with valid claims that stem from British Coal's previous activities and actions over many years. We are actively meeting that duty. We hope the plaintiffs' solicitors work with us to agree sensible arrangements to allow relevant claims to be processed systematically, and valid claims to be settled as soon as is practicable.

 Precise details of stocks of fireworks which may no longer be sold to the general public are not available. The proposals for safety regulations to prohibit certain fireworks were published in mid-June 1997 and sent to a wide range of companies, as well as to organisations representing retailers and other interests. The proposals, which received widespread publicity in the national press and on television, were also sent direct to all major firework suppliers to ensure that they were in a position to offer advice about possible changes in the law before deliveries of fireworks commenced for the 1997 firework season.

 We are aware of the decision by the London Lighthouse Council of Management to resite the Lighthouse's day care and other support services for people with HIV and AIDS in new premises from September 1998 and that this will involve the closure of its residential unit and the sale of its Lancaster Road building. This option was identified following extensive discussions between London Lighthouse and Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster Health Authority to identify a viable option for restructuring the Lighthouse's services in view of the financial difficulties it faces. The Lighthouse, like many other HIV and AIDS voluntary organisations, has been responding to changes in service requirements for people with HIV and AIDS which have been identified through local needs assessment and the need to maximise value for money, and, more recently, taking into account the effects of combination therapies, results from which so far are very encouraging in delaying the progression of HIV and the onset of AIDS.
<P>

<a name="80408w36.html_para2">I have met twice with the London Lighthouse to be advised about its position and I welcome the work which the London Lighthouse has done with Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster Health Authority to identify an option which seeks to safeguard the London Lighthouse's day care and other support services. Work is in hand to identify the practical implications of this option. Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster have agreed in principle to provide transitional funding to support the option, subject to public accountability requirements and a robust business case which meets the necessary financial conditions.
<P>

<a name="80408w36.html_para3">The Lighthouse has made a valuable contribution over the years to raise awareness and change attitudes to HIV and AIDS, and has continued to play a national role in the development of policy and services for people with HIV and AIDS in changing circumstances created by new treatments. I have agreed in principle to repeat its grant of &#163;150,000 for 1998/99, bringing the total financial support provided by the Department over the years to the Lighthouse to more than &#163;4 million.

 In reducing waiting lists we remain committed to the principles that the National Health Service must retain the capacity to respond promptly and effectively to emergencies and that clinical priority and the urgency of a patient's condition are the main factors which should determine how long patients on waiting lists wait for treatment. We have set the target that by April 1999 there will be fewer patients awaiting admission to hospital in England than the 1.16 million we inherited after the election. This will be the stepping stone to meeting our election pledge to reduce waiting lists to 100,000 below the level we inherited by the end of the present Parliament. &#163;320 million of the extra &#163;500 million for the NHS announced in the Budget will be spent directly on cutting waiting lists.

In addition to the above figures, NHS Supplies' Wholesaling Division's transport fleet spent approximately &#163;1.33 million on fuel costs (almost exclusively Derv) in 1997-98 and estimate this will rise to &#163;1.47 million in 1998-99.<P>

There is no evidence yet that the hazard is leading to a direct reduction in hearing function, but there is an increase in tinnitus.

 The Government are keen to encourage women aged 65 and over to request free three-yearly mammograms, and their entitlement to do so is widely publicised. In particular, the National Health Screening breast screening programme is working with Age Concern to encourage older women to request screening. They have produced a leaflet called "65 or over: You are still entitled to breast screening", which is widely available from general practitioners surgeries, clinics, some post offices and some shops. In addition, women who have already been screened through the programme are informed of their right to request free three-yearly screening after the age of 64.

<a name="80408w38.html_para1">The number of women aged 65 and over being screened has risen from 39,000 two years ago to over 57,000 last year. We are delighted that more and more women are making use of this important service.

<BR>
I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about Child Support Agency cases that pre-date April 1993.
<BR>
Some 340,000 cases were deferred in December 1994 where the client was in receipt of Income Support prior to April 1993 and where there had been no Agency contact, and a further 16,000 cases deferred in January-March 1995 where a maintenance application form had been issued before July 1994 and either had not been returned or lacked the necessary information.
<BR>
The Agency recommenced take on of these cases in November 1995, in line with the agreement made with the Secretary of State to recommence take on by December 1995.
<BR>
It is not possible to give an exact figure for the number of deferred cases still outstanding. To obtain this a clerical examination of all the deferred cases would have to be made to find those appropriate for action and this would incur disproportionate cost. In November 1997, it was estimated that the number outstanding had reduced to around 150,000 cases.
<BR>
This reduction is due to a number of reasons. The recommencement of take on mentioned above; also, in some cases where Income Support has ceased and the parent with care has made a fresh application for benefit, the Agency will have become involved and these cases will have been taken on; in other cases the parent with care will have requested that the Agency take on the case and this will have been done; finally, some clients will no longer be claiming Income Support.
<BR>
Where the Agency has taken-on cases, the length of time taken to complete a maintenance assessment is measured, and cases which exceed 52 weeks are considered to be a backlog; this backlog currently stands at approximately 113,000 from 225,000 at 31 March 1997.
<BR>
The Agency has developed and is now implementing a strategy for meeting its undertaking to clear its backlogs. All Business Units have put in place operational plans which will guide them towards the achievement of our stated objective of clearing backlogs by 31 March 1999.
<BR>
The Agency is tackling the backlog of cases. However, we must balance the demands placed on us--to deliver Secretary of State targets, to continue to improve performance and improve customer service--and clearance of the backlogs.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about child maintenance debt.
<BR>
The amount of child support full maintenance assessment debt outstanding as at the 31 March 1998, was &#163;691,416,505.67. This has increased from the amount reported as outstanding at 31 March 1997 in the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts for 1996-97 which was &#163;513,029,000. The increase in the amount of maintenance debt is largely a result of the rise of the Agency's live and assessed caseload, which has risen from 585,220 at 31 March 1997 to 758,580 at 31 March 1998.
<BR>
The Agency undertakes a Debt Analysis exercise at the end of each financial year, which estimates the collectability of the amounts outstanding. The results as at 31 March 1997 for 1996-97 are shown in the table attached, with definitions of the classifications. A similar exercise will be undertaken for 1997-98 and the results will be published in the Agency's 1997-98 Annual Report and Accounts in July 1998.

I have placed a list of Agency offices by region, showing the information you have requested for the period from April 1997 in the library.
<BR>
As I am sure you are aware, the Agency is in the process of reviewing its organisation to improve the service that we deliver. Our plans for re-organising are fully in line with the Government strategy of modernising the delivery of public services and reinforce more effectively parental responsibility. We believe our plans will increase compliance and the regularity of payment of maintenance and play an important part in helping lone parents return to work. It may help to explain some details of our current organisation to show how we plan to improve our accessibility to the public substantially.

The Agency currently has approximately 2900 staff working in Field offices throughout the country. In excess of 95% of those staff are engaged on backroom paper processing work so they do not have any face to face contact with the public at all and are no more accessible than those in the major processing centres. The number of staff years which are devoted to face-to-face contact is currently 120 which in many locations equates to fewer than one interview per day. We feel that this is not sufficient. Our restructuring will allow us to offer significantly more face to face contact on a peripatetic basis in a greater range of locations in conjunction with the Benefits Agency (with whom many of our clients are also concerned). At the same time we need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of other forms of contact with customers. We also need to improve our overall cost-efficiency sufficiently to keep pace with increases of 50% in our workloads over the next 3 years.
<BR>
We know that many of our customers who are working prefer to deal with us by 'phone rather than be visited at home or interviewed in one of our offices. We are developing proposals on how we might re-focus our resources to cope with an increasing workload while at the same time seeking to increase and improve both our telephone and our face to face contact. Our current thinking is that we can move processing work into the Child Support Agency Centres and larger local centres to provide economies of scale and much better value for money. Processing paper in small offices is significantly more expensive and our restructuring will allow us to increase our overall range of customer contact, as well as keeping pace with workloads.

While we may not retain a permanent presence at all our present sites we will provide interview facilities at a larger range of local outlets. We know that a proportion of our customers will want to have face to face contact with us for a number of reasons although not necessarily at a DSS office. We are exploring a number of options which will include for example Citizens Advice Bureaux or other Government facilities to increase our accessibility to the public.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to her answer of 13 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>394</i>, what rate of real increase in average earnings is assumed in her estimate that Class 1 National Insurance contribution rates would stay constant if pensions and linked benefits were uprated by earnings in April 1999. [35925]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80408w40.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The analysis used an assumption based on data and evidence available at the time of the Pre-Budget Report. Although the extra cost of uprating in line with earnings would be &#163;260 million, the rounding conventions used to calculate National Insurance contributions mean that the difference between the earnings assumption and the price assumption leads to a cost which is insufficient to trigger a change in the National Insurance contribution rate for April 1999.

<P>
<a name="80408w40.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The information is set out in the table.
<P>

<a name="80408w40.html_para0">The Department makes no estimates of the number of employees who are likely to pay National Insurance contributions in future years. However, the Government Actuary undertakes a Quinquennial Review of the operation of the Social Security Acts to estimate the rates of contribution likely to be required in future years to meet the costs of benefits provided for under the National Insurance Scheme. The assumed number of future contributors in his Report on the Third Quinquennial Review under Section 137 of the Social Security Act 1975 published on 31 January 1995 <sup>1</sup>  was, in an average week, 22.7 million for the year 2000, 24.0 million for 2010 and 24.0 million for 2020.
<P>

<a name="80408w40.html_para1">The estimates for future years in the Government Actuary's report are based on a number of underlying economic and demographic assumptions. These include projections of the number of employees and self-employed people, assumptions about earnings and the level of the lower earnings limit and the level of unemployment. From these assumptions the Government Actuary derives the estimated average number of contributors in any week for future years. However, these estimates are not directly comparable with those for previous years given in the table. The figures in the table

 Winter Fuel Payments are paid automatically without the need to claim, therefore take up is not an issue.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent parliamentary questions asking for what reasons Dr. and Mrs. Michael Norris of Broom Knolls, Lawford, Manningtree, Essex, were paid two winter fuel payments; and how many households have received winter fuel payments in excess of their entitlement; and what measures are being taken to recover excess payments.
<BR>
The making of almost ten million winter fuel payments to over seven million pensioner households before the end of March 1998 has been a challenging task for the Benefits Agency. This will have been achieved whilst maintaining normal benefit business.
<BR>
Around one and a half million of the poorest pensioners, those receiving Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, received their payment of &#163;50 during January.
<BR>
Other eligible pensioners are entitled to a payment of &#163;20 or &#163;10. Where they live alone, are the only eligible pensioner in a household, or are of no fixed abode, they are entitled to &#163;20; otherwise, they are entitled to &#163;10.
<BR>
In order to establish other eligible pensioners, correctly identify pensioner households, and determine the amount each should receive, it was necessary to match around fifteen million computer records, involving fifteen qualifying benefits, across nine computer systems. Where only one eligible person was identified as living at an address a payment of &#163;20 was made. Where more than one eligible person was identified as living at an address a payment of &#163;10 was made.
<BR>
Where official Departmental records are not correct or incomplete, it is possible that the amount of some payments may not correspond with the actual circumstances. For example, where two eligible pensioners live at the same address but in separate households. In such cases, each eligible person will have been sent a payment of &#163;10 when they should have received &#163;20. The award letter which accompanies the payment clearly explains the entitlement conditions and informs anyone who receives a &#163;10 payment, but satisfies the conditions for a &#163;20 payment, to contact the Benefits Agency Office which deals with their pension, or to telephone the Winter Fuel Helpline, and request the balance. Requests for a review of the original decision to pay &#163;10 are being dealt with as a matter of priority.
<BR>
Where two eligible pensioners live at the same address and in the same household, but the address details held on the relevant benefit computer records are incorrect or incomplete for either or both of them, the matching exercise may not identify more than one eligible person at the address recorded. In accordance with the provisions of the legislation each are entitled to a payment of &#163;20. There is no overprovision in such instances, but any voluntarily offer to repay any amount would be accepted. When an erroneous payment has been made or payment issued for an incorrect amount, appropriate action will be taken regarding the excess/over payment.
<BR>
In the case to which you refer, we have not been able to identify the couple named. However, we have identified two people with a similar name to those given who were not identified as living at the same address in the matching process due to differences on their computer records. We have no record of making any payments to the named persons you have asked about, but I will investigate further and reply separately on this matter.
<BR>
So far, fewer than 10,000 of the &#163;50 payments made during January have been identified as being incorrectly made. I am unable at present to provide you with information which takes into account payments of &#163;20 or &#163;10 made incorrectly. This is due to the fact that these payments are still in the process of being issued. It is anticipated that this information will be available some time after the end of April. I will provide the information on excess entitlement once it is available.
<BR>
Thank you for the opportunity to explain the position.

 Any lump-sum payment made in consequence of a personal injury--which would include a vaccine damage payment--can be ignored providing it is held in a Trust. The normal rules on deprivation of capital do not apply to a person who puts money from such an award into a Trust. The treatment of payments from Trusts depends on the terms and nature of the Trust itself and the purpose and use of the payments. For example, a regular payment from a discretionary Trust can be fully disregarded provided it is intended and used for items other than normal day-to-day living expenses. These rules enable personal injury awards to be used for the benefit of the injured person without affecting income-related benefits. More generally, we will keep the operation of the income and capital rules under review as we develop the principles announced in the Welfare Reform Green Paper.

<P>
<a name="80408w41.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The first Housing Benefit review, in 1995, estimated the overall cost of incorrectness in Housing Benefit to be around &#163;1 billion: this estimate includes confirmed and suspected fraud, as well as claimant and official error. The Department is currently conducting a further review to update that estimate.

<a name="80408w41.html_para5">Together with local authorities, we have taken significant steps to tackle Housing Benefit fraud, but more needs to be done. We made it clear in our Green Paper "New ambitions for our country: A contract for welfare reform" that rooting out fraud is an essential part of welfare reform. We have set up a fundamental review of the Department's counter-fraud strategy and are looking to strengthen each part of it, through earlier prevention, more effective deterrence, better detection.

 We want to develop a Social Security system that promotes the wider aims of welfare reform: work for those who can; security for those who cannot. Local authorities have an important part to play in this process and we are consulting them on our proposals in the Green Paper--"New ambitions for our country: a contract for welfare reform".

<a name="80408w42.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 April 1998]:</i> The original savings estimates show that for an investment of &#163;11.5 million in each of the three years covered by the 1996 Public Expenditure Survey, savings were assumed as &#163;27 million in 1997-98, &#163;40 million in 1998-99 and &#163;35 million in 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="80408w42.html_para1">These savings estimates comprise &#163;20 million/ &#163;30 million/&#163;28 million from the targeted review and renewal activity undertaken by the Benefit Integrity Project and &#163;7 million/&#163;10 million/&#163;7 million as a result of fraud detection activity in Disability Living Allowance generally.
<P>

<a name="80408w42.html_para2">The latest savings estimate for the Project alone is &#163;5/40/40 million, and this is the figure included in the Department's Memorandum to the Social Security Select Committee. The estimated savings for the Project have fallen from &#163;20 million to &#163;5 million in the first year, largely because live running has shown that processing performance has been considerably slower than expected. Estimated savings for years two and three are higher than anticipated as a result of higher than expected average savings per case coupled with cases being pushed forward from year one. The original assumption was that 220,000 cases would be processed in each of the first two years. Monitoring data up to the end of December 1997 suggests that 60,00 cases will have been processed by the end of year one. The latest estimate is also based on the expectation that the Project will process 220,000 cases in year two.
<P>

<a name="80408w42.html_para3">The latest estimate does not take account of the impact of the additional safeguard introduced on 9 February on further evidence gathering. Nor does it include additional changes which Secretary of State and Baroness Hollis have decided to implement following consultation with the disability organisations. We will continue to work with the disability organisations and will monitor the effects of improvements.
<P>

<a name="80408w42.html_para4">A revised savings estimate for 1997-1998 and subsequent years will be produced when all the information up to the end of March has been received. These may need further revision as monitoring continues.

2. The following assumptions have been made:<P>

 (a) The benefit unit is defined as being a lone parent with 2 children under the age of 11 working full-time.<P>

 (b) Given that Marginal Deduction Rates can vary within the specified income bands a mid-point for a measure of gross weekly earnings has been used.<P>

 (c) In order that the benefit unit is still entitled to Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit at gross weekly earnings in excess of &#163;300, housing costs at &#163;90 per week and council tax liability at &#163;28 per week have been used in the calculations.<P>

<a name="80408w43.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We have made it clear in our Green Paper "New ambitions for our country: A Contract for Welfare" that rooting out fraud is an essential part of welfare reform. Our principle is that the benefits system should encourage openness and honesty and that the gateways to benefit should be clear and enforceable. We have inherited a system which is seriously afflicted by fraud. As the Report by the Committee of Public Accounts on Housing Benefit fraud has shown, the old ways of tackling fraud do not work on their own. That is why we are completing a fundamental review of the Department's counter-fraud strategy and are looking to strengthen each part of it: earlier prevention, more effective deterrence, better detection. In the longer term, we can prevent fraud by designing benefit systems which minimise the scope for fraud.
<P>

<a name="80408w43.html_para0">Together with local authorities, we are already taking significant steps to address Housing Benefit fraud through, for instance: new powers for local authorities to tackle landlord fraud, and providing financial support for a special pilot local authority team in London which is already at work to root out organised landlord fraud across London borough boundaries; supporting new visiting drives by local authorities to root out fraud--over

&#163;1 million is being provided to London boroughs this year which is expected to generate more than 200,000 extra visits; a new framework of guidance being introduced this year, backed up with extra financial support, to help authorities check claims better and so prevent fraud; the new Benefit Fraud Inspectorate, whose inspection programme which has started recently will help raise standards in local authorities and the Department; and improved liaison arrangements and systems between the Benefits Agency and local authorities.

Tables showing (i) the amount of weekly benefit savings claimed in respect of Housing Benefit fraud and (ii) identified incorrect payments of Housing Benefit due to established fraud for the years 1993-94 to 1996-97 for each London local authority have been placed in the Library.

 The Department has a wide range of measures in place for tackling benefit fraud nationwide, including in Hackney. We have set out in the Green Paper "A New Contract for Welfare" our three pronged approach to fraud consisting of improved detection, more effective deterrence, and better prevention. To that end we are reviewing our strategic objectives governing counter fraud work, and we expect to be in a position to announce the outcome of the Review shortly.

2. Departmental Report.<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The information requested is not available for May 1992 and is not yet available for May 1997.<P>

2. Expenditure figures are estimates and have been calculated using the Housing Benefit Management System 1 per cent. sample and Departmental Reports. Estimates are based only on cases recorded on the Income Support Quarterly Statistical Enquiry as being asylum seekers. They therefore exclude other claimants in receipt of Urgent Case Payments who may in fact be asylum seekers, but are not identified as such. They also exclude any asylum seekers, in receipt of Housing Benefit who are not in receipt of Income Support, although the number of these cases is thought to be very small.<P>

3. Figures have been rounded to the nearest five million pounds.<P>
