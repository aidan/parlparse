 The Sex and Relationships Education (SRE) steering group was established in March 2008 and had its final meeting in October 2008, at which it signed-off its report and recommendations to Government.

The young-people survey was supplemented with a residential event with a small group of UK Youth Parliament members to discuss issues in more detail. The administration of the surveys, the analysis of the results and facilitation of the residential event were undertaken by the Sex Education Forum, which was paid &#163;13,625 to carry out this work; and</p>

Significant improvements have been introduced, including the widespread deployment of encryption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="90112w0005.htm_para8"><a name="09011226000125">The information about lost and stolen equipment, given in response to the question referred to, was obtained from centrally maintained records of security incidents. Detail is not available from these central records to indicate the nature of disciplinary action that was taken in individual cases. Such information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost, given that the bulk of these incidents occurred a number of years ago. However, the Department is currently reviewing its disciplinary policies to better reflect the importance which it attaches to the security of valuable assets and information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="90112w0005.htm_para9"><a name="09011226000126">Following the Cabinet Office review of Data Handling Procedures in Government, the Department has designated senior staff as Information Asset Owners, who are personally accountable for providing assurance in relation to the information assets within their respective business areas. Additional steps taken to reduce future losses include measures which prevent employees from copying information to removable media, except where this has been encrypted.</p>

 DWP treats temporary and permanent employees in the same way. All employees are paid on the basis of an annual salary and not an hourly rate. The appropriate starting salary is determined by grade and employees are normally recruited onto the minimum of their pay band. Progression up the pay band is based upon the annual pay review. It is possible for employees within a grade to be on different rates of pay but this is normally due to factors such as individual length of service or the effects of pay increases following previous promotion.</p>

1. Interpretation of these data needs to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the nomis website.<br>
2. Notified vacancies include any speculative placings recorded by Jobcentre Plus. Datasets from May 2006 may reflect substantially reduced levels of speculative placings as part of the notified series. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br>
3. The stocks of unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br>
4. Data are unrounded.<br>
5. Figures cover only those vacancies advertised through Jobcentre Plus, and so will not capture all available vacancies. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>

We remain the largest office network in Government with 747 modern Jobcentres which are supported by 31 contact centres and 79 main benefit processing centres. This has brought our customer facing services together in a more coherent and integrated network and I believe Jobcentre Plus is well-placed to respond to the full range of economic conditions.</p>

Applications for the period include all applications from potential non-resident parents or parents with care as well as, for the period to 14 July 2008 all applications from Jobcentre Plus when a parent with care applies for benefits and their details are sent directly to the Agency. Many of these applications are in fact a change of circumstance on an existing case or are closed prior to a maintenance schedule being set up.<br>
2. Applications resulting in a payment include cases both where a payment has been made through the Agency and where a maintenance direct agreement has been arranged between a non resident parent and parent with care.<br>
3. This table consists of information already published in tables 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 of the Child Support Agency Quarterly Summary of Statistics.<br>
4. From 14 July 2008, new benefit claimants were no longer compelled to use the Child Support Agency. This has resulted in a reduction in the number of applications and potential applications received from Jobcentre Plus and therefore the number of clearances.<br>
5. A significant proportion of applications cleared and which have progressed to payments stage in August and September 2008 will not yet have received the first payment, the number of cases cleared in these months that subsequently receive payment will rise.<br>
6. The figures in this table are a snapshot of the status of cases at the end of September 2008 and are therefore subject to revision.<br>
7. This table counts applications for Child Support. Not all applications become live cases. Information on the number of cases that are progressed clerically is not included in this table.<br>
8. Refers to cases assessed as initially having a positive maintenance liability, which also progress to payment stage, including Maintenance Direct Cases. It does not include cases initially assessed with a positive maintenance liability which are subsequently closed or reassessed as not having a maintenance liability.<br>

 In general, the Foresight report provided helpful reassurance that scientific evidence supports the welfare reforms the Government are and will be making.

The Government have accepted her recommendations and will be developing the first ever cross government National Strategy for Mental Health and Employment, which will help us improve work outcomes for people with mental health problems across the spectrum.

 The national insurance number (NINO) is a unique personal reference number used for tax, national insurance contributions, social security benefits, state pension, tax credit and student loan award purposes. The number links an individual with their tax payments and national insurance contributions to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions, and is needed to make a claim to benefit.

 The proposal to change the allowed length of backdating from 12 months to three months was part of a wider package of pensions measures to increase take up and make benefit processes simpler. Older people will be able to claim pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit in one phone call without having to fill in, sign or return any claim forms. This will benefit thousands of pensioners often put off by complicated claim forms and the fear of large amounts of personal information being required. Over the long-term the package results in extra expenditure for pensioners, rising to &#163;250 million per year by 2050.</p>

1. For 2007-08 figures marked with an asterisk (&#147;*&#148;) are not yet available from FRAIMS. Therefore, the information for the four quarters represents FIBS data only. Although this information is recorded on individual cases, it cannot be extracted at a summary level. Work is currently being undertaken to enable this to be done.<br>
2. The same applies to providing data on the number of persons being fined following conviction, although it is not envisaged that average fine values will be able to be generated. The amount of fine imposed is a matter for the courts<br>
3. Information has been included in the above tables showing the number of Administrative Penalties issued.<br>
4. Administrative Penalties are used for less serious cases of fraud; those where the overpayment is below &#163;2,000. Formal cautions are designed to correct claimant behaviour by getting them to admit to the offence. Administrative Penalties, which became available through the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997, give the claimant the opportunity to avoid prosecution by paying a penalty of 30 per cent. of the overpayment, as well as having to repay the overpayment in full.<br>

Last month Jobcentre Plus took an average of 10,000 new vacancies every working day, with many more coming up through other recruitment channels. Together with the advice and support provided through Jobcentre Plus, this means that most of those who become unemployed can find another job quickly; over half of new claimants leave jobseeker&#146;s allowance within three months and around three quarters leave within six months.</p>

As you know the Secretary of State announced recently an extension of the service.</p>
</ul><a name="90112w0011.htm_brev5"><a name="09011226000951"><ul><p class="tabletext">Employers are made aware of the service in three main ways. First, Jobcentre Plus is informed by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform when employers notify redundancies of 20 or more employees. We contact each of those employers to discuss the range of support that Jobcentre Plus is able, with its partners, to offer employees, and to decide which measures will be helpful. Second, we provide information through channels that employers use regularly, including: the Jobcentre Plus website www.iobcentreplus.gov.uk/employers, the websites of organisations who help to deliver the Rapid Response Service to employers and a range of leaflets and business/trade media. Third, some employers receive an account management service from Jobcentre Plus in return for their commitment to helping our individual customers to find work. In that context, employers facing difficulties may discuss their needs directly with Jobcentre Plus and appropriate levels of support will be offered.</p>

We also make efforts to identify situations where employers are making fewer than 20 people redundant and to offer Rapid Response Service-style support whenever we consider this likely to be the most effective way of helping the people involved.</p>

 We are currently engaged in the most substantial peacetime naval shipbuilding programme since the first world war. This is centred on the Type 45 destroyers, the Astute class submarines and the future aircraft Carriers. Following on from these we will have the future surface combatant and successor class submarine. This programme will provide the capability the Royal Navy needs to remain one of the world's most powerful maritime forces. As the House knows we have announced that the in-service dates of the carriers will be delayed by one to two years allowing closer alignment for the entry into service of the aircraft which will fly from them. HMS Daring, the first of class of the T45 destroyers, is expected to enter service next year with its five successors at a rate of approximately one a year thereafter. The House will also know that there has been some delay to the Astute programme. We are re-baselining the programme and I will make an announcement in due course. The future surface combatant will follow-on from the carriers, but it is far too early to announce an in-service date. The future surface combatant and the successor class submarines are at the very early stages of design.</p>

 The effect has been very positive. We are pressing ahead with Future Lynx and giving a new priority to the Warrior upgrade and the FRES reconnaissance vehicle. These are all very important programmes for current operations and the nation's future defence capability. We have been able to do this by re-profiling the carrier build programme without any loss to defence capability. Although the in-service dates of the new carrier have been delayed, of which the House is aware, this has allowed us to more closely align their entry into service with the aircraft which will fly off them.</p>

 Jackal was bought for Afghanistan in response to the requirements of that theatre. It provides excellent mobility and firepower and is well adapted for manoeuvring in the Afghan desert.

 The Department of Communities and Local Government and the Devolved Administrations lead on homelessness policy. They have strategies that recognise veterans issues. The Ministry of Defence does not collect on a national basis data on the numbers of homeless veterans. We have however estimated that the proportion of veterans among the non-statutory homeless population, at least in London, has fallen over the last 10 years. Independent research by the university of York published this year has shown that the proportion of veterans among the non-statutory homeless population in London in 2007 was about 6 per cent. This is a much lower proportion than in the mid-1990s when separate research reported a figure of 20-25 per cent.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence and its Agencies have several hundred computer systems in use ranging from corporate IT systems serving thousands of users across the Department and its Agencies, to business area systems serving smaller communities. The following data covers those systems within the MOD and its Agencies where accreditation is centrally controlled by Defence Security and Standards Assurance (DSSA), which are either connected to the MOD networks, or are stand alone above Secret, or are systems that contain significant value to the MOD e.g. those systems that contain particularly sensitive or personal data. It does not include those systems where authority for accreditation has been delegated e.g. stand alone systems with no onward connectivity, and where a further breakdown of information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 The information requested is not held. I can confirm that in preparation for Operation TELIC in 2003 large numbers of Reservists were called out, some at very short notice. This was because the rapidly developing situation in Iraq at that time required us to act quickly and we were not able to give as much notice to Reservists as we would have wished. Since then, the mobilisation process now ensures that Reserve units receive advance notice that they will be required to provide individuals to support a specific operation (this can be up to six months notice). More importantly, once Reservists have been selected for mobilisation, we  <br>

However, it must be accepted that the nature of military operations means that inevitably individuals may receive less notice of mobilisation due to rapidly changing requirements.</p>

 The Sellafield site is managed by Sellafield Ltd., a company not a public body. The low level waste repository facility near Drigg is similarly managed by a private company. It was necessary to provide the contractor for this facility with a nuclear indemnity but before doing so I am told that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) approached the private nuclear insurance market in 2007 in connection with insurance for nuclear liability claims to courts outside the UK and not party to the Paris and Brussels Convention. It became clear from these discussions that commercial insurers were not prepared to quote on these potential liability claims. This established an insurance industry position in principle, in light of which the NDA and its professional advisors concluded that the position that insurers would take on the specific issue at Sellafield was clear and therefore no additional conversations were required.</p>

In assessing economic impact the study has focused on those sectors that are expected to be most significantly impacted by tidal power development. Where possible, impacts have been quantified in terms of employment and gross value added variances.</p>

Recent exercise scenarios have included coastal flooding, tidal surges, fluvial flooding, surface water flooding and flooding caused by torrential rain conditions. &#147;Lessons learned&#148; from these exercises and real flooding events, are used by the Ambulance Service, with the relevant agencies in individual LRFs, to develop specific medical assistance protocols for the care and effective transportation of patients from flooded areas.</p>

 The operating framework for the national health service, which sets out the specific business and financial arrangements for the NHS in any given year, first made specific references to supporting carers in the 2008-09 report. The recently published operating framework for 2009-10 goes further. It requires primary care trusts (PCTs) to work with their local authority partners and publish joint plans on how their combined funding will support breaks for carers, including short breaks, in a personalised way.</p>

It is being run by a consortium led by the Expert Patients Programme and includes the three main carers&#146; organisations (Carers UK, Crossroads and the Princess Royal Trust for Carers) and Partners in Policymaking. &#163;4.4 million per year has been allocated to fund this programme.</p>

 My previous answer highlighted the importance of gloves and aprons in supporting good hygiene practices in an influenza pandemic. The quantities and type of gloves and aprons, based on the number and type of patient interactions, are currently being investigated. The large numbers required and the need to ensure availability at point of use strongly favours the creation of a pandemic stockpile (without impacting on the Business As Usual requirement for these products).

 A review of the arrangements under Part IX of the Drug tariff for the provision of stoma and urology items&#151;and related services&#151;in primary care is currently under way. One of the stated aims of the review is that it seeks to make service provided by and payment provision to dispensing appliance contractors (DACs) and pharmacy contractors more equitable. A number of proposals have been put forward in consultation issued by the Department and extending the expensive prescription fee to DACs has been raised by respondents and will therefore be considered. The consultation closed in September 2008; details of the how this work will progress in light of responses and a final impact assessment will be published in the new year.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health to what proportion of primary care trust revenue allocations for the 2009-10 financial year the health inequalities formula has been applied, with the meaning described on page 28 of his Department&#146;s Report of the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation published 8 December 2008.

 One of Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) objectives is to help to reduce avoidable health inequalities through resource allocation. To achieve this objective, a separate health inequalities formula has been developed which targets funds at the places with the worst health outcomes. This is a more transparent way of contributing towards the reduction in health inequalities through resource allocation, and highlights our commitment to tackling the issue of health inequality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_400"><a name="90112w0038.htm_para3"><a name="0901137001938">ACRA could not determine the proportion of allocations to apply the health inequalities formula to and left it to ministerial decision. Ministers decided to apply the formula to 15 per cent. of the allocations, excluding the mental health component of the formula (which already includes an adjustment for unmet need) and HIV/AIDS. This keeps the distribution of funding between the most and least deprived areas in line with the previous formula.</p>

 No data are collected on these risk factors, nor on the proportion of people receiving directly observed therapy. The Health Protection Agency has recently redeveloped its surveillance system to collect this information about risk factors and whether patients started on treatment are under direct observation, and the new system is currently being rolled out nationally.</p>

The WHO recommendation appears to be largely based on the USA Institute of Medicine's (IOM) Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin B12 published in 2000. The Institute of Occupational Medicine recommendation was based on a review of evidence some of which was not available to COMA in 1991.</p>
