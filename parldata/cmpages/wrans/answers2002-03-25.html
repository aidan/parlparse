This entitlement is available for each child, and can be taken before the child's 8th birthday. In relation to adoption, the leave can ben taken up to eight years after the child is first placed with the family for adoption, or until the child's 18th birthday if that is sooner.

 <i>[holding answer 14 March 2002]:</i> My own Department, the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers, is a small department of fewer than 35 staff. Staff are seconded to LSLO from other Government Departments and so the age range from which LSLO draws its staff depends upon the age policy of other Departments. Within that limitation, LSLO does not discriminate on grounds of age and there is no age bar in relation to recruitment. Currently the ages of staff at LSLO ranges from under 25 to over 60.

The Crown Prosecution Service is currently in the process of a complete review of Departmental policy on age, with a view to issuing revised policy later this year. The revised policy will take into account the current need for all employers to adopt a flexible approach to the recruitment and retention of older workers.
<P>

<a name="20325w03.html_para2">Historically the CPS has welcomed all job applications regardless of age, but has maintained a less flexible policy on age retirement. Guidance issued by the Cabinet Office (based on the non-statutory Code of Practice published by the former DfEE) encouraged the review of current policies on recruitment, conditions of service based on age or length of service, and retirement. The CPS review aims to bring all age-related policies in line with the code of practice.

 Royal naval submarines operating in waters frequented by UK fishing vessels are governed by a code of practice, mutually agreed by the Royal Navy and the UK fishing industry, which is designed to ensure the safety of fishing vessels. Additionally, it is mandatory for royal naval and allied submarines to report their position once a fishing vessel incident is reported. I can confirm that, following internal investigations, no submarines were operating in the vicinity of either of the two incidents referred to. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch have confirmed that they are satisfied with this conclusion.

 The information requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Since its formation in 1998, Fleet Support Ltd. (FSL) has undertaken an extensive programme of work on RN and RFA vessels in Portsmouth, during which period not every project has been delivered to time and cost. The reasons for this are complex, vary considerably across the projects concerned and are not necessarily the sole responsibility of the company in each instance. However, the company's performance overall in the last 12 months has been well within the performance indicators which the Warship Support Agency (WSA), as the provider of maritime logistics support, is tasked to achieve.

 RAF aircraft patrolling as part of the international coalition's enforcement of the no-fly zones over Iraq are regularly attacked by Iraqi air defences, including anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missiles. Owing to the skill of RAF aircrew, their training, equipment, tactics and support, none were hit in 2001, and no aircrew were injured. This record has been maintained this year to date.

 Empty Ministry of Defence housing is maintained under the same contractual arrangements which MOD, through the Defence Housing Executive (DHE), employs to maintain all its housing stock in mainland United Kingdom. A contracted Works Services Manager provides a response repair service and, working with the DHE Property Manager, undertakes a programme of regular planned maintenance which is fulfilled according to available funds.

 The effectiveness of fraud detection, in the context of Ministry of Defence housing and related works, is kept under constant review. Line management is responsible for ensuring that appropriate procedures are followed and controls operated effectively. In addition, there is a rolling programme of compliance and risk based audits carried out independently of line management. Consultants are also employed to carry out additional audits of property management and to undertake initial investigations of suspected fraud or impropriety. Furthermore, the central Defence Finance Audit Unit is notified of all suspected cases of fraud and they may then call in the MOD Police.

 The Ministry of Defence and armed forces are, with the exception of the Special Forces, subject to the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Work is under way to ensure that we are ready for implementation of the rights and obligations it creates. A pilot version of MOD's publication scheme was released in February and this is now being reviewed in light of comments from users and guidance which has recently been issued by the information commissioner under s.47(2) of the Act. More widely, the preparatory work will involve education of all relevant personnel about the key provisions; establishing or modifying procedures in order to support compliance; and ensuring that the status under the Act of all types of information held by MOD is understood both within the Department and, where appropriate, by external bodies. In addition, it is recognised that successful implementation will be dependent on developing a more open outlook and that achieving this culture change must also be an integral part of the agenda. In a Department as large and wide-ranging as MOD this represents a significant programme which, we assess, will require the full lead time provided by the implementation timetable which my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor announced on 13 November 2001.

<P>
<a name="20325w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Training and education are provided to service personnel from other countries engaged in UN peacekeeping and conflict resolution initiatives by the United Kingdom in various ways. A one-year post- graduate course in global security and a seven-week diploma course in managing defence in a democracy are offered at the Royal College of Military Science, Shrivenham and have been developed for foreign military and civilian students as part of the Ministry of Defence's Defence Diplomacy Mission. The Army has recently commenced a series of 10-day International Peace Supporting Briefing programmes with students attending from many parts of the world. The programme includes briefing on the structure and role of the British Army, the role of Government Departments and non-governmental organisations in peace support operations (PSO), PSO doctrine, civil/military co-operation, the role of the police and equipment and training issues. However, the Royal College of Defence Studies course and the Advanced Command and Staff course syllabi also contain elements relevant to UN peacekeeping and conflict resolution and

<a name="20325w06.html_para1">In addition to training conducted in the UK, overseas training is carried out by established British military advisory and training teams (BMATT). Most of this training is directly relevant to UN peacekeeping and conflict resolution initiatives and BMATTs are currently established in seven countries worldwide. The MOD also provides short term training teams (STTT) to supplement the training given by BMATTs or is provided for immediate local training needs in other areas of the world. Numerous STTTs are in place at any given time on deployments typically lasting for between two and six weeks.

 The Government have decided on arrangements which will secure better value for money for warship repair and maintenance for the Royal Navy.
<P>

<a name="20325w07.html_para0">The Ministry of Defence has considered a number of options, including internal proposals to improve efficiency, proposals for further improvements from the MOD trade unions, and proposals from the existing dockyard companies. All options offered significant benefits compared with the current cost of undertaking warship repair and maintenance, but the company proposals offered the best overall value for money.
<P>

<a name="20325w07.html_para1">I have therefore decided to proceed with partnering arrangements with the companies. Subject to the satisfactory conclusion of negotiations, contracts will be placed later this year with Devonport Management Ltd., Fleet Support Ltd. and Babcock Naval Services Ltd. (a newly formed subsidiary of BRDL) for the provision of engineering support and related services at the naval bases at Devonport, Portsmouth and the Clyde. The Ministry of Defence has also agreed with the dockyard companies that a larger proportion of the surface ship refit and repair programme will be opened up for competition, with corresponding improvements in value for money. Taken together, these approaches will deliver efficiency improvements of over &#163;300 million over the next five years.
<P>

<a name="20325w07.html_para2">These arrangements will involve the transfer of nearly 3,000 posts to the partnering. The Ministry of Defence will work closely with trade unions to ensure this transfer can be achieved as smoothly as possible.

 DERA was disestablished on 1 July 2001 as part of the DERA PPP and two new organisations, Dstl and QinetiQ plc, were formed. The split of DERA, and thus the work programme, was done on the basis of capabilities; the principle being that the work that could not easily be transferred to the private sector remained within the Ministry of Defence, the rest became part of QinetiQ's business.

 On completion of formal consultation on the DERA PPP process in June 2000, 19 written responses had been received from industry, including defence manufacturers. An industry forum was subsequently held to provide an opportunity for a detailed discussion of the PPP proposals before decisions were made on the way ahead. Rather than publish the individual representations, which would require the approval of the relevant organisations, the key points have been summarised in the Ministry of Defence responses about consultation to the Defence Select Committee and trade unions. The summary was published by the Defence Select Committee in its fifth report of session 2000&#150;01 titled "The Draft Defence Science and Technology Laboratory Trading Fund Order 2001 at Appendix 3". In general, industry 



<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 2002 : Column 561W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20325w07.html_para3">Consultation with industry has been a regular feature of the PPP process and has taken the form of informal workshops, meetings, briefings and seminars. Contact has generally been focused through the trade associations or other relevant professional bodies such as the Defence Industries Council, Defence Manufacturers Association and Association of Independent Research and Technology Organisations. Officials managing the PPP process are also in regular contact with the National Defence Industry Council's appointed industry liaison officer.

 The Department has agreed with distributors a series of measures with a view to halving the overall National Lottery Distribution Fund balance by 2004. We propose to identify any elements in the Statement of Financial Requirements or policy directions which hinder faster payment and a bolder forward commitment policy and make amendments where this is consistent with good financial management; and to review whether more discretionary powers need to be introduced into the financial directions to enable distributors to assess applications in a way more commensurate with the risk involved.

<P>

<a name="20325w07.html_para4">In addition, distributors have identified a range of methods which they may be able to use to reduce balances more quickly.

 The New Opportunities Fund and the community fund are required to meet their running costs from their share of the National Lottery Distribution Fund. It is not possible at this stage to disaggregate the running costs that will accrue to the two distributors from administering Fair Share.

 The Government do not believe that there would be value for money in joining the World Tourism Organisation, membership of which would cost around &#163;200,000 a year. However, DCMS does take an interest in the work of the World Tourism Organisation and offers co-operation in areas such as statistics and best practice in environmentally sustainable development.

 Membership of the Worlds Tourism Organisation is calculated by the WTO according to the level of economic development and the importance of tourism in each country. In 2000 the estimated cost to the UK of membership was around &#163;200,000.

 There has been one meeting of the ministerial group for the Queen's Golden Jubilee, which took place on 12 April 2000 to consider the planning of the celebrations. Since then a number of other issues have been considered by the group. In the interests of speedy resolution, these issues were dealt with and cleared through correspondence. They are also kept informed of all major developments in this way. There are 23 members of the group.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what relationship Ofcom will have with the devolved assemblies.  [44486]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w10.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Communications White Paper stated that Ofcom would be expected to develop good links with the relevant policy committees and executives of the devolved assemblies and with representatives of the English regions. We will expect Ofcom to consult closely with the devolved assemblies on how best to establish the most meaningful relationships with them and to build on some of the arrangements which some of the existing regulators have already established, such as holding 



<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 2002 : Column 572W</I><P>
regular meetings with assembly officials and establishing regular links between senior Ofcom representatives and the assemblies themselves.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w10.html_wqn1"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what the relationship will be between Ofcom and the OFT; and in the event of a dispute on jurisdiction who will decide.  [44487]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w10.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 As the White Paper made clear, Ofcom will be able to exercise powers under the Competition Act 1998 and the Fair Trading Act 1973 concurrently with the Director General of Fair Trading, in respect of communications matters. The Government are confident that Ofcom and the OFT will be able to work closely and constructively together in the exercise of these powers. This would reflect the existing relationship between regulators with concurrent powers and the OFT. The Competition Act moreover makes provision for formal co-ordination between the OFT and those regulators who have concurrent powers under that Act, including co-ordination of case handling under the Competition Act 1998 (Concurrency) Regulations 2000. The regulations provide that in the event of a dispute between the Director General of Fair Trading and any regulator as to which should handle a particular case, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will decide. To date my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not been required to be involved in this way. The OFT and regulators have always been able to agree on who is best placed to deal with each case and therefore its allocation. The provisions for formal co-ordination will be applied to Ofcom in the same way as to other regulators having concurrent powers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w10.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government fully recognise the importance of access to communications services for people with disabilities.
<P>

<a name="20325w10.html_para0">As proposed in the White Paper, the forthcoming Communications Bill will extend to digital cable and digital satellite broadcasters the current requirements for broadcasters on digital terrestrial television to provide subtitling, sign language and audio description services on their channels.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport whether EU directives for the administration of public projects apply to the building of the national stadium at Wembley; and if she will make a statement on the national stadium.  [44445]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Responsibility for the development of the National Stadium project lies with the Football Association and their wholly owned subsidiary company Wembley National Stadium Ltd. (WNSL). The FA are 



<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 2002 : Column 573W</I><P>
committed to making a significant equity investment in the project and to raising debt financing to fund the majority of construction and other related costs.
<P>

<a name="20325w10.html_para2">WNSL are required, under the terms of the lottery funding agreement concluded with Sport England, to fully comply with EU procurement legislation unless WNSL has been properly advised that EU procurement legislation does not apply. In such circumstances, the lottery funding agreement requires WNSL to adopt commercial competitive tendering procedures unless it can demonstrate to the satisfaction of Sport England that there is some overriding reason why that is not appropriate. I understand that WNSL's legal advisers advised WNSL in 1998 that EU procurement legislation does not apply to the national stadium project.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what steps have been taken to ensure that an independent assessment is made of any future contract between Wembley National Stadium Ltd. and Multiplex to ensure value for money and conformity to best practice in corporate governance and procurement practice.  [46246]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State set out the Government's position on the national stadium project to the House on 19 December 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 292. One of the conditions of Government support was that the Football Association and Wembley National Stadium Ltd. should commission an independent value for money assessment of the proposed contracts with Multiplex. That assessment is currently under way following the appointment by WNSL of Cyrill Sweet Ltd. to carry out this study. A copy of Cyrill Sweet Ltd.'s terms of reference were placed in the Library on 12 March.
<P>

<a name="20325w10.html_para3">Another of the Government conditions laid out on 19 December relates to corporate governance changes required of the Football Association and WNSL to produce a management structure capable of delivering a complex project within procedures acceptable to the public sector. The FA and WNSL are currently engaged in producing proposals to meet the Government's conditions and we expect the FA's work to be completed in April. The FA/WNSL proposals will be subject to scrutiny by Patrick Carter's review team and Sport England as well as by the Government.

 <i>[holding answer 21 March 2002]:</i> Digital publications are continuing to increase in number and importance. The present system of legal deposit requires printed publications to be deposited in the British Library. In July 1998 the Working Party on the Legal Deposit of Non-print Publications chaired by Sir Anthony Kenny reported to the then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Copies of the report have been placed in the Library. The report makes a convincing case for moving towards legislation for the legal deposit of non-print material. My Department continues to seek a legislative slot in which to bring the matter before the House. In the meantime a voluntary code of practice is in operation.

 The Public Accounts Commission has provided funding for the National Audit Office which is consistent with the completion of some 50 major reports a year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 In general, clergy in the Church of England serving in parishes, cathedrals and dioceses are office holders and do not have contracts of employment. However, some clergy serving as chaplains do so under contacts of employment, and the same applies to some clergy who are on the staff of diocesan bodies, the Church's national institutions, or other bodies connected with the Church.

<a name="20325w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bell: </B>

To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, 



<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 2002 : Column 581W</I><P>
what estimate he has made of the increase in funding within diocesan resources required in 2002&#150;03 to replace Church Commissioners' funding.  [43181]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 Following the Commissioners' good investment performance in recent years, they plan to distribute an extra &#163;10 million for parish ministry over 2002&#150;04 and will increase their transitional relief to assist dioceses and parishes in meeting contributions for clergy pension by the same amount. They continue to meet the full cost of clergy pensions for service prior to 1998.
<P>

<a name="20325w12.html_para0">The relationship between the Church's funding partners remains fluid and it is not particularly meaningful to express part of diocesan expenditure as a replacement for Commissioners' funding. I refer the hon. Member to the Commissioners' annual report and to our correspondence for a fuller account of these matters.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 I have had no discussions recently about the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme, which is managed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. However, I understand that a number of successful applications have already received moneys from the scheme.
<P>

<a name="20325w12.html_para1">Discussions with the Treasury continue on the wider question of a reduction of VAT payable on the repair and maintenance of listed church buildings. I understand the European Commission has indicated that it will consider this matter as part of its general review of reduced rates in 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 There have been no recent changes in the civil defence and emergency planning responsibilities of local authorities. The Government have decided to allocate a total of &#163;18.97 million to local authorities in civil defence grant for 2002&#150;03. Figures for subsequent years will be settled as part of this year's spending review.

 The Cabinet Office is an equal opportunities employer and is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for all.




<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 2002 : Column 582W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20325w12.html_para2">It is the Department's policy that everyone should have equality of opportunity for employment and advancement on the basis of their ability, qualifications and suitability for work. There must be no discrimination on the grounds of age, disability, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, race, colour, nationality, ethnic origin or national origin.
<P>

<a name="20325w12.html_para3">The Cabinet Office's age retirement policy for grades below the senior civil service supports the recommendations of "Winning the Generation Game". Our normal age for retirement is 60 years but retention beyond this age up to age 70 is possible subject to departmental needs and continuing health and efficiency for most grades.

 The Cabinet Office has no specific plans to celebrate St. Patrick's Day, St. George's Day or St. Andrew's Day. The Union flag will, however, be flown from the Department's buildings on the latter two days.

It is likely that they arise from the fact that, on arrival at the scene, the first priority for the police was to establish perimeter security and also that firefighters could not be deployed within the site until a degree of order had been re-established.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The most recent refurbishment work at a GCHQ premises, involving the provision of air- conditioning, engaged the services of W. S. Atkins as consultant.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs whether an installer capable of installing not-in-kind air conditioning was invited to quote for the recent refurbishment contract for GCHQ; and if he will make a statement.  [41165]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In line with Government policy, contracts for GCHQ are let on the basis of a main contractor providing goods and services via sub-contractors, (including in this case the provision of air conditioning). It is for those specialists to determine solutions which may, or may not, be on a like for like basis.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what measures were taken to ensure that the consultant advising on the installation of air conditioning during the recent refurbishment of GCHQ was aware of the Government's policy on the use of hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants in air conditioning; and if he will make a statement on the measures taken by the consultant to source practical and safe alternatives to hydrofluorocarbon-based air conditioning.  [41164]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 GCHQ ensured that the consultant complied fully with Government policy on refrigerants, which supports the phase-out timetable for ozone- depleting agents&#151;including hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)&#151;as agreed in the Montreal Protocol of 1987, and the subsequent revisions laid down by European Commission Regulation 594&#150;91. The refrigerant chosen for the air conditioning plant used in the refurbishment was R407C (which is HFC-based and is therefore not ozone-depleting) and all other materials were CFC-free. This is acceptable under the relevant legislation.

<P>

<a name="20325w18.html_para3">Additionally, India and Pakistan have tested nuclear devices. We continue to encourage Israel to resolve international concerns about its nuclear status by acceding to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a non-nuclear weapons state.

 The FCO opened its first workplace nursery on 3 September 2001. It can take up to 36 children. Capital costs were in the region of &#163;450,000 (&#163;375,000 for construction costs, &#163;50,000 for professional fees and &#163;25,000 for furniture and equipment). The Cabinet Office provided &#163;150,000 towards these costs from the Modernising Government Fund. Parents pay between &#163;100-&#163;120 per week, depending on their grade and the age of the child. It is envisaged that an initial subsidy towards running costs of up to &#163;85,000 per annum, reducing gradually over a 2&#150;3 year period, will be needed while the nursery builds up to full capacity. The objective of setting up the nursery was to demonstrate a long-term commitment to helping staff combine work and family.
<P>

<a name="20325w19.html_para3">The FCO is also an employer partner in the Buffer Bear network of nurseries, with access to 10 priority places. The cost of a place varies depending on, among other things, the location of the nursery and staff are offered a subsidy of &#163;15-&#163;35 per week depending on their grade. These nurseries are based at key commuter points and offer choice for parents who do not wish to bring their children into London.
<P>

<a name="20325w19.html_para4">The FCO currently has two under-two places at the First Steps nursery in Marsham street. These are being phased out, before the FCO withdraws from the contract in December 2002. The cost of a place for an under-two is &#163;223.14 per week. As with our in-house nursery, parents pay between &#163;100-&#163;120 per week, depending on their grade. The FCO subsidy for the coming year will be in the region of &#163;14,000.
<P>

<a name="20325w19.html_para5">Staff are also eligible to use the Westminster Holiday Playscheme, which caters for 5 to 12-year-olds during school holidays, at three sites in central London. The cost is &#163;26 per day, which is split equally between the FCO and the parent. The subsidy for FY 2001&#150;02 will be in the region of &#163;4,000. Places are offered on a first come, first served basis, which means the number of users varies each year.

As a signal of our conviction that the election was neither free nor fair, the British high commissioner in Harare did not attend the inauguration ceremony for Mr. Mugabe on 17 March.

The Government of India's response has been that the nature of Mr. Bleach's offences was different: we do not accept this. We have asked the Government of India to reconsider Mr. Bleach's case and to take into account the deterioration in his health since he has been diagnosed with tuberculosis and bronco-pneumonia.

 The UK Government have received no direct approach from the Government of Iraq, although we are aware that an Iraqi spokesman announced such an offer through the state-controlled Iraqi media. The demand of the international community is for UN weapons inspectors to be allowed into Iraq. They have built up a vast amount of knowledge about Iraq's weapons and know where to look. United Nations Security Council resolutions also require Iraq to allow the weapons inspectors full, unconditional access at any time. If Iraq truly has nothing to hide it will let them in on this basis. I note from the Iraqi spokesman's announcement that the British team would be allowed to visit only sites named in advance. We are looking for Iraqi disarmament, not yet more propaganda stunts.

 The judgment in the 1999 Court of Appeal case of R. <i>v.</i> Bow County Court, ex parte Pelling confirms that litigants in person should be allowed the help of a McKenzie Friend in public proceedings, held in open court or in chambers, unless the judge is satisfied that fairness and the interests of justice do not require it.
<P>

<a name="20325w22.html_para0">In an open court hearing there usually must be some justification established if a person is not to have the benefit of a McKenzie Friend, or some evidence that the McKenzie Friend has acted or is acting inappropriately at the hearing which makes it reasonable to deprive the litigant of the assistance which would otherwise be permitted.
<P>

<a name="20325w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The decision whether to grant bail or not is a judicial decision taken within the statutory framework provided by the Bail Act 1976. Judges and magistrates carry out their duties independently of the Government. It would be wrong for Ministers to seek to direct judges or magistrates in the way they exercise their discretion. Accordingly, no guidelines have been issued on the use of bail or the related powers in section 23 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969. For the same reasons, my Department does not issue guidelines on sentencing. Magistrates and judges are helped by decisions of the higher courts and, particularly, by the guideline judgments of the Court of Appeal. In R. <i>v.</i> Howells and others (1998) the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham, in a reserved judgment, considered, at length, the factors which courts should weigh when considering whether an offence is so serious that only a custodial sentence is justified.

All of the schools involved in the project are doing this. Our White Paper "Schools: achieving success" gives a commitment that all children will be entitled to two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week, within and outside the curriculum.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what measures her Department has taken to prevent the selling of school playing fields.  [44444]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w24.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Before October 1998, there was nothing to prevent a local authority selling a school playing field if it wanted to. As a result of widespread public concern, section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced in October 1998 to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields. Local authorities and governing bodies of all maintained schools are now required to obtain the Secretary of State's consent before they can sell any part of a playing field.
<P>

<a name="20325w24.html_para4">Applications to sell school playing fields are assessed against the following criteria:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a. schools' needs: that playing field provision and curriculum requirements at the school selling the playing field, and at other schools in the local area, will be met;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>b. community needs: that community use of a school's playing fields is taken into account, with alternative facilities made available if necessary;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>c. finance: that the sale proceeds are re-invested to provide new or improved sports facilities at schools, or are used to help to raise standards by providing better educational facilities.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="20325w24.html_para5">The criteria are set out in the Department's Guidance 0580/2001: "The Protection of School Playing Fields and Land for City Academies". Only those applications that meet the criteria are approved. Furthermore, since July 2001, all applications have been scrutinised by the independent School Playing Fields Advisory Panel to make sure that they conform to the published criteria. The Panel comprises representatives from the National Playing Fields Association, the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the education organisation Learning through Landscapes, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Local Government Association.

<a name="20325w25.html_para0">The airline and aerospace industries have been affected by a number of closures and job losses in recent months. The Government have been proactive in working, in regional and local partnerships, to support those people affected by providing the most appropriate service to help them back into work and to retrain them where necessary.
<P>

<a name="20325w25.html_para1">Retraining opportunities are offered to people who have been made redundant through Work Based Learning for Adults. In addition, Rapid Response Funding has recently been approved to retrain individuals made redundant from BAe Systems in the north-west and Gill Aviation in the north-east. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) are also offering support&#151;for example, at Gatwick and Heathrow LSC funding has been provided for one to one advice sessions for clients facing particular employment problems, and to support their training needs.

 Statistics relating to the literacy levels of the long-term unemployed in England are not available. However, we estimate that around one third of unemployed people have literacy and/or numeracy skills below Level 1 (the level expected of an 11-year-old) in England) <sup>1</sup> .

 Currently different arrangements for testing eye health apply to staff employed in the former Department of Social Security and those employed in the Employment Service.
<P>

<a name="20325w26.html_para3">In May 2001 the Department of Social Security contracted with a company of ophthalmic opticians to provide staff with free eye tests at intervals of not less than two years. Between 1 May 2001 and 31 January 2002 (which is the latest month for which statistics are available) a total of 13,888 staff had their eyes tested under this contract. We estimate that by the end of the first year of the contract, on 30 April 2002, around 18,500 staff would have benefited from the service.




<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 2002 : Column 638W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20325w26.html_para4">The availability of free eye tests in the former Department of Social Security is publicised on the Department's "Intranet" computer system and was brought to the attention of staff through a circular which was distributed widely. New staff are provided with information about the service as part of the standard induction programme. In addition, local managers are required to nominate an eye care liaison officer whose responsibility is to publicise the availability of the service, using posters and leaflets, prior to an optician visiting an office of the Department.
<P>

<a name="20325w26.html_para5">The Employment Service (which was up to July 2001 part of the former Department for Education and Employment) does not have a contract with an external eye care specialist. Instead staff are able to arrange their own eye tests with an optician of their choice and to have the cost reimbursed. Between 1 April 2001 and 31 January 2002 a total of 2,030 staff had their eyes tested at the Agency's expense.
<P>

<a name="20325w26.html_para6">The Employment Service provides new staff with a "Workstation Guide" leaflet and a video entitled "In Your Own Interests" is shown to all staff. Both of these highlight the provision of eye tests. In addition, eye tests are covered in the Health and Safety Guide which is available on the Employment Service's computerised communication system. Work station assessment forms are also completed by staff at six monthly intervals or following a work station change. These too highlight the provision of eye tests.
<P>

<a name="20325w26.html_para7">We intend to gradually extend the provisions of the former Department of Social Security's contract to all staff in the Department for Work and Pensions from April 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Parental leave is unpaid and therefore incurs no direct financial cost. We do not keep records of the opportunity or indirect cost of staff taking parental leave. Information obtained from our payroll systems shows that during the period 1 March 2001 to 28 February 2001, staff in DWP took a total of 2,075 days parental leave.
<P>

<a name="20325w26.html_para8">We cannot quantify the specific benefits to the Department provided by the parental leave directive because it is only one part of a wide range of family- friendly policies provided by the Department. Benefits to the Department include increased labour supply, reduced turnover and a higher commitment from staff while enabling them to achieve a better balance between their home and working lives.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Schemes may be included under more than one category in the above table.<P>

2. The GAD survey did not include information on the number of defined contribution and personal pension in payment that provide for a survivor's pension as most of these schemes provide a lump sum on retirement with which the member buys a pension. It is then up to the member to choose whether or not the pension will provide for a survivor's pension. In a defined contribution scheme used to contract out of the state earnings related pension scheme (SERPS), that part of the pension deriving from the national insurance contribution rebate (the protected rights) must be used to purchase a pension providing for a survivor's pension where the member is married at the time the pension is purchased.<P>

3. The same rules apply to personal pensions. It is entirely a matter for the member to decide whether or not the pension provides for survivor's benefits except where the personal pension has been used to contract out of (SERPS). In these circumstances, that part of the pension fund comprising the protected rights, must be used to purchase a pension providing for a survivor's pension where the member is married at the time that the pension is purchased.<P>

4. All occupational pension schemes (both defined benefit and defined contribution) are subject to indexation. That part of the pension in payment that derives from pension rights built up from 6 April 1997 must be increased by the percentage increase in the retail price index, or 5 per cent, whichever is the lesser.<P>

5. With personal pensions only that part of the pension deriving from the protected rights is subject to indexation. It is up to the scheme member to decide whether or not the pension deriving from the excess of these rights is to be indexed.<P>

 Entitlement to Retirement Pension begins with the pay-day on or following the pensioner's 60 or 65 birthday. Changes in entitlement, for example a decrease because of a prolonged stay in hospital, also takes effect from the pay-day following the change in circumstances. The same rule applies with the termination of the award. The principle of paying Retirement Pension in whole weeks stems from the fact that the benefit is traditionally paid in advance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w29.html_spnew0"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Entitlement to the mobility component of disability living allowance is based on the effects of a disabling condition and not the condition itself. Even where a condition remains unchanged, the effect on a person's ability to walk, or the help they need from other people when out and about, can change over time for a number of reasons, including medical treatment, therapy, or how the person adapts to their disability.
<P>

<a name="20325w29.html_para0">When considering entitlement to either care or mobility components of disability living allowance, the decision maker may request a report based on an examination by a specially trained Medical Services doctor. This is not primarily about diagnosis, but is intended to obtain an expert view of the disabling effects of the condition. The decision maker will consider this, along with any other evidence about their needs supplied by the disabled person, their medical attendants, carers or others with relevant information, to decide whether the relevant statutory provisions relating to entitlement are satisfied.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w29.html_spnew1"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Mobility allowance was replaced by the mobility component of disability living allowance in 1992. The mobility component, which comprises a lower rate and a higher rate, is primarily to help people who are severely disabled early in life.
<P>

<a name="20325w29.html_para2">To qualify for the lower rate claimants must be aged five or over, and must be so severely disabled physically or mentally that they cannot take advantage of the faculty of walking out of doors without guidance or supervision from another person most of the time.

 The former mobility allowance is now the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance (DLA).

 Accounting standards are a matter for the Accounting Standards Board which is independent of Government. There are many factors affecting occupational pension provision including longer life expectancy and falling stockmarkets. It is not possible to isolate the effects of FRS 17 from these other factors.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20325w29.html_para10">The Access to Justice Act 1999 excludes most personal injury claims from the scope of Community Legal Service funding. However funding is still available for personal injury claims against public authorities which allege serious wrongdoing, such as child abuse claims and actions against the police. A personal injury claim may also be funded if it has a significant wider public interest. Support funding remains available for exceptionally expensive cases. Public funding is also available for clinical negligence cases, as we recognise that costly investigative work is necessary for these cases to be brought.
<P>

<a name="20325w29.html_para11">We believe that conditional fee agreements provide a suitable alternative to public funding for those personal injury cases excluded from the scope of the Community Legal Service scheme, and we have no plans to re-introduce public funding for those cases.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Reinstating three traffic lanes in each direction is not expected to have any material effect on the volume of traffic using this section of the M1. The main benefit of restoring capacity will be the reduction of congestion at peak times. This will improve journey-time reliability and reduce accident risks associated with traffic queues on motorways.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Several plans exist for diverting traffic onto alternative routes. They are applied in consultation with the police and depend upon the nature of the incident requiring a diversion. For example, local diversions from the top level of the Viaduct to the lower level, the A631, are used during periods of high winds and when accidents occur on the Viaduct. Wider diversions to direct traffic off the motorway at junctions in advance of the Viaduct are also available.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>When the Viaduct needs to be closed for roadworks, alternative traffic routes are agreed with the Local Highway Authorities. It is rarely necessary to close the Viaduct completely. Planned closures take place when traffic flows are reduced, usually at night.</FONT></UL>

 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) is working with the industry, including Connex and Railtrack to ensure all matters connected with the replacement of slam door rolling stock are carried out effectively. Their remit covers the London&#151;Sittingbourne route and the enhancement to the power supply system will take into account the need to operate 12 car trains on this route.

<P>
<a name="20325w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Braithwaite viaduct is outside the limits of deviation established for the northern extension of the East London Line under its Transport and Works Order. London Underground Ltd. have no plans, or powers, to construct a railway on that alignment.
<P>

<a name="20325w32.html_para0">Consequently, there is no possibility of the Braithwaite viaduct being incorporated in the East London Line project. LUL have not sought the removal of the Braithwaite viaduct, which is now listed as a Schedule II building, as it does not form part of the East London Line works at the Bishopsgate Goodsyard. London Underground will need to obtain Listed Building consent to demolish the structures adjacent to the Braithwaite.

<P>

 The 10-year Plan for Transport made estimates of the amount of time lost on English roads as a result of delays due to congestion in 2000. The Plan made forecasts for 2010 of the increase in congestion and of the extent to which the policies in the Plan would reduce this rise in congestion.
<P>

<a name="20325w33.html_para0">A number of external estimates have also been made of the value road users might place on the elimination of congestion. These use different methods and therefore produce different results, but they all agree that this value runs to billions of pounds per annum.
<P>

<a name="20325w33.html_para1">Neither these external estimates, nor those undertaken by my Department, can be translated directly into assessments of the cost of congestion to business or more widely. This is because they relate only to the amount of time road users lose to congestion and the value of this time to them. They take no account of the costs of implementing the policies or schemes needed to reduce the amount of time lost. The true costs of congestion are therefore the economic and other benefits forgone if we do not tackle it.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) of 12 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 871W, on rents, if he will provide similar estimates for the real terms percentage changes in each year he predicts for formula rents for council tenants in each local council in England until 2011.  [43851]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w33.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 As I said in my earlier answer to the hon. Member, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1004W, the underlying increase in 'formula' rents will be the same for all local authorities.
<P>

<a name="20325w33.html_para9">It is possible to make estimates of how average 'actual' rents might change in real terms between 2001&#150;02 and 2011&#150;12 if the national average local authority formula rent were to increase by an average of about 1.5 per cent. per year, and each local authority were to move its actual average rent to its average formula rent over that period (ignoring the impact of rent caps and the limit on annual rent changes for individual tenants). This was the basis of the figures given to the hon. Member for Hendon on 12 December. I am placing in the Libraries a table giving equivalent figures for all authorities on the same basis.
<P>

<a name="20325w33.html_para10">I must, however, emphasise once more that these figures are only estimates based on a number of assumptions. Ultimately the level of 'actual' local authority rents over the next ten years will depend, among other things, on the outcomes of future spending reviews and the decisions taken by individual local authorities.

 The White Paper proposed a rate relief scheme for small businesses, funded through a small supplement of no more than 2.5 per cent. on the bills of ratepayers not receiving the relief. The scheme will require primary legislation to allow for the relief and to allow for the small upward adjustment in the national rate poundage that will apply to those not receiving relief. The timing of this legislation depends on the availability of parliamentary time.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what assessment he has made of the impact of EU state aid rules on the use of private sector partnerships to deliver urban regeneration in the UK.  [41385]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w35.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The closure of the PIP programme has restricted the use of regeneration PPPs. We are currently working on ways of removing these restrictions. However, provided public and private involvement in the regeneration PPP acts on the same terms it should not be affected by the state aid rules. The existing gap funding schemes allow PPPs to provide state aid within defined limits. The Single Regeneration Budget, one of the Government's major regeneration programmes, is delivered through local regeneration partnerships and the private sector continues to be an important member of a large number of these.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what his most recent estimate is of the quantity of previously developed urban land available for development in the London Region; and what estimate has been made of the number of new dwellings that may be accommodated on that land.  [45651]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w35.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Estimates from the National Land Use Database show that, within London in 1998, there were some 2,820 hectares of previously developed land that were unused or may have been available for redevelopment. Estimates from the boroughs suggested that some 1,720 hectares of this were suitable for housing and could accommodate some 82,000 dwellings. The figures provide a snapshot of the land available in 1998. The estimated dwelling capacity reflects the development plan policies applying at the time and were made prior to the publication of revised national planning policy guidance on Housing (PPG3). The figures do not make allowance for new brownfield sites emerging in future, or other sources of additional capacity, not involving greenfield land, such as sub-division of existing housing, flats over shops and empty homes.
<P>

<a name="20325w35.html_para2">In September 2000, the GLA published a report entitled "London's Housing Capacity". The capacity study, undertaken in 1999, estimated that there was potential for 381,000 net additional dwellings in London in the period 1997&#150;2016. If vacancies and non self-contained accommodation are included the capacity is 458,000 household spaces. The study found that of the large identified

<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w35.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 My general approach, like that of previous Secretaries of State, is not to interfere with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities unless it is necessary to do so. Parliament has entrusted them with responsibility for day-to-day planning control in their areas. Local planning authorities are normally best placed to make decisions relating to their areas and it is right that, in general, they should be free to carry out their duties responsibly, with the minimum of interference.
<P>

<a name="20325w35.html_para6">There will be occasions, however, when I may consider it necessary to call in a planning application to determine myself instead of leaving it to the local planning authority. My policy is to be very selective about calling in planning applications. I will, in general, only take this step if planning issues of more than local importance are involved and if those issues need to be decided by me rather than at a local level. Such cases may include, for example, those which, in my opinion:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may conflict with national policies on important matters;
<P>

could have significant effects beyond their immediate locality;

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what recent changes there have been in the <i>(a)</i> management, <i>(b)</i> computerisation and <i>(c)</i> other aspects of the DVLA related to the process by which licence applications are processed; and if he will make a statement.  [45413]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w36.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The second EC directive on driver licensing resulted in significant changes to the management, computerisation and other aspects of DVLA's processes relating to the issue of driving licences. Prior to July 1998 drivers received paper licences. From this point photocard licences were introduced on a phased basis. All licences issued by DVLA are now in this form.
<P>

<a name="20325w36.html_para10">The changes have meant that photographs and signatures are captured electronically for reproduction on the new style licence. As it now contains a photograph identity checking procedures have been tightened up considerably, compared with those in place for the issue of paper licences. Ministers decided that from April 1999 identity documentation should be accepted to support identity.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w36.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what assessment his Department has made of the effectiveness of the process by which licence applications are processed by the DVLA; what steps his Department <i>(a)</i> has taken and <i>(b)</i> plans to take to make this process more effective; and if he will make a statement.  [45412]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w36.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The process associated with the issue of driving licences has been the subject of continuous review and improvement since photocards were introduced in July 1998. Holders of UK passports and those in receipt of state retirement pensions can now have their applications checked at some 750 post offices with the documents returned immediately, thereby reducing the need to send their documents direct to Swansea.
<P>

<a name="20325w36.html_para11">The introduction of electronic interchange of information about identity between DVLA and UK Passport Services is being actively explored. New versions of forms and leaflets are introduced regularly taking customers views into account, which has reduced the rate of return of applications significantly.

<P>
<a name="20325w37.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Checks of the standard of MOT test procedures and authorised premises are carried out by the Vehicle Inspectorate (VI) by means of regular visits during which premises are inspected and tests observed; observed tests of vehicles submitted by "incognito" vehicle examiners; checks carried out in response to appeals against the test result from members of the public; and special investigations in cases where the inspectorate believes that there might be significant breaches of the regulations. The Vehicle Inspectorate has the power to take enforcement action when evidence of sub-standard testing is found. Sanctions can range from the issue of warning letters to withdrawal of authorisation.
<P>

<a name="20325w37.html_para2">VI trialled a new check of testing effectiveness in 2000&#150;01 which has been introduced fully this year. Examiners carry out random re-inspections of recently tested vehicles and the results give VI a measure of how well garages are applying test standards.

[42067]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w39.html_spnew9"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Insolvency (Amendment) regulations 2000, which came into force on 31 March 2000 make provision for payments into and out of the Insolvency Services Account to be transmitted by electronic means. This has had the following effect on the Insolvency Service and its customers:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> Cost savings: the Insolvency Service estimates that a BACS payment costs 50p less than a payment by cheque. In the period from 1 April 2000 to 28 February 2002, 7,770 payments out of the Insolvency Services Account were made by BACS producing total estimated savings for the Insolvency Service of &#163;3,885. Insolvency practitioners who have a BACS payments facility should be able to achieve the same order of cost savings when remitting funds to the Insolvency Services Account by this method. Currently the Insolvency Service does not levy a fee for making a BACS payment, whereas a fee of 65p per cheque is charged against the estate upon which it is drawn. In respect of the 7,770 BACS payments in the period from 1 April 2000 to 28 February 2002, the cost saving to estates was &#163;5,050.50.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> Efficiency savings: the resource efficiencies of electronic payments have, with other process efficiency gains, enabled the Insolvency Service to process a 15 per cent. higher volume of payments in the period from 1 April 2000 to 28 February 2002 without increasing the number of staff engaged in this area of work.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(c)</i> Changes in service levels between the Insolvency Service and its customer: a BACS payment request is processed on the day of receipt (day one) by the Insolvency Service and credited to the payee's bank account on day three. By comparison, a cheque requisition received on day one is despatched to the payee on day four; the transit time and bank clearing process mean that the cheque will generally be credited to the payee's account on day seven&#151;four days later than by BACS.</FONT></UL>

 After considerable consultation with the industry conducted by my Department and the New Opportunities Fund (NOF), we have recently put forward the initial details of the bioenergy capital grants scheme on our website. The initial design takes into account the policy directions which accompany the NOF funding and the recommendations of the Performance and Innovation Unit which accompany the DTI funding. There is no limit to the size of organisation which can be involved, but we envisage setting minimum project sizes to ensure appropriate economies of scale, appropriate electrical efficiency and sufficient supply chain development.

The Government have also funded over &#163;100 million of research under their civil aeronautics research programme since 1997. The programme, which was renewed last year for a further five years until 2006, will continue to encourage both research and technology demonstration in civil aeronautics.

 Carpal tunnel syndrome, CTS, was not originally included in the Handling Agreement and therefore claimants cannot directly apply for compensation for this disability under the present scheme.

Where claimants have been diagnosed as suffering from CTS following medical assessment, the Department will make an additional payment.

 An export licence is not required from the Department of Trade and Industry's Export Control Organisation to manufacture items outside the UK.

The projects include work on advanced lightweight materials, alternative systems for powertrain such as hybridisation and improved conventional internal combustion engines. The Foresight Vehicle Programme is carrying out technology road mapping which will identify R&D priorities for future phases of Foresight Vehicle and inform requirements such as those outlined in the Government's draft "Powering Future Vehicles" strategy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w43.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The renewables obligation will require licensed electricity suppliers to demonstrate through a system of renewables obligation certificates (ROCs) that they have bought a specified proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. Alternatively, suppliers may meet their obligation through the independent market purchase of ROCs. The renewables obligation will thus provide a substantial market incentive for the UK renewable energy industry as a whole. Electricity suppliers will be free to choose the sources of renewable electricity that enable them to meet their obligation most cost-effectively.
<P>

<a name="20325w43.html_para3">Suppliers who do not present the required number of ROCs will be required to make a buy-out payment corresponding to the extent that their purchases of renewable electricity fall short of the specified amount. The buy-out price will be set initially at 3 pence per kilowatt hour. The proceeds from the buy-out payments will be recycled to suppliers in proportion to the number of ROCs presented. The recycling of the buy-out payments will thus provide an extra incentive to suppliers to meet their obligation.
<P>

<a name="20325w43.html_para4">Separately from the operation of the renewables obligation, the Government are providing over &#163;260 million over the three-year period to March 2004 for the direct support of renewable energy initiatives, including capital grants for early demonstration schemes, and research grants.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what action her Department is taking to enable small traders to join the fenestration self- assessment scheme.  [42720]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w44.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20325w44.html_para11">I recently made regulations which allow a person registered with the Fenestration Self-Assessment Scheme (FENSA) to certify to local authorities that replacement glazing they undertake complies with the Building Regulations. FENSA has been developed by the Glass and Glazing Federation (GGF) in consultation with, among others, key industry representative bodies, local authorities, and my Department.
<P>

<a name="20325w44.html_para12">From the start it was the Department's requirement that the scheme should be open, fair and cost-effective. Any business of any size is able to join the scheme. All firms are required to pay a standard registration fee of &#163;100, in addition to a vetting fee of &#163;200. The vetting fee is not required however, if the firm has already been vetted by another body which has standards comparable to FENSA. Currently 19 such bodies are recognised. Therefore the majority of firms applying to FENSA do not need to pay the vetting fee. On top of the vetting fee there is an annual fee of &#163;50, and a transaction charge of under &#163;1 per certificate issued to local authorities&#151;&#163;2 if not undertaken electronically. All these costs are exclusive of VAT. Inspection will be undertaken on 1 per cent. of installations, subject to a minimum of two and a maximum of 100. These will cost around &#163;100 per inspection. The firm is also required to purchase Approved Documents L1 and N.
<P>

<a name="20325w44.html_para13">I do not consider these costs to be punitive. FENSA represents a cost-effective mechanism for companies to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations, while at the same time, providing the necessary safeguards to ensure consumer confidence. Fees set below this level would not allow the necessary number of checks to be undertaken, or the development and maintenance of a satisfactory database which eases the certification process for the installer. I consider that no special measures are required for small traders.

<a name="20325w45.html_para0">The UK's Third National Communication on Climate Change, published last October, reports progress with implementing our climate change programme. We have made excellent progress so far in cutting greenhouse emissions which we estimate have fallen by about 13 per cent. between 1990 and 2000. The Climate Change Programme, published in November 2000, outlines a range of policies that we estimate could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 23 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. This is well in excess of our 12.5 per cent. Kyoto target.

 <i>[holding answer 11 February 2002]:</i> Since the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations (1993) came into force in the UK, a total of 193 consents have been issued to release GM crops to the environment for research purposes. These include the farm scale evaluations, national list trials and a number of other research trials. Releases have taken place at about 1,000 different locations as most consents permit trials at more than one release site. We do not have the figures available in the form requested. However, the DEFRA website contains extracts from the public register, which list the locations by grid reference of all releases as part of experimental trials since 1993 and all sites in the farm scale evaluation programme.

<P>
<a name="20325w45.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government do not consider that there is as yet a clear or accepted understanding of what is meant by the term "final storage quality". We have therefore not undertaken work to determine what treatment such a standard would require before hazardous waste could be sent to landfill or conducted a risk assessment on the impact of not applying such a standard after July 2004.
<P>

<a name="20325w45.html_para6">The Environment Agency has produced draft guidance on standards for treatment of hazardous waste going to landfill following implementation of the directive. The guidance is based on a determination of the best practicable environmental option for individual waste streams and, where processes are regulated under the PPC, the obligation to employ best available techniques with regard to the production of wastes and their

<P>

<a name="20325w45.html_para8">At present approximately 53 per cent. of hazardous waste arisings are landfilled. It is estimated that approximately 41 per cent. of current arisings will continue to be able to be landfilled following the implementation of the bans in July 2002. The amount of hazardous waste that will continue to be landfilled beyond July 2004 and will hence need to be pre-treated will depend on a range of factors. These include general trends in hazardous waste arisings, changes to the definition of hazardous waste, the availability of hazardous waste landfill capacity, the availability of alternative disposal routes such as incineration, and implementation of the waste acceptance criteria currently under negotiation in Brussels which will set out what hazardous wastes can go to hazardous waste sites or to separate cells in non- hazardous landfill sites.

 <i>[holding answer 4 March 2002]:</i> A Scottish Executive Minister was not part of the UK delegation at the Environmental Council on 4 March. On the second point, it is the responsibility of the European Committee of the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise Scottish Executive involvement in preparations for EU Council meetings. The Department provides information to Scottish Executive officials as part of that process.

<P>
<a name="20325w46.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The position of HFCs was made clear in the UK climate change programme that was produced in November 2000. It recognised that HFCs are not sustainable in the long-term and that technological developments may eventually make it possible to replace them in applications where they are used. The programme also stated that HFC emission reduction strategies should not undermine commitments to phase out ozone-depleting substances under the Montreal protocol while making it clear they should only be used where other safe, technically feasible, cost-effective and more environmentally acceptable alternatives do not exist. This position is reflected in the advice make available on the Greening Government website for managers on the Government estate, consultants and manufacturers of air conditioning systems. However, there may be scope under the EC procurement rules for Government Departments to work more closely with their suppliers and this is one of the issues that is being considered by the cross-Government Sustainable Procurement Group recently established by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

<P>
<a name="20325w47.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 March 2002]:</i> Agreement at the climate change talks in Bonn and Marrakesh in 2001 on the detailed rules for implementation of the Kyoto protocol opened the way for ratification and entry into force of the protocol. In order for the Kyoto protocol to enter into force, it must be ratified by at least 55 countries, including countries accounting for at least 55 per cent. of industrialised countries' emissions in 1990. Without US participation, it is essential for both Russia and Japan to ratify as well as the EU.
<P>

<a name="20325w47.html_para0">A European Community decision to ratify Kyoto was adopted on 4 March. This paved the way for the UK and the other EU member states to complete their own ratification procedures. On 7 March, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs made a statement to the House setting in motion the process of UK ratification. Once the protocol has been before Parliament for 21 sitting days, the Foreign Secretary will be in a position to sign the ratification instrument and will do so on or shortly after 19 April. For legal and presentational reasons, the European Community and each of its member states have agreed to deposit their instruments of ratification with the UN Depository simultaneously. Since entry into force of the protocol will occur only 90 days after the prescribed number of ratification instruments have been deposited, the aim is to do this by early June at the latest to allow entry into force by the World Summit on Sustainable Development. We are encouraging other countries to work to this deadline.
<P>

<a name="20325w47.html_para1">The UK is making strong progress with implementing its climate change programme which we estimate could reduce our emissions by 23 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. This is significantly over and above our 12.5 per cent. Kyoto target.
<P>

<a name="20325w47.html_para2">The UK has set a domestic goal to exceed this target through the measures set out in the Government's Climate Change Programme, published in November 2000. This aims to cut CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions alone by 20 per cent.&#151;we are well on course to achieve this and shall continue to evaluate our progress regularly. Measures set out in the UK Climate Change Programme aim to drive emission reductions over the next decade and into the future. Some examples include: the climate change levy, a new Energy Efficiency Commitment, an obligation to increase the production of energy from renewable sources by 10 per cent. by 2020 and an emissions trading scheme which is due to go live in April.

 <i>[holding answer 14 March 2002]:</i> On the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, our goal is to reduce the overall burden of the CAP, delivering better value for money to taxpayers and consumers; greater reflection of animal welfare concerns; a better deal for the environment; and a better deal for farmers.
<P>

<a name="20325w47.html_para3">We want to see market price support and production controls phased out, with transitional support payments to help farmers to adjust. This should be complemented by a shift towards the "second pillar" of the CAP, thus expanding the resources available for targeted support for rural development and agri-environment schemes.
<P>

<a name="20325w47.html_para4">Our primary objective for the Common Fisheries Policy must be for a policy which is both economically and environmentally sustainable and one which involves stakeholders more closely in management decisions affecting them. Only in that way will the CFP attract support and credibility from fishermen, ensure responsible stock management and give the promise of a viable future. I strongly agree with the Commission's conclusions in their Green Paper on the operation of the CFP that it is not meeting its objectives.

<P>

<a name="20325w48.html_para3">Since then, there have been no changes in the area of land required to spread manure in a NVZ. The controls require farmers to remain within annual whole-farm limits for applying organic manure, allowing maximum nitrogen loadings of 250 kg/ha of total N on grassland and 210 kg/ha of total N on arable land.
<P>

<a name="20325w48.html_para4">From 19 December 2002 the maximum loading for arable land in existing NVZs (but not in new NVZs) will be reduced from 210 kg/ha to 170 kg/ha.

 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2002]:</i> The EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste&#151;94/62/EC&#151;was implemented in Great Britain by the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended).
<P>

<a name="20325w48.html_para10">In order to comply with the requirements in the directive, recovery and recycling targets for 2001 under the packaging regulations were 56 per cent. for recovery and 18 per cent. for material-specific recycling of packaging waste. Data received to date suggest that, if obligated parties meet their obligations, these targets should be met.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w49.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The recovery or disposal of waste, including lower grade composted waste, must be carried out in compliance with the controls in place to fulfil the requirements of the waste framework directive. The main controls are set out in Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Waste Management Licensing Regulations (the 1994 Regulations). We have issued guidance on these controls in DOE Circular 11/94; and statutory guidance to the Environment Agency on waste management licensing in Waste Management Paper Number 4.
<P>

<a name="20325w49.html_para0">Waste compost may be spread on land for agricultural benefit or ecological improvement under the terms of the licensing exemption provided in paragraph 7 of Schedule 3 to the 1994 Regulations and registered with the Environment Agency. The spreading of waste compost in these circumstances is classified as a waste recovery operation. The disposal of waste compost must be carried out under the terms of a licence issued by the Environment Agency.
<P>

 In 1999 the Government published its strategy for sustainable development for the UK, "A Better Quality of Life". This strategy is supported by a core set of around 150 indicators of sustainable development. A subset of 15 headline indicators focuses on specific issues and reflects targets against which progress is measured and reported annually. River water quality is one of the headline indicators. Over the last decade, general river quality in the UK has either improved or remained high.
<P>

<a name="20325w49.html_para4">In 1995 the Environment Act amended the Water Industry Act 1991 to place water companies under a statutory duty to promote the efficient use of water by their customers. Ofwat enforces this duty and requires companies to produce five-year water efficiency plans on which progress is reported annually. Following the Water Summit in 1997, Ofwat set annual leakage targets for water companies, which have resulted in a reduction of about 30 per cent. Further details are contained in the Ofwat report 'Leakage and the efficient use of water 2000&#150;01', a copy of which is in the Library of the House. In addition, the Government runs the Envirowise programme, which promotes resource productivity&#151;including water use&#151;by industry. This resulted in over 29 million m <sup>3</sup>  of water being saved last year.

 The issues of poverty eradication and sustainable production and consumption have been addressed by a number of key strategies published since 1997. In particular, the UK Government's Sustainable Development Strategy, 'A Better Quality of Life' sets out an overarching strategy for achieving sustainable development through social progress which recognises the needs of everyone, effective protection of the environment, prudent use of natural resources, and maintenance of high and stable levels of economic growth and employment. It includes a set of indicators to measure progress. The 2001 Annual Report on progress with the strategy was published last week.

 Combating illegal logging requires effort from both timber producing and consuming countries. Timber producing countries are responsible for defining and enforcing the national legislative and regulatory frameworks that define legality.

 The Department has commissioned a report on the scale of timber procurement activities undertaken by central Government Departments and the improved guidance required to help buyers purchase timber and wood products from sustainable and legal sources. The final report is not due to be published until the summer of 2002. The timber trade, non-governmental organisations and other interested stakeholders are being consulted on the options for assessing product supplier claims on the sustainability of the source of the wood in their products. A consultation paper has been published on the website of the Tropical Forest Forum in advance of an open discussion on 25 March 2002. Written comments have been invited too. Following completion of the report it is intended that Departments will be given clearer guidelines including how to monitor and report on the evidence presented by suppliers. Departments will be asked to include information on wood product procurement in their returns for the annual reports on Sustainable Development in Government. This should enable their success in purchasing timber from independently certified sources to be evaluated.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to her answer of 8 March 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 642W, on flooding, what plans she has to review groundwater flooding matters.  [45195]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w50.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We have no such plans. While groundwater flooding was recognised as a significant factor in the flooding of autumn 2000, its causes are varied and often complex.
<P>

<a name="20325w50.html_para3">The current legal situation is that, as with land subsidence, responsibility for taking remedial action generally falls to the individual householder or landowner. Only where groundwater problems are directly related to a defined watercourse do flood defence operating authorities have permissive powers to act. In deciding whether to do so they would need to consider the technical, economic and environmental effects of such action.
<P>

<a name="20325w50.html_para4">However, the Environment Agency routinely monitor major groundwater aquifers for water resource purposes.

 The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) provide 145 full-time subsidised nursery places for departmental and agency staff at six sites. The actual number of children using the nurseries is higher than this figure due to many of the places being allocated on a part-time basis. The cost of nursery places and the amount of subsidy varies for each location.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w52.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The emphasis of the Department's approach to controlling outbreaks of brucellosis is the regular statutory testing of both dairy and beef herds to ensure that Great Britain maintains its brucellosis free status.
<P>

<a name="20325w52.html_para0">All dairy herds are tested monthly using the bulk milk tank test. If there is a positive result, blood samples are taken from all cattle in the herd and tested. Blood samples are taken from all adult breeding cattle in 50 per cent. of the national beef herd every year. This far exceeds the requirements of EC Directive 64/432. Under the Brucellosis (England) Order 2000, and equivalent legislation in Scotland and Wales, there is a statutory requirement for farmers to report abortions and premature calvings to the Local Animal Health Office of DEFRA. Investigative tests are then carried out.
<P>

<a name="20325w52.html_para1">To lessen the risk that brucellosis might be imported during the controlled restocking of farms following the foot and mouth disease epidemic, my Department has issued instructions to introduce even tighter surveillance and control for brucellosis under the cattle tracing system. All imported female cattle will be targeted for testing at strategic points. Reports are generated in the event of calving, absence of notified calving when a female reaches 30 months and when no calving has been registered for females over 30 months within 12 months of import. These reports are then followed up and testing carried out accordingly.
<P>

<a name="20325w52.html_para2">If an animal tests positive, it will be slaughtered with compensation and the rest of the herd will be placed under movement restrictions while further confirmatory testing is carried out. A veterinary investigation into the cause of the positive blood test result will be initiated immediately and movements on to and off the affected premises will be traced. It usually takes up to three weeks to confirm whether or not the animal was infected. In the event that brucellosis is confirmed contact herds will be tested. If 



<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 2002 : Column 730W</I><P>
the veterinary investigation reveals that some contact animals are at risk, these will also be slaughtered. This may involve the slaughter of all the affected herd. This strategy worked when one case of imported brucellosis was confirmed in Great Britain in 1993.

<P>

<a name="20325w53.html_para3">The website was relaunched in November 2001 to provide the Treasury with a more robust, better organised and searchable platform for its website. At that time, the opportunity was taken to remove a number of older documents, including files relating to the previous administration. Material removed at that time included expenditure reviews, press releases from 1994 to 1996 and older budget and spending review information. However, as a consequence of the relaunch, the site is significantly more robust and, with its search engine and simple navigational structure, documents are now easier to access and read.

 The Tax Law Rewrite Project continues to make good progress. At the end of this month it will be publishing its thirteenth Exposure Draft, containing draft clauses on foreign income and property income.
<P>

<a name="20325w54.html_para7">The project is also currently working on an Income Tax Bill rewriting the provisions on employment income, pension income and taxable social security benefits. In preparation for that Bill, this year's Finance Bill will included some small amendments to the tax legislation on employment income. Copies of this draft Finance Bill legislation will shortly be published on the project's website.
<P>

<a name="20325w54.html_para8">Copies of the Exposure Draft and the draft Finance Bill legislation will be placed in the Library as soon as they are available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w54.html_spnew12"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Preston judgment means that many employers must give all their part-time employees and certain of their ex-employees, retrospective access to membership of their occupational pension schemes from April 1976 or in some cases later. The employers concerned have a responsibility to settle with their employees and ex-employees how this should be achieved in each case. There are outstanding cases before Employment Tribunals which are designed to determine how employers and employees should meet their liabilities.
<P>

<a name="20325w54.html_para9">Where employees are entitled to membership rights in an occupational scheme in respect of past periods of employment, the normal rules about tax relief on contributions continue to apply. That is:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>all employers' contributions to occupational pension schemes, including any for past service, qualify for corporation tax relief;
<P>
<BR>
employees' contributions up to 15 per cent. of their salary from the employer concerned in the year the contributions are paid qualify for income tax, irrespective of whether any part of the contribution is in respect of previous years' service;
<P>

employees may make contributions to their schemes above 15 per cent. of salary in any tax year but any such contributions do not benefit from tax relief.

 Following a detailed review of the current arrangements and future requirements for government debt and asset management, the National Debt Office (NDO) and the Public Works Loans Board (PWLB) will be integrated with the UK Debt Management Office (DMO) with effect from 1 July. Both the NDO and the PWLB are part of the National Investment and Loans Office (NILO) and the relevant staff will be relocated to the DMO's offices. This reorganisation, while maintaining provision of existing services, is designed to deliver improved management of the central Government balance sheet, and to offer a more robust, flexible and innovative service to public sector clients.
<P>

<a name="20325w55.html_para0">At the same time the remaining part of NILO, the Office of HM Paymaster General (OPG), will be merged with the Treasury, while also maintaining the provision of its existing services. NILO will thereafter cease to exist.

 As detailed in the Pre-Budget Report 2000 (Cm 4917, Box A3, page 153) higher oil prices would, all else equal, tend to reduce GDP growth and increase inflation. However, the UK differs from most other major industrialised economies in that it is a small net exporter of oil, so potential GDP losses may be partly offset by increased North Sea production.

 As the Prime Minister has made clear, most recently on 11 March, no decision has been made on whether to take military action against Iraq. Iraq currently contributes supplies of oil equivalent to about three per cent. of world production. Spare oil production capacity worldwide is currently several times this amount. Moreover, there are also International Energy Agency and international agreements on holding stocks of oil, and procedures to deal with any oil supply disruptions. Oil markets are, however, volatile and to some extent driven by expectations, as well as responding to the near-term actual balance of supply and demand. It is therefore difficult to predict the impact on oil prices from any supply disruptions, and the question of military action against Iraq is only one of a wide range of influences. The Government will publish an updated forecast for the UK economy in the Budget on April 17, taking account of all relevant economic factors.

 As indicated in my reply to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) on 5 March 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 192W, a full investigation has now been carried out into the circumstances which led to delays in dealing with parliamentary questions in the Department of Health, including apparent falsification in recording the 



<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 2002 : Column 752W</I><P>
handling of parliamentary questions in the Department's parliamentary section. The aim of the investigation was to establish the facts and to ensure that the necessary remedial action is taken.
<P>

<a name="20325w58.html_para2">An audit of outstanding questions was carried out immediately after the apparent falsification of the electronic database used in the parliamentary section to track the handling of parliamentary questions in the Department was discovered. This identified 411 outstanding questions due for reply before 14 February, with 214 of those questions having been recorded as answered when no reply had been given. This information formed the basis for my reply on 5 March and for replies to subsequent questions to hon. Members. Further more detailed investigation of the information derived from this audit reduced the number of outstanding questions due for reply before 14 February to 354, with 202 questions recorded as having been answered when no reply had been given. The balance was accounted for by questions which further investigation showed had in fact been answered where this had not been clear previously or which were due for reply after 14 February, questions transferred to other Departments for answer, duplicate entries on the database and incorrect entries on the database. Of these 354 questions, 348 received replies by 12 March, the remaining 6 on 13 March.
<P>

<a name="20325w58.html_para3">In addition this more detailed investigation identified a further 11 outstanding questions due for reply before 14 February. Six of these were recorded as having been completed and given a false Hansard reference on the database; two previously unidentified questions were found which had been recorded as having received replies when they had not; and three outstanding questions were discovered which had not been recorded on the database at all. All these questions have now been answered.
<P>

<a name="20325w58.html_para4">Of the total of 365 questions finally identified as due for reply before 14 February which had not received replies when I reported the situation on 5 March, 33 received an answer within one month of the due date for reply and 95 were answered within two months. The remaining 237 had been awaiting replies for more than two months; and 77 of these were asked before the summer recess in 2001.

<a name="20325w58.html_para6">The investigation has also established that according to the Library of the House there are a number of outstanding questions from previous Sessions. Regrettably, because the Department had not been following the normal practice of sending all questions answered by letter to the Library of the House, we are unable to confirm how many of these questions were not in fact answered. All of the questions answered by letter during the last summer recess have now been placed in the Library; and this practice will be followed assiduously in future. There are, however, some indications that falsification of the database may have taken

place during previous Sessions; and this will be pursued in the context of the disciplinary process which is taking place.
<P>

<a name="20325w58.html_para7">The main conclusions of the investigation were as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) There is clear evidence of the systematic falsification of records on the database which tracks the handling of the parliamentary questions received in the Department of Health. Questions were recorded as having been answered when no replies had been passed to the Member of Parliament or the <i>Official Report</i>; incorrect information appears to have been entered on the whereabouts of parliamentary questions within the system and in a number of cases a false Hansard reference was entered to indicate that the process was complete and had been externally validated. There have been three cases where questions that appeared on the Order Paper were not entered on to the database, thus preventing their being processed at all.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) Examination of the questions in the backlog revealed no consistent pattern either by party or subject matter.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) All the indications are that previously unidentified delays in handling cases in the parliamentary section were the overwhelming contributory factor, leading to the backlog of outstanding questions that developed, and that these delays were not identified through routine monitoring systems because of deliberate falsification of the database.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iv) The number of parliamentary questions listed for answer by the Department of Health has increased significantly during this Session. During the 2000&#150;01 Session (December 2000&#151;May 2001) 1,754 questions were asked in 83 sitting days. For the current Session to date (June 2001&#151;20 March 2002) 5,748 questions have been asked in 120 sitting days. This increase has tested the resources of the parliamentary section, particularly in the timely and diligent follow up of ministerial queries on draft answers. Pressure of work cannot, however, explain the failure to answer all the parliamentary questions in an appropriate and timely manner.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(v) Although some concerns were raised both within the Department and by MPs about delays in responding to questions and these concerns were followed up by Ministers and managers, suspicion was successfully deflected to others within the organisation. This was possible because the management information provided by the database had been corrupted by the false entries and because the increased volume of parliamentary questions made it increasingly difficult to track the physical progress of parliamentary questions folders in a small and cramped office. The falsification of the database also prevented the size of the backlog emerging in routine monitoring of progress on answering questions. Currently there is no external system against which the Department can validate its performance. From April the Leader of the House will make available to all Departments regular lists of the parliamentary questions the Library's records show are outstanding, so that such a check can be made.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(vi) An official in the parliamentary section has been suspended and is awaiting disciplinary action, in accordance with departmental disciplinary procedures. The detailed evidence found by the investigation will be used in this process. There is no evidence to suggest that any other member of staff was improperly involved.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="20325w58.html_para8">Line managers had already put in hand action to manage the increased volume of parliamentary questions, to speed up their processing, and to share the tasks more widely within the unit. The database was in the process of being modified to provide more accessible and timely management information on the handling of parliamentary questions to enable improved tracking, early intervention and a clear audit trail. The staffing complement of the unit had been increased from seven to eight.

<P>

<a name="20325w58.html_para9">A summary of the process for dealing with parliamentary questions in the Department of Health prior to this investigation is being placed in the Library of the House. The following further remedial action was identified as necessary by the investigation and is being put in hand immediately:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) New arrangements will be established within the parliamentary section to ensure that the process for tracking parliamentary questions cannot be manipulated by any one individual. This will include a clear separation of tasks and building in a greater degree of external checking and validation, including regular checks against information held by the Library of the House.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) The electronic database will be modified and shared across the Department and Ministers' Private Offices to allow for a more transparent system of tracking the handling of parliamentary questions.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) Questions are already handled electronically between the parliamentary section and officials. This will be extended to include Ministers' Private Office to simplify and speed the process.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iv) Ministers' Private Secretaries will be responsible for dealing with outstanding queries on draft parliamentary questions before they are returned to the parliamentary section.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(v) The parliamentary section will be moved to more suitable accommodation as a matter of urgency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(vi) In addition to the extra capacity already introduced, there will be an immediate review of the staffing complement within the parliamentary section to reflect the increase in work load and to ensure proper controls mechanisms are in place, using other Departments' parliamentary sections with similar volumes of work as comparators.</FONT></UL>

1. Waiting time statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and waiting times for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment at a given point in time and how long they have been on the waiting list.<P>

2. HES calculates the waiting time as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-referrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<P>

3. The main operation is the first of four operation fields in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode.<P>

 The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry. The MRC spend on autism research for 2000&#150;01 was approximately &#163;1.2 million. The MRC funds a large amount of work on the causes and treatment of autism, and to increase the knowledge base of issues surrounding autism. As part of this ongoing work the MRC has recently published a review of the current state of knowledge about the causes and epidemiology of autism. The MRC has also recently been given an extra &#163;2.5 million by the Department to do further research into autism.

 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> Part-time working among general practitioners (GPs) is growing as the numbers and proportion of women GPs increase.

<P>
<a name="20325w62.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The NHS Plan sets a target of 7,500 additional consultants by 2004 (England), over the 1999 baseline, needed to deliver the service targets set out in the Plan. There are currently around 275 consultants in genito-urinary medicine in England. We anticipate that by 2004 there will be an increase of around 35 trained specialists in genito-urinary medicine, and a further 25 by 2009. We have also agreed an increase in specialist registrar numbers of up to 16 by 2004.
<P>

<a name="20325w62.html_para2">We continually review future requirements for trained specialists as part of the NHS's new multi-disciplinary workforce planning processes. These will look at the requirements for doctors alongside other staff focusing on the potential for new ways of working and developing new roles. As part of this process we discuss with the Royal College of Physicians their view of workforce needs in genito-urinary medicine.

 Under the Care Standards Act 2000, the National Care Standards Commission takes over its responsibility for the regulation of social care and independent health care services on 1 April.

On that basis the Commission has not received any applications for registration from such potential providers. The

The Commission has to date received no applications from bed and breakfast accommodation under pilot schemes wishing to register under the Care Standards Act.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what recent assessment he has made of the risk of abuse of elderly people with mental health problems in different care environments.  [41710]<P>

<P>
<a name="20325w63.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Older people with mental health problems are as potentially susceptible to abuse as any other group of vulnerable adults. The Department takes the protection of vulnerable adults extremely seriously and is determined to stamp out abuse wherever it occurs. We are actively seeking to tackle the problem through a variety of initiatives. These include the launch of guidance titled 'No Secrets' and the planned implementation of the Protection of Vulnerable Adults list.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the <i>(a)</i> amount and <i>(b)</i> proportion of mental health expenditure has been on child and adolescent services in financial year 2001&#150;02; and if he will make a statement on his assessment of the adequacy of the (i) amount and (ii) proportion of expenditure devoted to child and adolescent services.  [45941]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20325w63.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 This information requested is not readily available. However our estimate for likely mental health expenditure in 2001&#150;02 and the proportion spent on child and adolescent services is shown in the table, with the personal social services (PSS) expenditure particularly difficult to estimate.
<P>

<a name="20325w63.html_para4">We recognise that much still needs to be done to improve child and adolescent mental health. The work currently ongoing on the child and adolescent mental health module of the Children's National Service Framework will do much to inform our future expenditure.

 The national health service provides care for women during pregnancy and childbirth in various types, sizes and locations of maternity units, including units within general hospitals or stand alone units. The Department expects this choice to continue. It is for local health authorities, Trusts and communities to decide on the pattern of service provision, taking into account the needs of local people, evidence of effectiveness and available resources.

 The Department has consistently supported research into diabetes but has not in the past collected information on its total expenditure in this field. The greater part of the funding has gone to the clinical service support costs of research funded by other agencies such as the Medical Research Council and Diabetes UK. The landmark "UK Prospective Diabetes Study", a randomised multi-centre trial in more than 5,000 patients over 20 years, has been supported in this way and continues. The Department has also funded the direct costs of research through its national and regional research and development programmes.

 Services for the screening and management of diabetes are provided in a variety of health care settings and are of varying quality. There is evidence to show that the onset of Type II diabetes can be delayed, or even prevented, that effective management of diabetes increases life expectancy and reduces the risk of complications, and that self-management is the cornerstone of effective diabetes care. This evidence underpins our development of a national service framework for diabetes, for which we published the standards in December 2001. They set out 12 standards

<P>
<a name="20325w64.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Government has undertaken a range of co-ordinated initiatives to raise awareness of epilepsy. These include: supporting the Epilepsy Advisory Board to produce "Epilepsy Care&#151;Making it Happen", a highly useful publication for improving epilepsy services; holding a NHS Epilepsy Day in October 1999; commending the Clinical Standards Advisory Group (CSAG) report, Services for people who have epilepsy, to the NHS; providing Section 64 funding to the Joint Epilepsy Council (JEC) to undertake a project to draw upon the good practice advice in the CSAG report and other recent epilepsy initiatives; supporting the National Sentinel Audit into Epilepsy Related Deaths which is expected to be published in May 2002; and, publishing the Chief Medical Officer's (CMO) Annual Report 2001, On the State of the Public Health, which included information on epilepsy.

<a name="20325w64.html_para9">In addition to specific projects, the Department also provides support for research commissioned by charities and the research councils that takes place in the national health service . Management of much of the research supported by NHS research and development funding is devolved and expenditure at project level is not held centrally by the Department. The total investment is therefore considerably greater than just the spend on directly commissioned projects.

 Direct sale of emergency contraception in pharmacies has provided a welcome additional point of access to emergency contraception.
