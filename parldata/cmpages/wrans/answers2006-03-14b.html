 We remain concerned about the infringement of human rights through the Hudood Ordinances, which enforce strict forms of punishments such as whipping, amputation of limbs and death for breaking the law. We are particularly concerned by the ordinance relating to the offence of Zina (Fornication/Adultery) which increases potential injustices against women. Victims of rape, or even gang rape, have been accused of Zina and thereby subjected to wrong and unjust prosecutions. This has often left victims ostracised by their families and communities.

<p><a name="st_19"><a name="60314w02.html_spnew5"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 As the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has documented in successive reports, Iran has long lacked transparency about its nuclear activities. The nature of Iran&#039;s nuclear activities, its record of concealment, its failure to co-operate fully with the IAEA, and its failure to take necessary confidence building steps have contributed to the deep concerns of the international community that Iran&#039;s intentions regarding its nuclear programme, may not be, as it claims, exclusively peaceful. It is precisely for this reason that we, with France and Germany, and with the

We urge the DPRK to return to the Six Party talks and implement its commitments, including verifiably dismantling its illicit weapons programmes and resuming its engagement in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="60314w04.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 The Department&#039;s National Transport Model uses fuel prices that are based upon DTI crude oil price projections. We update our fuel price forecasts in line with DTI oil price updates. DTI usually make their oil price projections (which they normally update one or two times a year) publicly available on their website and also subject them to periodic public review&#151;most recently in the summer of 2005 (http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/fossil&#095;fuel&#095;price&#095;assumptions.pdf). Their latest projections are for crude oil to fall from its current high levels to $35 (in 2004 prices) in 2010 and then remain at that level in real terms through to 2020&#151;the end of their projection.

<a name="stpa_17">The Aviation White Paper published in December 2003 says that DfT will continue to update forecasts in the light of trends.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps his Department is taking to encourage <i>(a)</i> Governments and <i>(b)</i> other organisations to support the establishment of the proposed Arms Trade Treaty.  [57494]</p>




<p><a name="st_65"><a name="60314w07.html_spnew6"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Ensuring better regulation of the arms trade is an essential pre-requisite for conflict prevention and development. As a result, DFID has worked very closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to promote the Government&#039;s commitment to an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). When the first committee of the UN General Assembly meets this year, the UK will aim to secure a UN resolution which will establish a formal UN-based ATT process. Significant progress has already been made, notably the endorsement of an ATT by the EU Council and the call for negotiations on an ATT from Commonwealth Heads of Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w07.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_36">DFID has contributed to a range of FCO-led initiatives, including the May 2005 meeting of experts at Lancaster House in London. This year, DFID is developing a joint strategy with Whitehall partners on how to encourage other countries and regional bodies to actively promote the ATT. This will focus on building wider support for a first committee resolution, and will include awareness raising events and the establishment of a &quot;friends of ATT&quot; group of supportive Governments. In addition we will use ministerial visits and discussions with partner countries, regional and international organisations to generate support for a resolution. For example, this month we participated in a cross-Whitehall lobbying visit to China.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w07.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_37">In parallel, given the devastating impact of small arms and light weapons (SALW) on the developing world, DFID is working closely with the FCO and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) on strengthening language on transfer controls within the existing UN Programme of Action on SALW. When the UN Programme of Action is reviewed in July we will seek agreement to develop a set of politically binding criteria for SALW transfers. In the run up to the review conference DFID will work closely with the FCO to win support for a common text on universal principles for SALW transfers. There has been good progress in developing regional agreement on standards for small arms transfers in Central America and the Horn of Africa/Great Lakes region. Under the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, we have funded non-governmental organisations such as the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA) and Saferworld, which work with African Governments and civil society to ensure that African voices are heard in discussions on transfer controls.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what estimate he has made of the number of women who died in childbirth in developing countries in each of the last five years, broken down by <i>(a)</i> country and <i>(b)</i> age group.  [57608]</p>




<p><a name="st_67"><a name="60314w08.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Maternal mortality is quite difficult to measure over relatively short time periods, and DFID looks to the World Health Organisation (WHO), with the United Nations Children&#039;s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to collectively produce global estimates. These are supplemented in some countries by information on maternal mortality obtained from demographic and health surveys conducted every four to five years. From the data available, it is estimated that each year 529,000 women die from complications in pregnancy and childbirth, and that 99 per cent. of these deaths take place in poor countries. With the exception of Afghanistan, the countries with the highest maternal mortality ratios are all in Africa. These include Sierra Leone which has a maternal mortality ratio of 2,000 deaths for every 100,000 live births, and Malawi which has a ratio of 1,800 deaths for every 100,000 live births.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w08.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_40">DFID is supporting research with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Gates Foundation to improve the way maternal mortality is measured. This will enable poor countries to both better track progress of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of improving maternal mortality and to advocate for more resources for maternal health. Some countries in sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing a reversal of previous gains and without considerably more action this MDG target will not be met.

 Over 529,000 women; mostly young, impoverished and vulnerable, die each year as a result of pregnancy or childbirth. Much more effort is needed if the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) to lower maternal mortality is to be achieved by 2015.

<a name="60314w08.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_41">This is why DFID launched its strategy &#039;Reducing maternal deaths: Evidence and action&#039; in 2004. The strategy sets out four clear priorities for action:

<a name="stpa_42">The UK is the only major bilateral donor to have developed a strategy specifically to address &#039;improving maternal health&#039; (MDG 5). We are also supporting the global Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health which is working to advocate on a much bigger international and national platform.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w08.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_43">Improving maternal health depends on functioning health services, and stronger health systems, with the right staff, equipment, drugs and supplies in place and functioning properly. Women also need to be able to access sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, and care to deal with the causes and consequences of unsafe abortion, as well services to prevent, treat and care for HIV and AIDS. DFID has invested &#163;650 million for health sector support since 2000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w08.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_44">DFID support in Nepal is addressing all these issues. For example, the remote Baglung district hospital is providing emergency obstetric care (Caesareans), with local nurses who have been trained in giving epidural anaesthesia. Blood transfusions are available, transport is possible because bridges have been built and communications (now through mobile phones), is working. Access to obstetric care is increasing, irrespective of the conflict. And that means that not only are women benefiting, but children with fractured limbs and others who need blood transfusions are getting help.

<a name="stpa_45">In Malawi, DFID has provided &#163;100 million to an Emergency Human Resource Programme. In a country where two out of three nurse-midwife posts are vacant and where only eight out of 27 districts have a Malawian doctor, there is now early evidence to suggest a positive shift. And importantly, pregnant women are beginning to be able to have HIV tests and some are receiving anti-retroviral drugs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w08.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_46">In 2004&#150;05, DFID spent more than &#163;243 million on bilateral programmes on maternal health (including sexual and reproductive health) and are continuing to ensure that good country plans which highlight maternal health are fully funded. In several countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and Kenya, DFID is investing strongly in specific safe motherhood programmes with a focus on skilled birth attendants and access to obstetric services. We further support maternal health through multilateral support to our partners in UN agencies, the World Bank and the EU.

 If there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health, including highly pathogenic avian influenza, in a non-EU country, Community legislation allows appropriate safeguard action to be taken, which may include a ban on imports from all, or from parts, of the affected country. In the UK we implement the Community safeguard measures by the issue of a legal document called a Declaration that sets out the details of the ban or trade restrictions imposed.

 Under the Water Resources Act the Environment Agency is responsible for controlling discharges to groundwater, taking into account whether such discharges could lead to pollution. Under the Groundwater Regulations 1998, disposals to land which contain substances listed in the Regulations require prior authorisation. For cases where pollution of groundwater might result, the Environment Agency may not grant consent. Thus where surface water contains polluting matter; including listed substances, prior authorisation to discharge or dispose of it is required.

 The IPCC Third Assessment (2001) considers carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2</sub>  ) generated by both natural phenomena and human activities. Human emissions are estimated to be approximately 8 billion tonnes of carbon in 1990, rising to 9.1 billion tonnes of carbon in 2002, compared to approximately 210 billion tonnes of carbon generated naturally in 1990. However, as natural emissions and their removal from the atmosphere are about balanced, the additional emissions from human activities are extremely significant for the energy balance of the atmosphere.

This is designed to be used by coastal authorities to inform their current revisions of SMPs.

 The Advisory Committee on Pesticides has considered the possibility that exposure to pesticides could cause complex multi-system disorders in a minority of individuals who are unusually susceptible and accepts that this cannot be completely ruled out. However, the Committee considers it unlikely that pesticide toxicity contributes significantly to conditions such as these because there are currently no known toxic mechanisms that would explain the patterns of symptoms reported by people with these disorders, nor is there any information about the limits on exposure that would be needed to prevent such illness occurring. Other regulatory and standard-setting bodies in the UK and internationally similarly do not include possible risks of these illnesses when setting exposure limits for pesticides or other environmental chemicals.

The 12 most serious cases involved cypermethrin dips. The majority of incidents were in Wales and most arose from apparent routine use rather than disposal of used dip. All of the cases involved the loss of aquatic life with one involving the loss of a great many cray fish; a protected species. Nine of the cases have led to prosecution.

 A broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy is in place. The strategy can be summarised as, &#039;Reducing distress and promoting the well being of all who live and work in prisons.&#039; It operates by embedding &#039;safer custody&#039; as a current through every area of prison life&#151;including detoxification, healthcare, staff training, and the built environment. The key intervention currently being introduced across public and private prisons is the new care-planning system for at-risk prisoners: Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT). ACCT aims to improve the quality of care by introducing flexible care-planning that is prisoner-centred, supported by improved staff training in assessing and understanding at-risk prisoners.

Existing risk management processes, in particular cell-sharing risk assessment, help staff to identify individuals who may have racist or homophobic attitudes and make accommodation decisions that reduce the risk of violence motivated by hate.

This process includes interviews with key Commanders and staffs, the units involved, engagement with Coalition partners and analysis of publicly available information.

 Research on the possible impact of the Government&#039;s proposals to reform liquor licensing in Northern Ireland was carried out via an Omnibus Survey of some 1,000 households and a review of literature in the UK and further a field. This included the topics of antisocial behaviour and under-age drinking. The proposals were drawn up in conjunction with a steering group including officials from the Department for Social Development, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the Northern Ireland Office and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. A consultation paper was published on 1 November 2005 and circulated to a wide range of organisations. A list of these organisations was placed in the Library. I will carefully consider responses to the consultation exercise before announcing my proposals for legislation.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland pursuant to the Answer of 27 February 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, column 378W, on osteoporosis, how much has been spent on osteoporosis in Northern Ireland in each of the last 10 years; which are the most common forms of intervention used in Northern Ireland; what assessment he has made of their effectiveness; how many people are waiting to be treated for osteoporosis in Northern Ireland; and whether all interventions available in England are not available in Northern Ireland.

<p><a name="st_221"><a name="60314w31.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 The amount spent on osteoporosis in each of the last ten years is not known; the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is included as part of the work of a wide range of health and social services professionals and it is not possible to distinguish separately the amount spent by them on the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w31.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_189">The forms of intervention used in connection with osteoporosis depend on a number of factors, including whether the intervention is to prevent or treat osteoporosis, the risk factors involved, the age and gender of the individual patient, the propensity to fracture and the extent of co-existing disease. Typical interventions include case finding approaches, lifestyle advice, prevention of falls and the use of medicines both to treat osteoporosis or to prevent it, especially for those people at risk of fracture or who have multiple risk factors.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Mar 2006 : Column 2154W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w31.html_para4">
The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has made no specific assessment of the multiple interventions which can be used to prevent and/or treat osteoporosis. However, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Effectiveness (NICE) has produced guidance on certain drugs and is currently assessing other drug treatments for both primary and secondary prevention of osteoporosis. NICE also intends to produce a comprehensive clinical guideline on the assessment of fracture risk and the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in individuals at high risk. My Department is currently putting in place arrangements to link with NICE, and will conduct a local process to determine applicability of NICE guidance to Northern Ireland. It is intended that future assessments of the clinical and cost effectiveness of interventions, once published by NICE, will be part of this process. In this context, the Department will then consider whether there is a need to revise the previously published local guidance produced by the Clinical Resource Efficiency Support Team (CREST) in 2001 on the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w31.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_190">The number of people waiting to be treated for osteoporosis is not known. Official waiting list statistics are collected at specialty level and it is not possible to identify from these figures how many patients are waiting to be treated for a specific condition such as osteoporosis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w31.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_191">Finally, the Department does not hold details of the availability of interventions for osteoporosis in England. Within Northern Ireland, the specialist drug teriparatide, which is licensed for use in the treatment of established osteoporosis in post-menopausal women, is not currently funded by Health and Social Services Boards due to competing pressures for funding. I shall be announcing shortly details of additional funding for specialist drugs in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 and I would expect Boards to utilise a proportion of this funding to introduce new specialist drugs such as teriparatide.

<a name="stpa_196">There is currently no backlog of asylum appeals at the AIT. However, between April and September 2005 the AIT accrued a backlog of entry clearance and family visitor appeals due to higher volumes of receipts, particularly family visitor appeals, than anticipated. These appeals were processed by the end of December 2005 and now form part of the Tribunal&#039;s work in progress. They are currently awaiting appeal bundles from the relevant entry clearance posts and will be heard throughout the remainder of this calendar year. Planning for the clearance of these appeals was not contingent upon the appointments of additional Immigration Judges from the current competitions.

Assessing an individual at a relatively early stage of their claim allows us to maximise their chances of returning to work.

<sup>(40)</sup> Outturn figures show the final investment cost for the completed projects.<br>

<sup>(41)</sup> CSR: The Department had a Private Finance Initiative contract for the provision of IT services to the Child Support Agency worth approximately &#163;456 million over 10 years. This contract commenced in August 2000 with a 10 year duration to August 2010. Under a general realignment of departmental contracts announced in August 2005, EDS will complete the system as currently specified, including correcting all agreed defects. The revised contract still has a completion date of August 2010 and the Department expects to save around &#163;65 million (net present value basis) in Child Support information technology costs over the remaining period of the deal with EDS.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The planned expenditure is;<br>

for projects currently in progress, the latest forecast investment expenditure or<br>

for completed projects the final approved investment expenditure.<br>

2. BPRP: As part of the programme&#039;s governance it attended a gate on Monday 6 February 2006. At this gate a number of options for progressing the programme were presented. The gate reserved its decision and asked the programme to:<br>

(i) Return to a gate in four months time having considered the impact of the Welfare Reform Green Paper; and<br>

(ii) Continue its investment programme until the next gate by progressing work in areas common to all options presented.<br>

Agreed forecast costs and completion date is dependant upon this decision.<br>

<i>[holding answer 27 February 2006]:</i> Primary care trusts (PCTs) and predecessor organisations, have responsibility for managing delivery of services provided by general practitioners (GPs); including the adequacy of their practice premises from which to provide.

<p>

<p>
<a name="60314w41.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_248">The 2005 snapshot by PCTs shows that collectively they have judged many GP premises across London as being below minimum standards. This needs to be set in context in that judgements for some of those standards are subjective which by their very nature may lead to some PCTs reporting higher levels of premises that do not meet minimum standards than other PCTs with similar premises.

<a name="stpa_249">In addition, failure is not about buildings being in a dangerous state of repair. Rather, that the premises may not have for example, adequate access to and within premises and WC facilities for disabled patients and staff.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w41.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_250">This is not because of a lack of intent by GPs practices and their PCTs to provide these facilities but because for example, the building is too small to incorporate them; with a general lack of suitable, alternative locations to develop. These are historic problems for London and other inner city PCTs that prevents investment in smaller business buildings including the development of modern GP and wider primary care premises.

Nevertheless, the NHS plan set targets to substantially improve or replace up to 3,000 general practitioner premises and provide 500 one-stop primary care centres by 2004. These national targets were achieved with 462 premises improvements and 45 one-stop primary care centres produced or being developed across London.

<a name="stpa_251">For the longer term, across the London area all PCTs apart from Kensington and Chelsea PCT, and Westminster PCT are part of NHS LIFT. This, in its initial phase, has delivered to date 14 new buildings open to patients with another 18 under construction. These are not like-for-like replacements but modern super-surgeries that co-locate a range of primary, community and social care services with others normally provided in hospital settings.

<a name="stpa_252">Examples include Newham PCT, who are through City and East London LIFT delivering a wider range of services to patients. The Centre, Manor Park houses three GP practices, health visitors, dentists, pharmacy, cardiology clinic, x-ray facilities, pathology services, optometry services and a healthy living cafe together in a single, one-stop centre.

Nevertheless, the FSA is carrying out its own survey of benzene in soft drinks and will consider what action may be needed to further reduce benzene levels.

<i>[holding answer 2 March 2006]:</i> It is a matter for individual local authorities to determine arrangements for funding private voluntary and independent (pvi) providers to deliver the free nursery education entitlement. In meeting their statutory responsibilities to secure sufficient provision they must have regard to guidance from the Secretary of State. That guidance makes clear the importance of a thriving pvi sector to the provision of sufficient, high quality child care.

 Good progress is being made on extended schools with 4,700 schools, thus far, indicating their willingness to work on developing extended services. This includes 18 schools in the Barnet local authority area, of which four are in the Hendon area, that are working towards delivering a core offer of extended services by September 2006. This Government want all schools to provide access to a core offer of extended services by 2010, with half of primary schools and a third of secondary schools doing so by 2008. We want to see at least 2,500 schools providing access to the core offer by September 2006. The core offer, which should be available to all parents and pupils of the school, comprises: high quality child care available 8 am to 6 pm year round; a varied menu of study support activities; parenting support programmes; swift and easy referral to a wide range of specialised support services; and wider community access. It will be for individual local authorities, in discussion with all schools in their area, to take a strategic approach to developing access to the core offer in each year.

 We rely on local authorities to estimate whether additional secondary or primary schools are required to meet planned expansions of housing. This is because local authorities are best placed to calculate the additional number of children of school age, to evaluate the effect of other demographic changes, and to compare the resulting totals with the actual and potential capacity of existing schools.

Formulaic capital funding is notified in advance to local authorities, and is responsive to forecast changes in school population which will result from expansion of housing. Specifically, Modernisation funding is allocated on the basis of pupil numbers and the relative condition and suitability need of each authority&#039;s school buildings. In addition, New Pupil Places funding is allocated on the basis of the actual number of school pupils in each authority, and the forecast growth in pupil numbers. These funding streams are calculated using local authorities&#039; own forecasts. Where an authority is facing exceptional circumstances because of the rate of growth of pupil numbers, then the Department periodically operates a safety-valve mechanism for additional funding.

<sup>(71)</sup> The expenditure data to 1998&#150;99 are drawn from the annual &#039;RO1&#039; spending returns which local authorities submitted to the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions. Figures for 1999&#150;2000 to 2001&#150;02 are drawn from Section 52 (Table 3) Outturn statements which local authorities submitted to the DfES. Figures for 2002&#150;03 onwards are taken from Section 52 (Table A) Outturn statements. The change in sources is shown by the dotted lines.<br>

<sup>(72)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by local authority schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure. The pupil data are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(73)</sup> From 2002&#150;03 the school based expenditure calculation is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001&#150;02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRO payments and other indirect employee expenses, while from 2002&#150;03 only the schools element of these categories is included. In 2001&#150;02 this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil of the England total, while the schools element of these categories accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the England total in 2002&#150;03. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002&#150;03 and would therefore be excluded, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>

<sup>(74)</sup> Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999&#150;2000.<br>

<sup>(75)</sup> Combined local authority and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in local authority maintained establishments and pupils educated by the authority other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). Certain elements of central local authority expenditure cannot be attributed to a particular phase of education and consequently a sector breakdown is not available. Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under 5s funded by the authority and being educated in private settings (only available from 1999&#150;2000), pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and any other local authority maintained pupils. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(76)</sup> Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99.<br>

<sup>(77)</sup> The expenditure data for 1999&#150;2000 onwards reflect the return of grant maintained schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

<sup>(78)</sup> 2004&#150;05 data is provisional and is subject to change by the local authority.<br>

Note:<br>

Figures are as reported by the LEA in cash terms rounded to the nearest &#163;10 and may not sum due to rounding.<br>

<p><a name="st_384"><a name="60314w54.html_spnew0"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 The success of the Government&#039;s vision for all schools to provide a core offer of extended services will depend upon effective partnerships with the private, voluntary and independent (PVI) sectors. Local authorities and schools can benefit from the often long-standing skills, knowledge and experience that the PVI sectors have in delivering services for children, young people and the wider community. Through the National Remodelling Team we are encouraging schools and local authorities to involve existing PVI providers in both the strategic planning and delivery of activities.

<a name="stpa_334">At this early stage in the roll-out we do not hold data on how many schools are working with the PVI sectors.

 Admission protocols that allow pupils to be admitted according to aptitude in an Academy&#039;s specialism (including sport) will remain unchanged under the proposals in the Education and Inspections Bill.
