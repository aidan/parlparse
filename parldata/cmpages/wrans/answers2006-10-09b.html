It is not possible to break down ineffective calls into those that did
or did not receive an engaged tone for old system calls in 2002-03.
<i> Notes:</i>  1. Data is presented for calls made regarding
cases on the new system (CS2) and the old system (CSCS)
combined.  2. "Attempted customer calls" excludes calls
attempted outside working hours.  3. "Calls for which outcome
not recorded" are those that were received but for which, due to data
problems, the eventual outcome was not recorded. The volume of such
calls has decreased significantly in the last three years as management
information systems have improved.  4. "Calls for which
outcome recorded" are those which were received and for which there is
management information to track the eventual outcome.  5. IVR
denotes the automated touch tone part of the process where customers
enter their details via the telephone key pad. Once callers have
cleared this part of the process, they enter a queue to be answered by
a member of CSA staff. Note that there is no IVR process on the old
system.  6. Numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand.
Components may not sum to totals due to
rounding.<br></td></tr></table><br><p><a name="06101024000181"><b><a name="06101024001232">Mr.

the market value of occupational pension scheme assets reduced by a

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 111W</b><br><p><a name="06101116000052"><b><a name="06101116001236">Beverley
Hughes:</b> Several research projects that examine the sexual
attitudes and behaviours of BME groups have been commissioned as part
of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, details of which are provided at
annex 1. The strategy has also drawn upon routinely collected data to
inform our understanding of ethnicity and teenage pregnancy.</p><p><a name="06101116000053">The evidence suggests that
young people from different ethnic groups are more or less likely to
experience teenage pregnancy than others. But establishing the precise
impact of ethnicity is difficult because: ethnicity is not recorded at
birth registration; BME groups are over-represented in deprived areas
where higher rates would be expected; and sexual behaviour, knowledge
and attitudes may vary considerably within BME
groups.</p><p><a name="06101116000054">Data on
mothers giving birth under-19, identified from the 2001 Census, show
rates of teenage motherhood are significantly higher among young women
of &#145;Mixed White and Black Caribbean&#146;, &#145;Other
Black&#146; and &#145;Black Caribbean&#146; ethnicity.
&#145;White British&#146; young women are also over-represented
among teenage mothers, while all Asian ethnic groups are
under-represented. Girls and young women of Black and Black British
ethnicity are also over-represented among abortions under-18. In 2004,
Black ethnic groups (which represent around 3 per cent. of all females
aged 15-17) accounted for 9 per cent. of all abortions
under-18.</p><p><a name="06101116000055">The Teenage
Pregnancy Strategy has a target to halve the rate of under-18
conceptions by 2010 (compared to the rate in 1998). Between 1998 and
2004 (the latest year for which data are available) the under-18
conception rate fell by 11.1 per cent., to its lowest level for 20
years and the under 16 rate fell by 15.2 per cent. The strategy does
not have targets to reduce conceptions among different ethnic groups,
although local areas are asked to take account of factors that increase
the risk of early pregnancy, including social deprivation, poor
educational attainment, living in care and ethnicity, in the delivery
of local
strategies.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61009w0019.htm_wqn9"><a name="06101116000006">Connexions</h3><p><a name="06101116000056"><b><a name="06101116001237">Mr.

individual courses, students entitlement to student support, whether or
not students transfer to other HE institutions and whether or not

dispose, or change the use, of school playing fields are considered
against strict criteria which are set out in the Department's guidance.
Briefly, these are:</p><a name="brev_143"><a name="06101116001226"><ul><p class="tabletext">(a)
school's needs: that playing field provision and curriculum
requirements at the school making the disposal, and at other schools in

case of the two rejected applications, the School Playing Fields
Advisory Panel determined, on appeal, that the applications did not
meet the published criteria. Applications have been withdrawn either as
a result of the panel's preliminary view that the application failed to
meet the criteria or as a result of similar advice from officials. In
some instances, the applicant itself has withdrawn its application
because it realised that it failed to meet the criteria. In every case,
however, the reason for withdrawal was that the application failed to
meet the criteria for giving consent. A withdrawn case has the same
effect as one that is rejected in that the proposed disposal, or change
of use, does not
happen.</p><p><a name="06101116001079"><b><a name="06101116001315">Mr.

their schools to determine their own particular training and
development needs; the Department does not direct the amount to be

provision to restrict the salary used to calculate retirement benefits

against a disproportionate level of pension benefits being paid in
relation to the contributions that have been received. The regulations
do, however, provide for the employer to make a payment to the scheme
to cover the actuarial value of the increased retirement benefits and,

of Congo most affected by insecurity. Current estimates from the UN
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) suggest that
there are over 200,000 internally displaced people (IDPs). The worst
affected area is around the villages of Gety and Aveba, where over
40,000 people have sought shelter in camps. Attacks on these IDPs and
on international non-governmental organisation (NGO) staff by rebel
groups make it extremely difficult to provide support for these people,
many of whom had been hiding in the surrounding forests for some time.
Shortages in food supplies and logistical constraints have compounded a
very serious humanitarian
situation.</p><p><a name="06101118000232">However the
situation has now stabilised and food and other support is reaching
people in the camps. Food rations supplied by the World Food Programme
(WFP) were being distributed in Gety during the visit of one of
DFID&#146;s humanitarian experts in the second half of September.
Additional resources have been allocated to WFP in DRC this year to
cover food, transport and logistics costs through the Central Emergency
Relief Fund (CERF) and the DRC Humanitarian Pooled Fund. Both these
funds were established with strong encouragement from DFID and the UK
is a major contributor to
both.</p><p><a name="06101118000233">The people of

George:</b> To ask the Secretary of State for
International Development what assessment he has made of the impact of
policies of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank which have
the effect of capping the amount of public spending in developing
countries receiving aid from those institutions.
[88617]</p><p><a name="06101118000527"><b><a name="06101118000867">Hilary
Benn:</b> The policies of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and World Bank are designed to support country led development
strategies, including their public spending plans. These include
policies to support economic stability, promote the effective use of
higher levels of aid and to build the capacity of public
services.</p><p><a name="06101118000528">Economic
stability is important if poverty is to be reduced. It is a foundation
for growth, for avoiding inflation that harms the poor and for ensuring
countries can sustain long term investments in public services. All
countries face constraints in deciding on appropriate levels of
domestic deficits and borrowing. The IMF's dialogue and advice helps
countries establish budget policies that achieve and maintain
stability. This includes agreeing with countries on the budget limits
that are central to their fiscal policies. These limits avoid
unsustainable deficits that will force countries to cut back on their
future spending. These policies support long-term spending plans that
are central to strengthening public
services.</p><p><a name="06101118000529">The IMF and
the World Bank are both committed to helping developing countries
manage larger aid flows to support public service investments that
reduce poverty. The IMF helps countries with advice on policies to
manage the macroeconomic consequences of larger aid flows. It promotes
long term predictable aid that can finance higher public spending
without excessive borrowing and adjusts the fiscal targets in its
programmes to support higher aid backed spending. The World Bank plays
a leading role in supporting countries' own poverty reduction
strategies. It is a major global provider of aid to finance these
strategies. The Bank also plays a central role in helping countries

overall donor support and ensuring aid is provided in an effective
manner. The Bank is heavily involved in international efforts to
strengthen key public services such as the Fast Track Initiative for
education. All these policies provide direct support for public service
investments. The IMF and the World Bank have made a further major
contribution with the resources they have committed through the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. This will help provide developing
countries with the long-term predictable funding they need to help
finance critical services like health and education.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61009w0026.htm_wqn2"><a name="06101118000017">Disabled

is providing &#163;4.3 million to the World Bank for a programme to
incorporate DRR more effectively into poverty reduction strategies and
approximately &#163;15 million to NGOs undertaking community level
DRR work in disaster-prone
countries.</p><p><a name="06101118000537">Regionally,
DFID&#146;s priorities are, within Africa, to reduce risk and
vulnerability. We are working in five African countries to establish
food safety net programmes for delivering regular grants of cash and
food to the poorest. In Asia, DFID is working to ensure that additional
money allocated to the region following the series of major natural
disasters in 2004-06 is spent effectively. This has arisen from
DFID&#146;s commitment to allocate 10 per cent. of its funding in
response to each natural disaster for DRR. As a result, DFID is
providing &#163;6.5 million for DRR work in the Asia tsunami-affected
region, an additional &#163;5.8 million following the 2005 earthquake
in Pakistan and &#163;500,000 following the 2006 earthquake in
Yogyakarta, Indonesia. In Latin America and the Caribbean DFID has been
working with its partners to reduce the damaging impacts of rapid onset
emergencies such as hurricanes. Throughout the 2005 and 2006 hurricane
seasons we have placed a dedicated Humanitarian/DRR adviser in the
Caribbean to take forward this work with regional
partners.</p><p><a name="06101118000538"><b><a name="06101118000872">Jo

related to areas highlighted in the question has been managed through
the joint DFID, FCO and MOD conflict prevention pools; the Africa
Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP) and the Global Conflict Prevention Pool
(GCPP). Both pools receive technical support from the Post Conflict
Reconstruction Unit (PCRU). The PCRU is also a tri-departmental unit
involving DFID, the FCO and MOD. The PCRU enables UK Government
Departments and the military to work together to support countries
emerging from conflict. It provides skilled civilian staff to help
kick-start post-conflict recovery. It does not provide funds.</p><p><a name="06101118000613">The pools support projects to
improve the effectiveness of UK and international support for conflict
prevention, through addressing long-term structural causes of conflict,
managing regional and national tension and violence, and supporting
post-conflict reconstruction where the UK can make a significant
contribution, in particular Africa, Asia, the Balkans and the middle
east.</p><p><a name="06101118000614">Given these
arrangements, providing a detailed break down of DFID contributions in
the areas (a) to (e) would be difficult and would incur
disproportionate costs. Further, they would effectively be limited to
administrative costs incurred by DFID in fulfilling its management and
oversight obligations. The overall pools budgets for the financial year
2006-07 are provided as follows for information.</p><table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext"><i> Pool</i></td><td class="tabletext"><i> Overall

&#163;113 million. There are not yet forecast figures for
2008-09.</p><p><a name="06101118000625">The focus of
this aid is on three areas (i) livelihoods, (ii) rural assistance and
(iii) state- building; the latter comprising roughly 10 per cent. of
annual expenditure. State-building expenditure supports efforts to
increase Government capacity in order for the Afghan Government to meet
its commitments outlined in the Interim Afghan National Development
Strategy and Afghan Compact, both of which were signed at the London
Conference in January 2006. DFID Afghanistan does not fund directly
areas (b), (c), (d) or (e) outlined in the question. However through
DFIDs' partnership arrangements with UN agencies, international
financing institutions and civil society organisation funding does
indirectly address areas (b), (d) and (e). Disaggregated figures are

year (2007-08) is &#163;0.9 million. Beyond this it is difficult to

are focused on supporting the re-establishment of law and order
institutions in Somalia. We plan to commit &#163;620,000 to the UNDP
Rule of Law and Security programme in 2006-07. Much of this programme
is focused on Somaliland and Puntland, as both are more stable regions
with relatively better established institutions. Within the framework
of the transitional federal charter for Somalia, DFID is directing its
efforts at the establishment of inclusive safety, security and access
to justice institutions.</p><p><a name="06101118000645">On (b), DFID has committed
&#163;800,000 to UNHCR to support the integration and settlement of
internally displaced people (IDPs) and refugees. However in the long
term, safe return on a larger scale depends on satisfactory resolution
of the circumstances that have driven people from their homes in the
first place. Our efforts in the meantime are directed to helping to
achieve these conditions, for example by providing support to the
Transitional Federal Government in Somalia.</p><p><a name="06101118000646"><i> Sudan</i></p><p><a name="06101118000647">Sudan's framework for this
financial year and next is &#163;109.8 million. A substantial element
of these funds will be used to support most of the activities listed in
the question over the next three years, but given the need for rapid

so far contributed an estimated &#163;26 million to the United

support the successful return of 370,000 Liberian IDPs and &#163;1
million in DRC to support their work with IDP returns in that
country.</p><p><a name="06101118000650">A large
