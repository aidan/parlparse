 In July last year I announced a review of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. As part of this review, I have consulted on proposals to extend the protection the Act provides by removing the financial limit and to make the terms for early settlement of loans fairer to consumers. I will be consulting in 2003 on proposals for improving the current licensing regime to ensure better regulation of lenders and increasing protection for consumers against extortionate credit.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21212w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Keith Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office (1) what the criteria were by which the civil defence grant for 2003&#150;04 was allocated to individual local authorities;  [85835]




<P>
<P><I>12 Dec 2002 : Column 405W</I><P>

<P>
<UL>(2) what the aggregate amount of civil defence grant was in each financial year since 1996&#150;97.  [85836]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21212w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to my written ministerial statement on 3 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 68WS, which explains how civil defence grant was allocated for 2003&#150;04, and the level of allocation to each authority in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="21212w01.html_para6">To determine the individual allocations mentioned in that statement, the following formula was adopted:
<P>

<a name="21212w01.html_para7">Each authority received #53,000. Each county council received #12,000 in respect of each shire district within the authority's boundaries. These flat-rate payments accounted for approximately 65 per cent. of the aggregate grant, in recognition of the fact that every authority, regardless of size and population, would incur similar unavoidable costs in conducting the basic emergency planning function.
<P>

<a name="21212w01.html_para8">The remaining 35 per cent. of the aggregate grant was distributed according to the Bellwin threshold, using population size as a proxy for the scale of the emergency planning that authorities need to undertake.
<P>

<a name="21212w01.html_para9">In order to keep year-on-year changes to individual authorities' allocations within reasonable bounds, a damping was added to the formula, so that no authority lost more than 10 per cent. or gained more than 20 per cent. compared with the previous year.
<P>

<a name="21212w01.html_para10">Before the formula was applied for the financial year 2002&#150;03, #100,000 was retained for discretionary grant for special projects and special events of benefit to the wider emergency planning community in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="21212w01.html_para11">Before making decisions on this allocation method, consultations were held with local authority representatives on the basis of a draft formula. As a result of the representations made, the formula was amended to give greater weight to the flat rate element and less weight to the element distributed according to the Bellwin threshold. The damping was also changed to reduce the floor level for losses.
<P>

<a name="21212w01.html_para12">The aggregate amount of civil defence grant in each financial year since 1996&#150;97 is as follows:

<P>
<P>
<a name="21212w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 No assessment assuming an annual increase in the cost of flying of 1 per cent. has been made. The forecasts in XAir Traffic Forecasts for the United Kingdom 2000" assume a 1 per cent. per annum decrease in air fares. A sensitivity test, assuming constant fares over the forecast period, indicates a demand reduction of 25 per cent. by 2020. No assessments have been made on the assumption that the demand for flying were halved.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21212w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 A study published by the Department in November found that overall, the evidence suggests that cycle helmets are effective at reducing the severity of brain and upper facial injuries for all ages, and especially children. This reinforces our view that helmets should be worn by children. Our latest knowledge of wearing is that the rate for all cyclists on built-up major roads is now 22 per cent. The wearing rate is continuing to increase, but at this level, making helmets compulsory would cause enforcement difficulties, and without greater public acceptance, could have an effect on levels of cycling. We will continue to monitor wearing rates and review the option of compulsory wearing from time to time.

 DVLA has an overall total of 18 clamping teams operating from 14 pounds throughout the UK. Four of these teams operate in the London area.

<a name="21212w02.html_para2">The extension of the wheel clamping scheme is being addressed as part of our proposals to modernise the vehicle registration and licensing system.
<P>

<a name="21212w02.html_para3">Over the last five years DVLA clamping teams have spent two weeks twice a year in each London borough. In addition, DVLA is developing partnerships with local authorities to clamp and remove unlicensed vehicles. Such partnerships already operate in the London boroughs of Newham, Lewisham, Croydon and Wandsworth. Other boroughs have expressed an interest in joining the scheme.
<P>

<a name="21212w02.html_para4">DVLA's clamping contractor has to meet closely monitored targets for the number of vehicles clamped. The current target in the UK is over 1,000 vehicles per week. The overall impact of the wheel clamping scheme on the level of relicensing is regularly monitored by the Department's statisticians. The scheme consistently achieves a return of 3:1 when factors such as induced relicensing are taken into account.

 The Advisory Group on Motorcycling established five Task Forces to consider integration and traffic management, vehicle safety and security, environmental and fiscal issues, research and statistics. They have been meeting as necessary since 1999 and will continue to do so until they have completed their work in 2004. Their initial work was detailed in the Interim Report of the Advisory Group on Motorcycling, published in April 2001, and is available in the Libraries in the House.
<P>

<a name="21212w02.html_para5">Some of the key work streams will not reach fruition until 2004. Even then it would be difficult to assess the value for money of the Task Forces. The nature of their work does not involve specific costs and benefits which can be quantified. However, the work of the Advisory Group is highly valued by Government and provides the motorcycling community with the opportunity to input to the development of motorcycling policy.

receives a long-term attributable pension for herself and any children reflecting her husband's rank and linked to his rate of pay. The resulting benefits equate to around 90 per cent.of the members full career pension. From 31 October 2000, attributable widows' pensions have been paid for life, regardless of whether the widow remarries or cohabits with a man as her husband. In addition to the short and long-term pensions, she would receive a death-in-service gratuity equal to amount that would have been payable to the soldier on invaliding grounds, or if greater, twice the full career rate of the invaliding pension. An additional attributable gratuity is payable which is set according to the rank of the soldier. Benefits would also be paid under the War Pension Scheme.

The budget for the cadet organisations is reviewed in the same way as the rest of the Ministry of Defence. The budget is considered against the requirement to sustain a vigorous and vibrant youth organisation which sustains active membership for enrolled cadets. Risks to sustaining the cadet organisations are then considered alongside the other risks to the MOD's output targets. In the case of the Sea Cadet Corps, this process is based on the Corps's known annual requirements and any specific changing needs. Consideration is also given to the Sea Cadet Corps's other sources of income, on a year-by-year basis.

The collation of statistics is not a primary function of the support staff and as no personal information is requested from any caller, those statistics which are available are, inevitably, incomplete.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how his Department calculates the number of people employed in and by defence related industries in the regions of the UK; what multiplier is used; and what the regional and national totals are.  [86012]<P>

<a name="21212w04.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 10 December 2002]:</i> Estimates of employment can be determined as the addition of three elements. These are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Xdirect". The Xdirect" numbers are those employed in the supplying manufacturer i.e the company contracted by the Ministry of Defence to undertake the work, or the exporter;

<P>
<BR>
Xindirect". These include those indirectly employed through work generated in subcontractors and those who supply the main contractor. As well as manufacturers of products which are embodied in the final product, these will include suppliers of services e.g. consultants and electricity generators; and
<P>
<BR>
Xinduced", i.e. employment resulting from the additional consumer spending which arise from the direct and indirect employees.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="21212w04.html_para3">The Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA) has never produced figures for the number of Xinduced" jobs. Estimates, however, have been calculated for UK direct and indirect employment dependent on (i) MOD equipment expenditure, (ii) MOD non-equipment expenditure, and (iii) defence exports. These have been published since 1992 in United Kingdom Defence Statistics (UKDS) and, before then, in Volume 2 of the Statement of Defence Estimates. The method of derivation is as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Xfinal demand" of expenditure by (grouped) standard industrial categories is determined for MOD UK expenditure on equipment and non-equipment using information from MOD systems. Figures for exports are more problematic&#151;various sources are used for these;
<P>
<BR>
direct employment. Using MOD final demand and turnover per (full-time equivalent) employee for the sectors involved, direct employment follows by division; and
<P>
<BR>
indirect employment. Total and indirect demand is calculated using the MOD final demand and (adapted) UK Input-Output Analytical Tables. The latest available Analytical Tables, which are produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), are for the year 1995. They were published in May 2002. The Analytical Tables are assumed to change slowly, so may be applied to years other than the ones for which they were prepared. There are various ways of deriving indirect employment. The one proposed by DASA is to calculate it as derived indirect demand divided by the appropriate rates (output at basic prices) for the sectors concerned. Such details are still subject to review (see below).
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="21212w04.html_para4">The ONS has not published employment multipliers for the UK.
<P>

<a name="21212w04.html_para5">DASA has been leading a review into the method for estimating employment dependent on MOD equipment and non-equipment expenditure and exports. One of the outcomes of the review is that regional estimates of direct equipment related employment should not be published as National Statistics any more. The 



<P>
<P><I>12 Dec 2002 : Column 419W</I><P>
underlying data are not of a good enough quality and they only ever represented less than a third of the total employment estimates.
<P>

<a name="21212w04.html_para6">Estimates of regional indirect employment have never been prepared. They are more difficult to establish. Although Analytical Tables and multipliers are produced for some areas, for example, for Scotland (by the Scottish Executive), the calculation of employment would require knowledge of the volumes of Xexports" and Ximports" of MOD defence equipment from other regions. These data are not available. Analytical Tables are not produced by the ONS for the English regions.
<P>

<a name="21212w04.html_para7">A detailed report on the calculation of the UK employment estimates has been prepared. This is currently being peer reviewed and will be made available on the DASA website.
<P>

<a name="21212w04.html_para8">Provisional figures for the UK were published as Table 1.11 of UK Defence Statistics 2002, a copy of which is available from the Library of the House.

 The current System Development and Demonstration Phase of the Lockheed Martin Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) programme began in October 2001. We announced on 30 September this year that the Short Take-Off/Vertical Landing (STOVL) variant of the JSF

<P><I>12 Dec 2002 : Column 421W</I><P>
had been selected to meet our Future Joint Combat Aircraft (FJCA) requirement. The current planned United Kingdom in-service date is 2012.
<P>

<a name="21212w05.html_para1">In order to align with the US acquisition cycle, we do not expect to place orders for JSF aircraft before 2006. The average UK unit production cost of the STOVL variant of JSF is estimated to be around $50 million US.
<P>

<a name="21212w05.html_para2">The procurement cost for the FJCA programme, including certain spares and training facilities, is forecast to be up to #10 billion-working on a current planning assumption of 150 aircraft required. There is no reason to believe that the JCA programme will not remain within budget.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what records his Department maintains of individuals receiving a gratuity in respect of invalidity, on leaving HM armed forces, from 1941 to the present; and whether he has a record of a gratuity in respect of invalidity being paid to Mr. Jack Palfrey Wakefield, date of birth 24 September 1916, army serial number 1895475, formerly resident in Crewe.

 For members of the armed forces who have been invalided from service, records relating to consideration of entitlement to war pensions have been held on these cases by the Veterans Agency and its predecessors since prior to 1941. No war pensions files were destroyed until 1989 when a retention and destruction exercise was carried out. The criteria were that files were to be destroyed where no action had been taken on the case for more than 30 years, no pension was in payment and the claimant was over the age of 80.
<P>

<a name="21212w05.html_para3">Under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme, records containing details of invaliding gratuities paid are held by all three services for personnel who left between 1941 and the present day.

<a name="21212w05.html_para5">Where the pensioner dies and there is no widow/er or other dependant, the records would be destroyed after seven years for Royal Navy (RN) and Army personnel and after three years for RAF personnel. If not informed of this, records would be kept for 100 years from the date of the service member's birth for all three services. If there were a surviving widow/er, records would be destroyed some two to three years after the death of the spouse of RN and RAF personnel and seven years after the death of the spouse of Army personnel.

[86877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21212w05.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Two epidemiological studies of participants of the British nuclear test programme as a whole have been carried out on the Ministry of Defence's behalf by the National Radiological Protection Board. The results of these studies were published in 1988 and 1993. The studies showed that, as a group, participation in the tests has not had a detectable effect on the expectation of life, or on the risk of developing cancer or other fatal diseases by those who took part. No separate assessment has been made of those service personnel who took part in the tests on the Monte Bello Islands.
<P>

<a name="21212w05.html_para9">The Monte Bello Islands were uninhabited and had no civilian population. In 1983 the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council reassessed levels of radiation which had reached the Australian mainland from the tests on the Monte Bello Islands. It was concluded that exposure to radiation by the civilian population had been insignificant.

 Experimental firings of the Phalanx weapons system, which uses depleted uranium rounds (DU), took place at West Freugh in 1988 and 1990. The firings involved rounds that were manufactured in the United Kingdom from DU processed in the USA. No aircraft were involved in the tests, and there has been no further use of the West Freugh range for DU firings. A subsequent radiological survey of beach, sand and seawater by staff from the AtomicWeapons Establishment concluded that there was no detectable contamination.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence which Royal Navy vessels will be fitted with <i>(a)</i> the upgraded Type 1022 Radar and <i>(b)</i> the Type 996 Radar; and if he will make a statement on the increased capability this will provide.  [86296]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21212w06.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Radar Type 1022 is fitted to Type 42 Destroyers and Invincible Class Carriers. At present, there are no plans to upgrade the Radar but, as part of the normal planning process, consideration is being given to an upgrade that would deliver performance improvements in specific operating environments.
<P>

<a name="21212w06.html_para4">Radar Type 996 is in service with Type 42 Destroyers, Type 23 Frigates and Invincible Class Carriers, and is also being fitted to the new Landing Platform Dock (Replacement) vessels, the first of which is expected to come into service next year. Two programmes have been undertaken to improve the Radar's performance and availability. A further programme, to increase the Radar's capability against future airborne and surface threats, is currently in its assessment phase.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what impact the withdrawal of the Sea Harrier FA2 will have on the Royal Navy's ability to defend its ships against an attack from the AS17/Krypton anti-ship missile; and if he will make a statement.  [86440]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21212w06.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Royal Navy Task Groups will retain a significant air defence capability after the Sea Harrier is withdrawn from service in 2006, including against AS17/Krypton anti ship missiles. Task Groups typically include Type 42 Anti Air Warfare Destroyers armed with updated Sea Dart anti-aircraft missiles, Type 22 and 23 Frigates armed with Point Defence Missile Systems (including the enhanced Sea Wolf missile system) and Close in Weapons Systems. Many other Task Group warships will also include air defence assets for self protection and decoy systems against air and surface launched anti-ship missiles.

 The information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost, if at all, as we do not know whether all of it is held on departmental files. Furthermore, information pertaining to the associated police investigations and boards of inquiry would not normally be placed in the public domain. Only the death of Trooper Aled Jones has, so far, been subject to a board of inquiry; a copy of the final report was passed to the next of kin in 1997. A board of inquiry into the death of Ranger Paul Cochrane is on-going. No decision has yet been made as to whether a board of inquiry will be held into the death of Private David Shipley; this is subject to an on-going investigation by the Royal Military Police Special Investigation Branch, who have jurisdiction in this case. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to release any related information at this time.

<P>
<a name="21212w07.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Strategic Defence Review required the Reserve Forces to be integrated, relevant and usable. To ensure this requirement is met we need the support of those who employ members of the Volunteer Reserve Forces.
<P>

<a name="21212w07.html_para3">During the last 18 months the Ministry of Defence has carried out a review of its existing and long-standing campaign designed to win and maintain the support of Britain's employers for the Volunteer Reserve Forces. This has resulted in the launch of a new campaign called SaBRE (Supporting Britain's Reservists and Employers). Its purpose is to explain to employers not only the benefits of employing Reservists but also the attendant rights and obligations that employers have, including the requirement to release individuals for mobilisation should it be necessary to do so.The SaBRE campaign has already made good progress. Its strategy is to make use of the expertise available in the commercial world combined with a regional network of civilian volunteers, to deliver a campaign with a national identity at a regional level. A number of organisations, including the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors, the British Chambers of Commerce, the Engineering Employers' Federation and the Trades Union Congress together with some 6,200 companies, who between them account for a substantial part of the nation's workforce, have previously declared their support for the Reserves of the Armed Forces.

 The Ministry of Defence is working closely with a number of organisations to develop the Royal Navy's plans for the commemoration of the Battle of Trafalgar in 2005. Lead by the Official Nelson Celebrations Committee, which brings together the interests of a wide range of maritime museums and associations connected with the Nelson heritage, a national and international programme of cultural and commemorative events is being discussed, among which a number of events involving the Royal Navy are being considered. At this stage, it is too early to be precise.

 <i>[holding answer 9 December 2002]</i>: EU rules require that cattle for human consumption must be tested for BSE if aged over 30 months or, if subject to casualty slaughter or found sick at ante-mortem inspection, if aged over 24 months. In the event of a positive result, the carcase before and two carcasses after the positive case on the slaughter line must be destroyed unless there is a system in place preventing contamination between carcasses. The latter does not necessarily require significant extra space but this is a matter for the Official Veterinary Surgeon in individual abattoirs. There are no funds available to provide abattoirs with additional space.

 In 2001, the UK claimed #2.5 billion from the EU agriculture budget.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will place in the Library a list of those assets identified by the National Asset Register, Cm 5221, as belonging to <i>(a)</i> the former Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions and <i>(b)</i> the former Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and their respective agencies, non-departmental bodies and public corporations, which now belong to her Department, together with the current value of each such asset.  [85011]<P>

<P>
<a name="21212w08.html_spnew6"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The National Asset Register (NAR) was last updated for March 2000 and published in June 2001. Our understanding is that it is updated every five years.
<P>

<a name="21212w08.html_para5">Defra has a Departmental Asset Register (DAR) which lists all assets held currently for its core activities with current values. This does not include details of assets held by its agencies and NDPBs. It does include assets transferred from the former Department of Environment, Transport and Regions (DETR) to Defra in June 2001.
<P>

<a name="21212w08.html_para6">With the changes to the machinery of government, to provide the information requested considerable work would have to be done on the DAR to reflect and reconcile with what was listed in the NAR Cm 5221. We would also have to request detailed lists from all of our agencies, NDPBs and public corporations of assets included in the NAR with current values.
<P>

<a name="21212w08.html_para7">The compilation of the information requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 The Environment Agency is currently updating its information on mine waters, landfills and burial grounds. The agency should be able to provide a comprehensive answer by the new year, and I will write when it is available.
<P>

<a name="21212w08.html_para9">However, I understand that since 1997 no radioactive discharges from radioactive waste storage sites have exceeded permitted levels or resulted in poor water quality in river courses.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent research has been <i>(a)</i> conducted for her Department and <i>(b)</i> assessed by her Department on a potential link between drinking water and blue baby syndrome; what representations have been received; what discussions have taken place; and if she will place copies of the research in the Library.  [86418]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21212w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The term Xblue baby syndrome" is sometimes used to refer to infantile methaemoglobinaemia. This is a condition in which the pigment in the blood is altered and its ability to carry oxygen is impaired. Nitrate, nitrite and bacterial contamination of water supplies are among the potential causes. The condition is very rare&#151;there have been no confirmed cases of methaemoglobinaemia in the UK since 1972. I am not aware of any recent reports that this condition is attributable directly to public water supplies within the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="21212w08.html_para10">The Department is aware of the studies that have established a relationship between methaemoglobin levels and nitrate levels, but has not conducted, commissioned or assessed any recent research on the link. Discussions and review of current scientific research take place within expert groups of the World

Health Organisation, who expect to finalise the third edition of its XGuidelines for Drinking Water" in February 2003. Any changes in the guidelines will be considered by the European Commission and my Department.
<P>

<a name="21212w08.html_para11">The Department has received regular correspondence about the Nitrates Directive and also meets stakeholder groups. Officials have also replied to letters from or on behalf of farmers, for example from Farmers for Action, about the nitrate standard and health, including blue baby syndrome.

 The Association of British Insurers (ABI) have advised us that, for those homes unprotected to their minimum standard and unlikely to be so by 2007, they will consider each case on an individual basis using their best efforts to provide some form of cover. The ABI has not given the Government any specific figures relating to numbers of homes which will not continue to be provided with flood insurance.

 Defra has policy responsibility for flood and coastal defence in England. Operational responsibility for flooding from main rivers and the sea rests with the Environment Agency.

Landfill capacity covers two types&#151;open gate (open to anyone) and restricted access (usually in-house landfills for the private use of a single company). Similar figures for 2000&#150;01 will be available shortly on the Agency's website once data have been quality assured. These data are based on surveys carried out every two years. The first survey was not commissioned until 1998.

<i>[holding answer 11 December 2002]:</i> The data are not available in the form requested. Environment Agency reports have been collated centrally since April 2001 and so annual data are not available before this date. The following tables show the number of incidents broken down into impacts on water, land and air, and by region for the period April 2001 to March 2002. No specific record of impact on health is kept. It should be noted that each incident can be recorded as having an impact on more than one media. Therefore, adding records for impacts on single media will involve some double counting.

 The United Kingdom's pesticide legislation does not extend to the manufacture of pesticides or to those pesticides intended solely for exportation from the United Kingdom. The fact that a pesticide may not be approved in this country does not, in itself, prevent companies from selling such products in another country. The product would, of course, have to comply with the other country's own legislation.

 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2002]:</i> There are no accurate figures on the number of mobile phones discarded in the UK, although it is estimated that around 15 million are replaced each year. An independent consumer survey carried out as part of a pilot study in 1997 for 'Mobile Take Back UK' shows that in the UK very few phones are actually discarded. The majority of people keep old phones, give them to relatives, or store them for emergency use. However, a number of schemes are now collecting mobile phones for refurbishment and recycling. A certain number of refurbished phones are also sold to eastern Europe, Asia and Africa where there is a strong second hand market.

 Defra does not collate historical data on snowfall. However, the Met Office, which is an agency of the Ministry of Defence, records daily snowfall frequency and amount at 80 stations in the UK. Most of these records go back to 1971. In April this year, the Department published new climate change scenarios for the UK. These scenarios include information on total winter snowfall amounts, but not number of snowfall days. The scenarios show that snowfall in the London and Edinburgh areas could be reduced by between 55 and 90 per cent. by the 2080s (compared to the 1961&#150;90 baseline), depending on the degree of future climate change. Scaling these figures back to the years in question gives the following estimates of the reduction in snowfall amount at both locations, depending on whether there is a low or high degree of climate change:

 In April this year, the Department published new XClimate Change Scenarios for the UK". The scenarios do not contain an analysis of the changes in the number of snowfall days, but show that climate change will cause the amount of snowfall to decline significantly throughout the UK in the future. By the 2080s, large areas of the UK are likely to experience quite long sequences of snowless winters. Coastal areas and the English lowlands are likely to show the largest percentage reductions (up to 90 per cent. or more by the 2080s compared to 1961&#150;90 baseline), while the Scottish Highlands and parts of Northern Ireland may experience smaller percentage reductions (50 per cent. or less).

 On 15 October, in the aftermath of the Bali bomb , I announced a package of measures to help the victims of the attack and their families. This included making arrangements to reimburse the costs of bringing home the bodies of those who died, of the medical evacuation of the injured and of paying the travel and certain accommodation costs of up to two relatives of the dead and injured who wished to travel to the region. 12 families have used the package to travel to Bali.

<i> [holding answer 25 November]</i>: The FCO's major IT system is Firecrest, developed and delivered by FCO Services since 1997, providing a modern office-wide system to over 10,000 staff in the UK and overseas. The initial programme was expanded over time, and revised budgets approved in step. The total capital costs to date are #106 million compared with initial estimates totalling #118 million. Annual running costs are now around #19 million. The confidential version of this should be completed on budget by mid-2003.
<P>

<a name="21212w14.html_para2">Using this infrastructure, two programmes, Prism and Focus, are being developed. The aim of Prism is to provide an integrated world-wide financial and management accounting and human resources system. The planned expenditure for the programme from inception to the expiry of the contract in early 2009 was #80 million (including a #53 million contract with CGEY). This estimate has now risen to #90 million. Expenditure so far has been #28.3 million, in line with the planned budget. Focus is a programme designed to provide the FCO with a new global registry and intranet, allowing more efficient management, sifting, storage and retrieval of information. A contract for #10.5 million was awarded to Fujitsu in January 2002, as part of an initial budgeted cost of 23 million over six years. This estimate has now risen to #42 million because of the increased scope of the project. Given the scale of this increase and other relevant factors the Secretary of State is conducting an urgent review of the whole future of this programme. A further announcement will be made as soon as possible.

 On 22 October we published the XDeveloping the role of school support staff" consultation document in which we set out our plans for enhancing the role played by support staff in support of teachers and pupils, as opposed to replacing teachers with support staff. The paper drew on case study material of how schools are already making more effective use of different kinds of support staff and consideration of research carried out by a range of organisations, including Ofsted. The paper proposes for the first time to regulate the involvement of support staff in teaching and learning, based on the principle that qualified teachers must always have responsibility for ensuring high standards within a system of supervision and support staff must be suitably trained for the activities they undertake. The way in which the proposals are taken forward will depend on the outcomes of the consultation. Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Library of the House.

 It is a matter for the Comptroller and Auditor General to decide which subjects to review and whether or not to report to Parliament on them.

<BR>
Providing R&D tax credits to all companies, which will overwhelmingly benefit manufacturers, who undertake most of the UK's business R&D.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment his Department has made of the impact of the HIPC debt relief initiative in delivering a sustainable exit from debt for all eligible countries.  [85270]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21212w16.html_spnew0"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The UK Government have been at the forefront of the international debate on debt relief issues, and continues to press for the rapid and full implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.




<P>
<P><I>12 Dec 2002 : Column 466W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21212w16.html_para0">The Treasury closely monitors Highly Indebted Poor Countries' throughout the process of the HIPC initiative and follows their progress with International Monetary Fund (IMF) programmes.
<P>

<a name="21212w16.html_para1">Indeed, when the spring 2002 meetings of the IMF and the World bank highlighted the threat to debt sustainability from the global economic slowdown and weaker commodity prices, the UK argued strongly that we should be prepared to be proactive and flexible in providing additional debt relief at Completion Point&#151;the stage at which countries have their debts irrevocably cancelled to ensure a robust exit from unsustainable debt.
<P>

<a name="21212w16.html_para2">In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session in May, the Chancellor called for richer countries to provide a further US $1 billion to the HIPC initiative to finance more realistic and generous debt relief. And at the recent IMF/World bank meetings in Washington, the international community agreed the need for up to $1 billion of further debt relief for Highly Indebted Poor Countries. So I am pleased to confirm that the UK, joined by 16 other donors, have so far made firm commitments totalling $850 million to the HIPC Trust Fund. And EU member states have called on the Commission to make a contribution through the European Development Fund. This will benefit 26 Highly Indebted Poor Countries.
<P>

<a name="21212w16.html_para3">Debt sustainability over the longer term is an issue that goes beyond the financing of the initiative though. At their summit meeting in Kananaskis in June 2002, G7 leaders asked the IMF and the World bank to prepare a comprehensive review of debt sustainability, and going forward asked them to ensure that forecasts of debt sustainability are made on the basis of prudent and cautious assumptions about growth and exports.
<P>

<a name="21212w16.html_para4">We are determined that the HIPC initiative should provide a robust exit from unsustainable debt. That is why we have been forcing the debate on the use of voluntary additional bilateral debt relief. Although under HIPC rules creditors are typically only required to provide 90 per cent. relief on bilateral debts, many bilateral creditors (including the G7 countries) provide additional relief to 100 per cent. on a voluntary basis.
<P>

<a name="21212w16.html_para5">This extra relief is currently being included in the calculations of any additional debt relief provided at Completion Point to ensure countries exit the HIPC initiative with a debt to exports ratio of 150 per cent. This means that currently G7 countries are effectively subsidising other creditors. The UK has proposed that voluntary additional debt relief should be excluded from calculations, and this would clearly define the burden sharing among all creditors, both bilateral and multilateral, in support of the HIPC initiative.
<P>

<a name="21212w16.html_para6">Moreover it would mean that this additional voluntary debt relief would be truly additional, and allow countries to exit the process in a more favourable position than the agreed sustainability threshold. We are currently working to build international support for this policy.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what progress has been made to relieve child poverty since 1997.  [85272]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21212w16.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Government have a PSA target to reduce by a quarter the number of children in low-income households by a quarter by 2004&#150;05, as a contribution towards the broader target of halving child poverty by 2010 and eradicating it by 2020. Low-income households are defined as those with less than 60 per cent. of contemporary median income. Progress will be reported against the 1998&#150;99 baseline figures of 3.1 children in low-income households before housing costs, and 4.2 million after housing costs.
<P>

<a name="21212w16.html_para7">By 2000&#150;01 the number of children in low-income households had fallen by 300,000 after housing costs and by 400,000 before housing costs. This means that we are a third of the way to reaching the 2004 PSA target in a third of the time.
<P>

<a name="21212w16.html_para8">Low income is of course central to poverty. But poverty is a complex, multi-dimensional issue, affecting many other aspects of children's lives, including health, housing, the quality of their environment and opportunities to learn. In April 2002 the Government launched a consultation exercise to decide the best way to measure poverty in the long-term, to help target policies and enable the Government to be held to account over their long-term targets. Results will be published by spring 2003.

<P>
<a name="21212w16.html_spnew3"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Sound management of the public finances has meant that, during a time of global economic weakness and uncertainty, fiscal policy has supported monetary policy and smoothed the economic cycle by allowing the automatic stabilisers to operate in full.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21212w16.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Macroeconomic stability is a pre-requisite for delivering the Government's aim of employment opportunity for all. The Government's macroeconomic policy, based on low inflation and sound public finances, has successfully maintained stability and growth.
<P>

<a name="21212w16.html_para12">Against this background of stability, the Government have also introduced microeconomic reforms to improve the functioning of the labour market and ensure that employment opportunity is extended to all individuals in all parts of Britain. These include Welfare to Work policies that help the unemployed achieve a successful return to work, and extend help and support to areas and groups suffering from the greatest employment disadvantage.
<P>

<a name="21212w16.html_para13">This strategy has helped to deliver a dynamic and flexible labour market, with employment at record highs and both International Labour Organisation (ILO) unemployment and claimant unemployment close to their lowest levels since the 1970s.

<P>

 Manufacturing output in the UK has slowed since January 2001, clearly influenced by the synchronised global economic slowdown, the collapse in the demand for ICT related goods and the heightened uncertainty over the outlook for the world economy. The Office for National Statistics does not collect regional data on manufacturing output. However, both the Confederation of British Industry and the British Chamber of Commerce surveys for the third quarter of 2002 reported that businesses expect output to increase over the coming months, with the latter reporting the south east region with the highest balance of manufacturers expecting turnover to increase.

The UK is taking forward actions in all the areas covered by the G8 Africa action plan as part of our ongoing international development efforts.

 There is some evidence to suggest that Government borrowing affects their cost relative to wholesale commercial borrowing rates (as measured by swap spreads). However, there is no clear-cut evidence of a significant impact of Government borrowing on commercial borrowing rates.

We must also be satisfied that the procedures are likely to achieve the stated objectives.

 <i>[holding answer 9 December 2002]</i>: An assessment of the link is made regularly with updated research conducted through various sources. The Government's Rough Sleepers Unit has succeeded in reducing the numbers sleeping rough on any one night by two-thirds. This has however resulted in the percentage of those who are hardest to help&#151;drug-using homeless people&#151;rising, due to drug-using homeless being left on the streets whilst others can be more easily accommodated.
<P>

<a name="21212w19.html_para5">By July 2002, research by the charity Crisis, supported by the Home Office, found that 83 per cent of single homeless people were drug users. Other studies confirm that among those remaining single rough sleepers, drug misuse problems are of this level of magnitude&#151;between 50 and 80 per cent.
<P>

<a name="21212w19.html_para6">In awareness of this linkage, much work has been done to improve the delivery of drug services to homeless people. On 4 December 2002 the Home Office and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister jointly published new guidance entitled XDrug Services for Homeless People: a good practice handbook" (published on the Government website www.drugs.gov.uk) which is aimed at addressing these figures through mainstream and specialised drug services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21212w20.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 9 December 2002]:</i> The Cabinet Office report, XPrivate Action, Public Benefit", was published on 25 September 2002. Its 61 recommendations set out a package of measures which aim to modernise the law and enable a wide range of organisations to be more effective and innovative.
<P>

<a name="21212w20.html_para0">One of the recommendations is that the threshold for compulsory regulation with the Charity Commission should be raised from those organisations with an annual income of #1,000 to those with an annual income of #10,000. Currently, active monitoring by the Commission applies only to those charities with an annual income of #10,000 or more.
<P>

<a name="21212w20.html_para1">The report recommends that the threshold for registration and the threshold where active monitoring kicks in should logically be one and the same. This would result in two-thirds of charities being released from the bureaucratic burden of registration, and is entirely in line with this Government's, emphasis on deregulation.
<P>

<a name="21212w20.html_para2">I can understand the concern that being unable to describe an organisation as a registered charity may have an effect on public confidence. In fact, the report recognises this, and a further recommendation is that all charities below the new registration threshold should have the status of 'Small Charities'. This would also allow tax repayment claims to the Inland Revenue to continue, and for funders to treat 'Small Charities' in the same way as registered charities.
<P>

<a name="21212w20.html_para3">Of course, at the moment these are only proposals. The report is out for consultation until 31 December 2002, and we shall consider the responses to this, and all the other matters addressed in the report, very carefully.

 The Government's intention to bring forward a Sexual Offences Bill during this session was announced in the Queen's Speech on 19 November; we published a command paper, 'Protecting the Public', setting out our proposals. In relation to the notification requirements on sex offenders, these include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>registered offenders will be required to confirm annually and in person at their local police station that the information held about them is still up to date;
<P>
<BR>
a new order to make those convicted of sex offences overseas register their details when they come to the UK;
<P>
<BR>
a reduction in the period of time an offender can spend at an address other than his main home before he is required to notify the police of the address. This will be reduced from 14 days to seven days;
<P>
<BR>
a reduction in the period within which a sex offender must notify the police of change of name or address from 14 days to three days; and
<P>
<BR>
a new requirement on offenders to provide their national insurance details when registering. This will make it easier to identify and find those offenders who try to evade the registration requirements.

</FONT></UL>
<a name="21212w20.html_para4">'Schedule One offender' is a categorisation generally used in respect of offenders who have committed an offence against a child listed in Schedule One to the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. That list includes sexual offences, offences of violence, of cruelty and neglect and any other offence resulting in the bodily injury of a child under the age of 18. The list of offences under Schedule One is used, sometimes in conjunction with other indicators of risk, to determine whether an individual might be unsuitable to work with, care for or have unsupervised contact with children. It is important to note that not all Schedule One offenders are sex offenders. There are no notification requirements on Schedule One offenders.

<a name="21212w20.html_para5">The primary goal of all treatment should be abstinence while recognising that some drug misusers may require longer term support to achieve this.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland whether it is the Government's policy to require resignations or redundancies from over-represented sections in the event of a resignation by a trainee police officer in order to maintain the 50/50 recruitment quota for Catholics/non-Catholics in the Police Service of Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement.

 The Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 requires the Chief Constable to appoint police trainees on a 50 per cent. Catholic, 50 per cent. non-Catholic basis. This requirement applies only to the appointments process; it ceases to apply after police trainees have taken their place on the training course.

<a name="21212w21.html_para0">Local authorities are already under a duty (Section 3(1) of the Refuse Disposal (Amenity) Act 1978) to remove a vehicle which is abandoned in their area on any land in the open air or on any other land forming part of a highway.
<P>

<a name="21212w21.html_para1">For vehicles abandoned on private land, the local authority enters onto the land using their powers under section 8(1) of the Refuse Disposal (Amenity) Act 1978. They then serve on the landowner or the occupier a 15 day notice requiring them to remove the vehicle. If no representations are received then the local authority can remove the vehicle following the expiry of the 15 day period. Objections to the notice must be made by the landowner or occupier to the Chief Officer at the local authority within the 15 day period and the landowner or occupier must outline their reasons why they consider that the vehicle is not abandoned. If the local authority accepts the representations then the vehicle can remain on the land. If the local authority rejects the representations they will then remove the vehicle.

<P>
<a name="21212w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The method for calculating the labour and business rate elements of the area cost adjustment is the same for all local government services. What varies between services is the proportion of total costs assumed to relate to labour and business rates respectively. A full methodology guide has been placed in the Library of the House. The resulting area costs factors for all authorities are published in annex H of the draft Local Government Finance Report, which was placed in the Vote Office and the Library of the House on 5 December 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21212w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 As made clear in my answer to the hon. Member on 2 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 629W. any pay award, not affordable within existing public expenditure, must be paid for by modernisation. The Position Paper by the Independent Review of the Fire Service set out a clear programme of reform and modernisation in the Fire Service, which would lead to significant extra resources being freed up, which could lead to increases in firefighters' pay.
<P>

<a name="21212w21.html_para4">The first step is for the employers and the Fire Brigades Union to agree how those savings can be generated, and over what timescale. There is no point speculating about transitional costs at this stage.

<P>

 The Government is making additional funds available to meet a proportion of the costs of support that have identified as a result of the un-pooling of support costs from housing revenue accounts. After the introduction of Supporting People tenants who currently pay their own support costs, including those in sheltered accommodation will continue to do so.

 Stroud District Council's management and maintenance (M&M) allowances have for many years been higher than their long term M&M targets.
<P>

<a name="21212w21.html_para5">Authorities in this position have had their allowances reduced gradually over a number of years to bring them towards their targets without imposing sudden very large drops in allowances. For 2003&#150;04, we are proposing that Stroud's managementallowance will be set at #309.08, or 98 per cent. of last year's allowance, so that they will be 2 per cent. over their 2003&#150;04 management target of #301.77. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister proposes an increase of 4.7 per cent. in their maintenance allowance to #533.33, so that their allowance will be just below their new maintenance target of #533.37. In aggregate this represents an increase in their allowances of some 2.15 per cent.

 Applications to vary a condition attached to a planning permission are subject to the same requirements as other planning applications for the purposes of environmental impact assessment (EIA). For certain types of project EIA is mandatory. For others, EIA is required if the project meets prescribed criteria and the planning authority considers that it is likely to have significant effects on the environment. This applies to applications to vary a permission regardless of whether EIA was required for the original permission or whether that permission predated the introduction of EIA.

[86921]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21212w23.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The postponement of criminal records checks for staff who were in post immediately before 1 April 2002 makes no change to the rigorous pre-employment checks which were already in place to ensure their suitability to work with children and vulnerable adults. As such we do not anticipate these postponements affecting care home running costs. For children's homes, there have been no changes or postponements to the checks required.
<P>

<a name="21212w23.html_para4">We do not anticipate care homes incurring significant costs due to delays at the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) in processing applications for checks on new staff, or, in the case of children's homes, in processing applications for checks on all staff. The National Care Standards Commission has issued guidance to providers about the response to delays at the CRB in processing checks on new members of staff. The intention of the guidance is to enable providers to employ new members of staff in care homes, and all staff in children's homes, pending the completion of CRB checks while also ensuring the safety of residents.

 Patient information is generally held by national health service trusts under legal and ethical obligations of confidentiality. Information in health records should not be released to others without the consent of the patient concerned where the disclosure will identify the patient. The exceptions are where the information is effectively anonymised, is required by statute or the courts or if it is judged that there is a strong public interest justification in disclosure which overrides the duty of confidence to the patient. For example such circumstances would include the protection of the public and prevention of serious crime. Additionally there must not be a statutory prohibition against the

 We set a Public Service Agreement target in March 1999 to achieve a reduction in the level of fraud and error in income support and jobseeker's allowance by 10 per cent. by March 2002. In April 2001 two further targets were added: a 25 per cent. reduction by March 2004 and a 50 per cent. reduction by March 2006. In July this year we announced an increase in the target for working age customers to a 33 per cent. reduction by 2004 while maintaining our longer-term commitment to the 50 per cent. reduction by 2006.

 The overall aim of the Department's anti-fraud strategy is to have a benefit system which is secure from first claim to final payment. The implementation of this strategy means than an anti-fraud focus is integral to the work of all staff in the Department, as is dealing with the wider agenda of error and incorrectness in benefit payments.
<P>

<a name="21212w25.html_para8">The information currently available suggests that, throughout the period, around 5,000 staff have been employed by the Department and its agencies in work to investigate suspicions of fraud. This figures includes staff employed within the Benefit Fraud Investigation Service. However, taking account of changes in data collection measures over time and the integration of investigators more fully with front-line staff, it is clear that we need to improve the validity and reliability of year- on-year comparisons, and we have asked officials to undertake further work on this. We have concluded that it is not possible to make valid comparisons between figures year-on-year.
<P>

<a name="21212w25.html_para9">We will therefore undertake a review to improve the consistency of centrally collected information for the future.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the average length of time is which his Department allows for consultation with pensioners' practitioners about proposed changes to pensions law.  [87004]<P>

<P>
<a name="21212w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Legislation provides that, except in certain specified circumstances, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State should usually consult on draft private pensions regulations. The Department normally allows at least 12 weeks when undertaking a written consultation with pensioner practitioners on changes to pensions law.

<a name="21212w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Poverty is a complex, multi-dimensional issue, affecting many aspects of pensioners' lives&#151;including income, health, housing and the quality of their environment. Consequently, there is no single measure of pensioner poverty; providing a decent income is key. At present, no pensioner has to get by on less than #98.15 a week under the minimum income guarantee (#149.80 for couples). These rates will increase in April 2003 to #102.10 for single pensioners and #155.80 for couples.
<P>

<a name="21212w26.html_para1">From April 2002, the Government is spending an extra #6 billion a year in real terms on pensioners as a result of policies introduced since 1997. This includes #2&#189; billion more on the poorest third of pensioners.

from the Association of British Insurers reveals that 335,719 employers had designated a stakeholder pension scheme by the end of September 2002. This suggests a compliance rate of over 90 per cent.
<P>

<a name="21212w26.html_para2">The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra) is the body responsible for regulating compliance with the workplace access requirements in respect of stakeholder pension schemes. Opra will continue to follow up all reports of non-compliance and will take action where compliance has not been achieved. It is also looking into ways to identify employers who have not yet complied with the requirements. It has begun writing to employers to ascertain whether or not they have any pension provision, and whether this pension provision would exempt them from offering access to a stakeholder pension scheme. Where Opra identifies non-compliant employers it will actively pursue such cases.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many surplus properties his Department <i>(a)</i> has and <i>(b)</i> will have over the next 10 years; what their value is; and if he will make a statement.  [87000]<P>

<P>
<a name="21212w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 There are currently 44 properties that are surplus to the Department's accommodation requirements, six of these are freehold and 38 leasehold. The freeholds are valued at #1,605,000. It is difficult to place a value on the leaseholds, given the prevailing market conditions.

<a name="21212w26.html_para3">The Department is currently developing an estate strategy to meet our future business requirements and in particular support the implementation and rollout of Jobcentre Plus and the Pension Service. Until the strategy work is completed we cannot forecast how many properties in total will be required and consequently how many properties in total will be surplus to requirements.

<a name="21212w26.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 To ensure all eligible people in a household receive the correct level of winter fuel payment, personal information from the benefit computer systems is matched to ascertain how many eligible people live at each address. No distinction is made between houses with numbered addresses and those with house names but no number when determining entitlement to winter fuel payments.

Where more than one person's details are linked by the Delivery Point Suffix, each will be allocated #100; where the details are not linked to another, the person is awarded #200.

<a name="21212w26.html_para6">The Delivery Point Suffix is identified in 98 per cent. of cases, but in cross-referencing over 12 million records, there will unfortunately be some errors. Anyone who receives #100 when they believe that they are entitled to #200 is asked to contact the address on the notification letter.
<P>

<a name="21212w26.html_para7">This is then investigated and where further enquiries reveal that a #200 payment was due, a top up payment is issued. For Winter 2000&#150;01 45,332 top up payments were made, and for winter 2001&#150;02, there were 38,853 top up payments issued.
