 My Department aims to purchase only sustainably produced timber and timber products.

This states that as far as possible, wood products purchased by the Home Office should

come from forests and plantations that have been independently verified as being well managed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00217w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In keeping with my Department's policy to minimise any adverse environmental impact of its activities, the Home Office welcomes the availability of independent certification schemes such as that of the Forest Stewardship Council.
<P>

<a name="00217w02.html_para0">Our Greening Operations Policy (agreed in June 1998) encourages the use of ecolabels in procurement and asks purchasers to check environmental claims as thoroughly as possible, particularly with a view to verifying any vague environmental statements.
<P>

<a name="00217w02.html_para1">Nevertheless, it would be impractical for us to commit to ensuring that all paper and timber products that we purchase have the Forest Stewardship Council certificate. Our understanding is that the scheme does not yet cover the broad range of products that we are likely to require. Also, we would not want to find ourselves in breach of public procurement rules by being seen to favour the Forest Stewardship Council's scheme over and above any other equally valid certification scheme.

 This information is not collected centrally. Information on the time taken in magistrates courts proceedings is collected by the Lord Chancellor's Department's Time Intervals Survey. In 1999 and earlier years, the survey collected data on indictable (including triable either way) cases completed in a sample week of each February, June and October. From 2000 onwards, there will be four surveys during each year.

These figures include charged defendants but exclude summonsed defendants. For defendants committed for sentence to the Crown Court, time before committal is included but time spent in the Crown Court after committal is not available and therefore is not included.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00217w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Section 49 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 ("plea before venue") provides for defendants in either-way cases to be asked to indicate their plea before the magistrates decide whether to accept or decline jurisdiction. Its purpose is to allow cases in which a guilty plea is indicated, and which might previously have been committed for trial, to be dealt with by the magistrates themselves where the appropriate sentence (after any discount for the guilty plea) is within the court's powers, or if not through being committed to the Crown Court for sentence. The provision was implemented in October 1997, since when (as expected) substantially fewer cases have been committed for trial, but there has been a significant increase in the numbers committed for sentence. Statistics collected by the Crown Prosecution Service show that the percentage of either-way cases committed for trial reaching the Crown Court by way of the defendant's election was 28 per cent. in 1997 and 1998, and 32 per cent. in 1999.

<P>
<a name="00217w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Prison Service is considering a proposal to re-role Blantyre House, an adult male prison to a young offender institution for under 18-year-old juvenile males. This forms part of a strategy drawn up by the Prison Service and the Youth Justice Board for securing further improvements to the under 18 secure estate. The proposal is contingent upon the availability of resources and trends in the prison population. No other adult prisons are being considered for re-role to a young offender institution, or young offender institution holding 16 and 17-year-olds. However, changes in the composition of the prison population may require the Prison Service to consider other strategic re-role options in future.

Currently there are no plans to increase these. The penalties came into force on 3 February 1995, and include the option of a custodial sentence for the first time.

 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimates, the Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL), which covers Class IV Vote 1 (Home Office administration, police, probation, immigration and other services, England and Wales) and Vote 2 (Prisons, England and Wales), will be decreased by &#163;71,496,000 from &#163;7,763,444,000 to &#163;7,691,948,000.

 <i>[holding answer 26 January 2000]:</i> The provision of subtitling on BBC services is a matter for the BBC Governors and their policy is at least to match the targets set for any other broadcaster. 



<P>
<P><I>17 Feb 2000 : Column: 626W</I><P>
I understand from the BBC that they have concentrated on subtitling their most popular analogue services and this has inevitably led to a disparity between BBC1 and BBC2. As a result, 63 per cent. of BBC1 is currently subtitled and 53 per cent. of BBC2. On digital services, 60 per cent. of output on digital BBC1 and BBC2 and 30 per cent. on BBC Choice is subtitled. The BBC has recently increased its targets for its new digital channels to 50 per cent. of subtitling within five years and 100 per cent. within ten years.

 <i>[holding answer 14 February 2000]:</i> The entry in the relevant legislation under which the export of goods is controlled is known as their rating. The Export Control Organisation's computer databases have been interrogated. Between 1 January 1995 and 1 May 1997, 71 Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs) and 19 Open Individual Export Licences (OIELs) were issued covering the export to consignees or end-users in Bahrain of goods subject to control by being listed in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, commonly known as the Military List.
<P>

<a name="00217w04.html_para1">As regards export licences granted for the export of military goods to Bahrain between 2 May 1997 and 31 December 1998, details of export licensing decisions in this period were set out in the Government's Annual Reports published by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in March and November 1999. The Reports give details of the military equipment licensed for export during the periods as well as the ratings of these goods. Similar details of the military equipment licensed in later years will be set out in the relevant Annual Reports.
<P>

<a name="00217w04.html_para2">As regards licences granted since 1 January 1999, the Export Control Organisation's computer databases have been interrogated. Between 1 January 1999 and 31 January 2000, 17 SIELs and 14 OIELs have been issued covering the export of the relevant goods to Bahrain. A breakdown of the licences issued between 1 January 1995 and 1 May 1997 and between 1 January 1999 and 31 January 2000 are set out in the tables.
<P>

<a name="00217w04.html_para3">Individual licences may cover a range of goods with various ratings (and OIELs may also cover a range of countries). Where this is so, the licence is included in the table in the total for all of the relevant ratings.

 <i>[holding answer 14 February 2000]:</i> One of the key steps has been to establish the Small Business Service, which is to be formally launched in April this year. One of the primary functions of the Small Business Service will be to find ways of reducing the regulatory burden encountered by small business, by eliminating unnecessary regulations wherever possible and ensuring that the "Think Small First" principle is applied across Whitehall to all new regulations. The Small Business Service will also encourage Government Departments to make information on regulations more comprehensible and accessible, including through an SBS gateway.
<P>

<a name="00217w05.html_para2">Other important measures taken by the Department include exempting small shops from the EU requirement to unit price pre-packaged goods in fixed quantities and exempting employers with 20 or fewer employees from the trade union recognition procedures in the Employment Relations Act 1999. In addition we have recently consulted on proposals to increase the threshold below which companies are not required to have their accounts independently audited.

 The present legislative and administrative systems are intended to allow only those who qualify to be granted a driving licence. It is not at present planned to introduce further measures.

<P>
<a name="00217w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Evidence of valid insurance must be produced when a vehicle is licensed and the Vehicle Excise Duty is paid. Police have wide powers to stop vehicles and check insurance. As a result more than 250,000 motorists are convicted of insurance evasion each year. When vehicles are clamped and impounded for not displaying a tax disc an insurance certificate must be produced in order to buy the disc and reclaim the vehicle. The department is supporting the Association of British Insurers in setting up a computerised insurance database with links to the vehicle register. This should be operational by autumn next year.

 Display of a certificate would provide no assurance that the driver was covered by an insurance policy or was complying with policy conditions. Although the Government have not discarded the possibility of a requirement to display evidence of insurance, it appears at present that other measures, such as a computerised insurance database, would offer a better approach to the problem of the irresponsible minority of drivers who fail to take out insurance.

 The average fine imposed on employers and others convicted in Health and Safety Executive cases heard in 1998-99 was &#163;6,654, per defendant. The average fine in such cases, per individual offence, was &#163;5,038. These are provisional figures. The average fine per individual offence following local authority prosecutions in health and safety at work cases was &#163;2,224 in 1997-98.

<P>

<a name="00217w08.html_para16">The general level of fines imposed by the courts for health and safety at work offences has been far too low to properly reflect their true seriousness. In November 1998, the Court of Appeal said in a judgment that health and safety fines were too low and set out factors which should guide future health and safety sentencing. I welcome the Health and Safety at Work (Offences) Bill introduced to Parliament by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Savidge) which is taking forward the Government's intention to raise the maximum penalties for health and safety offences, especially making imprisonment available for a wider range of these offences. I hope this measure will send a clear message to all employers that society will not tolerate failures to safeguard health and safety.

 Leaseholders of houses already enjoy rights to enfranchise their property under the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, and leaseholders of flats enjoy collective enfranchisement rights under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. We intend to make these existing rights easier to exercise. The first stage in this will be the publication of a draft Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill for consultation during this session, as was announced in the Gracious Speech given on 17 November 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 4-7. Following that consultation, we intend to bring forward legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows.

 <i>[holding answer 16 February 2000]:</i> My right hon. Friend has no specific responsibilities if a train operating company or a bus company goes into liquidation. The Franchising Director has a responsibility to take over the operation of any franchised train operator in the event of premature termination of a franchise, as a result of liquidation of the company or for any other reason, and he has arrangements in readiness to do this at short notice, if necessary. London Transport Buses are responsible for the provision of bus services in London.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00217w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Government decision to set up a new inquiry into Bloody Sunday and the appointment of Lord Saville of Newdigate to chair the Tribunal of Inquiry was announced by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on 29 January 1998.
<P>

<a name="00217w09.html_para1">The Bloody Sunday Inquiry believe 29 self-loading rifles (SLRs) were submitted for ballistic testing during the Widgery Inquiry to the Department of Industrial and Forensic Science. It is not possible to say how many have retained their original barrels; it is highly probable that they would have been re-barrelled at some point during their operational lives, in which case their forensic value would be substantially reduced. Detailed records were not kept of repairs to SLRs and no record was kept of whether a rifle had been re-barrelled, or how many times this may have occurred. The SLR was declared obsolete in November 1997 and authority to commence destruction was given in January 1998. SLRs were therefore recalled for disposal in line with this policy. By the end of January 2000 approximately 116,000 rifles had been disposed of out of a total of 144,000.
<P>

<a name="00217w09.html_para2">A list of 29 partial serial numbers, relating to the rifles fired on Bloody Sunday, was sent by the Inquiry to the MOD on 1 September 1999. From the information available it was not possible to identify the rifles until 29 September 1999. Of the 29, 14 were identified as having been issued for destruction on the following dates: 26 January 1998, 13 February 1998, 8 April 1998, 29 April 1998, 30 April 1998, 3 June 1998, 29 June 1998, 10 August 1998, 17 August 1998, 22 February 1999, 29 March 1999, 23 August 1999 and two on 24 September 1999. Ten rifles were identified as having been sold to private companies, leaving the five in the possession of the MOD. Despite an embargo on the movement of the remaining five, two of these rifles were destroyed on 26 and 28 January 2000.
<P>

<a name="00217w09.html_para3">Thus 24 of the rifles were disposed of as part of the routine disposal programme at a time when they could not be identified as Bloody Sunday rifles from available MOD records. That two rifles have been destroyed since is a matter of deep regret and an investigation has been launched by the Chief Constable of the Ministry of Defence Police to which officers from the West Mercia Constabulary will be seconded. The Bloody Sunday Inquiry will be invited to send an observer. The remaining three rifles have been secured and the Bloody Sunday Inquiry has been given assurances about their safe keeping.

Excellence in Cities (EiC) was launched on 22 March 1999 by the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State. Summer schools are an integral part of this continuing support through the education system.

 For 2000-01, Gloucestershire's education SSA has increased by &#163;11.21 million to &#163;226.01 million. While it is for local authorities to set their education budgets, my right hon. Friend has written on behalf of the Government to urge all council leaders to ensure that all the additional provision we have made available is actually spent on education. Gloucestershire's Standards Fund allocation for 2000-01 is &#163;15.21 million, an increase of &#163;4.76 million. I hope it will take up all of this allocation. In addition, Gloucestershire will receive &#163;572,000 as its share of the extra &#163;50 million grant for education on condition that it is used for education and added to schools' delegated budgets. My right hon. Friend shall look for prior confirmation that the whole of the increase in Gloucestershire's education SSA has been passed on to education before deciding whether to release its share of the grant.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00217w12.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 The Government are committed to raising the status of early-years workers and improving the quality of early education. We have listened to early-years practitioners who have said that early education should be recognised as a distinct phase of education. The Foundation Stage of the National Curriculum will be launched in September, with the new Early Learning Goals which most children should achieve at the end of the reception year. And we will be providing significant extra training and support to help deliver that.
<P>

<a name="00217w12.html_para2">A highly trained and qualified workforce is the key to attracting and retaining good people. Our aim is to introduce minimum levels of qualifications for leaders of early-years settings and for the practitioners that work in them. In October 1999, we introduced "A Framework of Nationally Accredited Qualifications in Early Years Education, Childcare and Playwork". The framework provides for the first time clear, comprehensive and integrated information about the skills, competencies, training and qualifications that are needed for the wide range of jobs in the sector. It will be updated this spring. We are developing occupational standards for the sector which will form the basis for further qualifications. This work is being led by the Early Years National Training Organisation, which was established in November 1998.

<a name="00217w12.html_para3">I believe the steps we are taking will provide people working in early-years education with a more clearly defined career structure and better recognition of the contribution they make to children's development.

 I am today announcing the outcome of a fundamental review of the Employment Service Annual Performance Agreement (APA) which was launched in May 1999. The review included a wide-ranging public consultation involving employers, voluntary, public and private sector organisations and other Government Departments.
<P>

<a name="00217w12.html_para6">The review has been an important staging post in the modernisation of the Employment Service. I want the ES to provide an outward looking, accessible and efficient service, using the latest generation of technology, which can meet the demands of its customers, whether they are jobseekers or employers, by working in close partnership with a wide range of public, private and voluntary sectors. I also want greater emphasis on equal opportunities.
<P>

<a name="00217w12.html_para7">As a result of the review, the Employment Service will have a brand new Vision and Purpose for 2000-01 which describes the key elements for modernising the service. I am also announcing a new Aim and Objectives, which can be easily understood by ES staff and will help them to focus on the service that they provide to employers in helping to fill their vacancies. I believe that these proposals, together with a new set of targets, will help ES to be an inclusive service which helps all people without work and particularly the most disadvantaged jobseekers. During the year I will be exploring alternative ways of weighting targets. I hope to announce target numbers before the end of March 2000.

(10) The number of lone parents who were working part-time before obtaining work of over 16 hours cannot be split into target and non-target group for phase 1.<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The results for phase 2 of NDLP are not available split into the target and non-target groups on/training.<P>

2. In some cases it was not recorded whether the lone parent was either from the target or non-target group. The figures shown in the table are only those definitely recorded as in one group or the other.

 My right hon.

A range of other minor improvements, identified during the course of routine monitoring will also be included in the amendment to directions and guidance.

<P>
<a name="00217w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We shall lay before the House regulations to increase National Health Service charges in England from 1 April 2000. There will be a cash increase in the charge of 10p, (1.69 per cent.) from &#163;5.90 to &#163;6.00 for each quantity of a drug or appliance dispensed.
<P>

<a name="00217w14.html_para4">The cost of prescription prepayment certificates will rise to &#163;31.40 for a four-month certificate and &#163;86.20 for an annual certificate. These offer savings for those needing more than 5 items in four months or 14 in one year.
<P>

<a name="00217w14.html_para5">Prescription charges are expected to raise some &#163;380 million for the NHS in 2000-2001.
<P>

<a name="00217w14.html_para6">Charges for elastic stockings and tights, wigs and most fabric supports supplied through the Hospital Service will be increased similarly.
<P>

<a name="00217w14.html_para7">The maximum patient charge for a single course of dental treatment begun on or after 1 April 2000 will increase from &#163;348 to &#163;354. Only about 1 in every 1,000 courses of treatment will attract the new maximum charge.
<P>

<a name="00217w14.html_para8">The increases are in line with the movement of the retail prices index from January 1999 (the benchmark for the current charge) to November 1999 of 2 per cent., but rounded to the most convenient unit. Movements in the retail prices index from November to November will become the benchmark for any subsequent charges increases within the three year period following the Comprehensive Spending Review.
<P>

<a name="00217w14.html_para9">Optical voucher values in England will increase overall by 2 per cent. to help children, people on low income and certain people with complex sight problems with the cost of spectacles or contact lenses.
<P>

<a name="00217w14.html_para10">NHS charges and optical voucher values in Scotland and Wales are a matter for the devolved administrations. However, I can inform my hon. Friend that these proposals have been considered jointly with the Secretary for Health and Social Services to the National Assembly for Wales who tells me she will be putting forward parallel proposals for consideration by the Assembly.

<a name="00217w15.html_spnew9"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 By bringing policy responsibility for tax and NICs together in the Inland Revenue, we have provided a single focus for employers' representatives to discuss improvements in legislation and processes across both income tax and national insurance contributions. From April 1999 we have aligned the point at which employers start to pay national insurance contributions with the income tax personal allowance. From April 2001, we will align fully the point at which employees start to pay National Insurance contributions with the income tax personal allowance. Provisions in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill currently before Parliament go a long way towards aligning, in the interests of fairness, the tax and NICs treatment of benefits in kind. The Chancellor announced in the Pre-Budget Report that the Inland Revenue will work with employers' representatives and others to reduce technical differences between tax and National Insurance, while having due regard to individuals' benefit entitlement.

 For the year 2000-01 the estimated full year cost of raising the higher rate threshold by &#163;3,000 is &#163;1.3 billion and the estimated yield from aligning the threshold with the Upper Earnings Limit is &#163;3 billion. These estimates are based on the 1997-98 Survey of Personal Incomes and are consistent with the November 1999 Pre-Budget Report.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00217w15.html_spnew12"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 It is not possible to calculate the effects without more detail on how the integrated charge would work. In particular, income tax is charged on a wider base than national insurance contributions, covering in addition savings and investment income, pensions and contributory benefits. Income tax has no cap on employees' liability, no charge on the employer and no cessation of liability at retirement age, unlike National Insurance contributions, and payment of National Insurance contributions maintains access to contributory benefits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00217w16.html_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 I announced on 30 April 1999 that, after consultation with the Chairman of the Security Commission and the right hon. Gentleman, I had asked the Security Commission to investigate the circumstances in which breaches of security had or might have occurred arising out of the case of Chief Petty Officer Steven Hayden, who was convicted on 23 October 1998 of offences under section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1989; and to advise in the light of that investigation whether any change in security arrangements was necessary or desirable.
<P>

<a name="00217w16.html_para0">The Commission has now submitted its report to me and it is being published this afternoon as a Command paper, with the exception of some details which it would not be in the public interest to publish on national security grounds. I am most grateful to the Chairman, Lord Lloyd, and to Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, Sir John Foley and Sir Clive Whitmore.
<P>

<a name="00217w16.html_para1">It became apparent to the Commission at the start of the inquiry that the main issues at stake were in the area of personnel security. The Commission has fully examined the history of the Ministry of Defence's security assessment of Hayden. The Commission was critical of the decisions to continue to allow Hayden a security clearance and surprised at the lack of communication between the vetting authorities, the personnel authorities and line management about the management of the risk presented by him. In particular they considered whether 



<P>
<P><I>17 Feb 2000 : Column: 672W</I><P>
the correct balance was being struck between maintaining vetting confidentiality on the one hand and the effective involvement of line and personnel management in the active aftercare of vetting risk cases on the other.
<P>

<a name="00217w16.html_para2">It was also concerned that recommendations made in earlier Security Commission inquiries had sought to address similar situations to those in the Hayden case which suggested that they had not been fully implemented.
<P>

<a name="00217w16.html_para3">However, the Commission acknowledges the Ministry of Defence's acceptance that Hayden's case represents a clear failure in personnel security and welcomes the changes to vetting processes and procedures that the Ministry of Defence have already implemented based on the lessons learned. The Commission has made a number of recommendations. These, in summary, are that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) It should be standard practice for vetting authorities to consider whether to consult an individual's personnel or line managers, in order to ensure that the latter are aware of any particular vulnerabilities.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) In cases where doubts emerge, it should be normal practice for regular consultations to take place between all those involved in assessing a clearance. Where the recommendations of Investigating Officers seem likely to be overridden for wider policy considerations of a non-security kind, there should invariably be a discussion between them and those responsible for making the assessment, so that options can be explored before final decisions are reached.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) In risk cases where confidential medical reports exist on an individual, someone at an appropriately senior level should have the authority to see all the papers including a medical report on the individual's suitability to hold a DV clearance and thus be in a position to reach a proper assessment based on all relevant information.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iv) More emphasis should be given to threats outside the traditional risk of an individual being vulnerable to approaches from a hostile foreign intelligence service. Threats from "cheque-book journalism" and industrial espionage should be given more emphasis in the current Field Investigation Officers Guide issued by the Cabinet Office, and in departmental guidance based upon it.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(v) The question of follow-up to Security Commission recommendations should be revisited to ensure that effective implementation of agreed recommendations takes place.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="00217w16.html_para4">The recommendations of the Security Commission have been accepted in principle by the Government subject to further consideration of some detailed points and in the case of (iii), subject to discussion with the appropriate medical authorities.

 The reason for the increase in appropriations in aid is that the FCO was able to sell assets worth &#163;2 million more than projected. The increase in capital expenditure reflects the recycling of those proceeds into other FCO capital programmes.

 In November 1999, to mark the tenth anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the FCO and Save the Children UK organised a Children's Select Committee. 16 children from across the UK chose to examine four issues of central importance to children: child soldiers, child labour, child rights and the environment, and child participation. The Committee's findings were presented in a report to the FCO on 8 February making a number of recommendations for the Government, business sector and NGOs to consider.
<P>

<a name="00217w18.html_para2">The FCO is co-ordinating the Government's response which we plan to publish by the middle of April. We will also be looking at ways to publicise the Committee's report and a video of the event as widely as possible, including through our Posts overseas.

 Details of current FCO properties for sale are as listed. As to listing properties being considered for disposal, the entire estate is reviewed as part of a rolling programme revaluation exercise. This reveals properties which appear to be performing poorly on the basis of key performance indicators. These are then examined in detail to determine whether they should be replaced by more effective properties.

 Since 1 May 1997 the FCO has sold 78 estate assets. Details are as listed. Total proceeds to date from completed sales amount to &#163;39 million. For reasons of commercial confidentiality, the FCO does not publish names of buyers. Were we to do so, prospective purchasers might be dissuaded from bidding.

 We maintain close contact with a wide cross-section of society in Zimbabwe, including opposition groups. The referendum process was deeply flawed. The 'No' vote showed that there was clearly wide discontent with both the process and the content of the draft.
