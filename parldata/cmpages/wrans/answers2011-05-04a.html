The FSA has commenced a review of the funding model of the FSCS. They will proceed to a formal consultation once discussions on European directives affecting compensation arrangements have been concluded and the Government’s policy on the future role of the FSCS in the context of reform of the regulatory architecture for financial services has been settled.</p>

 We remain concerned at events in Bahrain. Although the immediate situation appears calmer, there continue to be many credible reports of human rights abuses. We urge the Government of Bahrain to meet all its human rights obligations and uphold political freedoms, equal access to justice and the rule of law. These do not run contrary to security, but are integral to longer term stability. Dialogue is the way to fulfil the aspirations of all Bahrainis. We urge all sides, including opposition groupings, to engage.</p>

 I am aware of the further use of lethal force to disperse protestors in Sana’a and Taiz in the period from 17-19 April 2011 resulting in the deaths of several demonstrators and injuries to many others. The use of live rounds and disproportionate force to quell demonstrations is not acceptable. I, along with the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon.

Following this, the GCC then brokered a revised transition deal between the ruling party and the official opposition group. I welcome reports that agreement is close and stated my strong support for the proposed settlement in a press release on 25 April 2011.

 The Creative Industries Council was formed at a round table chaired by myself and the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, the right hon. Member for Twickenham (Vince Cable), on 16 March this year, and will meet officially for the first time on 6 July. It is for the Council itself to decide on the frequency of its meetings, but it may meet every six months in order to keep strategic oversight of the work being done by the sub-groups it is planned to set up. I would expect the Council to continue while it is clear that it is adding value, and therefore has the commitment and active support of its members.</p>

 No specific target has been set. The private sector has announced plans that will provide high speed broadband access to at least two-thirds of the population of the UK. The Government have allocated £530 million up to 2015 to support broadband rollout in those areas the market will not reach. We intend to use that money to support projects that will provide access to high-speed broadband to as many of the remaining third of the population as possible while ensuring a basic level of access to virtually everybody.</p>

 The roll-out of smart meters will facilitate more innovative energy tariffs in a variety of ways, including tariffs which vary by time-of-use. Many more such tariffs will be technically feasible with smart meters. Smart meters will also make it easier for consumers to switch, which over time will reward companies who make new tariff offerings that are attractive to consumers. Ofgem, the energy market regulator, will continue to monitor and regulate energy suppliers in order to promote competition and innovation, and to protect the interests of energy consumers. DECC and Ofgem are working closely together on smart meter roll-out, to ensure that suppliers have appropriate incentives and obligations to deliver smart meters and drive innovation.</p>

 The Green Deal Impact Assessment (IA)<sup>(1)</sup> published alongside the Energy Bill in December 2010 presented estimates of the “maximum feasible potential” from the residential sector (8.7MtCO2e in 2020, and lifetime savings of 287MtCO2e). The IA also presents illustrative low and high take-up scenarios. These scenarios suggest carbon savings in 2020 of 3.9 and 5.8MtCO2e or lifetime carbon savings of 126 and 193MtCO2e respectively.</p>

 The UK operates within an international market for petroleum products. Levels of imports and exports have fluctuated over the past decade; a significant proportion of the products consumed in the UK are imported and a similar level of UK production is exported. We recognise that the UK’s demand for oil products has changed over the last 10 to 15 years, driven by growth in the aviation sector, the increasing numbers of diesel vehicles and a reduction in the use of oil for power generation.</p>

This is due to structural factors (e.g. central European markets are landlocked and hence less open to imports and competition) and the fact that UK refineries process higher quality (and hence higher cost) North sea crude feedstock than is the case in much of Europe. Further work to assess the competitiveness of the sector in more detail is currently under way.</p>

No thorium reactor design has been implemented beyond relatively small, experimental systems, while many either exist only on paper or have only had specific subsystems demonstrated. As an indicator of the challenge of taking this technology further, the Chinese Academy of Sciences estimates a development period of at least 20 years will be required before a demonstration thorium molten salt breeder reactor might be available.</p>

                        <i>[holding answer 28 April 2011]:</i> The Government are currently consulting on a range of options for discretionary support (in addition to the assistance already provided under the statutory blight and compensation provisions) for owners of properties which experience a significant diminution in value as a result of proximity to any new high speed rail line between London and the west midlands. Respondents to the consultation may wish to provide comments on these options, or suggest alternative approaches, and the Government will consider these. No decisions will be taken on what option or options should be taken forward to the next stage until the consultation process has ended and all responses have been analysed.</p>

 Under the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) governments are able to issue compulsory licenses on patented technologies. For Least Developed Countries (LDCs) this flexibility may have limited impact because they lack domestic manufacturing capability. Whilst TRIPS has been amended to enable compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical products for export to these countries, there is currently insufficient  <br/>

Compulsory licensing is also likely to be a strong disincentive to investment in technology innovation and is unlikely to encourage the transfer of know-how and tacit knowledge which is required to maintain and adapt technologies for local use. By contrast, voluntary licensing arrangements are more likely to foster longer term partnerships and bring about sustainable technology transfer. The UK is committed to providing incentives for business to promote technology transfer to LDCs as required by TRIPS Article 66.2.</p>

 The UK policy is to take a case-by-case approach to intellectual property rights within Free Trade Agreements between the European Union and developing countries. The level of intellectual property protection should be tailored to the trading partner's level of development. We stated in the recently published “Trade and Investment for Growth” White Paper that we would seek to ensure that provisions on intellectual property rights in EU free trade agreements did not have negative impacts on the ability of the poorest to access low cost medicines.

1. Schools have been identified as those with a postcode in the Reading East parliamentary constituency. The figures cover schools classed by UCAS as comprehensive, grammar, independent and other secondary schools in England. Other kinds of centres have not contributed to this analysis. Only schools from which UCAS received applications in the cycle concerned have contributed to the proportion calculation. Figures do not account for students accepted to Oxford or Cambridge who applied directly, rather than via UCAS.
2. Detailed data on applications via secondary schools are only available from 2001. Data for earlier years have not been provided as the necessary reference data are not available.

 Colleges of music and conservatoires offer courses which are very popular and so we expect them to be in a strong position to attract fee income in future when most funding will follow the choices of students. Many of these institutions receive additional funding from the Funding Council to account for their small size or specialist nature, which are not recognised through the current mainstream funding formula. Whilst it is for the Funding Council to make decisions on grant allocations the Government will set out its priorities for continuing grant in the forthcoming higher education white paper. It will be our priority that in putting the new funding system in place we do not damage in the process those institutions with a world class reputation for the arts and music.</p>

 Yes, for the purposes of the Education (Student Support) Regulations an “end-on course” is a degree course taken immediately—that is to say without any break other than a vacation—after a foundation degree or other lower level qualification designated for support under those regulations. Students seeking top up qualifications in this way are treated as continuing their studies, and retain the support package and tuition charge arrangements that applied on their initial course.</p>

 The sale of DIY tattoo kits is covered by the General Product Safety Regulations 2005 (GPSR). These place a general duty on all suppliers/producers of consumer goods to supply products that are safe in normal or reasonably foreseeable use, which includes providing consumers with appropriate warnings and instructions for use (together with sell by dates, age related warnings and other relevant information in the language of the market). Local authorities as the UK market surveillance authorities enforce the GPSR and will be able to take action when they consider an absence of any of these renders a product unsafe, including online sales.</p>

                        <i>[holding answer 3 May 2011]:</i> The forthcoming revision of the UNECE Gothenburg Protocol provides an opportunity to highlight the importance of reducing black carbon as a component of particulate matter (PM) for both health and climate reasons. The proposal for an emissions ceiling for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the revised protocol will help to deliver reductions in black carbon out to 2020 while further work is carried out to develop emission inventories, ambient air quality monitoring and improve our understanding of control techniques for black carbon.</p>

However, emissions from biomass combustion have the potential to adversely impact ambient air quality. Therefore, as announced in the Government's March 2011 document on the renewable heat incentive (RHI), emission limits for particulate matter (PM10) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) will be introduced in 2012 for biomass installations below 20MWth as eligibility criteria for RHI support.

 A proposal for all dogs to be compulsorily microchipped was included in DEFRA's consultation on dangerous dog legislation. DEFRA received 1,875 responses on this issue, of which 84% were in favour and 16% opposed. We are currently working with groups such as the RSPCA to look at a range of issues raised in the consultation, including microchipping.</p>

 Future ivory sales will only be legal if agreed under a decision making mechanism which, in 2010, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species agreed should be produced by 2013. The UK is working with its EU partners to develop a robust line to be taken in future discussions, as well as calling for an early start to the development of a precautionary mechanism.

 No official reports of the apparent killings have been received, but we are liaising with the convention on international trade in endangered species (CITES) ‘Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants’ programme to assess the accuracy of the stories. The UK as a party to CITES supports its efforts to maintain or enhance countries' enforcement capabilities. In the second half of May, the UK will be participating in a CITES-organised rhino and elephant enforcement taskforce meeting which will exchange intelligence reports and methodologies and develop strategies to tackle the illegal trade in both animals across their ranges.</p>

The independent co-chairs of the NEA have, in agreement with all funders, decided that the NEA will be published in June. This will allow key stakeholders to be briefed on the study, for some additional analysis, and for further engagement with the devolved Administrations following their, elections.

 We are continuing to work on proposals for a Public Data Corporation which achieve all the objectives which were initially set out on 12 January 2011 and then updated at Budget. Our intent remains to put in place a coherent data policy framework by autumn 2011. We are also considering the merits of machinery of government changes to facilitate the development of a Public Data Corporation (PDC) through a sponsoring department and the subsequent establishment of a PDC Shadow Board.</p>

 There are many organisations in the public sector which hold and manage information. Not all organisations holding significant public sector information will be suitable for inclusion within the Public Data Corporation. Important considerations will be how and to what extent the information is made available to its customers (other parts of Government, businesses and citizens), and whether products and services form part of the organisation’s ‘public task’ or whether they are a by product in the organisation’s business model. Final decisions on inclusion of bodies and datasets will be taken in light of this work. Until decisions are taken it would be premature to announce which bodies may be involved.</p>

                        <a name="110504109000063"> While the majority of public sector information will be available under the Open Government License (OGL), there are some instances where this is not possible e.g. where third party intellectual property rights are present, or where charges are required to ensure the sustainability and quality of the data. Work over the coming months will focus on harmonising and simplifying licensing arrangements that can be used as a basis for licensing where the OGL is not appropriate.</p>

 The impact assessments accompanying the consultation response papers assume that court estate rationalisation does not impact on service delivery. As the volume of work is not expected to rise or fall as a result of estate rationalisation and there is sufficient capacity at recipient courts to undertake work from closing courts, it is not anticipated that timeliness of care proceedings will be significantly affected.</p>

                              <sup>(1)</sup> The statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(2)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

 The Ministry of Justice estate occupies around 2,140 properties as of September 2010, the most recent period for which we have verified data. This consists of freehold, leasehold premises and other holdings used under a memorandum of terms of occupancy. To disaggregate this figure and to give the name and address for each freehold property would incur disproportionate cost.

 This Ministry of Justice has conducted a pilot study comparing reoffending rates from three countries, England and Wales, Scotland and the Netherlands to assess whether national reoffending data can be compared.</p>

                        <a name="110504114000556"> The study showed that a significant part of the difference in reoffending rates between countries in this pilot was due to the different measurement techniques, rather than any real difference in the level of reoffending with particular groups of offenders. Therefore, it is important to understand and take into account underlying differences in the particular ways reoffending rates are calculated before any meaningful comparisons between countries can be made, and when making use of international evidence on what works to reduce reoffending.</p>

                              <sup>(1)</sup> Stealing from ‘shops and stalls’ (shoplifting) is an offence under Theft Act 1968, section 1.
<i>Notes:</i>
1. These statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts, and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

                              <sup>(1)</sup> The cautions statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been cautioned for two or more offences at the same time the principal offence is the more serious offence.
<sup>(2)</sup> From 1 June 2000 the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 came into force nationally and removed the use of cautions for persons under 18 and replaced them with reprimands and final warnings. These figures have been included in the totals.
<sup>(3)</sup> The court proceedings statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(4)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.

<sup>(2)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(3)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

                              <sup>(1)</sup> Stealing from ‘shops and stalls’ (shoplifting) is an offence under Theft Act 1968, section 1.
<i>Notes:</i>
1. These statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts, and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

 The Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) set out the Government's aim to accelerate the re-basing of the 20,000 or so armed forces personnel currently in Germany to the UK. Since the SDSR was announced the Ministry of Defence has been addressing the full range of basing and estate issues arising from the re-basing from Germany; restructuring of the Army's non-deployable regional and administrative structure; and the future requirement for RAF bases. Once we have drawn up a comprehensive basing and estates rationalisation plan the Army will be able to draw up its detailed proposals for the rebasing of forces from Germany. Officials will engage with the local authorities concerned as these develop.</p>

Contractors appointed under this arrangement are free to source on the open market consistent with meeting EU competition rules and quality standards.

The food supply contract has been placed on Purple Food Service Solutions who procure meat and dairy proteins in the UK that meet all UK animal welfare standards. Proteins purchased outside of the UK comply with the EU animal welfare standards. 100% of bacon sourced since May 2010 meets these standards. 100% of eggs sourced since May 2010 meets the Lion Standard, an internationally recognised quality code of practice. All food purchased through the MOD food supply contract is subject to stringent quality standards, encompassing farm assurance, animal welfare and health and nutrition. These meet or exceed all current legislative standards.</p>

The legislation means that UK Courts of Law can no longer be used to pursue excessive claims against some of the poorest countries on their historic debts, ensuring that resources are available to tackle poverty. The sunset clause attached to this legislation means that the law will expire on 7 June 2011. The Government have reviewed the impact of the Debt Relief (Developing Countries) Act 2010. Evidence suggests that the Act has had some benefit on heavily indebted poor countries and no evidence has been found of unintended adverse effects. The Government have decided to make the Act permanent. The draft Order was laid before Parliament on 28 March 2011. The UK will share its experience of addressing non-participation in debt relief with Britain's Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories.</p>

 The UK strongly support the Bank’s shift away from lending for coal fired power stations towards cleaner energy sources where there is a greater need for concessional lending. The Bank should focus where it can add most value such as support for low income countries, which have less capacity and access to finance. We want to see the Bank helping countries explore all reasonable alternative options before concluding that coal is the appropriate option. Where these are not feasible we want to see efforts being made to ensure the cleanest possible technology is used.</p>

 Under the Department for Children, Schools and Families two evaluations were commissioned of the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning programme. These were published in 2008 and 2010, and included measures of pupils' social and emotional skills, mental health difficulties, and behaviour problems. No quantitative measurements were included of cognitive, biological or physical development.</p>

The portal is available on the internet to professionals and the public, and has been widely advertised at national and local events. The portal has also been referenced in national and local guidance (such as the Local Awareness and Early Diagnosis Baseline Guide).

 Data on recurrences of <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection are not collected centrally. The symptoms of initial infection, recurrence of infection and re-infection is similar. Differentiation between recurrence of infection and re-infection requires culture and characterization of the causative strain(s) of <i>Clostridium difficile</i>. This is not routinely undertaken, as diagnoses are often based on the detection of <i>Clostridium difficile</i> toxins, rather than microbiological culture. However, studies typically show that approximately a quarter of individuals with <i>Clostridium difficile</i> Infection experience a recurrence of their symptoms. In about half of these recurrences a different strain (ie re-infection) is the cause, with the others due to relapse from the original strain. The best solution is to prevent these infections by adhering to the Department of Health/Health Protection Agency guidance on managing this infection <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection: How to deal with the problem. A copy of the guidance has already been placed in the Library and is available at:</p>

 ‘Reducing cancer inequality: evidence, progress and making it happen’, the March 2010 report of the National Cancer Equality Initiative (NCEI), said that it would be good practice for multi-disciplinary teams (MDTs) to undertake equality audits, reflecting annually on their practice and documenting their findings. It set out plans to support this. ‘Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer’ (January 2011) said that patient characteristic profiles would be made available to MDTs and that, in future, MDT health equality audits would form part of the National Cancer Peer Review Programme.</p>

                              <i>Notes:</i>
1. The new headcount methodology for 2010 data is not fully comparable with previous years data due to improvements that make it a more stringent count of absolute staff numbers. Headcount totals are unlikely to equal the sum of components. Further information on the headcount methodology is available in the Census publication here:
http://www.ic.nhs.uk/statistics-and-data-collections/workforce/nhs-staff-numbers
Headcount numbers in 2010 have also for some trusts been affected by clarification of the hosting arrangements for medical and dental staff.
2. Data Quality: The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses.

1. FCE: A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.
2. Data quality: The number of episodes where this diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record. ICD-10 codes used for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma:
C82—Follicular (nodular) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
C83—Diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
C85—Other and unspecified types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
3. Assessing growth through time: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.
4. Activity included: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.
5. Source statement: Activity in English NHS Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.
