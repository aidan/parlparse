While it is not possible to make any vehicle invulnerable to every possible attack, there has been a programme of continuing improvement to the protection level of vehicles in service. Snatch in particular has been reconfigured for Afghanistan, with a new variant, Snatch Vixen. As a result of modifications to the running gear, chassis, engine and other automotive components, the Snatch Vixen benefits from an increased payload, which has been used to enhance both the mobility and protection of this vehicle. These modifications mean that the new variant offers the highest levels of protection for its size and weight.</p>

Contracts were let to undertake a Strategic Environmental Assessment, and to provide advice on technical and engineering issues, on potential project ownership structure and financing, and on regional economic and energy market impacts. Following input from stakeholders, the feasibility study published a list of 10 potential schemes in July this year and has been assessing in broad terms the costs, benefits and impacts of the long list of potential schemes. This work will feed into an internal review, which will take place at the end of this year. Subject to that review, we will launch in the new year a public consultation to invite views on the scope of the strategic environmental assessment and on which of the 10 proposals will be short-listed for more detailed assessment in 2009. Advisory and scoping reports produced for the feasibility study will be published with the consultation paper.</p>

 In 2001, a three-year Government sponsored pilot project was launched to reduce fuel poverty on a local area basis. An evaluation of the pilot highlighted actions required for the area-based approach to be successful. The pilot evolved into the Warm Zones initiative which has continued across some areas, with the original concept being extended to include broader energy efficiency activity. The Community Energy Efficiency Fund built on these experiences and in September 2007 funded 49 individual projects across the country.

We are working hard to develop robust plans to streamline our business, cutting out unnecessary overheads and non-essential projects to remove duplication of effort and increase efficiency. The Department is currently conducting the necessary due diligence on its initial scoping work and we cannot yet provide accurate information on workforce projections. However, our approach to the use of agency staff and contractors will be to limit their use to essential tasks only and where it is cost effective for the Department to employ them, rather than permanent members of staff.</p>

 The MoJ settlement received in the last Comprehensive Spending Review meant that the MoJ would have to absorb cost of living increases and other upward pressures equivalent to approximately &#163;1 billion over the three year period. Ministers and the Management Board have been working to put in place plans to achieve the savings which are necessary. In doing this, our overall approach has been to capitalise on the synergies and the opportunities created by the merger of two large parts of Government to form the MoJ. We intend to do so in particular through increasing efficiency, removal of duplication and new ways of working while continuing to prioritise the delivery of effective frontline services.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many persistent young offenders are registered; how many offences have been recorded where the offender was a persistent young offender in each year since 1997; and what percentage of total offences in each police force area in England and Wales this represents.

 Statistics relating to Persistent Young Offenders (PYOs) are designed to measure the speed and efficiency of the youth justice system; through monitoring the pledge to halve the average time from arrest to sentence for dealing with PYOs in England and Wales from 142 days in 1996 to 71 days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="81113w0013.htm_para2"><a name="081113122000343">They are not designed to measure overall trends in youth crime, and will give a significantly misleading picture of the true trend if used for this purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="81113w0013.htm_para3"><a name="081113122000344">This is because the definition of a PYO relies on there being multiple sentencing occasions for a single offender during a limited time period. Young offenders are now being dealt with twice as quickly as they were prior to 1997, which means that there are much shorter intervals between sentencing occasions for those youths who repeatedly offend. Youth sentencing is therefore more timely, and for repeat offenders more frequent, than it used to be prior to 1997. Therefore, a side-effect of the Government&#146;s success in bringing much swifter justice to young repeat offenders is that more of them end up being defined as PYOs.</p>

 The UK Border Agency War Crimes Team does not collate statistics that relate solely to crimes against humanity. 16 per cent. of cases referred to the War Crimes Team in the last four years have resulted in recommendations for further immigration action.

This logo was created during the production of the original EYFS document in 2007, which was subsequently reprinted in 2008. The cost allocated for designing this logo was &#163;317.30.

<i> [holding answer 10 November 2008]:</i> The Department has funded early years training, in particular Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) training, through both the School's Standard Fund and the General Sure Start Grant (GSSG). In addition to this, we provided a further &#163;7 million during 2007-08 to support EYFS training for schools and practitioners in private, voluntary and independent settings. At the same time we enabled greater flexibility within the Transformation Fund to support its use for training on the EYFS for the private, voluntary and independent sector. Because of the way we fund through these broad grants, local authorities have discretion over how these funds are used at local level and therefore other programme funds may also have contributed, and continue to contribute, to training on the EYFS. Consequently, the Department does not hold information on the sums put towards early years training from these budgets.</p>

This guidance says that schools should consult as widely as possible with parents before implementing biometric-based systems. This guidance is in the public domain on the Becta and ICO websites. We will place this guidance in the House of Commons Library.</p>

 Carers of adults, together with parents of children under six and parents of disabled children under 18, already have the right to request flexible working. Employers must give serious consideration to their request but can decline it if necessary on specified business grounds.

The judgment in the European Court of Justice Case C-303/06 (Coleman <i> v.</i> Attridge Law), which concerns discrimination against an employee on grounds of her child's disability, does not provide a right to demand flexible working.</p>

 A recently published article in <i> The Lancet</i> (2008; 372:293-99) provides estimates of life expectancy for HIV-infected adults receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. It is based on analysis of over 43,000 patients from industrialised countries, including some from the UK. The median life expectancy for such patients was 63 years for those diagnosed at age 20 and 67 years for those diagnosed at age 35.</p>

For those patients starting combination therapy at age 20, life expectancy increased from an estimated 56.1 years in 1996-99 to 69.4 years in 2003-05. Equivalent figures at age 35 are from 60 years to 72.3 years.</p>

1. Population data and rates:<br>
The population data used was provided by the Populations and Geographies team in the NHS Information Centre. These figures are for calendar years only; therefore 2006-07 HES data uses 2006 population data. Also the population data are for residents of England whereas HES data are for activity in NHS Hospitals England and activity performed in the independent sector in England commissioned by English NHS.<br>
2. Assessing growth through time:<br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
3. Data quality:<br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
4. Finished admission episodes:<br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
5. The following admission methods were used to identify 'emergency hospital admissions:<br>
21 = Emergency: via Accident and Emergency (A and E) services, including the casualty department of the provider<br>
22 = Emergency: via general practitioner (GP)<br>
23 = Emergency: via Bed Bureau, including the Central Bureau<br>
24 = Emergency: via consultant outpatient clinic<br>
28 = Emergency: other means, including patients who arrive via the A and E department of another health care provider<br>

 In 2007-08, the performance of staff in the Department up to Grade 6 was assessed as Excellent, Good or Unsatisfactory. With a small number of assessments still to be confirmed, 10 staff were assessed as Unsatisfactory, representing 0.5 per cent. of the total. Performance arrangements for staff in the Senior Civil Service are common across all Departments. In 2007-08 there was no one in the Department whose performance was assessed as unacceptable.</p>

 The Department does not hold information on the number of prescriptions that are issued, only those that are issued and then dispensed.

 Universities, as autonomous bodies, are responsible for determining what policies should be in place to detect plagiarism and to decide appropriate disciplinary action. Universities also determine what advice should be provided to their students on plagiarism. The Quality Assurance Agency's code of practice, the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and the Higher Education Academy provide advice and guidance to universities on dealing with this issue. JISC includes on its Plagiarism Advisory Service website a list of well-known European and US essay bank websites, to make academics and teachers aware of these sites. Academics can use examples from these sites to demonstrate how essays used from such sources are often of poor quality and can be identified during their marking.</p>

 Government funding is focused on supporting people to gain the basic platform of skills for entering and progressing in sustained employment. This is reflected in the balance of responsibility between Government, learners and employers in meeting the costs of training with learners and employers contributing more to the costs where they see the greatest private returns.

 Human rights work is a key part of our engagement with China and we continue to commit considerable resources to it. As well as a number of officers working full-time on human rights and governance issues in London and the embassy in Beijing, human rights work features in the responsibilities of a large number of other officials at all levels, including the ambassador in Beijing and director Asia-Pacific in London. Project funding is reviewed annually and the amount we receive can vary from year to year. The FCO has recently approved &#163;660,000 of funding for new projects over the next three years under the Strategic Programme Fund Human Rights and Democracy Programme and additional bids will be considered.

 It is the longstanding policy of the UK, and the EU, to stand up for the internationally recognised principles to which so many Iranians aspire, including human rights, political freedoms and genuinely democratic, transparent and accountable government. We maintain contacts with a wide range of Iranians in many different fields (in and outside government) who work to support reform and the rule of law, including some connected to the Iranian student movement, which has historically been involved in the promotion of civil rights.</p>

In July five students were arrested in Mashhad for pursuing the cases of other detained students. The EU, with strong UK support, regularly raises concerns about human rights violations with the Iranian authorities. A recent EU demarche, delivered on 6 October, raised specific concerns about the increased pressure on Iranian students and the large number of arrests in recent months.</p>
