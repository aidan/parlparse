<p><a name="50207w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 We do not hold bovine TB surveillance data for individual constituencies. However TB data is available for Leicestershire. At the end of November 2004 there were 3,187 registered cattle herds in the county. Of these, 49 herds (1.5 per cent.) were under restriction at some point between 1 January and 30 November 2004. There were 36 new herd TB incidents during this period, of which 13 have been confirmed to date (three remain unclassified). TB surveillance data for Leicestershire is published each month on Defra&#039;s website at http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/stats/index.htm.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w01.html_para1">
The level of bovine TB in Leicestershire is low in comparison to some other areas of the country, e.g. South West England. We realise the importance of preventing the risk of TB spreading to new areas and that is why we introduced new measures at the end of 2004, e.g. changes to testing frequency and the imposition of movement restrictions immediately a test becomes overdue.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate

she has made of the savings to UK public funds of reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy since their introduction in 2003.  [213130]</p>




<p><a name="50207w01.html_spnew2"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The UK contributes to the EU budget as a whole rather than to individual elements, and it is not therefore possible to make precise estimates of savings to UK public funds following the reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy. However, increased financial discipline and setting the CAP budget until 2013 will limit the burden that the CAP places on taxpayers. Cross-compliance and modulation of direct payments into agri-environment schemes means that a greater proportion of public funds are now delivering better value for society by buying public goods not readily provided by the market. The Government will continue to press for further reforms which reduce the cost to taxpayers of the Common Agricultural Policy.

The position set out in the letter, regarding the management of under 10 vessels through producer organisations (POs), was changed following a review of the operation of the FQA system in consultation with industry in 2000&#150;02. As a result of that review Fisheries Departments decided that under 10 metre vessels should, for the first time, be permitted to fish against &quot;sectoral&quot; quota allocations managed by POs as an alternative to fishing against the &quot;pool&quot; quota allocations for the under 10 metre fleet which are managed by Fisheries Departments in consultation with industry. The owners of the small proportion of under 10 metre vessels who elect to fish against PO allocations are required to complete EU logbooks and submit landing declarations in the same way as vessels over 10 metres.

authorities about this shortly. We are encouraging them to actively promote understanding and greater use of national parks by all sections of society, especially people with disabilities, people from ethnic minorities, the inner cities and young people. We want our national parks to be appreciated fully by all sections of society as truly national assets. Defra and the Department for Education and Skills are working with national park authorities to develop initiatives to meet this aim. I also emphasised the Government&#039;s position on this policy of inclusion at a meeting with national park authorities on sustainable tourism in June 2003 so they have been aware of it for some time. I have also made clear that these ends can be achieved without excluding existing users groups and that we will encourage increased engagement of volunteers in meeting national park purposes.

National park authorities will also benefit from the findings of Defra&#039;s Diversity Review which is looking at what can be done to provide more opportunities for people who, for various reasons, have little experience of what the countryside has to offer. An action plan will be published next year. In addition, many park authorities were involved in the Mosaic Project set up by the Council for National Parks and the Black Environment Network in 2001 to enable people from black and ethnic minorities to experience the parks at first hand. The Council for National Parks recently secured lottery funding to develop this project further over the next three years.

 Our policy is to expand interest in national parks so that they are understood by all communities, as intended, as a genuinely natural asset. Initiatives like the Mosaic project have successfully engaged members of Asian and Black communities in the attractions of visiting several national parks, but there is a long way to go. From my own experience as a youth worker in Wales and from visits to English national parks in the past nine years, I can testify to the value and impact of such visits on inner city youngsters in particular.

</p>


<p>

Even with these additional resources the pressures on each national park is considerable.

 Actions to reduce exceedences of nitrogen dioxide, as those for many other air pollutants, are required at international, national and local level.

The Government has set out national policies to improve air quality in the Air Quality Strategy for England published in January 2000 and its Addendum published in February 2003. At local level the Government requires local authority to review and assess air quality locally and take actions (such as for example by using their traffic management powers) in cooperation with others if necessary, if they are unlikely to meet air quality objectives such as those for nitrogen dioxide; The Governments Air Quality Strategy and Guidance for Local Authority on Local Air Quality Management, including on local action planning, can be found at www.defra.gov.uk.

 In all its humanitarian responses, DFID works to ensure that the activities of the humanitarian community are informed by a solid analysis of the specific needs of the affected population. This requires assessment of and response to specific vulnerabilities and vulnerable groups, including women, orphans, the elderly, and, in the Asian context, the Dalit community, and indigenous people in the region. In addition, DFID humanitarian funding is often directly targeted at such groups. Following the Indian Ocean disaster, DFID has channelled &#163;400,000 through the Save the Children Fund and &#163;2,250,000 through the United Nations Children Fund to support orphans and other vulnerable children. The activities of the United Nations Children Fund are also targeted towards pregnant and lactating mothers. In addition, DFID has channelled &#163;483,054 through Help Age International.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w04.html_para0">
DFID is aware that social exclusion and discrimination on the grounds of gender, caste, ethnicity or religion constrain access to resources by some of the poorest people in Asia. DFID has made a public commitment in its Asia Director&#039;s Delivery Plan and Country Assistance Plans to ensuring that reduction of social exclusion is explicitly addressed in all its Asia programmes. DFID also regards the empowerment of women as an essential precondition for the elimination of poverty and the upholding of human rights.

DFID promotes an inclusive approach to ensure that no groups are excluded from mainstream programmes.

In 2003&#150;04, as part of its work to prepare the Country Plan, DFID reviewed its experience of working in Burma and consulted widely with colleagues including FCO, civil society groups inside and outside Burma, the National League for Democracy the UN and other donors. Some key lessons identified by this work included: the need to be realistic about what we seek to achieve; the importance of taking a long-term approach; that it can be possible to influence Government policy in certain areas; and that donors need to, and can, work better together in Burma to share lessons and experience to increase our impact.

<p><a name="50207w05.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The UK Government is Rwanda&#039;s major bilateral development partner. Our engagement with the Government of Rwanda is based on the UK/Rwanda Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The MoU describes the Government of Rwanda&#039;s commitments to the Rwandan people on poverty reduction, promoting regional stability, creating a democratic and inclusive state, and progressively securing human rights. The Government of Rwanda&#039;s undertakings include commitment to playing a full part in international and regional initiatives to prevent and reduce conflict within and between countries and establish peace in central Africa.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w05.html_para1">
The MoU confirms that the UK&#039;s engagement depends on continuing progress in these areas. Should we believe that the Government of Rwanda is not honouring the commitments made in the MoU, the UK&#039;s programme of assistance to the Government of Rwanda may be reconfigured or suspended.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w05.html_para2">
DFID is concerned by reports that Rwanda planned to mount a cross-border operation in DRC against elements of the ex-FAR and the Interahamwe (ex-FAR/l). Any military action by Rwanda in DRC would have very serious repercussions for Rwanda, DRC and the region as a whole. DFID has urged all parties to refrain from any actions that would breach international law and undermine regional stability and the work of the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC). We therefore welcome the recent statements by the Government of Rwanda indicating that they will not pursue cross-border military action and will support international efforts to disarm the ex-FAR/l in eastern DRC.

 DFID believes that the private sector can play a positive role and contribute to poverty alleviation through bringing gains in productivity, efficiency and quality of service delivery if its involvement is appropriately structured and regulated and includes mechanisms for public consultation.

 During my visit to Ghana in March 2004 I visited Nima, a deprived suburb of Accra, and talked to residents and officials of the Government of Ghana about the problems of poor urban water supply and plans to introduce private sector participation.

There is currently no legal requirement for these companies to offer a service to disabled people.

<p><a name="50207w07.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 A survey conducted by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in 2003 established that 75.2 per cent. of the address details held on its driving licence database were correct in every detail. The corresponding figure for its vehicle database was 85.6 per cent. The main cause of error was motorists&#039; failure to notify DVLA that they had changed address and 18 per cent. of driving licence holders and 7 per cent. of vehicle keepers had failed to do so. This means that DVLA&#039;s records were sufficiently up-to-date to allow law enforcement agencies to trace vehicle keepers in over 92 per cent. of cases.
</p>


<p>

Since then, DVLA has mounted a publicity campaign to encourage motorists to update their details. A further survey, to be conducted this year, will measure the effectiveness of that campaign.

 Since April 2001, all new construction work at schools has been subject to the Building Regulations. Projects will not be approved unless they are designed in accordance with the 2000 edition of Approved Document B (Fire Safety), which accompanies the regulations. The Building Regulations do not require the installation of fire sprinkler systems in new school accommodation but that does not mean that local education authorities are prohibited from specifying their use.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills for what reasons teachers accused of assaulting pupils are not granted anonymity.  [213552]</p>




<p><a name="50207w08.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 It is not appropriate to provide anonymity for people accused of crime for a number of reasons. The principle that criminal trials should take place in open court and be freely reported is one of the key foundations of our criminal justice system. The fact that the system is open and transparent, and that the media is able to report freely what has taken place publicly in court, helps ensure public confidence in the system and helps encourage victims and witnesses to come forward. Also anonymity would raise important principles of the freedom of the press and the public interest. Publicity can work to an accused person&#039;s advantage: by helping him or her gather support and bringing to light evidence in his or her behalf. Equally there have been examples of responsible investigative journalism bringing to light cases of serious abuse that might otherwise have gone undetected.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w08.html_para4">
However, someone who is under investigation by the police but who has not been charged with a criminal offence should not be identified in the press. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has issued revised guidance to all police forces, applying to all offences, which makes it clear that anyone under investigation, but not charged, should not be named, or details provided to the press which might lead to their identification before they are charged.

 Over the election period, insurgents and extremists continued in their efforts to destabilise the progress that is being made towards a stable and democratic Iraq. Despite this, elections took place successfully as planned, with initial indications of a high turn out and less violence than many anticipated. This reflects the thoroughness of the security arrangements put in place by the Iraqi Security Forces, the efforts of the Multi National Force-Iraq in support, and the determination of the Iraqi people to exercise their democratic rights.

 The United Kingdom takes very seriously the need to respect Iraq&#039;s cultural heritage. We are not aware of any assessments identifying damage done to sites of archaeological and historical significance by the British Army in Iraq. We have, however, taken a number of steps to minimise the risk. This includes being a signatory to the 1977 Additional Protocol (AP1) of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Under the terms of AP1, civilian objects are to be protected from attack unless that object is being used for military purposes, in which case it may lose its special protected status. An aide memoire is also issued to all UK service personnel deploying under Operation Telic, which reminds service personnel of their obligation under AP1. The leaflet contains a pictorial example of the protective emblem that can be used under the Hague Cultural Property Convention 1954, to which Iraq is a full signatory, to denote buildings used for religion, art, science, charity, historical monuments, or other important cultural sites. During the combat phase of Operation Telic, legal advisors briefed commanders deploying to theatre about the importance of protecting cultural property. Further guidance was, and continues to be available in the rules of engagement and the targeting directive.

 The Home Office is committed to ensuring that all citizens have equal access to justice. We recognise that public confidence in the Criminal Justice System is crucial to the delivery of fair and equitable justice. Ensuring that members of the public have confidence in the CJS will lead to more frequent reporting of crime and the greater likelihood of justice being done.
</p>

We are developing the infrastructure to ensure the effective delivery of new Public Sector Agreement (PSA) targets.

 The creation of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) offers a unique opportunity to sustain and expand existing voluntary sector work with offenders, while opening up the prospect of new areas for partnership and engagement with the voluntary and community sector. A new Voluntary Sector Unit has been established to provide a national lead and, will work closely with the recently appointed Regional Offender Managers, assisting them in being able to reach, support and work effectively with voluntary groups in their regions. The work of the Unit will be overseen by an independently chaired Advisory Group drawn from the voluntary sector, prisons and probation. A voluntary sector representative has been appointed to the NOMS Board, voluntary groups are included in the working group on Offender Management and proposals are being developed for a voluntary sector stakeholder group to help develop the mixed economy of provision for NOMS.

<p><a name="50207w18.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 The Department for Constitutional Affairs is the Government Department responsible for upholding justice, rights and democracy. The Department&#039;s aim is to provide for effective and accessible justice for all, to ensure the rights and responsibilities of the citizen, and to modernise the law and constitution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w18.html_para16">
Currently, the Department has six strategic objectives, which cover the delivery of justice, civil and administrative law, protecting the vulnerable, modernising the constitution, increasing consumer choice and working in partnership with the independent judiciary. The Department also has seven Public Service Agreement targets to help deliver its strategic objectives.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w18.html_para17">
Examples of the activity in 2004 to deliver these objectives include work with partners to make sure criminal trials are more efficient with the numbers of ineffective Crown Court trials falling from 24 per cent. in 2002&#150;03 to 16 per cent. in September 2004. The rate has reduced from 31 per cent. to 25 per cent. for the same period in the magistrates&#039; courts. The Department has also been involved in work to help people resolve their disputes in the most effective way, including pilots to test the effectiveness of court-based mediation. During 2004 there was a reduction from almost 49 per cent. to 41 per cent. in those cases that had eventually to be resolved by a hearing. Another area where pilots were used successfully was for all postal voting in four regions of England at the combined European and local elections in June 2004. Voter turnout doubled in the pilot regions compared with 1999.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w18.html_para18">
The range of the Department&#039;s policies and actions is wide and the statistical information relating to that activity is not collected on a constituency basis. Consequently, the information requested in the question cannot be provided except at a disproportionate cost. Statistical information about the Department&#039;s activities can be found at: http://www.dca.gov.uk/statistics/statfr.htm as well as at www.neighbourhood. statistics.gov.uk.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w18.html_para19">
An example of the information available on those sites is data on persistent young offenders. The average number of days from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders sentenced between August and October 2004 was 33 days in the Dyfed-Powys criminal justice area, which covers the constituency of Preseli Pembrokeshire. This compares with 124 days in the Dyfed-Powys criminal justice area in the 1997 calendar year.

[213120]</p>




<p><a name="50207w19.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Viggers </b> 
<i>[holding answer 1 February 2005]:</i> Under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 the Electoral Commission has a number of responsibilities relating to UK-wide referendums, referendums held in one or more of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and regional referendums in England. It does not have statutory responsibilities in relation to mayoral referendums or local issues referendums under the Local Government Act 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w19.html_para1">
I am informed that the Electoral Commission has issued no advice or guidance in respect of the combinations of elections and referendums listed in the question.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w19.html_para2">
The Commission has, however, on two occasions commented on suggestions for combining elections and referendums. In July 2002 the Electoral Commission issued a statement regarding the possibility of elections to the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales, and English local government elections, being combined with a referendum on the adoption of the single currency. In February 2004, it responded to the ODPM&#039;s consultation on combining regional and local referendums and on local referendum rules.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w19.html_para3">
On both occasions, the Commission expressed concerns about the possibility of combination, reflecting its view that on balance it is disadvantageous for elections to be combined with referendums. I understand that the reasons it advanced included concern that cross-party campaigning at the referendum could be confusing for the electorate.

 The Government announced in November 2002 a package of freedoms and flexibilities for local authorities which would be granted following Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA).

The LDA has gone beyond its statutory obligations by making sure that each business has already received an offer making clear what compensation would be payable in the event that they need to be relocated. This compensation offer ensures that every business with a compensatable interest will receive the market value of their property interest and will also receive payments in respect of costs incurred in relocating their business, including any loss of profits directly attributable to the relocation. All of these payments will be made as though the property had been compulsorily acquired, even though no compulsory purchase order is currently in place and there is no obligation to offer compensation on this basis.

The Common Position is re-evaluated annually. The UK and all other member states are committed to maintaining the Common Position as the basis for the EU&#039;s policy towards Cuba.

Notes:<br>

1. The prescription information is from the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) system, from the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA), and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispenses in the community, ie by community pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospitals, including mental health trusts, or private prescriptions.<br>

2. The average number of blood glucose monitoring strips per PCT has been calculated by dividing the total number of strips by 303 (the number of PCTs). It is not a weighted average and hence does not take into account PCT populations, or number of registered patients per PCT. PCTs came into existence in October 2002. For consistency, the average number of strips per PCT has used the current 303 PCTs for all five years.<br>

<p><a name="50207w33.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The majority of dental practices treat both private and national health service patients under an &quot;open&quot; contract with a primary care trust. The Office of Fair Trading report &quot;The private dentistry market in the UK&quot;, published in March 2003 estimated that out of 11,000 dental practices about 210 are private. The table shows by London constituency the numbers of dentists who stopped doing general or personal dental service work in England and Wales during the year as a percentage of the total number of dentists for the years 1997 to 2004. These figures do not include dentists who moved to other areas and continued to work in the general or personal dental services. The dentists could have ceased doing NHS work for a number of different reasons, for example, retirement or to take a short-term absence, apart from the reason that the dentist only wished to treat private patients. New contractual arrangements, which we are to introduce by April 2006, are intended to make NHS dentistry more attractive to dentists.

 Information on the dossiers for ingredients not listed in the food supplements directive (FSD), and which can continue to be used in supplements on sale in the United Kingdom after 1 August, will be available on the European Food Safety Authority and Food Standards Agency (FSA) websites. The FSA will, in addition, provide information on the ingredients listed in the FSD and on the scope of the directive. It is the responsibility of food supplements manufacturers to ensure that the products on sale after 1 August meet the requirements of the FSD and to decide what information is available to consumers on the products on sale. Manufacturers have had three years in which to produce dossiers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w34.html_para1">
No assessment has been made by the FSA of which supplements will be banned or reformulated under the FSD. The number of supplements which will be banned or need to be reformulated under the FSD will be dependent on the number of dossiers submitted by industry for assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Where a dossier for a particular ingredient has been submitted to either the UK or another European Union member state then that ingredient will be able to continue to be used in food supplements until December 2009 pending an opinion from EFSA on its use beyond 2009.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w34.html_para2">
An assessment of the economic impact of the Food Supplement Regulations was made in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) which accompanied the regulations. Article 4(8) of the FSD states that, no later than 12 July 2007, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report on whether the directive should be amended to increase its scope to include other nutrients as well as vitamins and minerals. This will also include a proposal for any amendments to the directive that the Commission deems necessary. The FSA will provide any information requested from member states by the Commission to inform this report.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w34.html_para3">
The directive does not at present set limits for the levels of vitamins, which can be used in food supplements. High doses of vitamins, which are listed in annex one of the directive, can continue to be used after 1 August when the directive comes into effect.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w34.html_para4">
The list of supplements in annexes 1 and 2 of the FSD has not been altered since the directive was agreed in July 2002. There is no reason to assume the list would be reduced unless new evidence came to light which raised questions regarding the safety of the vitamins and minerals listed.

 The Government asked the NHS Confederation to consider this issue, as part of a study into the terms and conditions of non-consultant career grade doctors, and to make recommendations.

<i>[holding answer 3 February 2005]:</i> The Department routinely monitors the performance of the national health service against the NHS Plan target for primary care access.

<p><a name="50207w36.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s modernisation of the national health service, underpinned by a sustained investment programme, is delivering more staff, faster treatment, more hospitals, a new focus on quality and, crucially, more choice for patients. Coupled with an increase in the NHS budget from &#163;43.9 billion in 2000&#150;01 to &#163;69 billion in 2004&#150;05 has come an increased devolution of power and responsibility to the front line NHS: 80 per cent. of the NHS budget in England is now devolved to local primary care trusts (PCTs), and central targets have been dramatically reduced to give the local NHS in rural and urban areas alike the headroom to address local priorities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w36.html_para3">
The Government have therefore given PCTs in rural areas the resources and the authority to make a difference locally and address rural needs. At the national level the Department is committed to rural proofing policies so that they take into account the needs of people living in rural areas. To further support the rural proofing agenda, last year the Government incorporated the rural proofing checklist within the regulatory impact assessment framework, thus ensuring that new policies are screened for their impact on rural communities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w36.html_para4">
The Department also supports rural health initiatives through grants to the voluntary sector. The Department has funded the Institute of Rural Health since 2001. The Institute is currently working on two projects (i) the rural health forum project which provides a regular interface between Government Departments and health providers at national, regional and local levels, and (ii) a rural proofing toolkit which will help PCTs and policy makers identify the health needs of residents in rural areas and help incorporate those needs into policy making at a strategic level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w36.html_para5">
The Department has also taken specific actions to help patients living with stress and mental health problems in rural areas. The National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) in implementing the national suicide prevention strategy is providing specific support for farmers and their families. We are also part funding a network of support for people in rural communities who are suffering from stress.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the medium secure units for people with dangerous and severe personality disorders operating in England; and how many inmates have escaped or absconded from each in each of the last five years.  [210784]</p>




<p><a name="50207w37.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The Arnold Lodge in Leicester is the only medium secure unit that currently takes patients with a dangerous and severe personality disorder (DSPD). The unit has a personality disorder unit (PDU) that has 12 beds. Of these, five are available for patients with a diagnosis of DSPD.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w37.html_para0">
From the DSPD beds, no patients have absconded. From the personality disorder beds, two patients have failed to return from leave.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w37.html_para1">
When a decision is taken to send a patient on leave, a detailed risk assessment is carried out beforehand. This details the potential risks involved should a patient abscond and a plan is in place to deal with these risks should it happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w37.html_para2">
Once a patient is known to have absconded, the local police are informed and any people who from the risk assessment have been identified as being vulnerable. On call arrangements are put in place and local, regional and national briefing if required takes place.

<p>
<a name="50207w37.html_para3">
In both the cases of absconcion from the PD unit at Arnold Lodge, both patients were returned to the unit within five to six hours. In the first case, the patient returned to the unit himself, in the second case, the patient missed a train back and presented to a police station and asked to be returned to Arnold Lodge.

<p><a name="50207w37.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The training and development of nurses to fit them to hold specialist posts is a matter for employers locally. The cost of training may vary according to specialism and the type of training or development involved and will be identified by employers in conjunction with educational commissioners and higher education institutions. There is no separate central budget.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what recent assessment has been made of the safety of the medium used to preserve embryonic stem cells.  [213450]</p>




<p><a name="50207w37.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 To date, most human embryonic stem cell lines have been cultured for laboratory research using nutritional support from animal cells. It is therefore not surprising that a recent United States study has demonstrated that many of the human embryonic stem cell lines, which can be used in federally-funded research in the US, are contaminated with a molecule from animal cells. As with any contaminated therapeutic product, these cells could never be used for clinical applications.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w37.html_para4">
Unlike the situation in the US, United Kingdom legislation permits the generation of new embryonic stem cell lines. UK researchers are well aware of the problem of animal contamination and are actively working on developing new embryonic stem cell lines, which have been grown without using animal products.

<p><a name="50207w37.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 Direct Payment into an account is the normal method of payment for benefits and pensions and will be the best option for the overwhelming majority of our customers, giving them a more modern and reliable method of payment, with greater choice about where and when they collect their money. Using a bank account also helps jobseekers show employers that they are job ready.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50207w37.html_para6">
The Department has always recognised that some customers will be unable to be paid in this way and the cheque payment was developed for the small minority of customers who cannot manage Direct Payment.

We are continuing to contact existing customers to invite them to provide account details. However at the end of this process customers, including those of working age, who have not provided account details, will be paid by cheque if possible after we have verified their address and confirmed there is no doubt about ongoing entitlement.

Research was commissioned to establish the general levels of awareness of council tax benefit and to identify the effect of the publicity campaign. The research was conducted at both pre and post stages of the publicity activity. Overall, the research suggested that this activity had a positive effect in raising levels of awareness among our primary target audience of pensioners. Those respondents aged 65 plus were more likely than other age groups to have seen or heard something about paying less council tax, and this increased from 19 per cent. at the pre-publicity stage to 29 per cent. at the post-publicity stage.

<p>
<a name="50207w38.html_para14">
In a recent survey, over 90 per cent. of authorities that responded said that they had introduced initiatives that overlapped with, or were as a result of, the council tax benefit campaign. And around two thirds of authorities said that this had resulted in an overall increase in case load.
