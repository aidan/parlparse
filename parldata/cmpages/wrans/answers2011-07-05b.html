               <i>[holding answer 4 July 2011]:</i> I confirm that there is a long standing history of representation from UK angling interests to increase the current minimum landing size (MLS) for sea bass, to achieve a better match to the size at which bass reach sexual maturity. A significant proportion of the commercial bass fishery, however, features vessels using trawled gear in a mixed fishery, which means the issue of raising the MLS is complex. To prevent a large increase in discards of bass in commercial fisheries using the most commonly applied mesh size range, the vessels would need to alter their fishing gear design or fishing practices to avoid catching or retaining under-sized bass.</p>

 Communities can put pressure on their public authorities to maintain appropriate standards of care for local authority owned heritage buildings, or where the conditions are right they can seek to have ownership of buildings transferred to them so they can take direct responsibility. English Heritage has produced guidance on both looking after local authority assets—‘Managing Local Authority Heritage Assets: some guiding principles for decision-makers’ and transferring assets into community ownership—‘Pillars of the Community’.</p>

We are also working to make the DRC a safer place for women through a police reform programme which aims to improve the police response to gender violence. The project is being piloted in three provinces and aims to achieve a 30% increase over the next two years in the proportion of women who report feeling safe. The UK Government are also working with the UN peace support mission (MONUSCO) and the Government of the DRC to step up efforts through the security services and justice system to protect women and to end impunity.</p>

 The contribution of new drugs and technologies on the levels of tuberculosis (TB) in developing countries could be significant, but there are limitations. While most TB patients can be cured with present drug regimens, the 2050 elimination target is far more likely to be achieved with a combination of improved diagnostics, drugs and vaccines that can detect and treat both latent TB infection and active disease. Recent modelling for the WHO has suggested that a combination of a neonatal pre-exposure TB vaccine, a two-month treatment regimen effective against drug-susceptible and resistant strains of TB, and a novel point-of-care diagnostic test could potentially reduce the incidence of TB by 71%. There are, however, questions remaining about the effect of these in high HIV prevalent areas.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) is supporting a number of product development partnerships to encourage industrial development of new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines for tuberculosis. This includes support to the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND); the Global Alliance for TB Drugs; and the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation. These initiatives are making progress. For instance, FIND has helped develop a new diagnostic for rapid detection of TB ('GenXpert'). This may help shorten the time to diagnosis and cut transmission, thus preventing new cases in future. FIND are also working on how they can adapt these tools for use in more peripheral settings.</p>

 The African Union High Level Implementation Panel facilitated talks in Addis Ababa have resulted in framework agreements on Southern Kordofan, Abyei and border monitoring. I commend the parties for coming together and setting this first milestone. However, much more needs to be done. The Framework Agreement on Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile provides for the completion of the popular consultation process that formed a part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. However, for civilians to take part in consultations and talks on their own future, they must have freedom of movement and speech so they can participate fully and freely.

 Recent reports suggest that violence is continuing in many parts of Southern Kordofan. There are reports of aerial attacks by Sudanese armed forces; of abuses against civilians carried out by soldiers from both sides and of civilians being caught up in the violence. The UK condemns the ongoing violence and calls all parties to cease hostilities immediately. The recent framework agreement on Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile is a step in the right direction but must lead to a ceasefire without delay, so that humanitarian aid can reach those in need, and talks on the future of Southern Kordofan can take place without continuing violence.</p>

 The EU restrictive measures impose an asset freeze and travel ban on 30 individuals (including President Assad) and an asset freeze on four entities. They are targeted against those persons responsible for violence and repression against the civilian population in Syria, and their associates. The EU measures also include an arms embargo and restrictions on the supply of equipment which might be used for internal repression. We judge that the sanctions have been effective in targeting key members of the Syrian regime and their associates. These measures will continue to apply so long as the individuals and entities listed continue to meet the criteria.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 30 June 2011]:</i> The purpose of penalties is to encourage taxpayers to meet their obligations and to reassure those who do comply that they will not be disadvantaged by those who do not. If a taxpayer is unable to meet an obligation, such as filing a return by the due date, because of circumstances beyond his control, he can ask HMRC to accept that he has a reasonable excuse for the failure and cancel the penalty.</p>

These plans include consideration of possible wide application of reasonable excuse, if something happens of such seriousness and on such a scale that a large number of taxpayers are prevented from filing their returns on time when they otherwise would have done.</p>

There are currently 25 priority areas, which includes Leicester, and these each receive dedicated resources and support.

               <i>[holding answer 4 July 2011]:</i>The British Crime survey (BCS) provides estimates on the proportion of domestic violence incidents reported to the police. The survey has two measures: one collected in the context of a face-to-face interview and a second based on answers to a self-completion questionnaire.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_460"> 
               <a name="110705w0002.htm_para24"> 
               <a name="11070589000109"> The measure of domestic violence included in the main BCS relates to any physical assault by a partner or ex-partner, relative or household member. The most recently published figure from the 2009-10 BCS shows that 41% of such incidents were reported to the police. It is known that incidents of domestic violence are under-estimated as some victims may not be willing to disclose their victimisation in the context of a face-to-face interview.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_461"> 
               <a name="110705w0002.htm_para25"> 
               <a name="11070589000110"> The self-completion module provides more privacy to respondents and is thought to yield greater disclosure by victims. The self-completion section provides a measure of “partner abuse” which is broader and covers physical force, non-physical emotional or financial abuse or threats to hurt the respondent or someone close to them carried out by a current or former partner. The latest estimate from the 2008-09 BCS, shows that 16% of victims of partner abuse reported the incident to the police.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_462"> 
               <a name="110705w0002.htm_para26"> 
               <a name="11070589000111"> This reporting figure is lower that that for the main domestic violence measure and is thought to partly reflect the wider measure of abuse that it includes. It may also be that victims who are willing to disclose victimisation to an interviewer are more likely to report incidents to the police.</p>

When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.

 The Government response to the “Fire Futures Report”, published on 12 April 2011, recognised that the provision of high quality training and development for fire and rescue service staff was vital to ensure that the service could respond effectively to the needs of their local communities and to major incidents.</p>

               <a name="11070599000229"> The response also acknowledged the strong value of a national college for fire and rescue service training, but explained that we believed that the Fire Service College could achieve its full potential only if there was greater involvement from other sectors (whether private, public or voluntary) in its ownership, operation and governance. We therefore undertook to explore with the sector and other organisations options to secure the future of the college.</p>

Outsourcing the provision of capital equipment can be one such way, provided the precise terms and conditions of the contract represent value for money in the long-term. The terms of these contracts, and the implications of any service failure, are a matter for the individual fire and rescue authorities themselves. Contact has been made with London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue Authority regarding AssetCo, and reassurance obtained that they are able to meet their statutory duties and ensure a continued service to the public irrespective of AssetCo's particular financial circumstances.</p>

 Firebuy Ltd, which helped deliver procurement efficiencies and collaboration for local fire and rescue authorities in England through nationally negotiated contracts, is closing in summer 2011 as part of the Government review of arm’s length bodies. It was not a function that needed to be undertaken by central Government.</p>

               <a name="11070599000336"> All of Firebuy's procurement functions have been transferred to alternative organisations. The 17 framework contracts were formally novated to Wiltshire county council with The Consortium for Purchasing and Distribution Ltd managing these on Wiltshire's behalf. This ensures that there is continuity of the existing arrangements. Fire and rescue authorities have been encouraged to continue to use these contracts to maintain the benefits of collaborative procurement though procurement is a matter for them to decide on based on their operational requirements.</p>

The new headcount methodology for 2010 data is not fully comparable with previous years' data due to improvements that make it a more stringent count of absolute staff numbers.

<i>Data Quality:</i>
The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses.

 “Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer” sets out our commitment to expand radiotherapy capacity by investing over £150 million in additional funding over the next four years. This additional funding was included in the financial settlement for the spending review period 2011-12 to 2014-15 and will be included in primary care trust (PCT) baseline allocations, alongside the existing funding for radiotherapy.</p>

Funding for specific services is not identified at PCT-level, it is for PCTs to decide how to use their funding to commission services, including radiotherapy services, to meet the healthcare needs of their local populations, taking account of local and national priorities. We have said we will investigate the potential development of a range of tariffs to incentivise high quality, cost-effective services, including the newest radiotherapy techniques, once the standard radiotherapy tariff has been introduced. It is anticipated that a national currency for radiotherapy will be introduced for contracting in April 2012, with prices agreed locally. Feedback from the service on the use of these currencies will inform decisions on when it would be appropriate to introduce a mandatory national tariff, which is likely to be no earlier than 2013-14.</p>

 This information is not available. We do not plan for the number of students at an institutional level.

We expect the total number of places on all courses in 2011/12 to be broadly similar to 2010/11.

 No such assessment has been undertaken. The Government are committed to the principle, which is underpinned in law, that decisions about admission to university are a matter for individual universities, and not for Government. The Office for Fair Access will ensure that universities wanting to charge over £6,000 for any of its courses will promote access to higher education for students from under-represented backgrounds. Students from outside the EU are not in competition for places with British students. Their places are in addition to the funded places available to home and EU students.</p>

 All prisoner transfer agreements (PTA) to which the United Kingdom is a signatory require the agreement of the other jurisdiction before a transfer is effected.

 The Ministry of Justice holds statistical information in relation to the numbers of mortgage and landlord possession claims which led to an order being made for all properties in each county court. These figures represent the numbers of claims leading to orders being made rather than the numbers of orders as they are more accurate, removing the double-counting of instances where a single claim leads to more than one order. They also provide a more meaningful measure of the number of homeowners who are subject to court repossession actions. The tables showing these figures by month from April 2009 to March 2011, the latest period for which figures are available, will be placed in the House Library.</p>

 The Criminal Injuries Compensation scheme (the scheme), which is set by Parliament, compensates people based on the injuries they sustain not the crime of which they were a victim. The ‘tariff of injuries’, which is the part of the scheme that assigns specific injuries standard amounts of compensation, contains several injury descriptions that could apply to people who have been sexually assaulted, a subset of which are most likely to apply to victims of rape. The figures CICA are able to produce, which follow, are therefore based on claims where they paid awards for these injury descriptions.</p>
