<a name="01219w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Shaw: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the training being provided for the Sierra Leone Army.  [143683]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01219w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The training is going well, and trainees completed the fourth short-term training team course on 15 December. Soldiers from 2 Royal Gurkha Rifles have now deployed to run the next course, taking over from 1st Prince of Wales Own Regiment. They will be deploying with additional trainers to conduct the continuation and refresher training that we announced in October.
<P>

<a name="01219w01.html_para0">In addition, we are making preparations for the short-term deployment of a surgical team to Sierra Leone to cover the possibility of a gap in medical cover due to the roulement of UN troops. We would hope to be able to continue to draw on the medical facilities provided by UNAMSIL, for whose support we are most grateful, but it is essential to ensure that emergency cover is in place. The team will be withdrawn as soon as possible once alternative arrangements are available.
<P>

<a name="01219w01.html_para1">Together, these deployments will mean an increase in UK forces on the ground in Sierra Leone to between 550 and 600.

<a name="01219w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence for what reason four Upholder class nuclear- powered submarines were removed from active service between 1994 and 1995; what plans he has for these submarines; and if he will make a statement.  [142172]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01219w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer Lord Robertson, the then Secretary of State for Defence, gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey) on 6 April 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 56W, and to my answers to the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock) on 23 October 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, 



<P>
<P><I>19 Dec 2000 : Column: 90W</I><P>
column 30W, and the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) on 31 October 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 341W. The decision to dispose of the four Upholder class conventionally powered (diesel-electric) submarines was taken in 1993, following a reassessment of strategic requirements after the end of the cold war.
<P>

<a name="01219w01.html_para2">After an extensive marketing campaign an agreement was reached with Canada in the form of an eight-year lease with an option of outright purchase. The submarines will be refurbished (reactivated) prior to handover to Canada.
<P>

<a name="01219w01.html_para3">The first of the submarines was handed over to Canada on 6 October 2000 and the remaining submarines will follow over the next 18 months.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list in each of the past 12 months to 30 November the movements of private commercial aircraft at the DERA Boscombe Down airfield by <i>(a)</i> date, <i>(b)</i> type of aircraft, <i>(c)</i> owner, <i>(d)</i> operator, <i>(e)</i> origin of flight, <i>(f)</i> destination of flight, <i>(g)</i> number of passengers, <i>(h)</i> attendance of HM Customs and Excise, <i>(i)</i> attendance of Home Office Immigration and Nationality officials, <i>(j)</i> airport charges levied and <i>(k)</i> national airport taxes levied.

 <i>[holding answer 12 December 2000]:</i> This is a matter for the Chief Executive of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency. I have asked the Chief Executive to write to the hon. Member.
<P>

<a name="01219w01.html_para4"><i>Letter from John Chisholm to Mr. Robert Key, dated 19 December 2000:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary question about the movements of private commercial aircraft at the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) airfield at Boscombe Down.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The information that you requested, such that we are able to provide, is detailed in the attachment to this letter. We have not included civil aircraft using the airfield on MOD business since charges are not levied on these. Neither have private aircraft using the airfield for leisure or sporting purposes, such as those of the Boscombe Down based flying club, been included. We do not have information on the owners of aircraft, only their operators. The information on numbers of passengers is somewhat incomplete since we are only required to keep this information for six months. Customs and immigration tasks are undertaken on behalf of the authorities by designated DERA Boscombe Down staff on the understanding that the appropriate authorities are notified in advance of air movements. Airport charges are levied in accordance with Ministry of Defence instructions. There is no requirement to levy a national airport tax.</FONT></UL>

 The Merlin HM Mk1 achieved its defined In-Service Date in March 1999 on delivery of the twelfth aircraft. Production continues and deliveries are scheduled until March 2002 when aircraft number 44 is due.
<P>

<a name="01219w02.html_para0">Following the recent accident involving a Royal Navy Merlin Mk 1, military flying of Merlin was suspended pending the results of the accident investigation and Board of Inquiry (BOI).
<P>

<a name="01219w02.html_para1">A combined Ministry of Defence and industry review team has completed a thorough analysis of airworthiness and recommended an early resumption of flying, subject to the successful completion of the current programme of checks and inspections. A phased resumption of flying is expected to commence this week once individual aircraft are cleared for flight through a process of physical and documentary checks.
<P>

<a name="01219w02.html_para2">The temporary suspension of flying activities has delayed the achievement of the required training flying rate and introduced a six week delay to the aircraft clearances issued by the Defence Evaluation Research Agency (Boscombe Down). Both delays are at present manageable.

Mk 1, the official handover ceremony at RAF Benson that was planned for November 2000 has been postponed and will not rescheduled until the resumption of military flying. However, it is currently assessed that the Merlin Mk 3 will enter operational service with a basic military capability in June 2002, as planned.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if the Merlin helicopter can provide sufficient sea-to-land lift capability for future amphibious operations.  [143333]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01219w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Royal Navy's Merlin Mk 1 aircraft is primarily an organic Anti-Submarine Warfare variant of the Anglo-Italian EH101 helicopter. Although it offers some lift capability, it is unlikely to be tasked for amphibious operations. The Mk 3 aircraft, designed to carry troops or a range of vehicles or underslung loads, will provide a major element of the Joint Helicopter Command's support helicopter capability. However, it is designed for use in battlefield, and not amphibious, operations. The UK's current amphibious lift capability is provided by the Sea King Mk 4, with occasional support from the RAF Chinook Mks 2 and 2A, while a small-scale lift capability is provided by the maritime Lynx Mks 3 and 8.

 We recognise that it can be difficult accurately to assess the needs of people with mental health problems, and that for some of these people the process of claiming itself can be difficult to understand and stressful. That is why people claiming Disability Living Allowance (DLA) are given six weeks to return the claim form to the Benefits Agency. Claimants with mental health problems are also encouraged to ask others, for example their carer or Community Psychiatric Nurse, for help in completing the claim form or to add comments on their behalf. In DLA/Attendance Allowance (AA), as with all benefits, claimants who are not able to manage their own affairs can have someone appointed to act on their behalf.
<P>

<a name="01219w03.html_para1">When gathering information to assess a claim for DLA, decision-making staff are encouraged to contact Community Psychiatric Nurses or other healthcare professionals who may have a good understanding of an individual's personal care and support arising from their mental health problems. As part of the Disability Benefits Modernisation programme we are always considering improvements in the taking of DLA/AA claims to provide all claimants, including those with mental health problems, with the necessary support to ensure they receive their correct entitlement.
<P>

<a name="01219w03.html_para2">Following recommendations from the Social Security Select Committee, we are looking at the possibility of assessing entitlement to DLA and AA in a different way--using a set of daily activities undertaken by disabled people in managing their lives as a means of assessing need. We are looking for an approach which would be more transparent, easier for disabled people to understand and could be administered with greater consistency. Clearly, we would not wish to make such a major change without clear evidence that it would lead to better assessments. Any changes would be made only after their impact on disabled people, including those with mental disabilities, had been thoroughly tested and

 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report was published today in respect of the London Borough of Waltham Forest and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01219w03.html_para4">The report provides recommendations aimed at helping the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="01219w03.html_para5">Inspectors found that Waltham Forest had clear aims to provide high quality benefit service, but this aim is not always being met. Waltham Forest had contracted out benefits administration in 1999. Since then, a backlog of work had developed on a number of occasions which meant that the requirement to process benefit claims within 14 days is not now being met and there are frequent breaks in payment.




<P>
<P><I>19 Dec 2000 : Column: 98W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01219w03.html_para6">Weaknesses were also found in the verification of information and the testing of the accuracy and quality of the work being done. The report notes that while there were some good counter fraud practices in place, this good work is undermined by a failure properly to establish fraud, resulting in weekly benefit savings being incorrectly claimed.

 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate (BFI) report was published today in respect of the London Borough of Newham and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01219w03.html_para9">The report provides recommendations aimed at helping the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="01219w03.html_para10">Inspectors found that Newham had some good working practices, but the efficiency, responsiveness and security of the benefits system was compromised by a substantial backlog of work and lengthy delays. The report notes that after Newham contracted out the benefits administration in 1999, customer dissatisfaction increased sharply, remedial expenditure outweighed any savings that might have been made, and benefits work fell badly into arrears. These arrears caused further deterioration of Newham's service and prompted it to defer the introduction of the Verification Framework, leaving it at greater risk of making incorrect benefit payments.
<P>

<a name="01219w03.html_para11">Inspectors found the lack of a counter fraud manager in the past and an ineffective prosecution policy have limited Newham's counter fraud work. BFI notes Newham's fraud investigations were poor and needed considerable improvement in the preparation and quality of work undertaken.
<P>

<a name="01219w03.html_para12">The report notes that Newham is keenly aware of the deficiencies in the current benefits operation and has recently introduced significant improvement programmes. It has had some success working with the contractor to clear backlogs and address inefficiencies and has developed an action plan to tackle the weaknesses in countering fraud.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01219w03.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate (BFI) report was published today in respect of the Leeds City Council and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01219w03.html_para14">The report provides recommendations aimed at helping the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="01219w03.html_para15">Inspectors report that there is no doubting Leeds' desire to provide a good service to benefit claimants and at the time of the inspection the council was processing new claims quickly, an important component of the quality of service available to claimants. The council has, to its credit, implemented the Verification Framework; however, inspectors found that there were weaknesses in verification and consider that the council could strike a better balance between clearance rates and the need to verify claims.
<P>

<a name="01219w03.html_para16">Although Leeds has implemented the Verification Framework (VF), Inspectors found there were weaknesses in verification. At the time of inspection, Leeds processed new claims quickly, which contributed significantly to the quality of service offered to claimants. Nonetheless, inspectors considered that the council could strike a better balance between clearance rates and the need to verify claims.
<P>

<a name="01219w03.html_para17">Inspectors found that Leeds makes effective use of management information to manage the workload, resulting in no significant arrears of new claims. However, the report notes that the council did not renew any claims for most of 1999 as it was changing its IT system to support the implementation of VF. This created significant backlogs, contravened regulations and has potential subsidy implications for the authority.
<P>

<a name="01219w03.html_para18">The BFI notes the council's commitment to tackling fraud but reports that the standard of fraud investigations is inadequate, with most investigations only scratching the surface. The report recommends that Leeds should improve the quality of its investigative work and develop a corporate counter fraud policy and strategy.

 Pension entitlement is determined when a claim is made at state pension age. An individual's contributions do not constitute a personal fund either for themselves or a spouse. The rules on remarriage do not, therefore, cause disadvantage.

 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2000]:</i> As I announced in the House on 15 November 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1029, we have allocated an annual injection of &#163;54 million to cover the additional cost of the guaranteed half-fare concessionary travel scheme under the Transport Act 2000. I confirm that that amount was included within the lower tier of the Environmental Protection & Cultural Services block in the Standard Spending Assessment, and has been taken into account in the calculation of Revenue Support Grant to individual local authorities in the settlement announced on 27 November 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 648-62.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many outstanding planning applications there are in England and Wales for base station masts for mobile telephony; how many are in <i>(a)</i> areas of outstanding natural beauty, <i>(b)</i> national parks and <i>(c)</i> national forests; and how many applications have been given consent in the last (1) three months and (2) six months.  [142728]<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received from health and other academic experts about the distance between <i>(a)</i> settlements and <i>(b)</i> dwellings and the location of a base station mast for mobile telephony.  [142563]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01219w08.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 In response to public concern about the possibility of health effects from mobile phone base stations, the Government set up the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (chaired by Sir William Stewart). The Group considered health effects from the use of mobile phones, base stations and transmitters. In carrying out the review, the Group gathered a wide range of views and a call for evidence was placed in the national daily newspapers and the scientific press. A comprehensive review of relevant research was carried out as part of the review and this helped to inform the Group's conclusions and recommendations. The Group published its report on mobile phones and health on 11 May 2000.
<P>

<a name="01219w08.html_para0">The Group's report, which took into account evidence from health and other academic experts, recommended the establishment of clearly defined physical exclusion zones around base station antennas, which delineate areas within which exposure guidelines may be exceeded. Operators have a duty under the Health and Safety legislation to ensure that their work activities, which includes the 



<P>
<P><I>19 Dec 2000 : Column: 116W</I><P>
operation of their apparatus, do not present a risk to employees and the general public. The Health and Safety Executive would therefore expect operators to have measures in place to prevent access by members of the public to areas where they might exceed exposure guidelines. The report did not recommend the introduction of a minimum distance between masts and settlements or dwellings.

<P>
<a name="01219w08.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Organ: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on planning and safety guidelines for the siting of base station masts for mobile telephony.  [142568]<P>

<P>

 Telecommunications operators have a duty under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 and the Management of the Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 to ensure that so far as is reasonably practicable, their work activities--which would include the installation and operation of their equipment--do not expose people to risks to their health and safety.
<P>

<a name="01219w08.html_para1">The Government's statutory adviser, the National Radiological Protection Board, has published guidelines on limiting exposure to electromagnetic radiation. All mobile phone transmission equipment should meet these guidelines. Following publication of the Stewart report on mobile phones and health in May 2000, the Government accepted that, as a precautionary measure, the emissions from mobile phone base stations should meet the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines for public exposure as expressed in the EU Council Recommendation of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0 Hz to 300GHz). Most base stations already meet the ICNIRP guidelines and all new base stations will do so.

<a name="01219w08.html_para2">Health considerations and public concern can in principle be material considerations in determining applications for planning permission and prior approval. Whether such matters are material in a particular case is ultimately a matter for the courts. It is for the decision-maker (usually the local planning authority) to determine what weight to attach to such considerations in any particular case. However, it is the Government's view that if a proposed development meets the ICNIRP guidelines it should not be necessary for an authority, in processing an application, to consider health effects further.

 The industry is working hard to achieve a steady improvement in rail services across all parts of the country. Railtrack estimate that nationally by the end of January 85 per cent. of journeys will be back to normal, with a tail end of work through to Easter by when all services should be fully back to normal. The Rail Recovery Action Group, chaired by the Minister for Transport, has been formed to help to get services back to normal as soon as possible.

 DVLA will take action against VED evaders in increasing numbers. In addition to offering out of court settlements and prosecutions the Agency will induce increasing numbers of evaders to relicense voluntarily through publicity campaigns.
<P>

<a name="01219w08.html_para4">Recent initiatives include the introduction of a scheme to wheelclamp and impound unlicensed vehicles. Over the past three years the scheme has encouraged over 325,000 motorists voluntarily to relicense bringing in some &#163;38 million in additional revenue.
<P>

<a name="01219w08.html_para5">Motorists are now required to notify DVLA if their vehicle is taken off the road unlicensed under the statutory off road notification scheme.

 A roadside survey conducted by departmental statisticians in June 1999 estimated that 1.5 million vehicles were evading vehicle duty (VED) in GB. The level of evasion was calculated at 3.9 per cent. of revenue due, equivalent to a loss of &#163;183 million in the current financial year. The 1999 survey indicated a drop in the VED evasion level for the first time and represents a saving of &#163;17 million a year from the previous estimate of 4.1 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01219w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 On Wednesday 13 December the Divisional Court gave judgment on four test cases brought in relation to the compatibility of certain aspects of domestic legislation with Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) concerning the right to a fair hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal. The Convention right was incorporated into UK legislation in the Human Rights Act 1998, which became operative in England and Wales on 2 October this year.
<P>

<a name="01219w09.html_para0">The legal challenges related to cases involving the Secretary of State's ability under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to call in and determine applications for planning permission and to recover and determine appeals, the confirmation by him of Compulsory Purchase Orders and related Orders under the Highways Act 1980 made by one of his departmental agencies and the making of orders under the Transport and Works Act 1992.
<P>

<a name="01219w09.html_para1">The Court concluded that the processes involved in each of the cases were not compatible with Article 6(1) of the ECHR. In particular, the Court concluded that:

<a name="01219w09.html_para5">Application was made, and the Court granted, leave for appeal to the Court of Appeal. The question whether an application can be made for the cases to be referred direct to the House of Lords is still under consideration by the Court. If the cases can be referred direct to the Lords, an application will be made for expedition.
<P>

<a name="01219w09.html_para6">The Court will make a "declaration of incompatibility" under section 4 of the Human Rights Act that the provisions of the relevant primary legislation are not compatible with a Convention right. However, such a declaration does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the provision in respect of which it was given (section 4 (6) HRA). If the decision of the High Court is upheld on appeal, the Government will have to decide how to deal with this incompatibility. In the meantime, the existing primary legislation continues to apply and the Secretary of State has a duty to continue determining cases which have been called-in and appeals that have been recovered, and to fulfil his statutory functions in relation to orders made, for example, under the Transport and Works and Highways Acts and under Compulsory Purchase legislation. He will

continue to exercise his discretion--for example, as to whether to call in planning applications--as before. In all cases, he will proceed in accordance with his usual practice. Pending final decisions on the appeals, in deciding whether to call-in or recover cases for his own decision, he will take account of the fact that call-in and recovery, although lawful, have been declared incompatible with the Convention by the Divisional Court.

 The Secretary of State has no immediate plans to visit Kosovo. In my role as Security Minister, I visited Pristina in December 1999 with the Chief Constable to meet 60 officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary working with the United Nations Mission in Kosovo. It was evident then that the RUC contingent would play a key part in the executive policing role pending the establishment of a new Kosovan police service. The RUC has currently 62 officers in Kosovo where they continue to provide outstanding support.

 Information is available on the number of sex offenders in prison in England and Wales who have completed a cognitive behavioural Sex Offender Treatment Programme since 1992. This is shown in the table. It is not possible to calculate what percentage this is of all convicted sex offenders but for comparison the population of sentenced sex offenders in prison each year is shown.
<P>

<a name="01219w10.html_para2">All Sex Offender Treatment Programmes in English and Welsh prisons are evaluated by the Prison Service's Offender Behaviour Programme Unit (OBPU) with additional input from independent external researchers.
<P>

<a name="01219w10.html_para3">OBPU has made an analysis of all sexual offenders released from prison between 1992 and March 1996. The results showed that treated offenders had slightly better reconviction rates after two years than untreated offenders except for the very highest risk category. The number of reconvictions were small however, which made it difficult to attach significance levels to the results.
<P>

<a name="01219w10.html_para4">More detailed evaluations of Prison Service's later prison treatment programmes are now being carried out by a team of independent researchers--but it is still too early for reliable reconviction studies.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the impact of illegally imported beer on levels of crime and disorder.  [142830]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01219w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 We do not know precisely the extent to which illegally imported beer is a factor in other crime, but we do know that alcohol misuse generally is often associated with crime and disorder. It is likely that illegally imported alcohol, including beer, will play a part in some cases, particularly where the alcohol ends up in the hands of under-age drinkers. The illegal importation of beer and other alcohol is primarily a matter for Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. It is an issue that will be addressed further within the overall context of the Home Department action plan on alcohol-related crime. This set out a forward programme to address all aspects of alcohol-related crime and disorder, including the problems associated with under-age drinking.

 Tackling under-age drinking is a priority for this Government. It is one of the key objectives of the Home Department action plan on alcohol-related crime. In taking forward the programme set out in that action plan, we shall, in consultation with Her Majesty's Customs and Excise and the police, look at whether more can be done to address the availability of illegally imported beer and other alcohol, in particular to young people. In addition, to go further in tackling under-age drinking more generally, we shall be asking Parliament to approve measures which will strengthen the requirements on licensees and their staff to satisfy themselves that customers are at least 18 before selling alcohol to them, and to establish clearly the ability of the police and local authorities to arrange for the test purchasing of alcohol by children under this age.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01219w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Home Department welcomed the report of the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) and the statistics which show a decline in the number of deaths in police custody. The fall in deaths occurring at police stations is particularly encouraging. These reductions reflect the efforts of police forces implementing good practice, much of it identified through work done by the PCA. Key initiatives include safer custody facilities, improved training, Closed Circuit Television observation and an emphasis on better care, assessment and monitoring of detainees.
<P>

<a name="01219w10.html_para5">The Home Department published its bulletin containing statistics on deaths in police custody during 1999-2000 on 15 December. This will also show a decline in the number of people dying in police stations. The bulletin will also set out a range of current action aimed at achieving further reductions.

 The drug arrest referral schemes, promoted and supported by the Home Department, with &#163;20 million from the Crime Reduction Programme, encourage the referral worker to assess the needs of those who have been arrested. While the focus is on drugs, the assessment will identify alcohol and other issues with which the individual has problems. The arrestee is referred to appropriate services, including those which can respond to alcohol abuse where they exist.

 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2000]:</i> Over the next five years, the British Council plans to spend a total of &#163;18.6 million, equivalent to 1 per cent. of its expected turnover over the period, on staff restructuring in the United Kingdom and overseas.

<a name="01219w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The European Scrutiny Committee have recommended that the Declaration on Sport be debated with the Helsinki Report on sport, and the Community Support Plan to combat doping in sport. It is planned that the debate be held in the new year. I believe that it was important for the Prime Minister to be able to agree the Declaration at the Nice European Council Meeting, particularly as it would have been viewed as a reversal of our position should the UK not have been in a position to support it. We have argued long and hard to secure the changes which meet the Government's objectives.
<P>

<a name="01219w12.html_para2">The declaration fully acknowledges the prerogatives of sports organisations; it underlines that while commercial sport should be subject to EU regulations, those regulations must be applied in a way that recognises the special nature of sport; and it does not envisage any expansion of the role of the Commission in relation to

<P>
<P>
<a name="01219w12.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The proposed European Union Council Regulation on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies, currently under discussion in Brussels, holds out the prospect of a return to live exports of bovine animals once BSE incident in the UK has reduced to a lower level.

<a name="01219w12.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2000]:</i> The Government have already paid out over &#163;3.7 million under the Pig Welfare (Disposal) Scheme to producers caught by movement controls brought in to prevent the spread of classical swine fever. As matters stand currently, over &#163;8.5 million will be paid to producers under this scheme. The only vehicle available to introduce a producer levy to provide funding for an industry top-up to these Government payments is a development scheme under the 1967 Agriculture Act. The formal consultation period on a development scheme began on 24 November and will end on 23 January 2001. If, after examining any objections, the industry decides to ask Agriculture Ministers to proceed with a scheme, we would aim to lay the statutory instrument before this House very quickly after receiving the request.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the outcome of the Fisheries Council held in Brussels on 14 December.  [143617]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01219w12.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the EU Fisheries Council in Brussels on 14-15 December, together with Rhona Brankin, Deputy Minister for Rural Affairs in the Scottish Executive, and Mrs. Brid Rodgers, the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development.
<P>

<a name="01219w12.html_para4">The Council agreed by qualified majority, with Belgium and Greece voting against and Italy abstaining, on total allowable catches (TACS) and quotas to apply in 2001 EU Waters and for EU vessels fishing in waters where catch limitations apply. Details of the agreed TACs will be made available in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="01219w12.html_para5">Following from the advice of fisheries scientists in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), the Commission proposed severe cuts in many TACs, notably for cod and hake, reflecting the poor state of stocks and the need to hold fishing effort at a level which will assist the recovery of depleted stocks. In addition, the Commission proposed cuts of 20 per cent. for a large range of stocks which may be caught with cod and hake, including prawns (nephrops) and flat fish.
<P>

<a name="01219w12.html_para6">I successfully argued that these cuts went beyond the science and would be excessive in their application. Taking measures to enable cod stocks to recover was a key priority, but this should be done by carefully targeted measures to reduce fishing effort, protect spawning and juvenile cod and improve the selectivity of fishing gear. I am pleased to report that such measures will be developed in close consultation with fishermen and scientists under the Cod Recovery Plan, which the Council agreed would be adopted early next year. There is also to be a corresponding Hake Recovery Plan.
<P>

<a name="01219w12.html_para7">By acting to protect the cod and hake stocks through recovery plans, it was possible to secure smaller cuts than the Commission had proposed, while still respecting the scientific advice. This particularly applies to flat fish and nephrops. For these, the agreed cuts are now generally 10 per cent. or less. Also, it will be possible to increase nephrops and other TACs if it can be shown that the cod or hake bycatch in these fisheries is low. Improvements were also secured in megrim, haddock and monkfish TACs and the cut in hake TACs was reduced from 74 per cent. to 41 per cent. Our quotas were also improved because Hague Preference was applied on all those stocks 



<P>
<P><I>19 Dec 2000 : Column: 135W</I><P>
on which I judged that it was in our national interest to seek it. As a result of these changes the total UK quotas agreed were some 4,000 tonnes higher in cod equivalent tonnes than in the Commission's proposals. This means that the estimated loss of quota value to the industry in 2001 is reduced by &#163;35 million to &#163;72 million.
<P>

<a name="01219w12.html_para8">There is an urgent need for action to protect stocks of deepwater species and the Commission had made proposals for the introduction of TACs and Quotas on nine such species. However, the impact of the proposals would have been of limited value because the stocks are fished by non-EU states whose activities would have been unaffected. Also, the scientific advice suggests that other management measures may be appropriate. Accordingly, the proposals were not adopted, but the Council committed itself to address the question of how protection for these vulnerable and over-exploited stocks could most effectively be improved in early 2001.
<P>

<a name="01219w12.html_para9">The Commission also presented a communication on the possibility of setting TACs on a multi-annual rather than annual basis under precautionary management strategies. This approach will apply first to cod and hake. The Council agreed that the Commission will continue its work in this area.
<P>

<a name="01219w12.html_para10">The Council reached agreement in principle on the funding of fisheries control activities and on the consolidation of technical measures for highly migratory species like tuna and swordfish. The Council adopted a decision provisionally applying from 1 January 2001, the recently negotiated Fourth Protocol to the EU-Greenland Agreement; Portugal abstained. The Commission reported that negotiations were continuing on a new EU-Morocco Fisheries Agreement, though with little progress so far.
<P>

<a name="01219w12.html_para11">In bilateral discussions with Denmark I agreed that we would have joint discussions in early 2001 on the North Sea sandeel fishery. These will cover possible reductions in the size of the TAC and adjustments to the bycatch arrangements which would reduce the allowance for bycatches of fish for human consumption.
<P>

<a name="01219w12.html_para12">The outcome of the Council represents a balance between the need to conserve fish stocks for the future and the avoidance of disproportionate cuts in fishing opportunities in 2001. I recognise that the fishing industry faces a difficult period in responding to the poor state of stocks and we will be having discussions with them early in the new year to evaluate the situation.

 When completing applications for ECGD cover exporters are obliged to declare any commission payments. In addition to existing procedures for identifying and controlling agents commissions, ECGD has recently introduced provisions in all its facilities aimed specifically at combating bribery. These provisions, among other things, enable insurance policies to be avoided in bribery situations and allow ECGD to seek to recover any loss it may suffer under its facilities following the conviction of either the exporter or the bank for corruption in connection with a contract or its financing.

<a name="01219w13.html_para6">As at 13 December the Department had made in excess of 11,000 revised and new expedited offers totalling &#163;54 million, further offers continue to be made. Of these, the value of payments made, following acceptance by the claimant, are as follows:

 Under the Postal Services Act 2000, the Secretary of State has today published consultation documents on the definition of turnover for the purposes of financial penalties (section 30), free postal services for blind and partially sighted persons (section 41), and social and environmental guidelines (section 43). These consultation documents are available on the DTI website and hard copies are available from the Postal Services Directorate at the Department of Trade and Industry. Responses should be submitted by 31 January. Hard copies are also available in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.

 This is a complex area. The Department's position is set out in a letter dated 26 July to hon. Members with direct coal mining interests, including my hon. Friend. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House for all hon. Members, and I am sending a copy of the letter to my hon. Friend. The Department believes that it is inappropriate for solicitors to take a proportion of a claimant's compensation.

 The Department has issued three publications giving advice on reducing "do not attend" (DNA) rates.
<P>

<a name="01219w14.html_para1">"Getting Patients Treated: The Waiting List Action Team Handbook" was published by the Waiting List Action Team in August 1999. This can be found at www.doh.gov.uk/wtactionteam.htm. It proposed the use of a "fail safe appointment system" to improve communication with patients before their appointment was due.
<P>

<a name="01219w14.html_para2">"Variations in NHS Outpatient Performance" was published in November 1999. "A step by step guide to improving outpatient services" was published in July 2000. Both can be found at www.doh.gov.uk/pspp. These publications advised National Health Service trusts, health authorities and primary care groups/trusts to implement outpatient partial booking systems. These systems have been shown to reduce the number of DNAs. They enable patients and NHS trusts to agree a mutually convenient date and time for appointments. All NHS trusts have been asked to introduce partial booking systems in outpatient clinics with waiting times in excess of 13 weeks.




<P>

<P>

<a name="01219w14.html_para3">NHS trusts are implementing this guidance. Individual NHS trusts also take additional steps, such as writing to remind patients of their appointments and providing patients with a central telephone number for changing or cancelling appointments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01219w15.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2000]:</i> I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that the Meat Inspection Charges Task Force (the Maclean Committee) concluded that the Government should provide some degree of financial support in order to prevent the closure of large numbers of small and medium sized abattoirs and cutting plants. It therefore recommended that the current method of charging for meat inspections on an hourly rate basis should be changed and that, instead, all abattoirs and cutting plants should be charged the lower of either the standard (headage/throughput) fees laid down in the EU Charges Directive or their actual inspection costs (subject to the minimum charge of 45 per cent. of the standard headage/throughput charges, as required by the Directive).
<P>

<a name="01219w15.html_para6">We have accepted this recommendation. The additional aid announced on 28 November in the context of the publication of the Rural White Paper (&#163;8.7 million in 2001-02) together with the existing subsidy on meat inspection charges (&#163;9 million in 2001-02) will help to fund implementation of the new method of charging. Any shortfall in the funding will be met from within Food Standards Agency resources.
<P>

<a name="01219w15.html_para7">The Task Force considered that acceptance of this recommendation by the Government would ensure that Meat Hygiene Service inspection charges were not the main reason for plants going out of business, which appeared to the Task Force to be the case under the existing charging system. However, the Task Force also considered that implementing its recommendation would not in itself keep uncompetitive meat plants in existence.

 My right hon. Friend has regular discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on a wide range of issues affecting Scotland.
<P>

<a name="01219w17.html_para2">My right hon. Friend the Chancellor and I agree that the price of fuel is only one factor in any consideration of motoring costs. Independent research commissioned by my Department has shown that the taxation costs of private motoring are lower in Scotland than in European countries such as the Netherlands, Finland, Ireland and even Portugal. The average Scottish driver pays &#163;1,000 a year less than in Denmark.

This Government also recognise that post offices form a vital part of the rural community, and are fully committed to maintaining the existing size and shape of the rural network.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) if he will assess the benefits of charging the benefit in kind taxation paid by an employee in receipt of a company-provided car on the cost of purchasing the car by the employer;  [142740]
<P>
<UL>(2) for what reason the benefit-in-kind taxation paid by an employee in receipt of a company-provided car is calculated on the retail price of the car; and if he will make a statement.  [143566]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01219w19.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 December 2000]:</i> The company car tax charge is based on the car's list price at first registration as this is easily obtainable and is the fairest figure on which to base the charge. Introduced from April 1994, this was the preferred option of the majority of those who responded to the 1992 consultation on the reform of company car taxation. It ensures that employees driving identical cars of the same age pay the same tax. List price will therefore continue to be used when the company car tax system is reformed from April 2002.
<P>

<a name="01219w19.html_para2">Basing the tax charge on the cost to the employer of providing the company car would create inequities between employees driving identical cars. However, in recent weeks most car manufacturers have reduced their list prices. This means company car drivers will accordingly pay less tax as their cars are replaced.

<P>

<a name="01219w20.html_para1">The objective of the review was to recommend an organisational structure which would best align the resources of OGC and its three executive agencies--



<P>
<P><I>19 Dec 2000 : Column: 162W</I><P>
CCTA, PACE and The Buying Agency (TBA)--to deliver successfully its vision and strategies. It involved an extensive consultation with Departments and other customers, as well as with suppliers and other stakeholders including staff and trade unions. The review proposes a more cohesive organisation, with a greater focus and capability for working with Departments to achieve substantial value for money improvements in the Government's procurement budget.
<P>

<a name="01219w20.html_para2">From 1 April 2001, OGC will incorporate PACE and a number of CCTA functions, to provide a more unified organisation, working to a common purpose. In addition, there will be a single trading fund, and executive agency of OGC, based on TBA together with the catalogue and managed services activities in CCTA. This will mean ending the executive agency status of CCTA and PACE, and incorporating some CCTA functions within TBA. To reflect this, subject to the laying of the necessary resolutions before this House, TBA's name will be changed to "OGC buying.solutions" from 1 April 2001.
<P>

<a name="01219w20.html_para3">The result will be a more efficient and effective organisation which, while building on current strengths, will add and support new capabilities to meet Ministers' and Departments' requirements.

<a name="01219w20.html_para4">TBA's financial year, which currently runs from 1 January until 31 December, is being brought into line with OGC. For this year only, TBA will operate an extended 15 month accounting period ending on 31 March 2001. Thereafter, they will operate on an April to March financial year. The Agency's financial target has been extended to cover the 15 month period, and it will be expected to achieve a return on capital employed at an annual rate of 8 per cent. over the full 15 month period.

 The proposal to restrict trial by jury will increase the magistrates' current work load of nearly 2 million criminal proceedings a year by about 14,000. The work load of the Crown court will consequently decrease significantly, even if account is taken of a number of appeals on mode of trial and an increase in appeals against conviction from defendants previously electing for trial in the Crown court.

<P>

<a name="01219w20.html_para9">Sentencing is a matter for the courts. Parliament lays down the parameters within which sentencers must work. It is then for the courts to decide on the sentence in the light of the facts of the case and after taking into consideration the circumstances of the offence and the offender. The Government cannot issue guidance to sentencers as it is a fundamental principle that the Executive does not interfere with judicial discretion.

<P>

<a name="01219w21.html_para0">Common themes to many appeals are: accessibility for all court users; the facilities available, costs of necessary renovations to bring the court up to standard. The provision of courtrooms and work load, extra travelling distances, additional costs and overall efficiency.

 There have been two advertising campaigns since 1996 and a third is planned for January 2001.
<P>

<a name="01219w21.html_para1">In 1998-99, total spending was &#163;333,253 on a national campaign to develop awareness of the magistracy. Effectiveness was gauged by the number of requests for further information about the magistracy: 15,000 people responded. (This figure cannot be related directly to eventual recruiting of magistrates which is on a regional basis and is also supported by ad hoc locally arranged advertising and publicity.)
<P>

<a name="01219w21.html_para2">In 2000-01, the total cost of advertising campaigns and associated publicity will be &#163;4.2 million.
<P>

<a name="01219w21.html_para3">A total of &#163;3.45 million will be spent on a rolling campaign of regional and local advertising and other publicity work including door-drop leaflets to raise awareness of the Community Legal Service (CLS) in those areas where CLS Partnerships have been formed. 



<P>
<P><I>19 Dec 2000 : Column: 166W</I><P>
The campaign began when the CLS was launched on 3 April 2000 and is continuing. Effectiveness is gauged by public awareness of the CLS. Market research linked with the campaign indicated that by mid-September 2000 general public awareness had reached 23 per cent. A further &#163;0.5 million is committed to national newspaper advertising for the CLS in February 2001.
<P>

<a name="01219w21.html_para4">In January and February 2001, a national newspaper advertising campaign is planned to raise awareness of mediation services in connection with family disputes. This is also linked with the CLS. The cost will be &#163;0.25 million. The effectiveness of the campaign and evaluation of its results will be gauged by the number of requests which result for new information leaflets on family mediation.
<P>

<a name="01219w21.html_para5">All figures include VAT, Central Office of Information fees and all associated research, production and distribution charges.
