<a name="71219w03.html_para0">The most recent Euratom report, published in 1994, contains figures for total inspection effort in the UK for the years 1989-92. Figures for subsequent years have also been published, most recently in a paper presented at the IAEA Safeguards Symposium held in Vienna in October 1997 (a copy of which will be placed in the Library of the House). These figures show Euratom safeguards inspection effort in the UK rising from slightly under 2,000 person days in 1989 to just over 3,000 person days in 1996. Although the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) do not themselves routinely publish corresponding figures for their inspections in the UK, the information they have provided to us shows that such effort has ranged between approximately 400 and 670 person days per year for the period in question.

 The latest household projections show the need for 4.4 million additional households between the years of 1991 and 2016. It is for water companies to quantify and provide the water supplies required. This is a normal part of the planning process.

 HSE inspectors carry out a range of different types of workplace inspections, for example proactive or planned inspections; visits associated with special projects; visits connected with enforcement matters; and advisory visits. During their visits, inspectors may issue a prohibition or "stop" notice on a dangerous activity if the circumstances warrant it. Over the past four years HSE inspectors made the following numbers of planned inspections:

 I regret that the information requested is not recorded by the Health and Safety Executive and cannot therefore be supplied. Not all occupiers of workplaces for which HSE enforces health and safety are required to register with HSE. HSE's primary concern is with conditions in workplaces, regardless of how they came to its attention. To identify those factories which were first recorded following visits by HSE inspectors would involve a disproportionate cost.

 On the basis of information up to 1995, it is estimated that about 700,000 dwellings then had a water supply with a lead concentration exceeding 50 g/litre.

 Proposed movements of vehicles and loads in excess of 80 tonnes and those in excess of 2.9 metres in width are required to be notified to the police. The timing of the movement is at the discretion of the Chief Officer(s) of police in the area(s) in which the movement is to take place. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has recommended to Police Forces that abnormal loads should, where possible, be moved at off-peak periods, including, where it is safe to do so, the hours of night. In timing the movement of such loads, it must be recognised that large loads frequently require police escort. This places considerable demands on resources and the Police service generally finds it difficult to provide a flexible escort service because other operational policing requirements frequently have to take priority at short notice. This can mean that Police Forces are sometimes left with no alternative but to escort loads at busy periods.

 The movement of heavy and wide loads on all types of roads is governed by either the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, the Special Types General Order 1979 or in the case of loads greater than 150 tonnes or wider than 6.1 metres by Order made under Section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 issued by my Department. Movements of any load in excess of 5.0 metres is also subject to the agreement of my Department. Vehicles and loads in excess of 38 tonnes are required to be notified to the highway and bridge authorities on the proposed route.

 My right hon. Friend has received no such representations from, or held discussions with, the Environment Agency on these matters. The issue of flood risk protection is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The position in respect of residential development is that water companies have a statutory duty to provide supplies of water sufficient for domestic purposes and this duty extends to all new premises. Current planning guidance requires local authorities to consult with infrastructure providers, such as water suppliers, when drawing up their development plans.

 During the development of this proposed directive both the manufacturers and operators have been consulted extensively.

 I met the Franchising Director on 15 December to discuss current West Coast performance issues and future investment plans. In addition to that, the Franchising Director has regular liaison meetings with my officials. Key performance issues are routinely discussed at these meetings, including the performance of the West Coast Main Line since privatisation. The Franchising Director publishes quarterly bulletins of performance information against Passenger's Charter targets for all Train Operating Companies, and an annual report; these documents are in the Library of the House. The West Coast Main Line franchise was taken over by Virgin Trains on 9 March 1997. Performance of these services is slightly better than it was under British Rail but is still well below Virgin's committed target of 90 per cent. punctuality by March 1998.

 One of our key aims is to rebuild integrity in, and public support for, the Social Security system and the way in which public money is spent. We need to focus on those who are properly entitled to benefit. This is why we have set up the Benefit Integrity Project.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question regarding how many recipients of each of the main disability benefits have had their benefits reduced and stopped as a result of the Benefits Integrity Programme (BIP), and what proportion of these recipients are over pension age.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As at 30 November 1997, the BIP has looked at 27,511 Disability Living Allowance (DLA) awards. Of these awards 2,339 were reduced, 1,152 were disallowed entirely, 23,363 left unaltered and 657 increased. In addition staff working on the BIP have dealt with 5,979 renewal claims of which 1,080 have been disallowed, 1,541 renewed at a lower rate, 3,174 renewed at the same rate and 184 renewed at a higher rate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what is the average weekly mortgage interest of homebuyers in receipt of family credit; and how many have weekly mortgage interest costs of (i) up to &#163;9.99, (ii) &#163;10-&#163;19.99, (iii) &#163;20-&#163;29.99, (iv) &#163;30-&#163;39.99, (v) &#163;40-&#163;49.99, (vi) &#163;50-&#163;59.99, (vii) &#163;60-&#163;69.99, (viii) &#163;70-&#163;79.99 and (ix) &#163;80 or above.

 The information is not available in the format requested. Such information as is available is as follows.
<P>

<a name="71219w08.html_para3">According to the 1995-96 Family Resources Survey (FRS) the average weekly mortgage interest cost to homebuyers in receipt of Family Credit (FC) was &#163;31 (rounded to nearest &#163;1).
<P>

<a name="71219w08.html_para4">Counts of FC receipt derived from the FRS do not match administrative sources. Therefore the requested figures for homebuyer FC recipients by mortgage band are shown in the table as percentages rather than grossed up counts. In addition, the requested mortgage interest bands resulted in counts too low to be reliable. Therefore it has been necessary to enlarge the mortgage interest bands used.

1. The estimates are based on sample counts which have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors which control for region, Council Tax Band and a number of demographic variables. Estimates are subject to sampling error and to variability in non response.<P>

2. The total count of homebuyers given is based on adult owner occupiers with a mortgage where the benefit unit to which the adult belongs is in receipt of Family Credit. A benefit unit is a single adult or couple living as married and any dependent children.<P>

provide the Department with serviced accommodation throughout the country, except for th<i></i>e Tyneside area, which is covered by a separate project. The contract will start on 1 April 1998. This is an imaginative and innovative form of partnership with the private sector which will bring specialist expertise to the management of the estate; deliver improved value for money; result in more investment in our buildings; and allow us to share in gains realised by property developments. It gives us more flexibility to adjust the buildings we occupy to meet our changing service needs, while retaining control over location of our offices. This project, PRIME, has been a major Government procurement. It is a pathfinder project which puts this Department at the forefront of the way in which the public sector manages property.

<P>
<a name="71219w09.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Universities and colleges will retain the contribution to fees which they collect from students; and also the part of the fee they receive from local authorities, where the student is assessed as paying less than the &#163;1,000. It is for universities with medical schools to decide how much of this income and of the grant received from the Higher Education Funding Council should be made available for medical school education.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if the revenue raised through the introduction of tuition fees wil be used entirely to fund further and higher education by allowing the institutions which collect the money to spend it. [21847]

<P>
<P>
<a name="71219w09.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 We have made it clear that the savings from the introduction of tuition fees will be used to improve quality, standards and opportunity for all in further and higher education.
<P>

<a name="71219w09.html_para0">For 1998-99 we have already announced that the introduction of private contributions to tuition fees for higher education will mean an extra &#163;125 million for higher education institutions, plus &#163;4 million to allow for a modest increase in students on sub degree courses mainly in FE colleges. In addition some &#163;15 million of the higher education savings has been allocated to the further education sector to contribute to meeting the Government's priorities for reducing social exclusion and increasing employability.

 In England and Wales, local education authorities will handle applications for mandatory awards from all new entrants to higher education in 1998-99.

 The School Standards and Framework Bill will establish a new framework for the organisation of schools. All existing legal categories of mainstream maintained school--including the grant-maintained category--will be replaced by three new categories: community, foundation and voluntary. All three will be maintained by local education authorities.

 The number of pupils with statements has risen from 161,000 in 1992 to 233,000 in 1997. Our Green Paper, "Excellence for all children: meeting special educational needs" draws on the views of members of the National Advisory Group on special educational needs and on discussions with schools, local education authorities and voluntary groups. It suggests that the reasons for the increase may include financial and other differential effects of statements. While confirming the continuing importance of statements for children with complex disabilities, the Green Paper seeks views on the case for helping schools to meet the needs of more children without recourse to expensive statutory statementing processes.

Compared with those without degrees, graduates on average see their earnings rise by as much as &#163;4,000 for every &#163;20,000 of earnings within about ten years of graduation.

 <i>[holding answer 16 December 1997]:</i> It is not possible to provide accurate figures on the number of times Brian McHugh has been strip searched whilst on remand at Belmarsh Prison. As a High Risk prisoner, Mr. McHugh is subject to a searching policy appropriate to his security category. In particular, he will be strip searched before and after visits, on entry to and exit from the prison and on entry to and exit from the court. These routine strip searches are not recorded since they are a mandatory requirement of Prison Service security policy.

<P>
<a name="71219w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government believe that the provision of soundly based guidance to farmers should continue to be the centrepiece of public policy on the protection of agriculture soils. For this purpose, Agriculture Departments have made available a wide range of advice about the protection of soil. In particular, the MAFF/WOAD Soil Code provides farmers with comprehensive advice about the impact of agricultural practices on soil condition. This includes advice on preventing or minimising erosion. In addition, this Department published an advisory booklet during 1997, "Controlling Soil Erosion", which gave farmers further help in dealing with soil erosion problems.
<P>

<a name="71219w10.html_para2">The Department has also commissioned a step by step guide to help farmers plan erosion control systematically. The draft guide will be trailed over the winter in certain areas of England with soils at high risk of erosion by water.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at which meetings of the fisheries and management committees were <i>(a)</i> proposals and <i>(b)</i> decisions made relating to the minimum size of legally caught plaice; and for what purposes these proposals and decisions were made. [20970]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71219w10.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A proposal to revise the minimum landing size for legally caught plaice was made by the European Commission in June 1996 as part of a package of technical conservation measures. The size of 17 cm proposed was that at which plaice are retained and killed by 80 mm nets. The revised minimum size was intended to reduce the discarding of dead fish that could not otherwise be landed.
<P>

<a name="71219w10.html_para4">On 30 October 1997, the Fisheries Council decided to increase the minimum size from 17 cm to 22 cm as part of a compromise package. This new size will apply from 1 January 2000 and is intended to take account of the fact that plaice are often targeted with nets exceeding 80 mm minimum mesh size.

 Allocations for MAFF grants and credit approvals to operating authorities for capital flood and coastal defence works in 1998-99 are at the same level as plans proposed last year by the previous Government. Also, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has recently announced that Revenue Support Grant allocations for 1998-99, which cover residual costs of local authorities' schemes that are not covered by grant aid, will be almost 5.1 per cent. higher than actual expenditure in 1997-98. For future years the level of funding will depend on the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review.

Arrangements for actual disposal are a commercial matter between individual butchers and those who collect their waste.

 <i>[holding answer 18 December 1997]:</i> There is no backlog of the Over Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS) carcases awaiting incineration. On average 15,000 animals a week are presented for the scheme, of which around 1,500 cattle, mostly on-farm casualties, are directly incinerated in appropriately authorised incinerators. The remainder are rendered and the remains securely stored pending disposal. Following a tender held last year, the amount of direct carcase incineration capacity available to the scheme is expected to increase to around 5,000 animals a week by spring 1998, subject to the successful companies obtaining the necessary planning and environmental consents. Much of this increase will be in respect of incinerators that are associated with scheme abattoirs, thus providing an integrated disposal solution.

Friend, and having taken into account the views of the Chief Medical Officer, he announced his intention to consult widely on proposals to prohibit the sale of beef on the bone from animals aged over six months. My right hon. Friend has received a large number of comments which were taken into account before he introduced legislation in this House.

<a name="71219w12.html_para0"><i>Letter from T. W. Stewart to Kate Hoey, dated 19 December 1997:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has asked me to reply to your recent Questions about the Cottonmount landfill site at Mallusk Belfast.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are no direct implications of Phase 2 of the Cottonmount landfill site for recycling measures in Northern Ireland. The new Waste Management and Contaminated Land (NI) Order 1997 includes a requirement that a Northern Ireland Waste Strategy be prepared. Work is already under way on the Strategy which will inter alia promote the hierarchy of waste management options which range from waste minimisation, through re-cycling to landfill at the bottom of the list. The recycling measures which flow from the Order together with the landfill tax all mitigate against landfill. However, there is likely to be an on-going need for landfill sites for materials which are not recyclable and, for example, residues from incineration.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The application to landfill Phase 1 of the Cottonmount site was submitted on 31 May 1988 prior to the introduction of the Planning (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1989 on 1 March 1989. A formal environmental statement could not therefore have been sought for that application. An 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>19 Dec 1997 : Column: 379</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>environmental statement was requested, submitted and carefully considered with the current application for Phase 2 prior to the Notice of Opinion to approve issuing.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The EC Directive has been in preparation for a number of years and a previous draft was rejected by the European Parliament in May 1996. Article 18 of the EC directive states that Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 30 June 2000. While the draft EC Directive is a material consideration, only limited cognisance can be taken of it.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Annex 1 of the draft Directive states that the separation distance from the boundary of the site to residential areas should be a minimum of 500 metres in the case of municipal waste landfills and 2 kilometres in the case of hazardous waste landfills. In Phase 2 of the Cottonmount site residential and recreation areas are closer to the boundary than currently stated in the draft EC Directive.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Newtownabbey Borough Council has appointed independent consultants to consider the landfilling practices of the operators and to investigate particularly the causes of odours generated by Phase 1 of Cottonmount. As work on the study has not yet commenced no account can be taken of it. The Department however, consulted Newtownabbey Borough Council for advice on the environmental health issues when processing the current application and took account of the advice when reaching an opinion as to how the application should be determined.

 It is for defence companies themselves to take the lead on determining the future structure of the industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71219w14.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The White Paper "The New NHS" (Cm 3807) is fully consistent with general practitioners' freedom of referral. Primary Care Groups will be able to develop long term agreements with National Health Service trusts that reflect the views of all local GPs and are sensitive to their referral choices. The arrangements to replace the internal market system of extra contractual referrals, substituting adjustments to allocations for the former bureaucratic invoicing system, will cover the freedom to refer outside these agreements in special cases, combining the freedom to refer with the ability to fund.

 Ministers have decided that the special occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the National Health Service should be marked with events and initiatives that reflect the Service's achievements and, equally important, herald its further development over the coming years. The Service has been issued with guidance that emphasises that the main focus should be at local level, with the active participation of staff and patients, and should reflect the caring ethos of the Health Service.
<P>

<a name="71219w15.html_para2">The guidance also emphasises that events should be low cost, sponsored or self financing so that resources are not diverted from patient care.

<P>

<P>
<a name="71219w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Priorities for funding research in the Department are set very carefully, based on the burden of disease and other criteria. Bids for conducting research into chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) are therefore always considered on that basis. The Department continues to fund research into the management and treatment of CFS/ME through the National Health Service Research and Development Programme. It is currently funding an on-going research project, costing about &#163;60,000, which is looking at whether general practitioners are best placed to manage CFS/ME patients. A recently completed research project, costing over &#163;65,000, considered whether a particular type of psychological treatment was effective in reducing disability in CFS/ME patients. The main agency through which the Government support medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council. The Council currently provides support for one Small Project Grant in the area of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome entitled "The role of noradrenaline in the neuropsychological pathogenesis of the chronic fatigue syndrome". The total amount awarded was &#163;37,000.
