As part of the future relationship, the government of Iraq have indicated that they would like the UK to continue to provide military training and education. The precise scope of this training and education will inform decisions on the number of UK service personnel in Iraq after 31 July. Decisions will also be based on advice from our military commanders and conditions on the ground.

The Government works closely with the Commission of the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and the international Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels to conserve most of South Georgia's breeding populations. In addition the GSGSSI has a number of polices in place to protect life in both the marine and terrestrial environment, these include the designation of specially protected areas, specially protected species as well as prohibitions on disturbing, killing, capturing or exporting native fauna.

the government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI) work collaboratively to investigate and protect biodiversity and ensure the conservation of endangered species at South Georgia. The BAS have a long-term monitoring and survey programme which monitors seabird and seal population dynamics, feeding ecology and reproductive performance. The GSGSSI has strict procedures in place to prevent the introduction or transfer of alien species and in support of this the FCO is part-funding the development of a biosecurity store to be built at South Georgia to safeguard native species and control invasive species.</p>

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has no plans to improve transport facilities in South Georgia.

While the numbers of tourists visiting South Georgia has increased in recent years, visitor landings are managed by the government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands so that authorised visitors may continue to have access to approved landing sites in a safe and regulated manner, whilst minimising any potential impacts on the island's unique heritage.</p>

 Kosovo&#146;s independence was the culmination of a UN-led political process, envisaged in UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (99), to determine its final status. This process exhausted all avenues to negotiate a solution between the parties and in the UN Security Council. In declaring independence, Kosovo explicitly undertook to implement the UN Special Envoy&#146;s Comprehensive Settlement proposals, including the provisions on minority and community rights. It has adopted a constitution and legislative framework which give effect to this undertaking.</p>

 Child trust funds are a long-term investment over an 18-year period, with the first accounts reaching maturity in 2020. Parents can choose which type of CTF account their child&#146;s money is invested in, and can transfer between account types at any time. Three types of child trust fund accounts are available. Stakeholder accounts and shares accounts invest in stocks and shares, while the savings account does not. Although shares can go down as well as up in value, particularly in the short-term, the historical evidence is that they tend to provide a better return than cash for long-term investments. Also, with CTF stakeholder accounts, the level of exposure to shares will decrease over time as money in the account is gradually moved into more cash-like investments after the child turns 13. This &#145;lifestyling&#146; element will help to reduce risk before maturity.</p>

The campaign was national in scope but needed to be targeted to reach particular people and organisations for which the Mental Capacity Act would have an impact and provide benefits. An external agency was used as the resource did not exist in the OPG, and the MOJ Communications Directorate could not dedicate sufficient resource to run such a campaign. Procuring an external agency to deliver the time-limited campaign also meant that the OPG did not have to hire extra staff and so exceed headcount limits.</p>

 Information on current and planned capacity for breast screening in each primary care trust (PCT) is not collected centrally. It is for PCTs, in partnership with strategic health authorities, local services and other local stakeholders, to determine how best to use their funds to meet the healthcare needs of their local populations. PCTs are required to provide breast screening services for their eligible populations. They are responsible for ensuring that breast screening services are delivered to national standards.</p>

It is now screening more women and detecting more cancers than ever before. In 2007-08, 1.71 million women were screened and 14,110 cancers were detected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="90202w0018.htm_para9"><a name="09020233001248">We are extending routine breast screening to women between the ages of 47 and 73 years, with a guarantee that women will have their first screening before the age of 50. As a result, over 400,000 more women will be screened each year. This extension is being managed by NHS Cancer Screening Programmes in partnership with local health services and will be piloted in six sites from January 2009. The pilots will meet strict quality and performance criteria and will act as a learning platform to enable remaining services to model their rollout plans. Full implementation of the breast screening extension across England is due by the end of 2012.</p>

 During the two-year period January 2007 to December 2008, the Local Government Ombudsman received 73 complaints related to cemeteries and crematoria. Of these, five were outside their jurisdiction and 21 were premature and so were referred back to the council. Of the 47 cases that were investigated, six are still waiting a decision. Of the 41 cases determined, there were no formal findings of maladministration, although local settlements were reached in six cases, which can be regarded as an acceptance of fault by the Council.</p>

 Domestic dwellings are not liable for business rates.

The Government have announced totals for Formula Grant for 2008-09 to 2010-11. Within the total Formula Grant for each year, the amount of Revenue Support Grant varies to compensate for fluctuations in the distributable amount. The Government have delivered the first three year settlement for individual local authorities providing the predictability and stability which allow them to deliver effective services and to plan to deliver continued efficiency gains to help residents and local businesses in the current economic climate.</p>
