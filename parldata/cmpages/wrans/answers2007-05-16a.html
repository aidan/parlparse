 An analysis of educational visits arranged through the Parliamentary Education Service in 2005-06 showed that 64 per cent. of schools were from London and the south east regions. New recording systems are currently being investigated that will allow the Education Service to provide regional breakdowns of visitors from the start of the next academic year in September 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_440"><a name="70516w0001.htm_para0"><a name="07051686000200">Several Members have made representations that funding should be found to provide subsidies to encourage schools to visit Westminster as part of the Administration Committee's recent inquiry into visitor facilities at Parliament. As part of its evidence to the inquiry, the Education Service commissioned research with teachers to find out what obstacles might prevent schools from visiting Parliament. 46 per cent. of those teachers who indicated that they were unlikely to visit gave as their reason that the journey would be too expensive. The Committee recommended in its report, Improving Facilities for Educational Visitors to Parliament<sup>(1)</sup>, that the House of Commons Commission, working closely with the appropriate bodies in the House of Lords, should consider the case for subsidising school visits to Westminster from more remote constituencies. The Group on Information for the Public will be presenting proposals for consideration by the Commission later in the year.</p>

 The trade unions gave evidence to the Cummins review of 2003-04 which led to the proposal for a Joint Parliamentary ICT Department and have been involved in both formal and informal consultation at each subsequent stage. Consultation has taken place through the House of Commons Whitley Committee structure and also through an informal working group in which officials of both Houses and trade union representatives have taken part. Normally such exchanges would be treated as part of discussions carried out in confidence between the management and the unions. Since, however, these consultations relate to the subject of a Bill currently before the House, it was been agreed with the trade union side that copies of the formal letters exchanged to date should be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_477"><a name="70516w0004.htm_para5"><a name="07051686000483">Firstly, we are providing financial support to Africa's own efforts to increase agricultural productivity through our support to the African Union's New Partnership for Africa's Development initiative, the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Plan (CAADP), and through direct support to governments and partners to help poor farmers. Programmes include improving access to agricultural inputs, and transferring new technologies and skills to farmers to help them produce more. We will double to &#163;80 million per year our expenditure on agricultural, fisheries and forestry research by 2010. About two thirds of this will benefit Africa directly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_478"><a name="70516w0004.htm_para6"><a name="07051686000484">Secondly, we are helping keep small-scale farmers productive after shocks like drought. With support from DFID, African governments are able to provide small, timely transfers of adequate amounts of cash, food or agricultural inputs. For example, in Ethiopia we have provided over &#163;70 million to the Productive Safety Net Programme&#151;giving 7.2 million people cash and food transfers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_479"><a name="70516w0004.htm_para7"><a name="07051686000485">The Commission for Africa recommended that donors should support a doubling of irrigated area by 2015. Irrigation is also an important element of the first pillar of CAADP. DFID is a strong supporter of CAADP and has provided &#163;5 million to speed up its implementation by African governments. DFID is also one of the main supporters of the Nile Basin Initiative, which is an African-led regional process for sustainable management of the Nile, including for irrigation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_480"><a name="70516w0004.htm_para8"><a name="07051686000486">DFID recognizes the need to increase fertilizer use in many African countries so as to replenish the soils and improve food production in combination with complementary measures, such as improved seed varieties, irrigation and soil conservation. Improving fertilizer access is one component of CAADP. DFID co-funded an Africa Fertilizer Summit in July 2006. Over the past five years, DFID has committed around &#163;50 million to finance fertilizer-related programmes in Africa, which were executed through non-governmental organisations, government ministries and the UN. In Malawi, for example, DFID has provided support to help small-scale farmers acquire fertilizer. A recent evaluation has shown that the fertilizer and seed subsidy programmes in Malawi have led to additional maize production of 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes and 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes in 2005-06 and 2006-07 respectively, after taking into account better than average rainfalls. The value of the additional maize production in 2006-07 amounts to about $200 million based on import parity prices, about 9 per cent. of 2006 GDP.</p>

The power sector is a particular priority&#151;both to increase generation capacity and power transmission cable systems for greater regional connectivity. DFID provides no direct funding of power cables, for which finance is available from development banks such as the World Bank and African development banks. DFID has, however, provided $150,000 for preparation of the East African Submarine Cable System project. This fibre optic cable will link eastern and southern Africa to the international fibre optic system and will support high speed and high quality internet connections.</p>

Improving sanitation is a particularly effective way of reducing the number of pathogens in water sources and is usually included as a component of water supply programmes.

The Public Accounts Committee took evidence from senior officials from DfES in January 2007 and we await their conclusions. We will be issuing guidance very shortly which contains the principles of good governance for children&#146;s centres and extended services and includes details of children&#146;s centres advisory boards which will support effective financial management and performance monitoring. In the summer we plan further guidance to accompany details of the additional funding for children&#146;s centres, resulting from our Comprehensive Spending Review, to help local authorities ensure that resources are effectively targeted, fairly distributed according to need, and achieve value for money.</p>

 The principal reason for any change to the capital values of the schemes at the Tees Esk and Wear Valley National Health Service Trust, the Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, Mid Yorkshire NHS Trust, Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust and the North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust was that the review of private finance initiative schemes led the trusts concerned to reconsider how their schemes could best be structured in order to deliver services, in the most cost effective way and ensure their long-term viability. A key part of this work was an assessment of the capacity assumptions to ascertain if these were realistic and properly suited to the needs of the local health economy; and a review of the estate in terms of current and planned building stock to ensure optimal use.</p>

This meant that by the time the review came to consider these schemes their capital values had increased.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_549"><a name="70516w0009.htm_para13"><a name="07051686000905">The figures given in the 27 of February press notice for Mid Yorkshire included &#163;37 million of public capital that was not included in the figure given in February 2006.</p>

 Early intervention is a guiding principle of the Social Exclusion Action Plan. This report highlighted the relative costs and benefits of a rigorously tested programme, the Nurse Family Partnership from the US that provides intensive home visiting services by health visitors to disadvantaged mothers from pregnancy until the child is two-years-old. The evaluation showed that for every $1 invested in the US programme, $5 is saved down the line.

A young person may have a legitimate reason for being out at night unsupervised and the power to return young people to their homes is discretionary: it is not a curfew.</p>

 The disarmament measures undertaken by the UK, which I referred to in my answer of 8 May 2007, <i> Official Report</i>, column 67W, were pertinent to our obligations towards achieving the general and complete disarmament objectives of Article VI of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty, a multilaterally negotiated treaty. None of the measures have taken place as a result of any separate multilateral disarmament negotiations. The UK has for many years retained only the minimum nuclear capabilities we require and as a result we have the smallest stockpile of any of the nuclear weapon states recognised under the NPT. We believe it will only be useful for us to include our deterrent in multinational negotiations once further progress has been made in reducing global nuclear stockpiles.
