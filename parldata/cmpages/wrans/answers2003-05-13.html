<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Our National Cycling Strategy (NCS) aims to quadruple the number of journeys made by bike (based on 1996 figures) by 2012. We have established the NCS Board for England to take this forward. The Board combines expertise on transport engineering, marketing, local government and research. It has established a team of regional champions&#151;the English Regions Cycling Development Team&#151;to work with local authorities to promote and monitor cycling and deliver an improvement in conditions for cyclists.
<P>

<a name="30513w01.html_para7">At local level, provision and improvement of facilities for cyclists are largely funded through Local Transport Plan funds, All authorities have developed a local cycling strategy as part of these plans. This must identify gaps in the local infrastructure and potential improvements to the cycling network. In the 2003&#150;04, Tees Valley authorities plan to spend over &#163;1 million on cycling schemes.

<a name="30513w02.html_wqn14"><B> Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the impact of the Animal By-Products Regulation on <i>(a)</i> small abattoirs and slaughterhouses and <i>(b)</i> planning applications for small and medium-sized abattoirs and slaughterhouses since October 2002.  [111117]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A partial Regulatory Impact Assessment on the Animal By-Products Regulation is in the Library of the House, as part of the consultation on the enforcing regulations dated 27 January 2003. The Department has issued guidance to abattoirs, suggesting simple, low-cost ways of complying with the new requirements for disposal of blood. Planning applications may not be required in all cases. We have no information on the impact that the Regulation has had on the number of planning applications from small and medium sized abattoirs since October 2002.

<a name="30513w02.html_wqn15"><B> Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment her Department has made of the provisions relating to the separation of buildings in the Animal By-Products Regulation in relation to small abattoirs and slaughterhouses.  [111118]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The UK has secured a modification to Annex V of the Regulation to allow fat-rendering plants to be linked to abattoirs, providing they are operated separately and only process animal by-products originating on the premises.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w02.html_wqn16"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what regulations will be in force regarding the burial of horses on racecourses and studs following the introduction of the EU Animal By-products Regulation; and what information has been given to horse owners and trainers.  [111350]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 New EU legislation, the Animal By-Products Regulation, applied in Member States from 1 May. Amongst other things the Regulation banned the routine on-farm burial and open burning of animal carcases.
<P>

<a name="30513w02.html_para3">Horses from racecourses and stud farms will have to be disposed of in accordance with the Regulation. Burial or open burning is not permitted. Currently the permitted disposal routes for fallen stock include rendering, incineration, or sending the carcases to approved knackers yards, hunt kennels or maggot farms.
<P>

<a name="30513w02.html_para4">No specific advice has been provided to horse owners and trainers, but information on the disposal of animal carcases is available on the Defra website, at http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/bv-prods/default.htm., and from local Defra Animal Health Offices.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures she is taking to encourage catering sections of each Department to source and serve food which is <i>(a)</i> produced in Britain, <i>(b)</i> organic and <i>(c)</i> Fair Trade.  [111156]

<a name="30513w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Defra has published guidance for public sector bodies that covers issues such as removing obstacles to tendering by local and UK producers and the purchase of organic and fair trade produce. It can be seen on our web site at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/sustain/procurement/index.htm. We are also taking a number of other steps to integrate sustainable development into the public procurement of food and catering services. These include seminars to raise awareness, bilateral meeting at Ministerial and senior management level (including with representatives of local government) and the production of case studies. The guidance takes account of the Government's policy of achieving value for money and its commitment under the EC rules to ensure that public procurement is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory.

<P>
<a name="30513w03.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Randall: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she expects <i>(a)</i> Wedholme Flow, <i>(b)</i> Bolton Fell Moss and <i>(c)</i> Solway Moss to be designated as special areas of conservation in accordance with the recommendations of English Nature.  [112032]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Following English Nature's recommendations in June 2002, issues concerning boundary alignment and compensation payments have arisen. English Nature is working with stakeholders to resolve these questions. Until these matters have been resolved it is not possible to say when the sites will be designated as Special Areas of Conservation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she expects 



<P>
<P><I>13 May 2003 : Column 142W</I><P>
the new rights of access under Part I of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 to commence in the upper north west region.  [112530]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w03.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 I announced in November last year that the new right for the public to walk on mountain, moor, heath, down and registered common land will be rolled out on a region by region basis. This will give walkers the right to walk in open countryside and on registered common land as early as possible, rather than having to wait for the mapping process to be completed for the whole country. I intend to open the upper and lower north west regions in the autumn of 2004.
<P>

<a name="30513w03.html_para0">This is a demanding timetable as we will need to have in place not only the conclusive maps for those regions but also all necessary restrictions and exclusions. Guidance and codes of practice will also need to be available to walkers and landowners. These mechanisms are necessary under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act (The CROW Act) and it is important for them to be in force in each region before access land is made available to the public so that the interests of both land managers and walkers are safeguarded. We expect to meet the target of having all access land open by the end of 2005.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w03.html_wqn3"><B> Andrew Bennett: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 16 January, <i>Official Report</i>, column 735W, if she will set out the timetable for the implementation of regulations under Part I of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.  [112801]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w03.html_spnew3"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The table below records the progress we have already made towards bringing regulations into force and our timetable for completing the process. As I explained in my answer of 16 January, the precise timing may vary but we are firmly committed to ensuring the necessary regulations are made to allow the new right of public access under the Act to be rolled out as planned.

<P>
<a name="30513w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The EU animal by-products regulation which includes a ban on burial of fallen stock applies throughout the EU from 1 May 2003. Defra has sent a letter to all livestock farmers in England asking for expressions of interest in joining a national fallen stock collection and disposal scheme although it is not an essential requirement. We very much hope that farmers in Buckinghamshire will respond positively to this letter.

 The report by consultants DNV has been published this morning and is available at the Defra website: http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/regions/wmidlands/wmidlands.htm. I have placed copies of the report in the Library. I understand that DNV has written to local elected representatives to inform them of the outcome.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what weight of wild fish is required to provide fishmeal for the production of one kilogram of farmed fish; and what assessment she has made of the long-term implications for wild fish stocks.  [112417]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We do not hold information on the weight of wild fish used in fishmeal for feeding to farmed fish in the UK. The quantity involved will vary depending on the proportion of the fishmeal used in the different grades of dry fish feed produced for the species of farmed fish concerned and their stages of growth. However carnivorous aquaculture species are unlikely to consume more natural marine resources through feed than their wild counterparts would consume in the natural environment.
<P>

<a name="30513w04.html_para0">The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) makes annual assessments of the main commercial fish stocks around Britain, including those used to produce fish meal such as sandeels, Norway pout and blue whiting, and provides advice on their management. The total abundance of sandeel or Norway pout in the North Sea varies considerably for natural reasons, but the ICES assessments show that they are currently stable. ICES does not consider that the sandeel and pout fisheries are affecting the availability of food for other wild fish at the stock level, but studies are in progress to investigate whether problems are likely to occur more locally. As regards blue whiting, ICES has stated that these stocks are outside safe biological limits and that catches should be

limited to 600,000 tonnes in 2003. Although there is no internationally agreed Total Allowable Catch (TAC), the EU has set a TAC of 345,000 tonnes for Community waters in order to help manage the fishery.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what support her Department is giving to the British food and drinks industries to help them to promote British brands.  [110747]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Defra promotes the export of British brands of food through sponsorship of and grant in aid to Food from Britain, which also assists with the marketing of regional speciality foods. As part of the Strategy on Sustainable Farming and Food, we have introduced a new structure and an additional &#163;3 million over three years for regional food initiatives both in this country and overseas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Food Chain Emergency Liaison Group, which we have set up with the industry and which meets regularly, provides a forum for sharing of advice on security issues. We are also in regular contact with representatives of all parts of the food chain and pass on security information of relevance to them.

 <i>[holding answer 6 May 2003]</i>: Information is displayed at ports of entry to the UK as well as at some foreign airports, and disseminated through many of our diplomatic posts abroad. In addition we have produced two videos and a radio filler. The videos are being broadcast on television and we continue to work with airlines to get our message across in-flight. An increasing number of airlines are now making in-flight announcements on the personal import rules. Our message on meat imports is currently advertised on seven million ticket wallets for long-haul destinations.
<P>

<a name="30513w04.html_para1">Defra has recently produced a new leaflet setting out in detail the up-to-date rules on personal imports. This leaflet is being distributed via HM Customs, who have taken over responsibility for enforcement at the border, and for publicity at our ports and airports, at overseas destinations and in transit to the UK. Defra will retain responsibility for raising awareness within Britain of the fact that there are rules on the import of animal and plant products, the reasons for them and the penalties for breaking them, for example by attending appropriate shows and events.

 An assessment of the environmental performance of various alternative fuels was carried out by the Cleaner Vehicles Task Force in 2000. A copy of their report is available via the DfT website, at www.dft.gov.uk. Copies are also available through the House of Commons Library. The research showed that road fuel gases can have environmental benefits over conventional fuels, particularly for air quality and noise, although progress with conventional engine and fuel technologies is reducing this advantage.

<a name="30513w04.html_para2">As announced in Budget 2003, the Government plans to consult key stakeholders on how best to ensure that future support for LPG and other road fuel gases continues to reflect environmental and other policy objectives.

 Since 1998&#150;99 the Countryside Agency has administered four rural transport schemes. In 2001&#150;02 the Parish Transport Grant was launched and the Rural Transport Development Fund was amalgamated with the Rural Transport Partnership Scheme to form the Rural Transport Partnership. It would involve disproportionate cost to provide the number of projects funded under the Rural Transport Development Fund and the Rural Transport Partnership Scheme from 1998&#150;99 to 2001&#150;02. Since 2001, the Countryside Agency has been part of DEFRA's responsibilities while the Department for Transport funds rural bus projects through the Rural Bus Challenge and figures for this are also shown in the following table.

<i> [holding answer 12 May 2003]:</i> The Ministry of Defence takes the ill health veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict extremely seriously. It is addressing their concerns by providing medical help through the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme and financial assistance through pensions and fundig scientific research. Gulf veterans who are concerned about their health should contact the MOD's Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Unit on Freephone: 0800 169 4495.
<P>

<a name="30513w06.html_para2">We have asked the independent Medical Research Council to carry out a formal review of research to date and recommend what further work we should sponsor. This is expected to the published later this month.
<P>

<a name="30513w06.html_para3">The Pensions Appeal Tribunal (PAT) decided in December 2002 that Mr Izett was ill as a result of the immunisations he was given. It was only necessary for him under the provisions of the war pensions scheme to raise a reasonable doubt of a causal link between ill-health and Service. The PAT accepted such a doubt had been raised and therefore allowed the appeal. Whilst we disagree with the PAT's decision, such decisions can only be challenged on a point of law. There is no point on which MOD can mount an appeal.

 Royal Navy and French Navy ships are occasionally attached to our respective Task Group deployments on a purely bilateral basis. The most recent attachments were those of FS Primauguet to the Naval Task Group (NTG) 2003 between 17 to 29 January 2003 and the French Minehunter, FS Cassiopee, to a Royal Navy Mine Countermeasure Group between 21 January to 7 March 2003. This followed the attachment of FS Aconit during the NTG 2000 deployment which built on the successful integration of HMS Somerset, followed by HMS Grafton, in the French Task Group during operations in the Adriatic in 1999. Such integration between our naval forces is considered routine business.

 Five RN submarines are Tomahawk capable. Three are currently fully operational, with the fourth, HMS Spartan, undergoing sea trials before returning to the fleet in mid 2003, and the fifth, HMS Trafalgar, undergoing a fleet time maintenance period planned to complete in the first quarter of 2004.

<a name="30513w07.html_para0">In common with all RN vessels, submarines are subject to improvements and modifications throughout their operational lives.

 There are currently no plans to dispose of any Royal Navy Type 23 frigates earlier than scheduled. The annual financial savings arising from a decision to dispose of a Type 23 frigate prematurely would vary according to the circumstances. An Investment Appraisal would be conducted, including an examination of the resource accounting implications (eg depreciation, cost of capital charges etc.). Any decision, however, would be dependent on the Royal Navy's ability to maintain the required level of capability to meet its current and contingent operational requirements.

 As I made clear in my answer of 24 February <i>Official Report</i>, column 303W, the principal role of the Type 45 Destroyers will be Anti-Air Warfare. However, these ships are being designed and built with significant space and weight margins to enable incremental acquisition should an emerging requirement necessitate a different equipment fit. Our requirements are being kept under review, and the design could be modified, to incorporate improved land attack capabilities, including a cruise missile system such as Tomahawk.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what percentage increases in local government grant were awarded to Worcester City Council in each year since 1992&#150;93.  [112989]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 There are two funding streams to help support revenue funding by local authorities. These are Revenue Support Grant (RSG) and redistributed non-domestic rates (NNDR). It is important to look at the total of these funding streams (formula grant) in order to compare support from central government year-on-year, since the level of non-domestic rates can vary year-on-year.
<P>

<a name="30513w10.html_para10">Since 1997 there have been many changes in local government functions and funding. To enable a like-for-like comparison between years, we calculate adjusted grants. The percentage change figures have been calculated on the basis of these like-for-like comparisons.
<P>

<a name="30513w10.html_para11">However, until the introduction of Central Support Protection Grant in 1999&#150;2000, there was no need to calculate grant on a like-for-like basis. For this reason grant comparisons in the years between 1992&#150;93 and 1998&#150;99 do not make logical sense and are not available. For information, the unadjusted grant amounts for these years are still shown.
<P>

<a name="30513w10.html_para12">The following table shows the amount of formula grant (which consists of RSG, NNDR and SSA Reduction Grant (where appropriate)) received by Worcester City Council during the period. The table also shows the percentage year-on-year changes in formula grant on a like-for-like basis where possible.
<P>

<a name="30513w10.html_para13">The large decrease in formula grant between 1992&#150;93 and 1993&#150;94 represents a significant change in the way formula grant was paid. Up until 1992&#150;93 all formula grant was paid to the billing authority and then paid by the billing authority to other tiers of authority. In subsequent years each authorities grant has been paid directly and hence billing authorities receive less grant.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make it his policy not to apply resource equalisation to the budget of Worcestershire County Council in future financial years; and if he will make a statement.  [112662]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Resource equalisation has been part of the revenue funding system for many years, where it serves an important purpose in helping to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of central Government support between local authorities. It is the Government's intention that an allowance for the differing ability of local authorities to raise income locally from council taxpayers should remain an integral part of the grant distribution system for all authorities.

<P>
<a name="30513w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The existing eight Regional Chambers call themselves Assemblies, but they are not shadow bodies for the elected regional assemblies, whose potential remit was described in the 2002 White Paper "Your Region, Your Choice". The Chambers initially came together voluntarily to act as a focal point for considering issues of regional interest.
<P>

<a name="30513w11.html_para0">The Chambers are designated under the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 as representative regional bodies to scrutinize the plans and activities of the Regional Development Agencies. As of 1 April 2003, they have all chosen to become Regional Planning Bodies responsible for keeping regional planning guidance (RPG) under review and preparing any draft revisions as necessary. They collectively receive government grant of &#163;11 million a year for these

<P><I>13 May 2003 : Column 173W</I><P>
purposes. An additional &#163;3 million is being made available from the Planning Delivery Grant fund for the purpose of improving their performance in the review of RPG.

<P>

<a name="30513w11.html_para1">To meet the criteria for designation and receipt of grant their membership needs to be representative of the range of views and interests within the region. The Government expect at least 30 per cent. of Assembly measures to come from stakeholder groups, representative of business, trades unions, environmental, consumer and other groups. The remainder come from local government, and reflect the broad political balance across the region. The Government are not prescriptive about the size of the Assembly, provided that these criteria are met, and both the size of the Assembly and the selection process for membership vary from region to region.

 Local authorities have a discretionary duty to provide sites based on need within their area. Where they identify a need, they would be expected to fund it. Planning policies concerning the provision of suitable locations for gypsy sites, whether local authority provided or private, is set out in the Department of Environment Circular 1/94 'Gypsy Sites and Planning'.

<a name="30513w12.html_para2">In 2001, the Government made &#163;17 million over three years via the Gypsy Site Refurbishment Grant. The grant allows local authorities to bring unused or under-used sites back into full use; and/or improve the facilities on sites; and to create new transit or emergency stopping sites. Bidding guidance and application forms are sent out to local authorities in the autumn. The guidance sets out the purpose for the scheme, how to bid, the criteria for assessment and conditions for payment.

 The National Standards for under 8s child minding require that childminders should normally look after no more than one child under one-year-old. Ofsted guidance indicates that each case should be considered on its merits. Exceptions can be made to accommodate siblings. The National Standards were finalised in 2001 after extensive consultation. We are reviewing the Standards this year and, alongside other matters, are proposing to allow child minders to care for more than one baby under one if child minders have the necessary experience or training.

 The Learning and Skills Council's published rates show that the basic cost to the public purse of delivering three A-levels to a student in 2002/03 at an English maintained secondary school was &#163;2,899.

This figure comprises &#163;663 for the delivery of each A-level course, and &#163;697 for each student for the enrichment of their learning programme. In each case additional funding may also be available to take account of the higher costs of delivering learning in particular geographical areas, in higher cost subjects, or to students with particular disadvantages or individual needs. We expect the funding gap between school sixth forms and sixth form colleges to narrow over the 2003/06 period while maintaining the real terms guarantee for school sixth forms.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what examples of best practice from other countries in Europe he plans to introduce to enhance Government plans to encourage literacy throughout the UK.  [112451]<P>

<P>
<a name="30513w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The international 'Progress in Reading Literacy Study' (PIRLS), showed that our primary school pupils were the third most able readers in the world, and that England was the most successful English speaking country. This demonstrates the international success of our National Literacy Strategy which has led to dramatic improvements since its introduction in 1998. The number of 11-year-olds achieving the expected level for their age (Level 4) in English rose by 10 percentage points between 1998 and 2002.
<P>

<a name="30513w13.html_para2">The National Literacy Strategy has from its inception benefited from international research such as PIRLS to support teachers. Important elements of its guidance to teachers, including Progression in Phonics, Grammar for Writing and Developing Early Writing, have drawn on experience in other countries. We will, of course, continue to refine the Strategy to ensure that it reflects international best practice and research evidence, so that all children fulfil their potential. We will shortly be publishing a strategy document on primary education, which will set out how we intend to build on the success of the NLS.

 The Digital Television Action Plan includes actions to ensure that digital television equipment and services are widely accessible. In 2001, the Government appointed CRSP, Loughborough University, to scope the human aspects of adopting digital television, including the needs of disabled people. The report was published in March 2002 and the recommendations fed into the Action Plan. The Action Plan's Technology and Equipment Group (comprising manufacturers, broadcasters, software/application providers and consumer groups) has an ongoing action to analyse the needs of disabled people and made reference to the issue in its first report. Copies of the reports are available on www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk.

Within the next few weeks we will be sending an advance team of administrators and archaeological professionals to join the US Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Aid (ORHA) in Iraq. Working with Iraqi colleagues they will be able to reach rapid conclusions about the extent of the damage to Iraqi museums and sites and to begin the process of making an inventory of missing objects.

<P>
<a name="30513w15.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Development Plan Programme set out in Planning Service's Corporate and Business Plan 2002&#150;03 indicated that the Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan (BMAP)&#151;Draft Plan would be published before the end of the 2002&#150;03 financial year.
<P>

<a name="30513w15.html_para3">A number of important research studies being carried out by, or on behalf of, the Plan Team, required ward level data from the 2001 Census. As this data was not published until 19 December 2002, I agreed a revised timetable with members of the Political Group, representative of the six Councils in the Belfast Metropolitan area, which oversees the process and which I Chair. This revised timetable allowed for completion of the research, and indicated that the Draft Plan would be published in September 2003.
<P>

<a name="30513w15.html_para4">A number of factors outside the control of the Plan Team now mean that it will not be possible to meet that timescale.
<P>

<a name="30513w15.html_para5">Following an initial round of consultation meetings between the BMAP Team and the Councils within the Plan area, a number of Councils have written requesting an extension to the consultation timeframe. I have agreed to this request.
<P>

<a name="30513w15.html_para6">The amended consultation timeframe, together with the fact that a number of inputs to the BMAP process from other bodies will not be available until May/June, will result in the final Council consultation being delayed until late summer. While this delay is unavoidable, it is essential that the new timetable is strictly adhered to, in order that the plan process remains within an appropriate timeframe.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The Northern Ireland Executive consulted on three of the Disability Rights Task Force's recommendations on the definition of disability in "Improving Civil Rights for Disabled People" in September 2001.
<P>

<a name="30513w16.html_para4">The majority of respondents to that consultation supported the recommendations on the definition: recognising HIV as a disability from the point at which it is diagnosed; recognising cancer (provided it is symptomatic) from the point of diagnosis as being a condition that is likely to require substantial treatment; and making it easier for people who are blind or partially sighted to be recognised as having a "disability" within the meaning of the Disability Discrimination Act.
<P>

<a name="30513w16.html_para5">The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI) will also be making recommendations to Government following their recent review of the Disability Discrimination Act in Northern Ireland. These may include further recommendations on the definition of disability.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w16.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Department for Transport consulted on 29 November 2002 on the proposal to remove the exemption for transport services in Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in relation to GB. Once the outcome of this consultation is known it will be for the Department of the Environment and the Department for Regional Development to consider the implications for Northern Ireland and decide what action is appropriate. Any proposed action will be subject to public consultation in Northern Ireland but it is not yet possible to give a timescale for this.

 The former Northern Ireland Executive agreed the Promoting Social Inclusion (PSI) priorities and the Terms of Reference and membership for the Working Group which was tasked with developing the strategy on 31 May 2002. The Group met for the first time on 2 July 2002.
<P>

<a name="30513w16.html_para7">The original Programme for Government target for the strategy was December 2002. Work on the draft strategy requires close cross-departmental input and agreement on how best to implement the actions flowing from the Executive's response to the Disability Rights Task Force recommendations. Active consideration of other non-legislative issues relating to access to information, services and equipment by people with disabilities has been carried out. This has been a particularly important aspect of the work as it links in with work on the European Year of People with Disabilities (EYPD) 2003 which is of high priority and will raise public awareness of issues affecting people with disabilities.
<P>

<a name="30513w16.html_para8">It is currently planned to publish the strategy in summer 2003. However, the delay in publishing the strategy has not resulted in delay in progressing the actions to be included within it.

<a name="30513w16.html_para9">The Group's remit also includes wider issues raised during the consultation process such as barriers to the provision of services and equipment for people with disabilities and taking forward this part of the strategy has involved representatives of disability groups. A focus group meeting was convened (last September) comprising representatives from those groups who had responded to the questions on barriers to services and equipment in the consultation exercise. Full and active consideration of those views is on-going as part of the Working Group's deliberations on the strategy.

 No additional patients have commenced treatment with these specialist medicines since 1 January 2003 because recruitment of the necessary specialist staff, as explained in the answer referred to, has not yet been completed. Interviews have now taken place for extra nursing staff, who are expected to be in post no later than June 2003 and regional joint medical/nursing clinics are in the process of being set up.

<i>(a) Civic Forum</i>
<P>

<a name="30513w17.html_para3">Funding for the Civic Forum ceased during suspension. As a result staff in the Civic Forum Secretariat have been redeployed on other duties.
<P>

<a name="30513w17.html_para4"><i>(b) North-South Ministerial Council</i>
<P>

<a name="30513w17.html_para5">The North-South Ministerial Council cannot meet during suspension. The 25.5 whole time equivalent staff employed in the Joint Secretariat are currently engaged in providing administrative support associated with the care and maintenance of the North/South Implementation Bodies and a range of other duties.
<P>

<a name="30513w17.html_para6"><i>(c) North-South Implementation Bodies</i>
<P>

<a name="30513w17.html_para7">At the latest date for which staffing figures are available, there are 486.6 whole-time equivalent staff employed in the North-South Implementation Bodies.
<P>

<a name="30513w17.html_para8"><i>(d) British-Irish Council</i>
<P>

<a name="30513w17.html_para9">The British and Irish Governments provide the Secretariat for the British-Irish Council in co-ordination with officials from each of the other members. In addition to servicing the work of the Council, the officials are involved in carrying out a range of other duties. It is therefore not possible to identify detailed staff numbers in respect of those functions which relate to the Secretariat.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the status is of the North-South Implementation Bodies following the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly.  [85883]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The Implementation Bodies were established under the Implementation Bodies Agreement of 9 March 1999 made between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland. That Agreement also conferred functions on the Bodies. The Agreement was incorporated into the domestic law of Northern Ireland by the North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) (NI) Order 1999. Following suspension it is the intention of the British and Irish Governments that the Bodies should be able to continue to perform their essential functions.

<P>
<a name="30513w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Monitoring of assessments carried out by Health and Social Services Trusts indicates that, since October 2002, approximately 1,400 people in nursing homes have been assessed for contributions towards the costs of their nursing care.

 The average period of time from an assessment for nursing care payments taking place until payment is received by the patient's nursing home is four weeks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the average length of time spent with a patient by medical staff has been when carrying out an assessment for a contribution to nursing care.  [100875]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 A nursing needs assessment is completed by a nurse. If any other needs are identified the appropriate professional will be asked to contribute to the assessment. Clients who agree to a nursing needs assessment undergo a specific assessment process using the agreed needs assessment tool. The average time spent by nursing needs assessors with a patient undergoing the assessment is 90 minutes. The assessment times can increase or decrease depending on the clients health and ability to participate, the information within nursing and medical notes, the representative/carers input to the assessment and the nursing home staffs evaluation of a clients needs. Further information may also be necessary in order to reach a decision.

introduce the right of third party appeals in the planning process in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement.  [108173]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w18.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 There is no proposal, at present, to introduce third party appeals to the Northern Ireland planning process. When the Draft Planning (Amendment) (NI) Order 2003 was being considered by the House of Commons I indicated that I was commissioning a Regulatory Impact Assessment of the impact which third party appeals would have, if introduced. When complete, this will be published as part of a full consultation paper. Any decision to introduce third-party appeals in advance of that consultation would be premature.

<P>
<a name="30513w18.html_spnew5"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Royal Warrant for the Special Constabulary Long Service Medal is in the process of being revised to allow service in the Police Service of Northern Ireland Reserve to be aggregated with previous service in the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve for the purpose of eligibility for the award of the Medal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w18.html_spnew6"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 In the latest competition for administrative assistants in the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which took place in May 2002, 264 candidates were found suitable for inclusion in the merit pool. Of these, 26 were classified as having a Roman Catholic community background, and 238 as having a non-Roman Catholic background. 52 were, therefore, appointable under current legislation, all of whom will be offered a post.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland whether it is his policy that past terrorist atrocities which have not resulted in charges or convictions should not be investigated by the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  [102091]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 No. Whether a criminal investigation is reopened by the PSNI is a matter for the Chief Constable. When there are calls for public inquiries into past incidents, the Government have to decide on a case by case basis the most appropriate course of action. In doing so the Government's priority is that those responsible should be convicted and that the whole truth should emerge. In many cases I believe that criminal investigations represent the best way of achieving this.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w18.html_spnew8"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The 50:50 recruitment arrangements apply only to police trainees. They do not apply to lateral entry at ranks above constable. Serving police officers in both the Garda Siochana and police services in Great Britain are therefore subject to the 50:50 arrangements if they apply to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland as police trainees. The proposed new arrangements provided for by clause 19 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill, to enable fixed term appointments of up to three years to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, will apply only to the ranks of sergeant to Chief Superintendent. The 50:50 recruitment arrangements will therefore not apply to appointments under this scheme.

<P>
<a name="30513w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Article 11 of the Criminal Justice (NI) order 1980 empowers the Secretary of State to approve a list of registered medical practitioners for the performance of Coroner's post mortem examinations. The list is compiled by the Secretary of State on the advice of the State Pathologist.
<P>

<a name="30513w19.html_para0">The current list is made up from forensic pathologists on the staff of the State Pathologist's Dept and named hospital pathologists attached to the Royal Victoria Hospital or the Belfast City Hospital. SPD staff will be engaged to conduct the majority of coroner's cases, especially post mortem examinations involving deaths, which might result in serious criminal charges being prepared, or where medical negligence or neglect has been alleged.
<P>

<a name="30513w19.html_para1">Hospital pathologists currently conduct coroner's cases when the death of a patient has occurred in one of the Belfast teaching hospitals (Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast City Hospital, Mater Hospital and Ulster Hospital). In some circumstances eg paediatric deaths, autopsies are carried out jointly between a member of the State Pathologist's Department and a paediatric pathologist, while in others, specialist advice such as neuropathology, may be sought by the State Pathologist.

<P>
<a name="30513w20.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what research the State Pathology Department undertakes in Northern Ireland.  [102016]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 It is the policy of the State Pathologist's Department to use where appropriate, the valuable information gained from conducting post mortem examinations, particularly in areas such as sudden infant deaths, suicides, terrorist related deaths and genetic disorders. This information may be of tremendous value, particularly in inherited diseases for genetic counselling and in other instances for providing advice and guidance in preventing further similar deaths.
<P>

<a name="30513w20.html_para0">In conveying such information, the anonymity of the deceased is protected. If relatives decide to donate tissue or organs specifically for research, the State Pathologist's Department must have their written consent to do so.
<P>

<a name="30513w20.html_para1">The State Pathologist's Department does not use material derived from Coroner's post mortem examinations to conduct research. Such material is solely taken to assist in the ascertainment of the cause of death, or if required for evidential purposes in suspected criminal cases.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment he has made of the effect changes to the common funding formula, and in particular changes to threshold funds, will have on funds available for teachers' salaries.  [100977]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w20.html_spnew1"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The intention is to introduce the common formula in the calculation of school budgets for 2004&#150;05.
<P>

<a name="30513w20.html_para2">All changes to the common formula, when in place, will be subject to detailed modelling and consultation with education interests. There is no separate allocation for teacher costs within LMS formulae and schools may therefore decide for themselves the staffing complement and the organisational structure.
<P>

<a name="30513w20.html_para3">The inclusion of threshold resources within school delegated budgets in 2003&#150;4 means that, on average, school budgets will increase by between 8 per cent. and 11 per cent. depending in which area the school is located. In common with longstanding arrangements any school with a financial difficulty should contact its funding authority which will consider what additional financial support can be made available under its LMS Scheme and taking account of its responsibilities for other schools in its area.

 There is currently a hold on deciding all asylum claims from Iraqis. However, there is no question of people recently engaged in hostilities against British forces being granted asylum or Humanitarian Protection.
<P>

<a name="30513w21.html_para0">Despite the hold, all Iraqi asylum applicants are fingerprinted and checked against the Immigration Service Warnings Index computer system. As part of the

<P>

<a name="30513w21.html_para3">In addition, any other person whether asylum seeker or refugee who poses a threat to national security will be denied the protection of the Refugee Convention.

 As part of the initial screening process asylum seekers are required to provide proof of residence at a particular address and are issued with an Application Registration Card (ARC) containing their details and fingerprints. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) maintains databases containing the information supplied, which is also recorded in the individual Home Office file. For those subject to a reporting regime, place of residence is verified during the reporting event. Measures are now in place to increase the numbers of asylum seekers subject to reporting conditions, which will reduce the numbers absconding. All applicants, and their representatives, are told of their obligation to notify the Home Office of any subsequent change of address.
<P>

<a name="30513w21.html_para7">The Immigration Service has eight designated reporting centres to assist in managing reporting regimes and, in addition, a person may be required to report to a police station near their address.

 The Strategy Unit report is a report to Government and does not represent settled Government policy.

 There is no centrally held data on the charities and charitable organisations, which provide public services either alongside or in addition to services provided by central and local government. However, the Treasury Cross Cutting Review on 'The Role of the Voluntary and Community Sector in Service Delivery' published in September 2001, considered Government flows of funding&#151;as grants and/or contracts&#151;to the voluntary and community sector. On the basis of research conducted by the Home Office, it is estimated that, in 2000&#150;01, central Government Departments and their associated agencies/non-departmental public bodies provided funding spent in excess of &#163;1.8 billion through voluntary and community organisations in England.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The Home Office has adopted the corporate civil service target that staff with disabilities should comprise three per cent of the Senior Civil Service (SCS) by 2005. At present the department has no known staff with disabilities at that level but arrangements are in place to support people who have disabilities when they apply for jobs in the Home Office, and to support such staff once appointed in their development and progression. Representation of staff with disabilities has risen at junior and middle management levels and it is hoped that this will feed through into more senior levels including the SCS. The department operates a guaranteed interview scheme for candidates with disabilities applying for external and internal vacancies, provided they meet minimum post requirements. Where necessary reasonable adjustments are made and special equipment provided for staff with disabilities, both at the workplace and in selection and promotion procedures, including selection for the department's Intensive Development and Fast-track Nomination schemes. The Home Office is currently engaged in external recruitment to senior grades and is taking steps to draw this to the attention of disability groups. The department participates in the Cabinet Office Disability Bursary Scheme, designed for staff with potential for early promotion to senior levels, the Cabinet Office summer placement scheme for disabled graduates and the Cabinet Office-chaired Disability Working Group, which is examining ways of raising the representation of people with disabilities in the SCS.
<P>

<a name="30513w22.html_para0">There is evidence, from a Home Office staff survey in 2001, of a significant gap between the numbers of staff who declare disability and the actual position. Against this background, the department is exploring ways of persuading staff of the value of declaring their disability. The department has facilitated and resourced the establishment of the Home Office Disability Support Network (HODS), to provide support and encouragement to staff with disabilities and advice to the department about their needs. The membership of HODS has recently risen to 350.

 The Compact on Relations between Government and the Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS) in England, published in November 1998, provides a framework of principles and undertakings, which should underpin the relationship between the Government and voluntary and community in England. The Compact is supported by four Codes of Good Practice covering: funding; consultation and policy appraisal; black and minority ethnic and community organisations; and volunteering. The Compact Code of Good Practice on Funding makes a number of recommendations that are designed to ensure coherence and clarity in Government funding programmes.
<P>

<a name="30513w22.html_para2">Fostering productive networking, learning and knowledge transfer among partner organisations is achieved in a variety of ways both nationally and regionally. The main mechanism is through the 18 regional voluntary sector networks consisting of a general and a black and minority ethnic network in each of the nine regions, which are funded by the Active Community Unit. The Regional Voluntary Sector Networks exist to increase the effectiveness of the VCS in each region, to unlock further funding at the regional level and to advocate effectively at the regional level.

<P><I>13 May 2003 : Column 215W</I><P>
ensuring that when the sector wishes to engage in service delivery there are no unnecessary barriers from both central and local Government. The Cross Cutting Review contains recommendations concerned with strengthening the sector, simplifying bureaucracy and getting the funding relationship between government and the sector right. It also recognises that if the expertise of the voluntary and community sector is to be used in the delivery of public services it is vital that the sector's right to independence is protected, separate to any funding relationship with Government that might exist.

 The Government are considering the extent to which action at ED level on these matters is appropriate. The Green Paper published by the Commission does not contain firm proposals for action but rather identifies certain basic rights and poses a number of questions about the setting of minimum standards in these areas. The Government believe that any future proposals for EU measures should be based on the principles of mutual recognition and subsidiarity and assist the process of tackling cross-border crime by ensuring that suspects or defendants are not discriminated against when subject to criminal proceedings in another EU country.

 <i>[holding answer 8 April 2003]:</i> There is currently a hold on deciding all asylum claims from Iraqis. However, there is currently no question of Iraqi prisoners of war in the UK being granted asylum or Humanitarian Protection. Despite the hold, all Iraqi asylum applicants are fingerprinted and checked against the Immigration Service Warnings Index computer system. As part of the initial screening process, all claimants are interviewed comprehensively about the routes and methods employed to reach the UK.
<P>

<a name="30513w23.html_para0">Any cases giving rise to security concerns are immediately referred to the appropriate agencies. When decision-making is resumed, all claims will be considered on their individual merits against the circumstances which then apply in Iraq. But anyone who commits a war crime or is guilty of terrorist acts will be denied asylum, as the Refugee Convention requires. So, too, will anyone committing a serious non-political crime before arrival in the UK.
<P>

<a name="30513w23.html_para1">In addition, any other person whether asylum seeker or refugee who poses a threat to national security will be denied the protection of the Refugee Convention.
<P>

<a name="30513w23.html_para2">It will not be possible to establish a claim for asylum simply on the basis of having been a Ba'ath Party official, of having supported Saddam Hussein or having been forced to join the party or fight against UK/US troops.

<a name="30513w23.html_para3">We do not expect Iraqis to face persecution following its liberation. We therefore envisage the progressive return ofIraqis to their country now that large scale combat operations are over. They will have an important role to play in rebuilding Iraq's economy and civic society.

In April 2001 an independent external evaluation showed that the initiative benefited both black and minority ethnic organisations and mainstream voluntary organisations. The evaluation contained a number of recommendations for building on the successes of the initiative. They have been taken forward as part of the Home Office Active Community Unit's work with the voluntary sector.

Reporters are invited to complete this electronic questionnaire after completing an electronic report. An evaluation will be carried out in November 2003, in order to assess the impact of and the nature and quality of information received on electronic yellow cards.

<a name="30513w25.html_para7">The Energy White Paper, "Our Energy Future&#151;Creating a Low Carbon Economy", made clear the importance the Government attach to improving energy efficiency in its own estate. This is reflected in several targets. There is currently an interim target of a 1 per cent. per annum ongoing reduction in weather-corrected carbon emissions, pending the development of new indicators and targets based on benchmarking the performance of each department's largest buildings. These new targets are planned to be in place later this year. New targets for Government Departments' use of combined heat and power generated electricity will also be established during 2003.
<P>

<a name="30513w25.html_para8">In addition, the review of Government procurement has identified areas where procurement could reinforce the achievement of these targets, and arrangements are being made centrally for Departments to purchase goods with high energy efficiency standards and which provide good value for money.
<P>

<a name="30513w25.html_para9">The Department of Health has a good record on the environmental management of its own estate and continues to seek ways of improving its performance. Against the Government target that five per cent. of Departments' electricity should come from renewable sources by 30 March 2003, the Department has been purchasing renewable energy for the majority of its London administrative buildings since November 2001. This effectively reduces carbon to air emissions by 39 per cent. per annum.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The minimum practice income guarantee (MPIG) forms part of the proposed new general medical services contract. It will ensure that any practice which would have lost income as a result of the introduction of the global sum arrangements will receive funding equal to its previous level of income from those aspects covered by the global sum providing it meets minimum standards of quality.
<P>

<a name="30513w26.html_para0">The British Medical Association and NHS Confederation have announced details of the MPIG for the first two years of the new contract. Beyond 2005&#150;06, the application of the MPIG will be considered in the light of the review of the allocation formula.
<P>

<a name="30513w26.html_para1">The costs of the MPIG are estimated at &#163;393 million in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;293 million in 2005&#150;06 in England. These costs form part of the financial envelope for primary care investment already agreed between the NHS Confederation, the BMA and Government and which remains unchanged.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health by when he expects the GP contract will come into force.  [110325]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30513w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Should the profession vote in favour of the contract, and subject to parliamentary approval of the necessary legislation, the Government's intention is that the implementation timetable would be as set out in chapter 8 of "Investing in Primary Care&#151;the new GMS contract". This lists which elements would be introduced from 2003&#150;04 and elements which would be introduced from 2004&#150;05.

 If accepted by the profession, the new national general medical services (CMS) contract will apply to all CMS practices including those in London. Personal medical services contracts will continue as a permanent complementary local option.
<P>

<a name="30513w26.html_para2">In recognition of the particular problems faced by practices in the London area, the new CMS contract provides for an off-formula addition to the funding available to London practices. In 2004&#150;05, this would amount to &#163;53 million. Taken with the recently announced minimum practice income guarantee this means that no practice in London would lose against their global sum equivalent, so long as they continue to provide the same or a greater range of services and meet minimum quality standards. They would gain from the considerable additional funding provided for primary care&#151;a 33 per cent. increase United Kingdom-wide by 2005&#150;06.

Our proposals for improving services for people with learning disabilities, their families and carers are set out in the White Paper Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century (Cm. 5086), published in March 2001.

These include the establishment of a joint group with the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) to develop a programme to address disability equality issues; placing a new duty on national health service bodies to involve and consult patients and the public (including disabled people and groups) in developing services; as part of a wider equalities and diversity strategy for the NHS workforce commissioning the NHS University to lead development of a new disabilities awareness training plan which will consider with the Leonard Cheshire Foundation and the DRC how best to use the 'Working with Disability' learning package; and supporting primary care providers in ensuring that their premises comply with the Disability Discrimination Act.

 The Government's strategy for the development of child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), initiated in 1999&#150;2000, is making progress with the aim of improving the overall quality and accessibility of local services for children and young people with mental health problems. In the four years ending 31 March 2003, we invested &#163;105 million in CAMHS developments across the National Health Service and local authorities, which resulted in significant increases in staffing, new or expanded services and better joint working between the main providing agencies.
<P>

<a name="30513w27.html_para0">Our objectives for the further development of CAMHS, set out in the Department's Priorities and Planning Framework 2003&#150;2006 "Improvement, Expansion and Reform", include year-on-year increases of at least ten per cent across the service according to agreed local priorities leading to a comprehensive service in all areas by 2006. These developments will be underpinned by additional central investment of some &#163;250 million over the three years and by guidance contained in the new children's national service framework (NSF). The recently published emerging

 The information requested is not available because it is not collected centrally. As the recent pensions Green Paper made clear, however, increasing longevity means that individuals will need to consider their retirement options carefully if they are to get the retirement income they want. The Green Paper contains a range of proposals to allow individuals to both increase their retirement income through saving and extend their working lives.
