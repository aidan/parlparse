Bradshaw:</b> The Rame Head disposal site has received dredged
material from the Plymouth area for over 100 years. A disposal licence
under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 (FEPA) is required
prior to any disposal taking place. No licence would be issued until
the impact of disposing of the material had been fully assessed. The
decision would account for Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on the
precautionary
principle.</p><p><a name="stpa_432"><a name="61128w0002.htm_para11"><a name="061128100000200">The
majority of the dredged material disposed of at Rame Head is sourced
from the Devonport Naval Base on the River Tamar. However, Cattewater
Harbour and ABP Millbay Docks and Lincombe Boatyard have also used the
site. The following tables show the licences issued since 1997 and the
amounts disposed of to the disposal site. Further historical
information is available on

recent Parliamentary questions requesting information on the complaints
dealt with by the Standards Board for England (the Standards Board) and
the Adjudication Panel for England (APE). The Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government has asked the Standards Board to reply
directly to your request. I am copying this reply to her
officials.</p></ul><a name="61128w0011.htm_brev1"><a name="0611293000579"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
information you have requested has been placed in a table format for
ease of reference. The table is on the enclosed sheet. In summary, 91
per cent. of cases referred to them have been upheld by the
APE.</p></ul><a name="61128w0011.htm_brev2"><a name="0611293000580"><ul><p class="tabletext">We did not refer
any completed investigations for adjudication by the APE until October
2002, since the Code of Conduct was not approved by Parliament until
November 2001. You may also note that there were a relatively high
number of cases referred to the APE in the financial year 2002-2003.
This is because a majority of the first cases referred to the APE were
register of interest cases that involved parish councillors who were
opposed to the register of interests being imposed halfway through
their term of
office.</p></ul><a name="61128w0011.htm_brev3"><a name="0611293000581"><ul><p class="tabletext">You will also
note from the table of statistics that the APE received and determined
fewer cases than the Standards Board referred to it. This is because
when the APE receives multiple cases about the same member it will
normally consider all the cases at the same time, and therefore
consider them as a single
case.</p></ul><a name="61128w0011.htm_brev4"><a name="0611293000582"><ul><p class="tabletext">There is also a
disparity in each year between the numbers of cases the APE received
and the number it determined. This is because the APE will receive
cases near the end of a financial year that it will subsequently
determine in the following financial year. The normal handling time,
allowing for circulation of papers and responses, is around 16
weeks.</p></ul><a name="61128w0011.htm_brev5"><a name="0611293000583"><ul><p class="tabletext">We have been
able to provide you with the number of cases referred to the APE by the
Standards Board since 2001 by region. However, we do not collate this
regional information by each type of authority so I am unable to
provide you with this information broken down between parish/town
councils and the other remaining local authorities. This is however an
area of our statistical analysis that we will look to provide in the
future.</p></ul><a name="61128w0011.htm_brev6"><a name="0611293000584"><ul><p class="tabletext">We cannot
provide any statistics on complaints relating to local authorities in
Wales as, under the &#147;Local Government Act 2000&#148;, the
Standards Board does not have the power to consider complaints against
members of local authorities in Wales. Under the Act the Standards
Board only has the power to issue guidance on the Code of Conduct to
Welsh police authorities. It is the Public Service Ombudsman for Wales
that considers complaints against members of local authorities in
Wales, and you would need to contact him direct for any information you
require.</p></ul><a name="61128w0011.htm_brev7"><a name="0611293000585"><ul><p class="tabletext">It is
interesting to note that an increasing proportion of the complaints we
receive are submitted by members of the public. 51 per cent. of the
complaints we received in 2003-04 were from the public, rising to 60
per cent. in 2004-05 and rising further to 64 per cent. in
2005-06.</p></ul><a name="61128w0011.htm_brev8"><a name="0611293000586"><ul><p class="tabletext">I hope that

basket funds in 18 different countries in 2005 and delivered aid
through poverty reduction budget support in 16 countries. In all these
cases, DFID staff reviewed relevant financial information on how funds
were used and participated in meetings with government and donor
partners to discuss
progress.</p><p><a name="stpa_512"><a name="61128w0012.htm_para2"><a name="0611293000388">Around half
of the basket funds were audited by the national audit institution and

no standardised definition of a basket fund. In order to respond to the
question, we have defined it as having a common bank account into which
at least two donors pool resources to support a government to implement
an agreed sector programme or set of activities; and procedures
relating to the operation of the bank account are additional to
government&#146;s own procedures and are governed by an agreement
between government and
donors.</p><p><a name="stpa_515"><a name="61128w0012.htm_para5"><a name="0611293000391">Nearly all
national audit institutions are statutorily independent of the

auditors, although they are the auditors of government&#146;s
expenditure. In many cases and particularly in regard to budget
support, this is the form of independent audit carried out. This reply
distinguishes between audit by the national audit institution and an
audit carried out by a private sector auditor appointed outside normal
national procedures to meet donor
requirements.</p><a name="qn_131"><a name="61128w0012.htm_wqn1"><p><a name="0611293000392"><b><a name="61128w0012.htm_spnew2"><a name="0611293000657">Mr.

review of the UK's energy policy confirmed the Government's view that
security of supply is best ensured by a competitive and liberalised
market-based system. Coupled with a light touch regulatory framework,
this facilitates the short-term balancing of supply and demand, and
provides the price signals and incentives to encourage investment for
the longer term in diverse supplies. Two outcomes from the Energy
Review address security of gas supply: DTI is working to streamline
consent regimes for gas supply infrastructure projects, and is also
consulting on possible ways to further improve the effectiveness of the
current UK gas security of supply arrangements.</p><br>

recommendations and actions for the further strengthening of cancer

high standard. This master file was submitted to the General Dental

Public Safety has been encouraging the introduction of self-management
programmes for a number of long-term health conditions. In 2006-07, the
Department invested &#163;4 million, through the General Medical
Services Contract, in a number of Directed Enhanced Services. The main
aim of this investment is to enable GP practices to provide effective
self management training and action plans for people with asthma or
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and for patients who are
obese.</p><p><a name="stpa_590"><a name="61128w0018.htm_para4"><a name="06112915000339">The Department

recommendations aimed at improving financial management and reporting
in the education and library boards. Following the report, and in the
context of the forthcoming changes to education administration
structures, an action plan was agreed between the three departments
that currently fond the education and library boards which set out 25
specific areas for action or improvement. I understand that 12 of these
actions have already been put in place and that progress is continuing
to be made on a further 11. The remaining improvements will be put in
place in the context of designing the finance a accountability
arrangements that will apply to the new Education and Skills

the new operation started on the 30 October 2006 NCP has experienced
some difficulties in relation to machine maintenance and this has
resulted in some machines being out of order for longer than we would
like. This is in part due to the huge task of transferring the
management of maintenance and replacement of all parking equipment in
Northern Ireland to one central control point. The pay and display
machines currently operating in Limavady Central car park are
relatively old and are soon to be replaced. A computer monitoring
system, linked to the new pay and display machines will enable faults
to be detected as soon as they occur. It is hoped this improved system
will reduce the time machines are out of
