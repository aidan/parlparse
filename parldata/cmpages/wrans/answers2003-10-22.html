<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w01.html_spnew0"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 In April this year, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister launched a review into the current balance of funding for local government. The review has recently completed a period of extensive consultation, and we are now considering a range of options.
<P>

<a name="31022w01.html_para0">Local government has received a record 25 per cent. increase in Government grant in real terms since we took office in 1997&#151;compared with a real terms cut of 7 per cent. under the last four years of the party opposite's time in office.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w01.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Planning Policy Guidance note 17 on Open Space, Sport and Recreation (2002) states that local authorities should ensure provision is made for local sports and recreational facilities where planning permission is granted for new developments, especially for housing.
<P>

<a name="31022w01.html_para1">These facilities can be secured through planning obligations, also known as Section 106 agreements, which are agreed between developers and local planning authorities.

<P>
<a name="31022w01.html_spnew2"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 My hon. Friend asks if the Government will fund council housing departments on the same basis as Arms Length Management Organisations, and the answer to that is no.
<P>

<a name="31022w01.html_para2">As my hon. Friend is aware, the funding available for social housing, although greatly increased under this Government, is inevitably limited; and we wish to use it in ways that will most improve the lives of tenants.
<P>

<a name="31022w01.html_para3">The evidence is that Arms Length Management Organisations enhance the quality of service to tenants. It provides the extra funding needed to improve their homes and the local environment; and it enables the local authority to focus on its strategic housing role.

<a name="31022w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Skinner: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the average council rent is for those <i>(a)</i> local housing authorities with non-transferred housing stock and <i>(b)</i> local council areas where housing stock has been transferred to housing associations and other bodies.  [133766]<P>
<P>
<P>

12. <a name="31022w01.html_wqn5"><B> David Taylor: </B> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what recent representations he has received about the impact on councils in the East Midlands of the new formula funding arrangements.  [133444]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The East Midlands received &#163;220 million more this year than last, an increase of 7 per cent. in general grant and, along with the West Midlands, the largest increase of any region in England. We have not subsequently received many representations from the Midlands. During the earlier consultation on changes to the local government finance system, 20 representations from local authorities and Members of this House were received which related to the East Midlands.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the impact of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002.  [133446]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w01.html_spnew5"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 provides a fairer balance between the rights of landlords and leaseholders. Key provisions of the Act, applying to England, were introduced on 30 September 2002. These included a new Right to Manage, improved rights for leaseholders to challenge unreasonable charges and improved tribunal dispute resolution procedures.
<P>

<a name="31022w01.html_para4">For details of commencement dates in Wales, which I understand are after those of England, I would advise my hon. Friend to speak to the Welsh Assembly.

<P>
14. <a name="31022w01.html_wqn7"><B> Tom Brake: </B> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what recent assessment he has conducted of the impact of council tax on pensioners.  [133447]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w01.html_spnew6"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has not conducted such an assessment. However, council tax benefit, administered by the Department for Work and Pensions, is available to help low income pensioners pay their council tax. Council tax benefit is paid to around 3.9 million households in England, of which around two million are pensioners. With the recent introduction of pension credit, some 1.6 million pensioners will gain benefit and 310,000 will be entitled to benefit for the first time.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will publish the advice that he has offered to Kent County Council on their desire to fix the level of council tax increases for pensioners at the rate of inflation.  [133638]<P>

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister when he <i>(a)</i> received and <i>(b)</i> expects to publish the Inspector's report into the planning appeal against South Cambridgeshire District Council's refusal of planning permission for a Behavioural Neurosciences Centre at Huntingdon Road, Cambridge.  [133445]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w01.html_spnew8"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 This report was received in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on 17 March 2003. It is under active consideration and my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister will issue a decision as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w01.html_wqn10"><B> David Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what powers parish councils have to pay for flood prevention schemes.  [132480]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Section 137 of the 1972 Act permits parish councils to spend up to a given amount in a financial year on items that are 'of direct benefit to their area' in relation to which no other powers of expenditure exist. Flood prevention schemes might be regarded as such an item.
<P>

<a name="31022w01.html_para5">Primary responsibility for flood prevention measures is borne by other public bodies, however, with responsibility for ordinary watercourses generally falling to district and unitary councils.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mrs. Anne Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what steps he is taking to ensure that major new housing development is adequately served by public transport.  [133418]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w01.html_spnew10"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 All major housing development is assessed against PPG13 as part of the planning system, which requires full account to be taken of the provision of, and effects on, public transport.
<P>

<a name="31022w01.html_para6">In addition, in the four growth areas identified in "Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future", proposals for growth are set out in proposed changes to Regional Planning Guidance, which is subject to consultation and examination in public. As part of this 



<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2003 : Column 568W</I><P>
process we are working very closely with the Department for Transport to assess the transport implications and needs of future housing provision. One of the purposes of the RPG process is to test sustainability of proposals for new housing in the Growth Areas, including access to good public transport for new developments.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the role that the Audit Commission plays in advising local authorities who are undertaking large scale voluntary transfer of their housing stock.  [133636]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w01.html_spnew11"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Where the Audit Commission, through the district audit service, is an authority's external auditor, it is a resource that is available to an authority. Therefore, it could advise on the implications of, and risks that, an authority faces in implementing any of the options for delivery of the decent home target for social housing, one of which is to undertake a large scale voluntary transfer.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will publish the advice given to local authorities on communications strategies for those authorities which are undertaking large scale voluntary transfer of their housing stock.  [133637]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w01.html_spnew12"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Advice to local authorities on drawing up their communication strategies for Large Scale Voluntary Transfers is contained in section 4 of the Housing Transfer Manual 2003, published in March 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what proportion of <i>(a)</i> landlords and <i>(b)</i> tenants have signed up to the voluntary tenancy deposit pilot scheme.  [133605]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w02.html_spnew0"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister estimates that 16,000 tenancies were covered by the voluntary tenancy deposit pilot scheme. Not all of these were located strictly within the five pilot areas, so that the estimated take-up rate of 7 per cent. is subject to a margin of error.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment his Department has made of the value of making membership of a tenancy deposit scheme a legal requirement for <i>(a)</i> landlords and <i>(b)</i> tenants.  [133606]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w02.html_spnew1"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Last autumn, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister issued a consultation paper on options for Government intervention in landlords' and letting agents' handling of tenancy monies. This included an assessment of having a mandatory scheme (or schemes). The assessment was based partly on the evaluation of the pilot Tenancy Deposit Scheme carried out by the University of York.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment his Department has made of the need for further terminal capacity at Heathrow Airport in the event that a third runway is built.  [133330]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 For all options for additional capacity that were studied in SERAS, including those on which the Government consulted, an assessment was made of the scale of facilities needed to cater for the forecast additional throughput (eg passenger and freight handling, maintenance, aircraft stands, aprons, cargo, car parking). Layout plans based on those assessments were produced and their impacts appraised. Paragraph 6.6. of "The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom&#151;South East" made clear that these layouts were not definitive proposals. Detailed design will be a matter for the relevant airport developer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 For each of the options presented in the consultation document, the layouts illustrated allowed for adequate terminal capacity to be provided. The precise location of terminal and other facilities would be determined as part of the planning process for any relevant airport development.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Government place a high priority on reducing emissions of air pollutants from road transport. Emissions of particles (PM10) from road transport have reduced by some 50 per cent. over the last decade as a result of progressively tighter vehicle and fuel quality standards. Emissions of ultrafine particles from road transport are much harder to measure. The UK has been at the forefront of an international programme to develop appropriate ways of measuring emissions of these small particles. Once this has been completed, the Government will be in a position to take further steps, should the health evidence indicate that this is necessary.

<P>

<a name="31022w03.html_para6">The main items for substantive discussion were on Fisheries, the most important of which was agreement of a proposal for a regulation on the management of fishing effort in Western Waters. As you know this proposal had been on the table for some time but its adoption had been held up while the Presidency struggled to find a compromise acceptable to as many of the key member states as possible&#151;the UK, Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal. In the event the compromise adopted was acceptable to ourselves, France and Portugal but was opposed by Spain and Ireland, with Belgium abstaining.
<P>

<a name="31022w03.html_para7">The agreed regulation makes provision for an effort-based regime with member states' effort allocations to be based on fishing activity in the reference period 1998&#150;2002. Management zones are to be based on ICES sea areas. This means there is no separate management zone for the Irish Sea as we wished but the Council and Commission have made a joint statement to the effect that fishing effort in previously restricted areas will be closely monitored. In other respects the final outcome is one that offers the UK significant improvements over the text originally tabled last December. These include, in particular:

except for when entering and exiting the hake box, vessels will no longer have to hail in and out on entry and exit from Western waters zones, so substantially reducing industry's compliance costs;

The United Kingdom joined other non-producers in arguing for changes in these regimes to follow closely the pattern of reforms agreed in June for others. In particular, a substantial level of decoupling should be the norm, with the option for more if member states wished to move in that direction.

 The Government has set a domestic goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. The policy framework for delivering this goal is set out in the UK Climate Change programme.
<P>

<a name="31022w03.html_para11">In the Energy White Paper, we accepted the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's (RCEP) recommendation that the UK should put itself on a path towards a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of some 60 per cent. from current levels by about 2050. The Energy White Paper sets out long-term strategies and shorter-term policies to put us on this path. The Sustainable Energy Policy Network comprising units from Central Government, energy regulators, devolved administrations and key delivery organisations will ensure that these goals and policies are delivered. Part of this is a cross governmental network reporting to a Ministerial Committee co-chaired by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the

<P>

<a name="31022w03.html_para12">To put ourselves on course to cut the UK's carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent. by 2050, we will need to achieve cuts of around 15&#150;25 million tonnes of carbon (MtC) by 2020 in addition to the carbon savings from existing policies including the Climate Change Programme. The actual measures needed to reach this goal will be shaped by economic and technological developments. However, in reducing carbon dioxide emissions the government's priority is to strengthen renewables and energy efficiency.

 The Rural Enterprise Scheme (RES) is delivered by Defra's Rural Development Service (RDS), but running costs are not available broken down by both scheme and region.

RDS running costs are not funded from RES programme expenditure, however &#163;2.6 million expressed as a percentage of the final RES budget for 2002&#150;03 is 16.7 per cent. It is important to note that 2002&#150;03 running cost expenditure relates not just to the in-year budget, but also to the assessment and approval of projects which will incur expenditure in subsequent years; forward funding commitments at the end of 2002&#150;03 amounted to &#163;15.4 million.

<i>[holding answer 21 October 2003]:</i> At the end of last month, the Coal Authority launched an initiative to provide alongside every residential mining report it produces, insurance cover which will mitigate against any loss of property value, up to a maximum of &#163;20,000, attributable to any material change of the mining information revealed in any subsequent mining report on the same property. At the same time the Authority introduced an interpretive mining report service which will provide more detailed analysis and advice about mine entries including a risk assessment as to whether, in the expert opinion of the Coal Authority, the main building of a property is inside or outside the possible zone of ground movement from any reported mine entry.
<P>

<a name="31022w06.html_para4">The Coal Authority has developed these services under the auspices of the Department's Mineshafts Working Group, established last year to explore initiatives which might ameliorate the blighting effect which the proximity of historic coal mineshafts is perceived to have on certain properties, particularly in the West Midlands. The Coal Authority is also investigating the scope for development of non-invasive detection techniques capable of locating mining features in built-up environments. The Authority continues to work closely with property practitioners at a local level with a view to raising awareness of the very low statistical risk which historic mineshafts represent.

 'Statutory undertaker' is a concept found in a wide range of legislation across different sectors. In the electronic communications sector, a person or undertaking (such as a mobile telephone company) is not likely to satisfy any definition of 'statutory undertaker' unless they have had the electronic communications code applied to them by a direction by Ofcom pursuant to section 106 of the Communications Act 2003. The electronic communications code gives certain powers to operators vis-a-vis the installation of apparatus. The criteria which Ofcom must consider in deciding whether or not to apply the electronic communications code to a person or undertaking are set out in section 107(4) of the Communications Act 2003. The position in the gas and electricity sectors is different, as gas and electricity still have a licensing-based regime, whereas electronic communications does not.

 The number of customers who will eventually choose to open a Post Office card account is difficult to predict, at this stage. However, the Post Office card account is only one of a range of banking options available at post offices. All the major high street banks are providing access to a basic bank account through post offices. In addition, the Alliance and Leicester, Barclays and Lloyds/TSB are providing electronic access at post offices to all their current accounts&#151;some 20 million accounts in total. The Post Office also provides cheque based banking services for customers of the Cooperative bank and the internet banks, Smile and Cahoot. The Post Office is in discussion with the banks to modernise these services and to extend commercial arrangements to cover other financial institutions. Universal banking services, together with the Post Office's plans for an expansion of commercial banking arrangements, should lead to an increase in the number of people using post offices to do banking transactions. Wider access to bank accounts at post offices opens up a very much larger market than benefit recipients alone, and this should benefit sub-postmasters both directly and through increased footfall.

Care is taken to ensure that accurate records are maintained by recording all vaccinations on individuals' medical records. Further improvements in medical record keeping will be achieved over the next few years with the progressive introduction of new information technology systems. A number of personnel were not up to date with their Service standard vaccinations. Our policy guidance has been modified to ensure that all troops are now immunised routinely. In June 2002, we announced that our Voluntary Immunisation Programme against anthrax would be expanded, in phases, to the whole of the Armed Forces, including reserves and those essential civilians who were likely to deploy on operations, beginning with those units that were held at the highest readiness.

 Career guidance services in higher education are diverse and varied. There is no statutory obligation for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to provide careers advice and guidance. However, most 



<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2003 : Column 594W</I><P>
HEIs have established their own dedicated careers service. Some use other means, for example through academic departments or other student services; others use a combination of both approaches.
<P>

<a name="31022w08.html_para2">Higher Education Careers Services are funded by HEIs themselves. Each institution makes its own decisions about the level of funding it allocates to careers and other services from its overall funding allocation, according to its individual circumstances.

<a name="31022w08.html_para3">The 2001 report 'Developing Modern Higher Education Careers Services', published following a review commissioned by my Department, included the recommendations that universities should place increased emphasis upon:

<a name="31022w08.html_para4">The Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services (AGCAS), in conjunction with the University of Reading, offers a range of tailored professional qualifications. AGCAS now sets a condition that members must have achieved or be working towards the matrix standard, which is the national quality standard for any organisation delivering information, advice and guidance services on learning and work. In addition the Higher Education Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) has developed a voluntary code of practice for careers education, information and guidance in higher education. The majority of HE Careers Services are members of local Information Advice and Guidance partnerships which are funded by the Learning and Skills Council and which ensure coherence of all adult careers services in their local areas.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many employees in the education service require CRB checks; what the total cost of those checks is; and who pays for them.  [133301]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 All new employees in the education service who have regular contact with children require a CRB check on appointment and some staff need to be checked when they move between posts. Fees for CRB checks are set at 24 for a Standard Disclosure and 29 for an Enhanced Disclosure. Disclosures for volunteers are free of charge. I am not able to provide information on numbers of employees or the total costs involved as my Department does not hold this information. The cost of Disclosures falls to individuals, but some employers may decide to pay the fee on their behalf.

 I have received representations from people objecting to Essex LEA's proposals to charge for home-to-school transport where children attend a denominational school in preference to the local school designated by their LEA. The policy issue is one for the LEA, but several correspondents have raised concerns about the way in which the consultation was carried out. My officials have requested information from the LEA to find out whether the consultation has been conducted in accordance with our regulations.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development pursuant to his answer of 15 July 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 176W, on Iraq, which medical drugs are in short supply in Iraq; and in what quantities.  [132417]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w10.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Recent assessments by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Iraqi Ministry of Health indicate that there are no major shortages of essential medical supplies in Iraq. There are however still reported shortages of some very specialised supplies such as antisera (eg anti snake venom) and some anti-cancer medicines. The supply of anti-tuberculosis medicines has improved after a period of shortage immediately after the war. Some health facilities have reported intermittent shortages of local anaesthetic, probably caused by periods of high demand.
<P>

<a name="31022w10.html_para5">New medicine supply systems in Iraq are not yet fully operational and clear data remains difficult to obtain. WHO is working closely with the Ministry of Health, Kimadia (the Iraqi medical supply distribution agency) and the CPA to address immediate shortages and to establish formulae for likely consumption rates of priority medicines.

 DFID's policy is to provide assistance which responds to the needs of people, especially the poorest, irrespective of the causes of those needs. The main current form of support for vulnerable Iraqis is the Public Distribution System for food rations. DFID is providing assistance to the Ministry of Trade to ensure the continued smooth-running of the system. We are also assisting with plans to reform the system in the medium-term, with a view to ensuring that the needs of the most vulnerable continue to be met.

 The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which forms part of the United Nations Interim Administrative Mission in Kosovo, is the lead agency responsible for the monitoring and protection of human rights in Kosovo.

 DFID supports the contribution that microcredit can make to achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and is working with a range of multilateral and bilateral partners to improve the effectiveness of microfinance. Along with the UN, the World bank and the Regional Development Banks, DFID is a member of the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) which works as a multilateral donor organisation specialising in microfinance, and seeks to harmonise donor approaches to the industry. We encourage all those working in this area to provide assistance within the context of country-owned development strategies.

 The HIV Umbrella Programme in Uganda has an allocation of &#163;6.2 million for 2002&#150;05. Its purpose is to improve the coordination and monitoring of the Uganda's Strategic HIV/AIDS Framework in support of its Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). It also aims to improve the Government of Uganda's capacity to take effective action against HIV/AIDS, and supports service delivery and research on HIV/AIDS by civil society organisations.
<P>

<a name="31022w11.html_para1">The programme was last assessed in September 2003. The review concluded that overall the programme's approach was both strategic and effective. However, the review noted that progress in building the Uganda AIDS Commission's (UAC) capacity to coordinate and monitor the National Strategic Response was slower than anticipated. In response to this finding, DFID will be funding an HIV Adviser, to be located in UAC from November 2003, to assist its staff in technical and organisational management issues, and help facilitate the HIV Partnership in Uganda.
<P>

<a name="31022w11.html_para2">Insecurity in Northern Uganda has made access to health services difficult for many and there is some evidence that the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has targeted health centres (for drugs) and health workers in their attacks. Anecdotal evidence from NGOs suggests that life in crowded camps encourages earlier sexual activity, leading to a higher teenage pregnancy rate and increased spread of HIV. However, no data is available to date on this point, although a nationwide prevalence survey is due to be carried out at the end of the year.

The programme supports the provision of outpatient PAC with manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) services at five tertiary-level hospitals, strengthened training capacity for PAC with MVA at five teaching hospitals, the institutionalisation of PAC training for medical residents, the introduction by Government of Bolivia of the PAC-with-MVA model in secondary-level hospitals in rural areas, and the strengthening of the supply of PAC-with-MVA medical equipment and drugs, for present and future services.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) "Poverty statistics and monitoring" project in partnership with the World Bank, the Russian Ministry of Labour and Social Development and State Statistics Committee.

(b) "Review of poverty issues in Russia" project implemented by London School of Economics. The overall budget is &#163;90,000 for four years (February 2002 to February 2005).

 Early in 2002 independent research was commissioned from Queen's University Belfast (QUB) and University College Dublin (UCD) to investigate the viability of both a New Entrants and an Early Retirement Scheme in Northern Ireland.

 2003 marks the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the UK and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Visits to the UK in September by the Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister, Vu Khoan, and four other Vietnamese Ministers are testimony to the growing breadth and depth of relations. We have regular engagement with the Vietnamese Government on a range of issues: development, trade and investment, and education, as well as political issues, including human rights. The UK is a major investor in Vietnam and DFID's aid programme to Vietnam, currently &#163;25 million, is its fastest growing aid programme in the world.

 Air passenger duty (APD) is payable by aircraft operators. Nearly all airlines pass on the duty charge to their passengers via fares, though whether or not they do so is a decision for the airlines, and it is normal commercial practice for them to charge their customers at the time of ticket sale.

 Existing legislation (Health and Safety at Work, etc Act 1974. and the Management of Health and Safety Regulations 1999) places a general duty on employers to protect the health and safety of their employees and to carry out an adequate risk assessment. These duties apply equally to work-related stress as any other work-place hazard.

 Where an employer has not got appropriate employers' liability insurance, or does not produce a valid certificate of insurance when required to do so, then the Health and Safety Executive will consider prosecution.

<a name="31022w16.html_para0">Each case must be considered on its own merits, and in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. Prosecution decisions will also take account of the time since the date of offence, because offences under ELCI Act 1969 are triable only summarily, which means there is a six-month time limit from the date of the offence to commencing a prosecution.

<a name="31022w16.html_para1">Where there is evidence of non-insurance, and the case is within the statutory time period, then HSE will normally prosecute.

More recent figures from Datamonitor, a leading business information company, show less extreme pricing trends than the OFT survey but support the general picture.

<a name="31022w19.html_para3">However, these figures do not take into account those burglaries which are not reported to the police. The British Crime Survey (BCS) collects information on household burglaries which are both reported and not reported, and figures for numbers of household burglaries for the period 1995 to 2002&#150;03 are reported in HOSB 07/03. These can be used to derive estimates for the total costs (in constant prices) of household burglary over this period are given in Table 2. The BCS does not provide information on burglaries in premises other than households.

<P>
<a name="31022w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Blunkett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 September 2003]:</i> The Department follows the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, Second Edition (1997). The Code supports the policy of extending access to official information and responding to reasonable requests for information. The approach to the release of information in all cases is based upon the assumption that information should be released except where disclosure would not be in the public interest as specified in Part II of the Code. Where information cannot be provided under the terms of the Code an explanation will normally be given.
<P>

<a name="31022w19.html_para5">Responses are not sent to correspondence that is considered to be offensive. Examples of such letters include those that are gratuitously sexually explicit or threaten violence.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the cost was to his Department of media and voice training for ministers and officials in each year since 1997.  [123131]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w19.html_spnew5"><B> Fiona Mactaggart: </B> 
 Media training is available to Ministers and given to selected officials, mainly Prison Service Media Liaison Officers, immigration officers and senior appointees.
<P>

<a name="31022w19.html_para6">No Ministers or officials have been on training courses exclusively for the purpose of voice training. However one minor element of the Government's Centre for Management and Policy Studies' (CMPS) Creating Personal Impact course attended by senior officials does include an introduction to effective use of the voice. It is not possible to break down the cost of this element but since 1997 costs associated with the whole course total around &#163;5,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what assessment of procedures ensuring the safety of prisoners travelling in police vans will be made by <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> another regulatory body;  [132224]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will issue guidance on the introduction of safety belts for prisoners in police security vans;  [132225]

(3) if he will make a statement on recorded injuries to prisoners travelling in police vans in the past five years.  [132226]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="31022w19.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Information is not collected centrally on injuries to people travelling in police vans. Cellular vehicles are not required to have seat belts but under the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations (as amended), all new vehicles built after 1 October 2001 require appropriate anchorage points. The Association of Chief Police Officers issues operational guidance on the use of protected police vehicles. The safety and transportation of people in police vehicles is a matter for the chief officer of police for that area.

<P>
<a name="31022w19.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Gerrard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when, and for what areas, he has signed authorisations for the use by the police of section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000.  [131584]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31022w19.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The use of the section 44 Stop & Search power is authorised by a senior police officer of at least the rank of Assistant Chief Constable. The role of the Secretary of State is to confirm those authorisations.
<P>

<a name="31022w19.html_para8">Between 19 February 2001 and 30 September 2003 a total of 653 authorisations by a senior police officer under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 received confirmation from the Secretary of State. 583 of these relate to English police forces, and 70 to Welsh police forces.
<P>

<a name="31022w19.html_para9">It has been a longstanding policy of this and previous administrations not to comment on anti-terrorist operations. To provide a more detailed breakdown of the areas and times covered by Section 44 authorisations would put into the public domain, information that could prove valuable to terrorists.
<P>

<a name="31022w19.html_para10">Many forces run short term, localised operations for a variety of situations, that are supported by section 44 powers. These can include protective security operations for events or VIPs, intelligence gathering operations or measures taken in response to intelligence and threat assessments. To disclose detailed information on the times and locations of such operations could compromise their future effectiveness.
