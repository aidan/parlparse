 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will publish the cost to benefit ratios of all the transport schemes which he has approved in principle within the last three years, including those agreed for implementation by Transport for London.  [188031]</p>




<p><a name="41013w02.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) is one input into a decision about whether or not a project should go ahead. It shows those impacts that have established monetary valuations. There are often other significant impacts to which a monetary value cannot easily be attached, but which are accounted for when assessing overall value for money (vfm). Environmental and regeneration impacts for example could be very large and could alter the assessment of vfm from that 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Oct 2004 : Column 270W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
implied by looking at the BCR alone. In some cases, where the other impacts of the scheme are sufficiently negative, a high BCR may not mean a scheme offers good vfm. Conversely, in other cases, where the positive impacts are sufficiently large a low BCR may not mean that the scheme offers poor vfm.

In addition to the value for money assessment, there are other considerations that affect whether a project should go ahead, including:

<p>
<a name="41013w02.html_para10">
For local schemes the local authority does a value for money appraisal of the scheme using the New Approach to Appraisal (NATA)&#151;launched in 1998&#151;and submits that to the Department for independent scrutiny. The appraisal is assessed by the Department, and the BCRs listed are the Department&#039;s own best estimate, using the evidence presented in the promoter&#039;s appraisal and the information uncovered during the Department&#039;s own assessment process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41013w02.html_para11">
The schemes were appraised in different years and due to changes in the Government&#039;s appraisal methodology during this period, the BCRs reported have not all been calculated on the same basis, so they are not directly comparable between schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41013w02.html_para12">
The list does not include those schemes agreed for implementation by Transport for London, since the decision to approve such schemes is the responsibility of the Mayor. The exception has been the Thames Gateway Bridge, where the Department have offered to provide some Private Finance Initiative (PFI) credits, and borough streetlighting PFIs. These are included in the table.

Notes:<br>

1. Markham Employment Growth Zone: BCR -3.54<br>

The Markham Employment Growth Zone originated as a response to the Coalfield Task Force&#039;s Report &quot;Making the Difference&#151;A New Start for England&#039;s Coalfield Communities&quot;. It is principally a regeneration scheme for the former colliery and surrounding land. The method of calculating the BCR does not capture the wider economic benefits that the scheme will deliver.<br>

2. Ilkeston-Awsworth Link Road: BCR 0.81<br>

Ilkeston-Awsworth Link Road is justified largely on environmental grounds. The method of calculating the BCR does not capture the environmental benefits that the scheme will deliver.<br>

3. Ryde Esplanade Transport Interchange: BCR 0.36<br>

Ryde Esplanade Interchange is the main entry point to the Isle of Wight. It is primarily aimed at improving the quality of facilities, increasing security and encouraging tourism, which accounts for 24 per cent. of the island&#039;s economy. The method of calculating the BCR does not capture these wider benefits the scheme will deliver.<br>

4. Merseytram: BCR 1.1<br>

The scheme has significant benefits that are not included in the monetised BCR. These include significant regeneration and social inclusion benefits, as well as beneficial impacts on air quality and greenhouse gases.<br>

<p><a name="41013w03.html_spnew0"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 It would be for local transport authorities, including Passenger Transport Authorities and the Mayor for London, to propose new urban underground schemes as part of their plans. Each scheme would need to be considered on the basis of its value for money, including its wider benefits, and affordability. The cost of such schemes means it is unlikely they would be justified except on corridors with the highest level of demand.

 The system of floors and ceilings referred to by the Audit Commission is in place to ensure that all councils receive an increase in funding each year and that there is stability in the funding of authorities. In setting the levels of floors and ceilings, Ministers are mindful of the need to make progression to the allocations implied by the formula in order to deliver the fairer distribution of funding which the formula review produced. We therefore agree with the Audit Commission that there is a balance to be struck in setting the level of the floors and ceilings.

The minimum funding guarantee that was introduced in 2004&#150;05 has brought stability and certainty to schools budgets.

Changes to a local education authority&#039;s funding formulae are matters for local discretion provided that they operate within the framework of the regulations. While the Audit Commission reports that some councils have suspended proposed changes to their funding formula, the survey was based on a sample of LEAs and was carried out before the start of the financial year 2004&#150;05. Evidence from other authorities shows that there is no inherent need to suspend changes to formulae as a result of the minimum funding guarantee. Some authorities, in fact, have used the guarantee to provide transitional protection to ensure that such changes are phased in appropriately to ensure stability in school budgets.

The Department provides capital support for local authorities and schools to invest in school infrastructure, including for the provision of new pupil places. The Department allocates much of its capital resources to local authorities and schools by needs-related formulae, as they can best decide how to target their highest priority needs, in accordance with their asset management planning processes. Local authorities can also negotiate contributions from developers for new school provision, under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as substituted by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991). The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister provides guidance to local authorities about such agreements in its Circular 1/97.

 President Karzai removed Ismail Khan as Governor of Herat on 11 September. Ismail Khan was offered a ministerial post with the Afghan transitional administration in Kabul but has declined it, and currently remains in Herat as a private citizen.

UN buildings were targeted and some UN and NGO staff withdrew temporarily from the city. They have since returned.

<p><a name="41013w09.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 Afghanistan is governed by the Afghan Transitional Administration. President Karzai has acted on a number of occasions to remove regional governors who were ineffective or who were not loyal to central Government. Regional military commanders or warlords are involved in the UN-led process to demobilise and disarm militias. Latest UN figures show that this largely consensual process has succeeded in disarming more than 20,000 militia personnel (which is around a third of the total) and removing around 60 per cent. of heavy weapons from militia control. Kabul was declared free of heavy weapons on 1 September.

 We will support any mechanism for the resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh dispute which both parties can accept and which has a realistic chance of delivering a lasting political settlement. The framework for discussing such mechanisms is the OSCE Minsk Group, co-chaired by Russia, the US and France. While the UK is not a member of the Minsk Group, we support its work and remain in close touch through the UK Special Representative to the South Caucasus, Sir Brian Fall.

The Personal Representative of the OSCE Chairman in Office arranges for periodic observation of the line of control from both the Armenian and Azerbaijani sides. There are no Russian forces in Nagorno Karabakh that we are aware of. At its summit in 1994, the OSCE agreed in principle to the deployment of a multi-national peacekeeping operation, following the conclusion of a political agreement on the cessation of the armed conflict, and established a High Level Planning Group (HLPG) to work on details of an operation. This point has not been reached but high level governmental contacts between Armenia and Azerbaijan continue on a regular basis with and without the facilitation of the Minsk Group.

 This information is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, the Commission has identified more than 450 pieces of legislation which it considers could be repealed or formally recognised as obsolescent, and it will be putting proposals to do this to the Council and the European Parliament. As EU regulatory reform champions, we have strongly supported the Commission&#039;s work in this area and will continue to do so. It should be a priority for the new Commission too, and I welcome Commissioner Verheugen&#039;s comments on the issue in his recent European Parliament hearing. We are also working with EU partners on initiatives to use impact assessments as a basis for competitiveness testing, to simplify existing legislative proposals and encourage the use of alternatives to regulation.

<p><a name="41013w11.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 No British holidaymakers or citizens were airlifted out of Grenada in advance of Hurricane Ivan as there was insufficient warning of its impact. In the days immediately following the hurricane, the British High Commission in Grenada assisted approximately 400 British tourists, EU and Commonwealth nationals to secure flights, including one we chartered, out of Grenada, principally via Barbados. A further 200 British visitors, residents and dual British/Grenadian citizens have since been advised about leaving Grenada. Since 13 September commercial flights, principally via Barbados on regional airlines, have been operating out of Grenada.

We understand from British tour operators with clients in the region that before the hurricane there were around 3,400 holidaymakers.

I have visited Afghanistan for discussions with President Karzai and his Ministers about progress on the strategy. The UK has allocated &#163;70 million over three years to support this work. As a result of those contacts, in the first year of implementation of the strategy the basic counter narcotics structures have been put in place: drug control legislation, a Counter Narcotics Directorate, the Ministry of Interior&#039;s Afghan Special Narcotics Force, the Counter Narcotics Police and a central eradication capability. Work is also in hand to develop alternative livelihoods for farmers dependent on opium poppy cultivation. The measures we have put in place provide a sound basis for future co-operation with the Afghan Government and international partners to secure the further development of robust institutions and programmes to combat opium production and trafficking. Progress remains linked to the wider security situation in Afghanistan and to the implementation of other areas of institution building such as policing and judicial systems.

One of the improvements is to provide widows and widowers pensions for life. To provide a similar improvement in respect of the pre-October 2002 scheme (known as classic), where higher contributions have not been paid, would not only be unfair to the members of premium who are paying higher contributions for enhanced benefits, but would also result in tax payers meeting the additional costs to the classic scheme of doing so.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Oct 2004 : Column 318W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="41013w15.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 The Government commissioned a study in 2003 to see if there are any possible mechanisms, consistent with the objectives of the Energy White Paper, which could be deployed to encourage the control of CMM emissions. This study was undertaken by independent consultants and was overseen by a Advisory Board of representatives from the industry, DTI, DEFRA, and the Coal Authority. The purpose of the exercise was to investigate means for controlling emissions to atmosphere from abandoned mines where the current practice of venting is clearly undesirable. The results of the study are available on the DTI&#039;s website at http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/coal/cfft/coalminemethane.shtml.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41013w15.html_para4">
The study included an assessment of commercially exploiting CMM for power generation or for use as a burner tip fuel. The consultants found that the least cost option for dealing with these methane emissions was through flaring rather than putting them to commercial use. It was also concluded that the potential capacity for power generation, beyond that already exploited by the industry, was limited at less than 20 MW. There was therefore no significant security of supply arguments for specifically encouraging electricity generation from CMM.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41013w15.html_para5">
However, as a result of this study it was proposed that a scheme be established to control CMM emissions, which would be open to all technology options, including electricity generation, burner tip fuel use as well as flaring. Proposals from the private sector to control the emissions would be competitively considered by the Coal Authority and the most cost-effective solution awarded a contract leaving them to decide on the most cost-effective means of control.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41013w15.html_para6">
The Government recognise and value the benefits the coal mine methane technology industry provides by tapping the methane emissions from disused coal mines and putting them to good use for generation of electricity. We have already demonstrated this support through our securing exemption from the climate change levy for electricity generated from CMM which came into force in November 2003, and why the proposed grant-scheme will be open to this technology.

We need to find a solution that reflects the differing labour markets across the EU.
