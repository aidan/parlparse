 None. Aviation security is kept under review at all times and measures are adjusted from time to time. Delays and occasional cancellations may sometimes be necessary but the first priority is always the safety of the travelling public.

 The Department has a PSA target of 12&nbsp;per cent. growth in patronage on local public transport (bus and light rail) in England by 2010&#150;11 compared with 2000&#150;01. We are on track for achieving this national target, with bus and light rail patronage growing by 4&nbsp;per cent. in the first two years of the period, to 2002&#150;03.

<a name="40227w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Randall: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment his Department has made of the cost of bad weather disruption to transport in London in each of the last five years.  [156520]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40227w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 No assessment has been made by the Department about the cost of bad weather disruption to transport in London over the last five years. Responsibility for ensuring London Underground is not adversely affected by bad weather now rests with Transport for London following its transfer last July. Transport for London and London boroughs are also responsible for ensuring London's road network is not unduly disrupted.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40227w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 For legal reasons it is intended that ratification of the Montreal Convention by the European Community and by individual EU member states should be synchronised. The Commission is pressing member states to finalise their internal ratification procedures as soon as possible. The UK is ready to ratify the Convention.

 The Health and Safety Commission and Executive (HSC/E), as the regulator for railway health and safety, work with the industry to improve health and safety on the railways. Details about the work of the HSE are contained in its annual report on the safety record of the railways in Great Britain, copies of which are available in the House Libraries. Two recent key measures to improve rail safety are the fitment of the Train Protection and Warning System which was completed during 2003 and the continuing removal of Mark 1 rolling stock from the network.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40227w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Animal welfare organisations do not have direct access to details of those people who have been convicted of animal cruelty or those disqualified from keeping animals.
<P>

<a name="40227w01.html_para6">However, the department is considering, as part of the proposed Animal Welfare Bill, the introduction of an Animal Welfare Enforcement Database which would assist in the enforcement of animal welfare legislation in England and Wales. It is proposed that the database would include details of those people who have been convicted and disqualified from keeping animals. No decisions have been taken as to whether or not those welfare organisations who currently undertake enforcement work would be able to obtain full access to the database.

<P>
<a name="40227w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We are taking action in many ways, particularly through our active participation in the multilateral environmental agreements which help safeguard endangered species, including the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention on Migratory Species, the Convention on Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. We are also joining with other Governments to fund numerous conservation projects. Good examples include the Global Tiger Forum, the Great Ape Survival Project and a wide range of Darwin Initiative projects which are helping to protect endangered species.

<i>[holding answer 26&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> It is for developing countries to make their own assessment of the potential benefits of GM crops. The Government want to help ensure that if developing countries do use GM products they do so safely, appropriately and effectively to bring real benefits to their people. To assist developing countries make their own informed decisions on the possible use of GM technology the UK supports and has ratified the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, a multilateral agreement which provides a common global basis for risk assessment, decision-making and information exchange on GM crops and other products. Of course, GM technology is only one possible tool, not a panacea.
<P>

<a name="40227w02.html_para0">A recently published report by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics contains a number of case studies detailing the actual and potential benefits of GM crops for developing countries. These are not necessarily related to yield increases but may, for example, involve reduced farmer inputs.

<P>
<a name="40227w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 In line with all employers in the public and private sector, the Government believe that the Civil Service should be allowed to determine retirement age policy with regard to its business needs while giving staff as much choice as possible about when they retire. Departments and agencies are free to set the normal retirement age for their own staff subject only to the requirement that the minimum age at which civil servants can retire with full superannuation benefits is 60.
<P>

<a name="40227w02.html_para6">The normal retirement age for the Senior Civil Service is 60. However, Heads of Departments and Agency Chief Executives have the flexibility to retain members of the Senior Civil Service beyond 60 if they judge it to be in the public interest and are satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties.

<a name="40227w02.html_para7">Against this background, 80&nbsp;per cent. of the Civil Service now has the option to remain in work until 65, and a further 11&nbsp;per cent. has the option to remain in work on short service concessions. Those Departments and agencies which have decided that there is a strong case for retaining a retirement age of 60 in the current circumstances, will be expected to continue to re-examine the issue and look positively at offering more flexibilities to older staff.

<a name="40227w04.html_para4">We recognise that there is a strong regional dimension to the skills problem. Regional Skills Partnerships (RSPs) will be set up in each region to help ensure that the work of different agencies involved in delivering the aims of the Skills Strategy are better co-ordinated and delivered in a way that connects with the needs of employers at regional, local and sectoral levels. Key Partners in the RSPs include the Learning and Skills Council, Jobcentre Plus, the Skills for Business Network, and the Small Business Service. We will be talking to the North West Development Agency and their partners about their plans to set up the Partnership in the North West over the next few months.

 Union Learning Representatives are a key component of the Government's new Skills Strategy. In developing the Strategy, we consulted widely and met with trade union representatives on a number of occasions to discuss the vital role that unions and their learning representatives have to play.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the evidential basis was for his Department's decision to maintain the &#163;30,000 turnover test for sub-contractors to receive gross payments under the Construction Industry Scheme; and what advice he received from the Inland Revenue on this matter during the recent review of the scheme.  [156681]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40227w05.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 There has been a specialised taxation scheme for the construction industry since the 1970s to regulate an industry with a long history of poor compliance on taxation matters. The original scheme required a deduction to be made from payments unless the subcontractor could meet certain standards, which allowed him to be paid gross. However, this system failed to limit the numbers receiving gross payment.
<P>

<a name="40227w05.html_para0">The Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) was introduced in Finance Act 1995 and implemented from August 1999. It tightened up the criteria for gaining a gross payment certificate by requiring all subcontractors applying for gross payment status to demonstrate a minimum level of turnover. This approach proved successful and safeguarded monies that were previously at risk to the Exchequer under its predecessor.
<P>

<a name="40227w05.html_para1">The current review of CIS followed industry complaints about its cumbersome processes. The Chancellor announced, in Budget 2003 that the CIS would be replaced by a new system that will relieve some of the industry's administrative burden.

<P>
<a name="40227w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 Our intention is to introduce legislation so that the accession state nationals who are in the UK but who cannot find work, or will not work, will not have access to Income Support, income based Jobseekers Allowance, Pension Credit, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. After 12 months of working legally without interruption, citizens of EU accession states will be entitled to the full range of UK benefits. Tax credits and Child Benefit will be available to those citizens of EU accession states who are working legally in the UK; Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit may also be available to those workers on low income.
<P>

<a name="40227w09.html_para7">Incapacity Benefit and contribution-based Jobseekers Allowance are contributory benefits. People who have not lived and worked in the UK will not have paid National Insurance contributions and therefore will not normally have entitlement to these benefits.
<P>

<a name="40227w09.html_para8">For Disability Living Allowance and Carers Allowance, a person must have been resident for 26 out of the previous 52 weeks. However, time spent in another EEA or EU country may in some cases be treated as a period in the UK for the purpose of determining entitlement.

<P>
<a name="40227w09.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how the Pensions Bill will affect people in Northern Ireland; and whether there will be any assistance to those who have lost out in pension schemes in the past.  [156099]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40227w09.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Pensions legislation is a devolved matter to Northern Ireland. The provisions of the Pensions Bill therefore generally extend only to Great Britain. The exceptions to this are set out in clause 246, which specifies the provisions that also extend to Northern Ireland. These include those establishing the two new Non-Departmental Public Bodies, The Pensions Regulator and the Board of the Pension Protection Fund, which&#151;as currently with the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority and the Pensions Compensation Board&#151;will operate throughout the United Kingdom, but with functions relating to Northern Ireland conferred by Northern Ireland legislation.
<P>

<a name="40227w09.html_para11">Clause 247 allows provision corresponding to the Pensions Bill to be made for Northern Ireland by Order in Council subject to negative resolution.

<P>

<a name="40227w09.html_para13">We are exploring all the suggestions that have been put to us and are considering them in depth. But there are complex arguments on both sides so we need to consider very carefully what the appropriate course of action should be.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry with whom she has held discussions on her strategy to encourage growth in the broadband and third-generation mobile phone sectors.  [156178]<P>

<P>
<a name="40227w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Since launching the broadband strategy to have the most competitive and extensive broadband market in the G7 by 2005 in 2001, discussions have been held with a wide range of stakeholders throughout the broadband value chain involving the full range of technologies. These discussions were usually held through the Broadband Stakeholder Group, which was established to advise the Government on the development and implementation of a strategy to achieve this target and provide a focal point for stakeholders to address both short and long-term issues related to the deployment and take-up of broadband services. The Government values the work of the Broadband Stakeholder Group and the contribution it has made to the successful deployment of broadband in the UK.

 The primary focus of the Government's strategy is to meet the needs of end-users through the promotion of competition at all levels in the value chain 



<P>
<P><I>27 Feb 2004 : Column 608W</I><P>
in terms of quality, choice of broadband services and value for money. This means the effective and sustainable competition in the provision of broadband networks and services and a regulatory framework that is conducive to further investment and rollout to all areas of the United Kingdom. The third generation mobile phone sector offers not only increased competition and greater consumer choice; it will also provide a true mobile broadband service for individuals and businesses alike.
<P>

<a name="40227w10.html_para0">The Government's policy in licensing spectrum early for the third generation mobile phone sector has enabled the UK along with Italy to launch the first services in Europe. The auction of third generation licences enabled a new entrant, Hutchinson 3G, to enter the market and provide increased competition. The licence condition for third generation mobile phone operators will ensure that at least 80&nbsp;per cent. of the UK population will be covered by third generation services by 2007.

 The Government have set the target of obtaining 10&nbsp;per cent. of our electricity from renewable sources by 2010, with the aspiration of doubling this by 2020.

<P>
<a name="40227w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There are no plans to form UK-French battle groups. There is, however, a UK/French/German proposal to develop European capabilities in support of the EU's ability to undertake rapid crisis response operations. This advances the UK-French Summit declaration made on 24&nbsp;November, and the UN's demand for more rapid reaction peacekeeping forces. As part of the Helsinki Headline Goal, EU member states agreed to develop rapid response elements available and deployable at very high readiness.
<P>

<a name="40227w12.html_para0">The proposal being discussed by EU member states is to create battle group-sized forces (approximately 1,500 strong including Combat Support and Combat Service Support), deployable within 15 days, and sustainable for 30 days (but extendable up to 120 days). The target date for such forces to be available is 2007, and they will be designed for compatibility with typical UN Chapter VII mandates (to restore international peace and security). EU member states would be able to offer such formations individually&#151;as is likely to be the case for the UK&#151;or on a multinational basis, from existing forces. The concept will be developed coherently and transparently with the NATO Response Force. This initiative is compatible with current UK force structures and the UK's Joint Rapid Reaction Force, which already includes a number of very high readiness battlegroup formations. It is not envisaged that any additional military or civilian personnel will be required.

For the future, the age at which the preserved pension is paid to those leaving before age 55 will be deferred from the current age of 60 to age 65. This will affect both the current and the new schemes. We have not decided when to make the change to the existing scheme. The saving from the change to the preserved pension age in the new scheme is some &#163;50&nbsp;million a year and has been used to fund unmarried partners benefits and improved death-in-service benefits, as well as contributing to the costs of increased longevity. The right under the current scheme to take an Immediate Pension from age 38 with 16 years service (Officers) or age 40 with 22 years service (Other Ranks) is not affected.

 The Government believe that any woman considering an abortion must have all the facts to make an informed decision. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) guidance, "The care of women requesting induced abortion" (2000), states that professionals involved in abortion care should be equipped to provide women with information on the long-term effects of abortion which are rare or unproven, including breast cancer.
<P>

<a name="40227w13.html_para1">The RCOG is in the process of updating its guidance. It has carried out an extensive review of the literature and concluded that the evidence shows that induced abortion is not associated with an increase in the risk of breast cancer.
<P>

<a name="40227w13.html_para2">A similar review of recent evidence has taken place in the United States, where the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists also concluded that there was no evidence in the body of medical research to suggest any causal link between abortion and breast cancer <sup>1</sup> .
<P>

<a name="40227w13.html_para3">Cancer Research UK is undertaking a study of the risk factors associated with breast cancer, including a further international review of the research evidence on abortion and breast cancer. The results of this study will be made available when completed.

 "Shifting the Balance of Power" has allowed primary care trusts (PCTs) to have the necessary financial flexibility to provide services to best meet local needs. This includes ensuring access to the full range of methods of contraception, including emergency contraception, according to need. In addition, the Government has boosted these resources by providing an extra &#163;1&nbsp;million to help improve access to contraceptive services.

<P>
<a name="40227w14.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what advice has been issued to ethnic minority communities by the Food Standards Agency about the risk posed to human health through the consumption of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;illegal meat imports and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;bushmeat.  [155388]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40227w14.html_spnew9"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Responsibility for raising public awareness of the issue of illegal imports lies with the Food Standards Agency (FSA), the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. In terms of advice specifically targeted towards ethnic minority communities, the FSA has discussed the issue of illegal meat imports with its Muslim organisations working group and has subsequently spoken on this topic at seminars organised by the Muslim community. These have included, most recently, talks at the Husaini Cultural Centre in Peterborough in September 2003 and also at Haringey Mosque and the Islamic Cultural Centre in London in November 2003.
<P>

<a name="40227w14.html_para4">Defra has commissioned the Central Office of Information to undertake research in this area. The research phase of the project is currently under way and the results of this research will then be used to inform publicity campaigns among ethnic minority communities later in the year.
<P>

<a name="40227w14.html_para5">The scope of the research includes examining attitudes among these communities to imports of meat, including bushmeat, and the possible risks to both animal and human health.

<i>[holding answer 23&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> The Stewart Report, in 2000, provided a thorough and comprehensive consideration of the public health concerns associated with mobile phone systems and is available on the website of the independent expert group on mobile phones at: www.iegmp.org.uk The report dealt principally with signals from the widely used mobile phone (GSM) technologies, but it did note some contradictory results when examining the biological effects of pulsed radio signals similar to those associated with TETRA (terrestrial trunked radio). While no obvious health effect was suggested, it did recommend a precautionary approach.
<P>

<a name="40227w15.html_para18">The main conclusion about base stations from the Stewart Report was that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of guidelines".</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40227w15.html_para19">A substantial number of measurements of potential exposures of the public from base station emissions have now been made by a number of bodies, including the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) at: www.nrpb.org and the Radiocommunications Agency (now part of Ofcom) at: www.ofcom.org.uk These measurements include emissions from TETRA base stations. In all cases exposures have been very much lower than the guidelines published by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).
<P>

<a name="40227w15.html_para20">The latest report from NRPB's advisory group on non-ionising radiation (AGNIR), entitled "Health Effects from Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields", was published on 14&nbsp;January 2004. It addressed the base station issue and concluded that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Exposure levels from living near to mobile phone base stations are extremely low, and the overall evidence indicates that they are unlikely to pose a risk to health."</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40227w15.html_para21">Following a request by the Home Office to the NRPB, the issue of possible health effects caused by signals from TETRA base stations was comprehensively addressed by AGNIR. They published their report, "Possible Health Effects from Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA)", in 2001, which is available as Documents of NRPB, Volume 12, No. 2, 2001, or on the NRPB website: www.nrpb.org They noted that whereas the signals from the TETRA handsets are pulsed, those from TETRA base stations are not pulsed. They concluded, therefore, that there is no reason to believe 



<P>
<P><I>27 Feb 2004 : Column 628W</I><P>
that signals from TETRA base stations should be treated differently from other base stations. The AGNIR report also found that exposures of the public to signals from TETRA base stations are small fractions of international guidelines.
<P>

<a name="40227w15.html_para22">TETRA technologies are included within the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research (MTHR) programme, set by the Government in 2001 and available at: www.mthr.org.uk An associated programme, specifically on TETRA, is being funded by the Home Office (www.homeoffice.gov.uk). A number of projects are already under way, but it will be some time before the results are available.

<a name="40227w16.html_wqn3"><B> Ann Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to the answer of 2&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 739W, on European Regional Funding, what the level of matched funding is <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;in financial terms and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;as a percentage of EU funding for each of the regions for the period 2000 to 2006; and to which financial years the figures relate.  [155077]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40227w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Tabled as follows are the budgeted levels of match funding both in total financial terms and as a percentage of the total programmes for 2000 to 2006, for the North West, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber regions. Regions have discretion to vary the levels of actual spend between years and we expect some programmes will do so, up to the absolute deadline of 31&nbsp;December 2008.
<P>

<a name="40227w16.html_para2">European funding programmes operate to calendar years. The domestic financial years to which these figures relate are from 1999&#150;2000 (part) to 2006&#150;07 (part).

<i>Notes:</i><P>

Gross expenditure here includes spending from the General Fund Revenue Account, the Housing Revenue Account, External Trading Services accounts and the Capital Account. Adjustments have been made to eliminate double counting where possible. The General Fund Revenue Account is financed from formula grant (which includes revenue support grant, redistributed non-domestic rates, police grant), and specific grants within Aggregate External Finance (AEF) as well as specific grants outside AEF, sales, fees and charges and other non-grant income. The answer of 23&nbsp;February, was restricted to the General Fund Revenue Account and excluded specific grants outside AEF and sales, fees and charges and other non-grant income.<P>

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister for how long he has been considering the planning application (SUN/2963/11 or GOSE/103/3/VALE/29) for residential development on the Foxcombe Road site of the old Warnborough College on Boars Hill, near Oxford; and when he plans to make a decision.  [156054]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40227w17.html_spnew5"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Planning application SUN/2963/11 was first referred to my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister for consideration on 13&nbsp;December 2000. The application was called in for my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister's own determination on 19&nbsp;February 2001 and, following a public inquiry, was refused on 13&nbsp;November 2001, against the Inspector's recommendation. The decision was successfully challenged in the High Court but the application was again refused on 12&nbsp;March 2003. That decision has again been successfully challenged and the application now falls to be re-determined a second time. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister attaches great importance to preserving the openness of the Green Belt, and has asked for any further representations the parties may wish to make by the closing date of 27&nbsp;February 2004. A decision will be made as soon as possible.

[156055]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40227w17.html_spnew6"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The main reason my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister submitted to judgment in each case was:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister attached too much weight to the extant planning permission for residential conversion of the existing buildings, whereas the applicants had stated that, if the current application were refused, they would not implement the permission and would sell the site to an institutional user; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister failed to take into account a material consideration, namely the relative effects of a more than 'low-key' institutional use of the site.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what estimate he has made of the cost of the time <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;his officials and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;officials of the Government office for the South East spent on dealing with the planning application (SUN/2963/11 or GOSE/103/3/VALE/29) for residential development on the Foxcombe Road site of the old Warnborough College on Boars Hill, near Oxford.

 This has been a complex and long-running case. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister attaches great importance to the Green Belt policy. No estimate has been made of the cost of the time spent by his officials on dealing with the planning application.

<P>
<a name="40227w17.html_wqn8"><B> Dr. Evan Harris: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what targets he has set for the time taken to reconsider planning applications after a decision he has taken is legally challenged successfully.  [156053]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40227w17.html_spnew8"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 No targets have been set for the time taken to re-determine a planning application following a successful legal challenge, although the aim is to re-determine all cases as soon as possible. However, for the re-determination of called-in applications, we would aim to issue a decision within 13 weeks from the conclusion of the written representations procedure or receipt of the Inspector's report if it has been decided to re-open the inquiry.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the evidential basis was for his estimate that an elected regional assembly would have <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;running costs of &#163;25&nbsp;million a year and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;set-up costs of &#163;30&nbsp;million.  [155142]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40227w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The evidence is drawn from the cost of setting up the Greater London Authority and its first year running costs, reflecting differences between the London arrangements and those proposed for elected regional assemblies. For example, it is not proposed to provide elected assemblies with new, purpose built headquarters.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is reviewing pension arrangements for firefighters in accordance with the Government's White Paper "Our Fire and Rescue Service" (CM 5808), and in the light of the Department of Work and Pensions Green Paper (CM 5865). Proposals, which will reflect changes to the tax and policy framework for pensions, including on retirement and pension ages, have still to be formulated: consequently costings of possible savings to employers are not available. There will be consultation on the proposals that emerge.
