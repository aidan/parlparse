The Government's long-term objective, as prefigured by s.1 of the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000 is that, as far as reasonably practicable, by 22 November 2016, persons in England should not live in fuel poverty. The interim objective of the Fuel Poverty Strategy in England is that, so far as reasonably practicable, the Government would seek an end to fuel poverty for vulnerable households by 2010. The Government set no annual targets in respect of the 2016 and 2010 targets.</p>

 The Government's UK Sixth Annual Progress Report on Fuel Poverty was published on 2 October 2008. It shows that, in 2006, the latest period for which figures are available, there were around 3.5 million households in fuel poverty across the UK, an increase of one million households since 2005. Around 2.75 million of these were vulnerable households (containing children, the elderly, or a person who is disabled or long-term sick).</p>

<i> [</i><i> holding </i><i> answer 26 March 2009]:</i> Cushion gas may be described as the volume of gas intended for long-term use in a gas storage facility, necessary to maintain pressure and to enable redelivery of the stored gas. As such, it is not acquired with a view to being re-sold as an incident of the storage trade, but with a view to being retained long-term as a fixed asset of the business. In those circumstances, the cost of acquiring it is normally capital expenditure for taxation purposes. However, the answer can depend on the particular facts of the case so if, for example, there is systematic evidence of the buying and selling of recoverable cushion gas (perhaps allied to an accounting treatment of the gas as trading stock) this may point to the expenditure being revenue expenditure for tax purposes.</p>

 The information has been placed in the Library, and provides separate data for unfilled and notified vacancies to give the fullest picture of the number of Jobcentre Plus vacancies.

Estimates of the number of unfilled job vacancies across the economy as a whole are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises.

<i> [holding answer 27 January 2009]:</i> Reforms to make the state pension fairer and more widely available will be implemented in April 2010 including a reduction to 30 qualifying years required for entitlement to the full basic state pension and reforms to the system for crediting those with caring responsibilities to reflect the different ways in which people contribute to society. As a result of these changes around 75 per cent. of women reaching state pension age from April 2010 will be entitled to a full basic state pension compared to 50 per cent. without reform. By 2025 over 90 per cent. of both men and women reaching state pension age will be entitled to a full basic state pension.</p>

At present the available evidence is incomplete and it is too soon to fully evaluate the impact of the downturn on the sector at a constituency level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_508"><a name="90512w0013.htm_para0"><a name="09051277000472">The Government continue to take the difficulties many third sector organisations face during this recession very seriously, which is why the &#163;42.5 million package announced in &#147;Real help for Communities: Volunteers, Charities and Social Enterprises&#148; provides targeted help for the sector to face these challenges. This package of support was designed together with third sector leaders and took into account submissions from over 80 charities. This action plan builds on the wide range of measures the Government have put in place to support people through the economic downturn, and on the Government&#146;s long-term commitment to voluntary organisations and social enterprises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_509"><a name="90512w0013.htm_para1"><a name="09051277000473">The OTS will continue to monitor this situation closely and work with its partners to share evidence on this issue and will host a sector-wide summit on the economic downturn in June. In addition, the Third Sector Research Centre will also be factoring the impact of the downturn into its analysis of the sector.</p>

This data will be refreshed and updated automatically from these systems on a regular basis. We have received core information from four national data sources and this is the data set that all LAs have been working on to shield records. Work has also begun on the first updated data load from these sources, to ensure records held on ContactPoint are as accurate and up-to-date as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_517"><a name="90512w0015.htm_para1"><a name="09051278000023">We received a few reports of cases where updates from these sources may not be matching as expected. We took immediate action to investigate and initial indications are that matching is working correctly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_518"><a name="90512w0015.htm_para2"><a name="09051278000024">However, as a transitional precautionary measure, we have paused the ongoing data update feed while we investigate the instances reported to us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_519"><a name="90512w0015.htm_para3"><a name="09051278000025">This will minimise any risk to records that have been shielded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_520"><a name="90512w0015.htm_para4"><a name="09051278000026">Data feed from national systems will re-commence once all local authority ContactPoint management teams have been given access to ContactPoint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_521"><a name="90512w0015.htm_para5"><a name="09051278000027">DCSF continue to investigate the reports of duplicate records and will make changes as necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_522"><a name="90512w0015.htm_para6"><a name="09051278000028">We are taking a prudent and incremental approach to ContactPoint delivery. Local authorities provided a progress update on their shielding activity 13 March, which included whether they had robust arrangements in place to deal with shielding requests on an ongoing basis. Two thirds of local authorities confirmed that they had completed the required shielding actions. These responses were sent in confidence and as part of the normal, ongoing discussion between the Departments and local authorities and as part of the implementation process.</p>

 There has been no estimate of the likely maximum number of registered IP addresses from which ContactPoint will be accessible. We expect that the majority of users will access ContactPoint via secure Government networks. The remainder will only be able to access ContactPoint from known, accredited computer systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_523"><a name="90512w0015.htm_para7"><a name="09051278000031">Organisations that access ContactPoint via accredited computer systems will be asked to register IP address(es) for any computer that will be used to gain access. The number of IP addresses each organisation supplies will depend on many factors, including their network architecture. Some organisations will supply one IP address, others will supply a range.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_554"><a name="90512w0017.htm_para5"><a name="0905134000144">The basis of the Government radon programme in England for existing homes is to target the higher risk areas, where 5 per cent. or more of the houses are estimated to be above the action level. Radon testing programmes are run in partnership between HPA and local authorities, with radon tests offered free to householders in these areas. The local primary care trust and the BRE provide support and registered social landlords such as local councils and housing associations are encouraged to extend the radon testing programmes to all their properties in radon affected areas. HPA informs householders and landlords by letter of the result of the radon test and whether it is near to or exceeds the action level. If so, remediation is advised and householders are encouraged to attend special local events to discuss remediation organised jointly by the HPA, the relevant local authority and the BRE. A small number of homes in England have been found to have radon levels in excess of 10,000 Bq/m<sup>(3)</sup> (50 times the action level). HPA offers financial help and works with the local authority to remediate these homes, using advice from the BRE to help local contractors.</p>

 The local government sector has a strong track record of delivering substantial value for money savings. Authorities are working to go further and are raising their ambition for efficiency. Both central and local government have identified more scope for increased efficiencies which will allow a further one percentage point to be added to the totals savings target in 2010-11 taking it to at least 4 per cent. This will generate an additional &#163;600 million in savings across the sector. This money will be directly recycled within local authorities&#146; budgets to be put towards front line services and keeping council tax down.</p>

 The level of performance reward grant payable will be determined by the average level of performance achieved across all designated targets in the Local Area Agreement, subject to a minimum threshold of 60 per cent. At this stage it is not possible to determine the precise impact on the level of reward payable of a local authority not meeting targets based upon national indicator 191. The impact will be dependant upon how far short of the target an area&#146;s performance on NI 191 has actually fallen at the end of the LAA, how many designated targets were included in the LAA and the level of performance achieved across the other relevant targets.</p>

 When seeking parliamentary approval to the nine new unitary councils, we estimated transitional restructuring costs of around &#163;138 million, with total annual savings of at least &#163;100 million. Our latest estimates, following a stocktake exercise we with the support of independent financial experts have undertaken prior to 1 April 2009, are for the restructuring costs to be around &#163;135 million, slightly less than the original estimate.</p>

Where two new unitary councils have been formed in a former county area, the regulations require that the records of the predecessor district councils transfer to the relevant new unitary and those of the predecessor county council transfer to one or other of the new unitary councils as agreed between them.

4. Figures for Family Proceedings Courts prior to April 2007 are likely to be an undercount. A new method of data collection was introduced in April 2007 which has improved the coverage and completeness of data.

 The Ministry of Justice is committed to reducing its carbon emissions in accordance with the campaign initiated by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Activities and the Greening Government ICT Strategy. The MOJ recognises that reducing its ICT carbon emissions is not just about technology but also about embedding sustainability in its process and behaviour as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_585"><a name="90512w0021.htm_para7"><a name="0905136000052">The MOJ has worked to implement the appropriate &#145;Areas for ICT Carbon Reduction&#146; in the Greening Government ICT Strategy improving the sustainability of its printing, the energy efficiency of its desktop PCs and data centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_586"><a name="90512w0021.htm_para8"><a name="0905136000053">The MOJ has built sustainable IT principles into its IT policy and consideration of sustainability forms part of process of evaluation of changes to the IT estate. The MOJ is working with its suppliers to improve the energy efficiency of IT operations both in its outsourced data centres and at its own sites. It has employed third party expertise to analyse the sustainability of IT operations managed by a sample of the MOJ's key suppliers and advise on how best to realise improvements. This work has already led to increased data centre energy efficiency, and work on the centralisation of data processing will further reduce server energy consumption without negative affect on the volume or efficiency of data processing carried out. The convergence of formerly separate networks offers better sharing of IT resources for staff and the reduction of the overall number of devices we need to deliver the same level of service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_587"><a name="90512w0021.htm_para9"><a name="0905136000054">The MOJ has also used initiatives to realise the positive impact that ICT can have on the overall carbon emissions of its operations. It continues to invest in video-conferencing and teleconferencing technology to reduce emissions. The imminent upgrade of desktop PCs will offer not just improved power management to reduce energy consumption but also roaming profiles allowing any users to log on to any machine helping support MOJ estates' goal of 80 per cent. desking and a reduction in the overall size of the MOJ HQ estate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_588"><a name="90512w0021.htm_para10"><a name="0905136000055">MOJ is also working on staff awareness of green IT issues.

 The report recently published by the Electoral Commission and the Association of Chief Police Officers entitled &#147;Allegations of electoral malpractice at the May 2008 elections in England and Wales&#148; found that the police had recorded 103 cases of electoral malpractice at those elections. 81 per cent. of the cases required no further action by the police. One case has led to a prosecution, which resulted in a conviction of one person on a charge of making a false application to vote by proxy. Nine cases resulted in formal cautions which may lead to criminal records, with 12 cases under investigation or awaiting advice from the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

 The MOD's complaints handling policy is based on the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman's publication "Principles of Good Complaint Handling" and covers all complaints irrespective of how they are received. There are separate and published points of contact for complaints about specific activities, for example pensions or low flying, and our experience is that complaints are most effectively handled at the initial point of contact. Our policy sets out how complaints should be handled and, should it be necessary, explains how an internal review should be offered and conducted.
