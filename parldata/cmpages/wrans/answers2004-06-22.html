 The investigation and prosecution of allegations of electoral fraud are matters for the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, and these are not required to be notified to the Electoral Commission. However, I understand that the Commission is aware of a number of such allegations, and will be liaising with the Crown Prosecution Service to obtain details of all allegations of electoral fraud reported to the Service in the four regions where all-postal pilots were held, as part of its statutory evaluation of those pilots. The Commission will also examine issues of electoral fraud in its wider statutory report on the administration of the European parliamentary elections.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she will take to meet the requirement in Article 6.1 <i>(b)</i> of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters in relation to decisions on proposed activities which may have a significant effect on the environment; and if she will make a statement.  [179556]</p>








<p><a name="40622w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 18 June 2004]:</i> Appropriate steps have already been taken. The obligations under Article 6.1 of the Aarhus Convention primarily concern activities in relation to which environmental impact assessment may be required. At EC level, environmental impact assessment is governed by Directive 85/337/EC as amended by Directive 97/11/EC, which has been implemented in the UK by a number of statutory instruments. The criteria, thresholds and procedures for such activities are set out in legislation and explained in guidance published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (&quot;Environmental Impact Assessment: Guide to Procedures&quot;).

<a name="40622w01.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Radon Gas</h3>





<p><a name="40622w01.html_wqn2"><b> Ms Atherton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what surveys she has undertaken to investigate radon in homes in Cornwall; and what those surveys have concluded.  [179462]</p>








<p><a name="40622w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 18 June 2004]:</i> Since 1987 successive Governments have run radon measurement programmes to identify the extent of the radon problem in the UK. Initially, these focused on areas of England such as Cornwall, Devon and Somerset where dwellings were most likely to be at risk from the naturally occurring radioactive gas. By 1998, every home in England with a greater than 5 per cent. probability of radon levels being at or above the National Radiological Protection Board&#039;s (NRPB) recommended radon &#039;Action Level&#039; (200 becquerels per cubic metre of air&#151;Bq m <sup>-</sup>  <sup>3</sup> ) had been offered a free radon test. In accordance with NRPB&#039;s recommendation, we advise that remedial action is taken to reduce radon levels in any home at or above the Action Level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w01.html_para1">
The measurement campaigns have revealed and confirmed that Cornwall is an area that is significantly affected by radon. Data published in the NRPB&#039;s &quot;Radon Atlas of England and Wales&quot; (NRPB-W26) in December 2002 showed that 97 per cent. of dwellings in Cornwall are likely to be in radon-affect areas. Of the 220,500 homes in the county, some 67,640 had been measured, mostly from Government-funded tests. Nearly 16,000 homes had been found to have radon concentrations at or above the Action Level. At that time, the highest level recorded in the UK of 10,000 Bq m <sup>-</sup>  <sup>3</sup>  had been found in the district of Kerrier. It is estimated that up to 41,000 dwellings in Cornwall may have radon levels exceeding the Action Level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w01.html_para2">
Defra&#039;s latest programme continues to offer free radon measurements to the most at risk households in England. However, the initiative places greater emphasis on helping home owners to take action to reduce radon levels in their homes. This is being achieved in partnership with 27 local authorities who joined the initiative when it commenced in July 2000. In Cornwall, we started work with Kerrier district council at the end of 2003 to roll out a programme of action designed to raise awareness and promote radon remediation in the community. This has included over 31,000 invitations sent to householders offering free tests and retests (upon completion of satisfactory remedial work); and workshops providing information and advice on remediation for those householders recommended to take action to reduce radon levels in their homes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w01.html_para3">
Over 11,000 householders have accepted the offer and to date results from around 4,000 measurements are available. Some of the results reveal particularly high radon levels, and measurements taken in three dwellings are well above the previously highest recorded level of 10,000 Bq m <sup>-</sup>  <sup>3</sup> . Kerrier district council, together with NRPB and the Building Research Establishment (BRE), are providing the support to the occupants

<a name="40622w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Bovine TB</h3>





<p><a name="40622w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Dalyell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to the then Under-Secretary of State&#039;s letter 167650/MM of 26 June 2002, what the latest evaluation is of the work done to establish the relationship between badgers and bovine TB; and if she will make a statement.  [177891]</p>








<p><a name="40622w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 15 June 2004]:</i> The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) carried out an interim analysis of Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) data collected up to the end of August 2003. The analysis revealed that there was an increased risk of TB breakdowns in cattle herds occurring in trial areas where &quot;reactive&quot; culling had taken place, compared to the related &quot;survey only&quot; (control) areas <sup>1</sup> .
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w01.html_para4">
As a result of this finding, Ministers suspended culling operations in the &quot;reactive&quot; treatment areas of the RBCT from November 2003, because to continue would have meant the unnecessary culling of badgers, leading to an increased risk of TB in cattle herds. Such reactive culling has effectively been ruled out as a TB control option.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w01.html_para5">
Culling operations continue in &quot;proactive&quot; treatment areas, where more widespread and repeated trapping takes place. The ISG has given assurances that Ministers will be informed as soon as the data yield a scientifically significant result. The ISG estimate that the RBCT will be completed in 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w01.html_para6">
On 6 April, a report was published from an Independent Review Panel, which reviewed the progress of the RBCT and associated research, as part of a wider review of Defra&#039;s science. The ISG do not agree with all aspects of this report, and Ministers are considering its recommendations, particularly where the ISG does not concur.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"> <sup>1</sup>  The increase, compared to survey-only areas, was estimated to be 27 per cent. with 95 per cent. confidence that the increase lies between 4.8 per cent. and 53 per cent. A more conservative analysis would give would give confidence limits of between a 2.4 per cent. decrease and 65 per cent. increase. The ISG&#039;s most recent analysis of data collected to mid-February indicated an increase of 28 per cent. with confidence limits of between 1.1 per cent. and 62 per cent. using the wider confidence limits recommended by the Independent Review Panel.</p>

<p><a name="40622w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 One would normally expect those providing such a service to make a charge. However, there may be examples where charges are waived or are negligible for certain types of livestock and where farmers and those providing the service have other informal arrangements, e.g. some hunt kennels may collect calves at no cost in return for farmers allowing hunts to use their land.


</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the cost to <i>(a)</i> farmers and <i>(b)</i> the Government are of the fallen stock disposal scheme; whether the deadline for the scheme has been met; and if she will make a statement.  [179596]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Jun 2004 : Column 1291W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40622w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 21 June 2004]:</i> The cost to farmers will be a small annual subscription fee to cover administration costs, likely to be around &#163;25 in the first year, and thereafter will depend on their usage of the Scheme. The Government, including devolved administrations has said it will put &#163;20 million into the Scheme over its first three years. The Scheme is scheduled to start in the autumn of this year.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the impact on fish stocks of the rise in sea water temperature; and if she will make a statement.  [179404]</p>








<p><a name="40622w02.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Changes in sea temperature could potentially affect stock distribution, spawning, migratory patterns and survival of very young fish but the effect of long term temperature trends on fish stocks is not easy to predict. Defra has commissioned a range of science to improve our understanding of the processes and predictions. Our monitoring of sea fish stocks allows for an appropriate management response as we begin to observe changes. Fishing rates on many stocks remains high, and if those stocks are also under pressure due to ecosystem change, then this reinforces the need for effective fisheries management.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what steps he is taking towards the cancellation of debt in the world&#039;s poorest countries.  [179524]</p>








<p><a name="40622w03.html_spnew0"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 The UK is fully committed to the cancellation of debt in the world&#039;s poorest countries through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w03.html_para0">
The UK has provided commitments of &#163;2.3 billion of debt relief to eligible countries and has pledged a total of US$474 million through multilateral institutions to provide further support for debt relief to the world&#039;s poorest countries. The UK goes even further than is required under the HIPC Initiative, and is committed to providing 100 per cent. debt relief to eligible HIPC countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w03.html_para1">
The HIPC Initiative is delivering real benefits to participating countries. Debt relief of over $70 billion has already been agreed for 27 countries under the Initiative. Total social spending has increased by around $4 billion since 1999&#151;equivalent to 2.7 per cent. of GDP.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w03.html_para2">
However, the Government also recognises that we need to do more if we are to deliver a long-term exit from unsustainable debt for HIPCs. Last week, G8 Heads of State discussed proposals to enhance debt relief for the world&#039;s poorest countries. The UK successfully pushed for the extension of the HIPC Initiative by another two years, potentially allowing 10 more countries to benefit from debt relief in excess of $30 billion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w03.html_para3">
Heads of State also tasked Finance Ministers to consider further both reforms to the HIPC Initiative, and new and innovative mechanisms to deliver a long-term exit from unsustainable debt for the world&#039;s poorest countries. The UK will push for the granting of additional assistance (topping up) for all countries whose debt profiles have worsened after Decision Point as a result of factors beyond their control. We will also continue to press for additional bilateral assistance to be excluded from the calculation of this topping-up assistance at Completion Point, to ensure that every dollar benefits the recipient. The UK will also seek a firm commitment on financing the G7&#039;s share of costs for the HIPC Trust Fund, which we estimate at up to $1 billion.

Notes:<br>

1. Prior to 1999, a split by parliamentary constituency for state pension is not available.<br>

2. Income support (IS), incapacity benefit and state pension (SP) figures are based on a 5 per cent. sample and are therefore subject to sampling variation. JSA is based on 100 per cent. count.<br>





3. Figures have been rounded to the nearest hundred and quoted in thousands.<br>

4. JSA claimants includes income-based JSA, contribution-based JSA claimants and those persons not receiving benefit but signing for national insurance credits only.<br>

5. Income support parliamentary constituencies are allocated by matching postcodes against the relevant ONS postcode directory, and represent constituency boundaries as at May 1997.<br>

6. November 2003 IS figures are affected by the introduction of pension credit (PC), which replaced MIG on 6 October 2003.<br>

7. The number of people receiving housing benefit and/or council tax benefit in addition to the state pension is not available below a national level.<br>

 Responsibility for the management of the Health and Safety Executive, including conducting its pay negotiations, is a matter for the Executive of the HSE.

<p><a name="40622w06.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 The Department is currently conducting feasibility work to establish the full impact that the introduction of a national identity card will have on its business; however, by providing a single, effective, national system of establishing identity, an identity card scheme will allow us to simplify several of the Department&#039;s current business processes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w06.html_para0">
For example, we want all people who are eligible for benefits to take up their entitlement, and information on the National Identity Register may allow us more easily to identify those people who may be entitled to claim benefit. In addition, use of an identity card will ensure that the process of establishing identity for benefit claims is both more secure and more convenient for the customer, and we also envisage that the national identity card and its supporting database will be a useful tool in countering identity fraud.

Lone parents and sick and disabled people can qualify for income support. We have introduced work-focused interviews enabling everyone on income support to take advantage of the increasing opportunities to move into work by, for the first time, offering everyone of working age advice and guidance on the full range of employment programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w06.html_para3">
The national minimum wage and tax credits encourage people to start work by making it pay for them. Together they guarantee a minimum income in work and provide much improved gains through work. The improvements in gains through work have made a substantial contribution to improving labour market outcomes; for example the employment rate for lone parents has increased from 46 per cent. in 1997 to 53 per cent. this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w06.html_para4">
We have announced recent measures in the Budget to further improve gains through work for part time workers. We have introduced a disregard in housing benefit and council tax benefit for all tenants working part time (typically lone parents and disabled people) who are eligible for working tax credit which will make them around &#163;10 per week better off.

1. The net cost includes all savings except for additional Income tax revenue, (see note (5). Figures are for Great Britain in 2004&#150;05 price terms, using the GDP deflator index, rounded to the nearest &#163;100 million.<br>

2. Basic State Pension (BSP) costs are estimated by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department, consistent with Budget 2004 assumptions, made using 2002 based population projections.<br>

3. The savings credit is abolished for those aged 80 and over from April 2006 with no payments to existing pensioners and no new recipients after 2006.<br>

4. The savings from savings credit and other income related benefits (guarantee credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit) are calculated using the Department&#039;s policy simulation model for 2006&#150;7. It is assumed that the proportion of savings calculated for the first year is constant for subsequent years.<br>

5. (a) The net cost including tax revenues regardless of contribution record in 2006&#150;07 is &#163;1.3 billion. For illustrative purposes, we have assumed income tax revenue to be a fixed percentage of the gross cost for this option in 2007&#150;08 and 2008&#150;09. Therefore, the illustrative total net cost in 2007&#150;08 is &#163;1.5 billion and in 2008&#150;09 is &#163;1.6 billion. Estimates for later years would be subject to a greater degree of uncertainty.<br>

 (b) The net cost including tax revenues on the current system of entitlement in 2006&#150;07 is &#163;1.2 billion. Again we have assumed income tax revenue to be a fixed percentage of the gross cost for this option in 2007&#150;08 and 2008&#150;09. Therefore, the illustrative total net cost in 2007&#150;08 is &#163;1.4 billion and in 2008&#150;09 is &#163;1.5 billion.<br>





 (c) Tax revenues have been calculated using the Department&#039;s policy simulation model, as this provides information at a household level.<br>

6. (a) All single over 80 year olds have been given the single rate of the guarantee credit and all couples have been given the couples rate of the guarantee credit, split equally between the two, regardless of contribution records.<br>

 (b) Category A pensions are increased under existing rules (i.e. relative to the single rate of the guarantee credit) except that in a couple where one person is in receipt of a category B pension, the combined category A and category B pension is increased pro rata relative to the couples rate of the guarantee credit.<br>

 (c) In both scenarios couples with only one person over 80 years old are treated identically to those where both are over 80.<br>

7. The State Second Pension is assumed to be unchanged.<br>

<p><a name="40622w07.html_spnew8"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 Routine statistics do not record the primary cause of a road accident. However, under a pilot scheme 14 police forces have provided information on contributory factors to accidents. The latest year for which pilot data are available is 2002. Accidents for which &quot;excessive speed&quot; was deemed by the police to be one of the contributory factors, though not necessarily the primary factor, accounted for 13 per cent. of all injury road accidents recorded in the police areas taking part in the pilot scheme. The proportion of accidents where &#039;excessive speed&#039; is coded as a factor rises with the severity of the accident; it applied to 12 per cent. of slight accidents, 19 per cent. of serious accidents and 30 per cent. of fatal accidents in the pilot areas in 2002.

 Studies by the local authority, Leicestershire county council, were carried out in the early 1990s into the National Forest Line; the &quot;Ivanhoe Line&quot; scheme. Passenger services on Section 1, between Leicester and Loughborough, are currently operating under a subsidy from Leicestershire county council.

<p>
<a name="40622w07.html_para1">
A business case has not been made for the re-instatement of passenger services on Section 2, between Leicester and Burton-on-Trent, but it is likely that it will require considerable investment in infrastructure and additional subsidy to the train operator. Any appraisal will need to be considered against other priorities&#151;and in the context of the financial constraints on the industry at the present time.

<a name="40622w10.html_para0">
The Race Relations Act 1976 prohibits racial discrimination in employment (as well as education and the provision of goods and services) and established the Commission for Racial Equality to enforce the Act and provide advice and support to victims of discrimination. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 strengthened the Race Relations Act by prohibiting racial discrimination in almost all public functions not covered by the Race Relations Act and by placing a statutory duty on public authorities to promote racial equality, including in the field of employment. We have further strengthened the law on discrimination by transposing the EU Race Directive into domestic law in the Race Relations Act 1976 (Amendment) Regulations 2003. These improve the protection to employees by, for example, reversing the burden of proof in race discrimination cases, introducing a definition of harassment and narrowing the permissible exemptions to the employment provisions of the Race Relations Act 1976.

Notes:<br>

1. The number of Accounts may include more than one fine per offender. MCCs have the option of consolidating a number of fines for the same person under one fine account. Those MCCs (and it can vary within that MCC) that choose this facility are unable to state how many fines are held in total under each consolidated account.<br>

2. This includes Fines, Legal Aid, Costs, Community Penalty Costs and Compensation.<br>

3. Sussex MCC operate a unique collection system and are consequently unable to provide this information.<br>

NB: The payment rate can not be directly compared to number of live accounts to show what percentage of fines is uncollected. The number of accounts provides a snapshot of the number of live fines on a given day, and can include outstanding accounts from previous years. The payment rate shows the amount of money collected by an MCC as a percentage of that imposed within the time period.

Land Registry holds information on land ownership relating to registered titles but, under Rule 11 of the Land Registration Rules 2003, it is only possible to search for ownership by name if the applicant can satisfy the registrar that he is interested generally (for instance, as trustee in bankruptcy or personal representative).

We will continue to press the Vietnamese Government to allow unrestricted access at all times to the Central Highlands by diplomats, international press, UN agencies and international NGOs. In May, a group of several diplomatic missions comprising the Swiss, Norwegian, New Zealand and Canadian ambassadors visited the Central Highlands, as did a group of UN agency heads. An EU Troika delegation visited the region for the fourth time since 2001 on 16 to 19 December 2003. Further EU missions are planned in the future. EU ambassadors, including the British ambassador regularly raise the issue of access to the Central Highlands in the context of the EU-Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue; the next meeting is on 22 June.

 Mirtazapine (Zispin) is included in the review of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and related antidepressants. The risks and benefits of mirtazapine in children and adolescents have been considered by the expert working group on SSRIs and the committee on safety of medicines. Analysis of controlled clinical trials did not find an increased risk of suicidal behaviour or self harm in the mirtazapine treated group compared to those treated with a placebo. A summary of the paediatric clinical trial data for mirtazapine was published on the website of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in April 2004. The review of a possible risk of suicidal behaviour in adults treated with mirtazapine is ongoing.

Bupropion (Zyban) has not been included in the review by the expert working group as it is licensed in the United Kingdom as an aid to smoking cessation. Bupropion has recently undergone a Europe wide review of its risks and benefits. The product information for prescribers states that, depression, rarely including suicidal ideation, has been reported in patients undergoing a smoking cessation attempt. These symptoms have also been reported during Zyban treatment and generally occurred early during the treatment course.

 The Gateway Protection Programme brings refugees to the UK, not asylum seekers. This is the first year in which we have operated the Programme. It is a complex operation and our current priority is ensuring the policy and procedures are working satisfactorily. We will be reviewing the scope for extending the Programme in future years in light of our initial experiences, including the available caseloads and identified needs, the contribution resettlement is able to make to refugee protection and the availability and costs of placements in the UK.

A recent assessment of figures supplied by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate on immigration detention has highlighted an undercount of detainees held in prisons. The cases concerned are those immigration detainees who had completed their criminal sentence and had either been court-recommended for deportation or on conducive grounds but were still held in a prison pending deportation. At the end of March 2004 it is thought that there were approximately 200 such cases, some of whom may have claimed asylum at some stage. This issue is currently being looked into, and any necessary revisions to the regular statistics will be considered once we are satisfied that the issue has been resolved.

 The pilot exercise for the service in person of decisions was restricted to the service of appeal determinations for asylum seekers whose applications had been certified under schedule 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The pilot was discontinued as legislative measures introduced under part 5 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 changed the point at which appeal rights became exhausted. As a consequence the pilot was curtailed and while the results were considered encouraging they were not thought conclusive.

From 1 April 2003 only cases with an adverse statutory review decision were considered suitable for service in person as that was the point at which all appeal rights were exhausted. Since then the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) has received notification of 1,145 statutory review cases of which 848 have been dismissed. Of these 143 have been served in person of which 31 have been removed from the United Kingdom.

However, the over-riding rule, set by international standards for travel documents, is that the applicant&#039;s photograph should show a full face and that all features should be clearly distinguishable.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures are in place to combat identity fraud.  [177836]</p>








<p><a name="40622w22.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Identity fraud usually occurs when someone&#039;s personal information such as name, address or date of birth is captured without their knowledge and used by someone else to support criminal activity, which could involve deception, financial gain or obtaining other benefits and services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w22.html_para0">
Measures have been taken to improve the procedures for issuing and checking passports and driving licences, which are the two main official documents that are used currently to confirm personal details and therefore establish identity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w22.html_para1">
UK Passport Service has produced guidance on keeping passports safe and what to do if they are lost or stolen. The guidance emphasises that a lost or stolen passport increases the likelihood of the holder&#039;s identity being misused. It has also developed and deployed a database of lost and stolen passports, which is being shared with border authorities and police worldwide to counter identity fraud.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w22.html_para2">
DVLA is reviewing the advice that it currently provides to drivers. It is considering what guidance it can offer on looking after licences, including the fact that drivers&#039; identity could be open to misuse if their licences are lost or stolen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w22.html_para3">
In 2003 Home Office officials worked closely with colleagues in the UK Passport Service and DVLA to support the Association of Payment Clearing Services, CIFAS (the UK&#039;s Fraud Prevention Service) and the Finance and Leasing Association to produce &quot;Identity Fraud&#151;The UK Manual&quot;. The manual provides advice to staff on spotting false UK passports and driving licences and preventing identity fraud.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w22.html_para4">
We have also looked at legislative changes to make identity theft or fraud easier to prosecute or to ensure that the penalties associated with fraudulent use of documents take account of their use in creating false, or

stealing genuine, identities. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 changed the law to align the penalty associated with fraudulently obtaining a driving licence with that for fraudulently obtaining a passport and made these offences arrestable. This will ensure consistency of approach during prosecution so that fraudulently obtaining either document will incur a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment, serving as a more effective deterrent and ensuring that neither document is considered a weak link by fraudsters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w22.html_para5">
These measures should help to prevent fraudsters from using driving licences and passports to commit identity fraud.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w22.html_para6">
We announced in 2003 our intention to create a new offence relating to being in possession or control of false identity documents, without reasonable cause. This offence will provide the police with the means to disrupt the activities of criminals who use false identity documents such as passports and driving licences at an earlier stage of their activities. We published a consultation paper on 26 April on the legislation needed to introduce identity cards. The draft Identity Cards Bill includes the proposed false document offences.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w22.html_para7">
The Home Office has recently established a cross public-private sector work programme to tackle identity theft and identity fraud. The programme co-ordinates existing activity in the public and private sectors and identifies new projects and initiatives to reduce identity fraud.

<i>[holding answer 14 June 2004]:</i> Information on the numbers of illegal workers detected during visits to construction sites is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

 The Government announced on 16 March 2004 that changes would be made to section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, which prohibits the employment of illegal migrant workers. The new arrangements improve the security of the checks employers must carry out to avoid hiring illegal workers. These changes came into force on 1 May 2004 and form part of our continuing strategy to improve the way we tackle illegal working through tightening the legislation, improving its enforcement, engaging employer groups, stakeholders and other Government Departments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w22.html_para8">
In addition, we have included an amendment to the current Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Bill to make the current section 8 offence

triable either way, effectively removing the statutory limit on financial penalties the courts can impose in the more serious cases. The Government are also strongly supporting the Bill introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrewshire (Jim Sheridan), which will create a statutory licensing system for gangmasters. The Bill&#039;s objective is to drive out rogue operators and illegality from the agricultural labour provision sector altogether, by ensuring that farmers and food retailers use only reputable operators who comply with an industry code of practice, and by providing strong criminal sanctions against unlicensed gangmasters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w22.html_para9">
The Immigration Service has also significantly increased intelligence-led enforcement action, with the police and other public bodies, against those employers and labour providers who use and supply illegal labour, including where such individuals have links to organised crime.

<p><a name="40622w22.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 We have been incrementally developing and implementing policies and, where appropriate, legislative changes, to uphold and enhance border security in response to threats and abuses from 1997 onwards.

<p>

Examples include the expansion of the Airline Liaison Officer network which offers vital support and assistance to airlines at key locations overseas and now has an enhanced response capability, and an informed visa strategy designed to consider qualification for entry before arrival and which is kept under regular review. In 2003 we significantly increased the number of countries whose nationals require Direct Airside Transit Visas in a response to an analysis of emerging risks. We have also enhanced and upgraded our intelligence capability to tackle organised immigration crime.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40622w22.html_para11">
Other initiatives have represented a more radical development in the approach to protecting border security. Key examples are listed as follows:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">1998&#151;the White Paper &quot;Fairer, Faster and Firmer&quot; and in 1999 the Immigration and Asylum Act, set out a new approach to the management of the Immigration Control and those who seek to evade or abuse it. Key initiatives include civil penalties in relation to the transportation of clandestine entrants in road vehicles or rail freight wagons. These measures were brought into force in April 2000 and March 2001 respectively and have had a significant impact on the number of clandestine entrants detected.</p>

 Section 44 of the Race Relations Act 1976 sets out the purpose for which the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) may give financial assistance to other organisations. It does not prescribe which types of bodies may receive financial assistance and therefore does not limit such assistance to Racial Equality Councils (RECs). This year more applicants received funding under section 44 than in previous years. RECs still made up the large majority of organisations in receipt of grant from the CRE. However, a few RECs received no funding this year and some others received less funding than previously, where their applications did not fully meet the Commission&#039;s criteria.

In addition, we will be introducing a new pre-marriage lawful status eligibility requirement for marriages involving non-EEA foreign nationals to further deal with those seeking to circumvent immigration controls by entering into sham marriages.

 Data on bullying are not collected centrally and there is no reliable basis for an estimate of prevalence. However, any level of bullying is too high and we are determined to help schools to tackle the problem. Our guidance pack &quot;Bullying: Don&#039;t Suffer in Silence&quot;, the anti-bullying Charter for Action and the anti-bullying website www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying.

<p>
<a name="40622w26.html_para1">
In November 2003 I launched our anti-bullying charter for schools, which schools are now signing. It is accompanied by a summary of effective practice to help schools review and enhance their anti-bullying policies. The Charter was launched at the first of the Make The Difference series of regional conferences. The programme of conferences began in November 2003 and culminated with a final event on 14 June. These conferences are an opportunity for schools and other partners to share good practice on this issue and to learn at first hand about what has worked elsewhere. Details of the conferences can be accessed online at www.teachernet.gov.uk/antibullying. Our new public information film, &quot;Tell Someone&quot;, also encourages children and young people to tell someone if they are being bullied.

<sup>(29)</sup> These figures represent total assumed funding allocated to the Further Education Funding Council (FEFC) until 2000&#150;01, and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) from 2001&#150;02 in either further education sector colleges (further and higher education 



students) or in external institutions, specialist designated institutions and higher education institutions (further education students only).<br>

Over the last year the FE sector and other providers have exceeded expectations in participation, retention and attainment. In response the Government recently announced that they will increase the LSC&#039;s budget by &#163;130 million over the 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06 period.

Notes:<br>

1. The financial data are taken from local education authorities&#039; Section 52 Outturn Statements submitted to the DfES from 1999&#150;2000 onwards and the ODPM&#039;s RO1 statement previously. Up to and including 1997&#150;98 figures are for Essex LEA prior to local government reorganisation. From 1998&#150;99 onwards parts of Essex LEA became Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock LEAs. 2002&#150;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Figures are adjusted to 2002&#150;03 prices using the March 2004 GDP deflators.<br>

2. Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local Government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local Government in 1998&#150;99. 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

3. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&#150;2000.<br>

4. The Outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the expenditure in 2002&#150;03 is not strictly comparable with earlier years as it includes an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers.<br>

5. Net current expenditure includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.<br>

6. Net current expenditure after recharges was not recorded on RO1 until 1993&#150;94. Consequently up to and including 1992&#150;93 net recurrent expenditure is used and consequently figures in those years may not be strictly comparable with figures for future years.<br>

 For the academic year 2003&#150;04, core funding rates per qualification increased by 3 per cent. for school sixth forms and 10 per cent. for further education colleges. The 10 per cent. increase in core funding rates per qualification for further education colleges includes a 2 per cent. increase to compensate colleges for increases to the employer contribution to the Teachers Pension Scheme; and a 3.5 per cent. increase to reflect the consolidation of previously targeted funds for pay and staff training. The additional resources to schools for changes to the employer contribution to the Teachers Pension Scheme were allocated separately from the qualification rates to schools. The allocation was based on pupil numbers and area costs. The amount per pupil before area cost adjustments was &#163;103 in 2003&#150;04.

Although we have already invested a record amount in FE this spending review, we have added &#163;130 millionextra to the LSC&#039;s budget that will allow allocations for 2004&#150;05 to be kept on track for all colleges that are performing to target. This is an important extra investment which will

also support a process of change and help colleges develop towards a more demand-led system in which colleges are increasingly funded from a variety of sources, particularly from employers.

<p><a name="40622w28.html_spnew6"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) estimate that in 2002/03 there were about 17,000 different qualifications being studied for in further education (FE) colleges in England. This estimate covers LSC funded FE provision only and includes some non-accredited qualifications. In addition to this 17,000, some colleges also provide higher education courses, and many local authorities contract out some of their adult and community learning provision to FE colleges.

 The Department&#039;s main data source for monitoring the destination of graduates is the First Destination Survey (FDS), which is collected annually by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).

<i>[holding answer 9 June 2004]:</i> The Higher Education Bill includes provisions which will ensure that no institution can charge higher variable fees without an access plan approved by the Director of Fair Access. The access plan will include the outreach measures and financial support which the institutions will undertake to ensure access is safeguarded and promoted. We also propose to abolish the requirement to pay up front fees for all full time undergraduates&#151;they will be able to defer their fees, and repay them after they graduate.

In addition the maintenance loan will be increased to cover average basic living costs for undergraduates. From 2006, the poorest students will be eligible for the &#163;2,700 maintenance grant, as well as minimum &#163;300 bursary support. And all students commencing their courses after 2006 will benefit from a loan write off after 25 years.

[179762]</p>








<p><a name="40622w29.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 Research reports commissioned by the ODPM and undertaken by Wilcox and PA Consulting concluded that key worker affordability is at its worst in London and the South East; the areas of the country with the highest house prices. Available evidence suggests that a significant problem for key worker employers is the retention of more experienced/older key workers. Each year, 3,800 teachers (school and FE) leave teaching in London, the South East and East for reasons strongly associated with housing. We therefore determined that our highest priority should be that set of London teachers identified in the London Challenge strategy document as &quot;leaders of the future&#039;, who currently leave London teaching in order to afford family homes elsewhere. This group numbers around 500 each year. Second priority is the next group of London teachers (school and FE)&#151;numbering some 1,750, and the third priority is the remaining group of 1,550, largely outside London. We were clear that teachers in our target groups are largely looking for homes to buy, not rent. For our highest priority group, family homes are the issue.

Notes:<br>

1. The financial data are taken from Local Education Authorities&#039; 2003&#150;04 Section 52 Budget Statement Table 1 submitted to the DfES. Gross figures are provided rather than net as income cannot be split by phase of education. All figures are as recorded in LEAs&#039; Section 52 Budget statements. Figures may not sum due to rounding.<br>

2. In addition to the Total Schools Budget for secondary schools &#163;3,012 million was spent on total LEA central functions and part of this would have been used to support secondary education.<br>

3. Within the schools&#039; budget the amount available for delegation to schools after provision has been made for retained items is known as the Individual Schools Budget (ISB). ISB for secondary schools is &#163;9,985 million of which &#163;1,303 million is supported by the LSC for the funding of education for pupils in Sixth Forms.<br>

4. Total Standards Fund includes: Standards Fund allocation&#151;Revenue (the Standards Fund allocation that the authority expects to devolve to its schools); Standards Fund&#151;Non-Devolved (Standards Fund allocations not yet planned to be devolved to schools or to be spent centrally on items in the schools block; and Specific Formula Grants&#151;Excellence in Cities (expenditure pursuant to a partnership agreement (under the DfES programme known as &quot;Excellence in Cities&quot;) made between the authority, the Secretary of State and one or more of the authority&#039;s schools. In previous years this was not a separate line item but was recorded under the Devolved Standards Fund).<br>

5. Total post-16 LSC funding streams comprises of the memorandum items of expenditure included within the Total Schools Budget. The allocation from LSC for 16+ funding is included in (i) within the ISB. The sixth form elements of the provision for pupils with statements, the fees to independent schools for pupils without statements and the fees for pupils at independent special schools and abroad 



is included in other lines within the Total Schools Budget. Consequently the Total Schools Budget for secondary schools comprises of the total of (i) to (iii) plus additional expenditure of &#163;894 million for secondary schools on areas such as SEN, education out of school, school meals, school based strategic management, non-standards fund grants and capital expenditure from revenue.<br>

<p><a name="40622w31.html_spnew1"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 In general, repayments of income-contingent loans are collected through the tax system. Repayments are notified to the Student Loans Company (SLC) after the end of the tax year, after which time has to be allowed for SLC to reconcile the repayments notified with their records. There will therefore be some borrowers who have repaid their accounts in financial years 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, but this will not have been reported yet. Therefore data for those years understates the true number of borrowers making repayments. However, latest information from the SLC shows the following:

Borrowers enter repayment status, i.e. are due to make repayments on their loans, in the April after graduating or otherwise leaving their course. No repayments are deducted from income-contingent borrowers with income below &#163;10,000 per year. Borrowers with income-contingent loans can also make voluntary repayments, either in the form of pre-payments before they enter repayment status, or ad-hoc repayments to accelerate their repayments after entering repayment status. These repayments are made directly by the borrower to the SLC. The table shows the number of UK income-contingent loan borrowers who have entered repayment status by tax year.

However, we recognise that some schools will require headroom in their budgets in order to meet the contractual change from September 2005.

To that end, we are currently working with six LEAs and about a dozen schools in each of those LEAs to get a better understanding of their starting points, how they plan to deliver the reforms and to what extent this can be achieved through the redeployment of existing resources.
