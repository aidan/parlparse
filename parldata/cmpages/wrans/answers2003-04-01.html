 The Government will continue to report to Parliament and the public on their performance through a variety of means, such as reports, statistical bulletins, ministerial statements and parliamentary questions. The information in the annual report was in any event a collation of existing, publicly available, material and it has therefore been decided not to continue with it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority has made budgetary provision to develop the project further and to undertake preliminary works, if and when the outstanding planning issues are resolved. It is intended that the main works should be built and financed through a Special Purpose Vehicle and the Authority is discussing with the Department how best to structure this.

<P>
12. <a name="30401w01.html_wqn3"><B> Vernon Coaker: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Secretary of State's Directions and Guidance require the Strategic Rail Authority to have regard to "compatibility and consistency with local transport plans and regional transport strategies." The Authority's Strategic Plan sets out the developments being taken forward over the next 10 years in each area of the country.

<P>
<a name="30401w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Total investment in the rail industry in 2001&#150;02, excluding rolling stock, was &#163;3.1 billion. The bulk of this is in respect of rail infrastructure. Details of this investment are set out in "National Rail Trends", which is published by the SRA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We are in regular contact with the Authority over all aspects of railway services. The Authority is currently considering a draft report which it has recently received on the potential viability of a new north to south High Speed Line.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Following completion of the first Public Private Partnership contract on 31 December 2002, the Government expect the remaining two contracts to be completed very soon. The PPP brings in the modernisation the Underground so badly needs.
<P>

<a name="30401w01.html_para0">The Government want London Underground to transfer to Transport for London as soon as possible, and is working closely with TfL, London Underground and other interested parties to achieve that.

16. <a name="30401w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. David Stewart: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many responses he has received to his consultative document on the future of air transport in the UK.  [105802]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We have received over 100,000 responses (letters and questionnaires) to the consultation from all areas of the UK, and the majority originate from the south-east of England and the midlands.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Heald: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assumptions were made in the SERAS Air Passenger Forecasting Model in respect of <i>(a)</i> demand transferring to off-peak flights, <i>(b)</i> demand transferring to regional airports and <i>(c)</i> demand transferring to rail, in assessing the consequences for fare levels of a shortfall in airport capacity in the South East; and if he will make a statement.  [106217]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The consequences of a shortfall in airport capacity in the South East are an output of the SERAS Air Passenger Forecasting Model, not input assumptions. The model assigns passengers according to their 'least cost' route between the start point of their journey and its end point, as described in the SERAS Stage 2 Methodology Supporting document no 29, "Rules and Modelling." A shortfall in capacity at a specific airport leads to a 'fare premium' to balance demand and supply at that airport. This fare premium is only applied in the model when 'off-peak' flights at the constrained airport have already taken the initial burden of adjustment, so that airport utilisation throughout the day is high. With airport capacity constraints applying in the South East, some traffic with a South East origin is displaced to regional airports, some traffic with a regional origin is clawed back by regional airports, some traffic transfers to other transport modes including rail, and some traffic is suppressed entirely.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w01.html_wqn11"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what guidance he gives about the impact on air passengers' and carriers' liability of <i>(a)</i> a war and <i>(b)</i> a terrorist attack.  [105275]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The liability of air carriers' is established by international and European law and no further guidance is necessary.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Heald: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how much aviation fuel was consumed by UK civil aviation in the last year for which figures are available, broken down into fuel consumed by <i>(a)</i> domestic and <i>(b)</i> international air travel.  [106219]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Based on data reported by airlines to the Civil Aviation Authority, it is estimated that UK airlines used 10.2 million tonnes of fuel in 2002. Although such fuel usage is reported as a total it is broadly estimated that about 90 per cent. was expended on international aviation and 10 per cent on domestic aviation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Heald: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what airport development options in the South-East other than those described in The Future of Air Transport in the UK: South East he is considering; if those options will be included in the forthcoming white paper on aviation; and what the consultation arrangements for these options are.  [106220]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government will consider all responses to The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: South East submitted by 30 June 2003 including any reasonable alternatives to the options for new airport capacity set out in the consultation document. If the Government concluded that any such alternative schemes were superior to the 



<P>
<P><I>1 Apr 2003 : Column 612W</I><P>
options in the consultation document and wished to consider including them in the air transport white paper, there would be a full consultation process.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w01.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The junction will be approved as soon as all design and safety issues have been addressed. The Highways Agency and the developer have made significant progress and will continue to work closely to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.

<P>
<a name="30401w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what assistance he provides to local authorities in order that they can provide free rail passes to pensioners entitling them to concessionary rail travel;  [106071]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether his Department instructs local authorities on the rate at which rail passes should be supplied to pensioners for concessionary rail travel;  [106070]
<P>
(3) what discussions he has had with HM Treasury regarding the provision of free <i>(a)</i> passes for pensioners entitling them to concessionary rail travel and <i>(b)</i> off-peak travel on all public transport for all pensioners;  [106072]
<P>
(4) what guidelines he issues to local authorities on the provision of rail passes for pensioners entitling them to concessionary travel.  [106069]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Beyond the statutory minimum requirement for concessionary travel (half-fare on local buses for older and disabled people, with no charge for the pass) decisions about whether to offer a more generous scheme for bus and rail travel are for the relevant PTAs/local authorities.
<P>

<a name="30401w02.html_para0">Expenditure on concessionary travel schemes is covered by the contribution that the Government makes to local authorities through the annual grant settlement, including where a PTA/local authority offers consessionary travel on local railways.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B>

 It is not standard practice to verify claims of commercial confidentiality on receiving information from organisations as this issue is normally only relevant if the question arises as to whether the information should be disclosed to another party. The Treasury has not issued guidance on this issue. In the event of a request for information claimed to be commercially confidential, officials would rely on the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information and central guidance on the operation of the Code to determine whether information should be withheld.

 UK military forces continue to operate in Afghanistan but at a much lower level than during the period of the overthrow of the Taliban and the successful establishment of the International Security Assistance Force. We continue to work in close co-operation with other nations but we are receiving no direct subsidies for our military operations in Afghanistan.

 HM Customs and Excise are responsible for collecting indirect taxes and enforcing Government requirements relating to the movement of goods into and out of the UK. Customs' focus is on managing risks to the revenue, such as smuggling of spirits and wine, and risks to society that arise from the illegal importation of prohibited or restricted goods, such as Class A drugs.

 In the 2002 Budget, the Government set out its intention to modernise stamp duty, and as part of this reform to review the stamp duty charged on leases. Further information on policy options was published in the consultative document, "Modernising Stamp Duty on land and buildings in the UK," in April 2002. The Chancellor will report on progress in modernising stamp duty in this year's Budget.

 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his Budget last April that we are reviewing the residence and domicile rules as they affect the tax liabilities of individuals. We believe that any modernisation of these rules needs to be based on clear principles: the rules should be fair, clear, easy to operate and support the competitiveness of the British economy. As indicated in paragraph 5.82 of the Pre-Budget Report last November, the Treasury and the Inland Revenue will be publishing a background paper to aid discussion of how the rules compare with the Government's principles.

<P>

<a name="30401w03.html_para4">In June 2002 we adjusted the rules that apply to the construction of new annexes which are partly used for charitable purposes. In the pre-Budget Report in November 2002, we announced the closure of a heavily exploited tax avoidance loophole, ensuring that the full payment for a new commercial building is subject to VAT.

 It is not standard practice to verify claims of commercial confidentiality on receiving information from organisations, as this issue is normally relevant only if the question arises as to whether or not the information should be disclosed to another party.
<P>

<a name="30401w04.html_para2">The Code of Practice on Access to Government Information provides a specific exemption for a third party's commercial confidences, and the Code and the guidance on the operation of the Code helps officials to determine whether such information should be disclosed or withheld in response to an individual request. In deciding this, officials need to consider if "unwarranted disclosure would harm the competitive position of a third party." This would normally involve consultation with the third party involved. Even where the exemption to disclosure applies, the information in question must still be made available if there is an overriding public interest in disclosure, usually appropriate only where there is a substantial risk to public health, safety or the environment.

The White Paper, "The Future of Higher Education", highlighted how those with higher education qualifications earn on average around 50 per cent. more than non-graduates. There will inevitably be some individual variation in lifetime returns because graduate earnings are influenced by a number of factors, including the subject studied, institution attended, occupational choices and other personal characteristics and demographic factors.

 Since September 2000, &#163;6,000 teacher training bursaries have been offered to students taking Postgraduate Certificate in Education courses at institutions in England. For those students who train as specialist teachers of mathematics, science, modern languages, technology or English, and who go on, after induction, to teach those subjects in maintained schools in England, a further &#163;4,000 "golden hello" is available. From September 2002, these incentives have been supplemented by Repayment of Teachers' Loans Scheme, a three-year pilot to increase the numbers of new teachers of priority subjects by paying off their student loans over time. With better pay for teachers, and the new measures to reduce workloads and provide more support in the classroom that we have proposed, these initiatives have raised the numbers of teachers in schools to their highest level for 20 years and brought about a 20 per cent. rise in the number of recruits to initial teacher training courses since 1999&#150;2000.

<P>
<a name="30401w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 From mid-November 2002 to mid-March 2003 oil prices (Brent) rose by around $10 per barrel to over $33 per barrel due to a range of factors, including: a significant disruption to supplies from Venezuela; low levels of OECD commercial oil stocks, particularly in the United States and Asia-Pacific; very cold weather in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly the United States; and market uncertainty about international developments regarding Iraq.
<P>

<a name="30401w05.html_para0">Despite the loss of oil supplies from Iraq and a disruption to supplies from Nigeria, a combination of increased supply from producers (including a recovery in Venezuelan production), a seasonal fall in world oil demand, and reduced market uncertainty about developments regarding Iraq has seen oil prices fall to around $25 to $27 per barrel in late March.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment his Department has made of the effect of <i>(a)</i> a short and <i>(b)</i> a prolonged conflict in Iraq on the underlying supply and demand situation for oil.  [105689]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 No significant disruption to the underlying supply and demand balance for oil is expected to arise from military action in Iraq. Prior to conflict, Iraqi oil production stood at around 2.5 million barrels per day or only 3 per cent. of total world oil production, of which only around 1.5 to 2 million barrels per day was exported. Over the past few months, producers have increased oil supplies and this incremental supply is now reaching markets, with more oil on the way. Combined with a seasonal downturn in world oil demand in the second quarter this is helping to balance the oil market. OPEC producers have pledged to use their available excess capacity to ensure that the market remains adequately supplied. Moreover, the International Energy Agency remains ready to reinforce producers' efforts, including through the release of stocks, should the need arise.

 The European Spallation Source (ESS) is a potential project to build a new neutron source for European scientists. The UK has been involved in the discussions on ESS since a European Commission report in 1990 recommended a design study for a next generation neutron source. A Council was formed in 1993, including UK membership, and the initial design study was published in 1996. Further research and development was needed before a fair decision could be taken to build the ESS. Participating laboratories around Europe have been undertaking this R&D. The UK has been represented in the Council and has participated in the R&D via the Council for the Central Laboratories of the Research Councils (CCLRC), an NDPB Agency of the Department who operate the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory near Oxford and the Daresbury Laboratory near Warrington. CCLRC have responsibility for ensuring that UK researchers have access to neutron facilities now and in the future. They also operate the UK's current neutron source.

The inquiries were a statutory requirement under the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991. Pre-inquiry meetings were held by the PAC on 18 October 2001, 26 October 2001, 13 December 2001 and 8 January 2002 to establish arrangements for the inquiries and deal with procedural queries. The actual inquiries took place between

22 January and 31 January 2002. Preparatory work, which necessitated input from planning, vesting, legal (including counsel), transportation, built heritage and urban design consultants extended over a five month period and resulted in costs of &#163;215,000. The Department incurred a further &#163;507,900 in consultancy costs during the inquiry itself. These costs relate to the preparation and presentation of the Department's case in the form of written and oral evidence to the inquiries.

<a name="30401w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Council Directive 90/539/EEC sets out animal health conditions concerning intra Community trade in live poultry, including pheasants. Pheasants entering the UK from EU Member States must be accompanied by an export health certificate, which is issued by the Veterinary Authorities in the country of the origin. The export health certificate confirms that the Official Veterinarian has examined the pheasants and they meet the necessary health conditions specified in Council Directive 90/539/EEC. The Veterinary Authorities in the exporting Member State inform the appropriate local animal health office in the UK by an ANIMO message (animal movement system) that a health certificate has been signed and a consignment of birds is on its way. In addition, the importer in the UK must give at least 24 hours notice in writing to the Divisional Veterinary Manager responsible for the place of destination, of his intention to import the birds, the nature of the consignment, its anticipated date of arrival and the place of destination.
<P>

<a name="30401w07.html_para7">Council Directive 96/482/EEC lays down animal health conditions and veterinary certificates for the import of poultry, including pheasants, from Third Countries. Import of pheasants into the UK is allowed only from those Third Countries which can provide assurances supported by appropriate documents, or as a result of on-the-spot inspections, satisfy the necessary animal health conditions required by the UK and the European Commission. Pheasants entering the EU from Third Countries must be accompanied by an export health certificate issued by an Official Veterinarian in the country of origin. The health certificate confirms that the Official Veterinarian in the country of the origin has inspected the pheasants and they meet all the conditions specified in Council Directive 96/482/EEC. There is a post import isolation of 42 days. The State Veterinary Staff in the UK carry out at least six veterinary checks on the pheasants imported from Third Countries in the first 14 days after import. The Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge carries out tests on sick and dead pheasants to identify any possible disease. In addition, the local Divisional Veterinary Manager will receive an ANIMO message and import notification in the same way as EU imports.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A number of measures are already in place to protect all woodland in England, including ancient semi-natural woodlands, where the biodiversity and cultural heritage values are the highest. In particular, the felling of any type of woodland is controlled through felling regulations. Additionally, many woodlands are subject to further controls because they are within designated areas such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest or Special Areas of Conservation.

<a name="30401w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 27 March 2003]:</i> 2.5 per cent. of seizures of products of animal origin reported to DEFRA. Since March 2002, the Department has put in place measures to tackle the disease risks posed by illegal imports of all types of meat and animal products under the Illegal Imports Action Plan. Just under &#163;3 million has been spent this financial year on that plan. It is not possible to determine how much of this was spent to discourage the import specifically of bushmeat. We have made available a total of &#163;25 million over the next three financial years for measures to tackle all illegal imports of animal and plant products.
<P>

<a name="30401w09.html_para0">In the current financial year, additional measures have been introduced at ports and airports to tackle illegal imports. Temporary agency staff, funded by DEFRA, have been recruited to carry out checks to detect smuggled goods&#151;teams of six are based at our major airports and teams of two at major seaports. We are also paying for additional checks through overtime elsewhere. Further inspection resources have also been provided through the detector dog pilot, and a publicity campaign which has targeted ports, airports and overseas points of departure. We are working with airlines to get our message across through in-flight announcements and videos. We are also advertising on seven million ticket wallets to long-haul destinations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what proportion of her Department's funding allocation to the Carbon Trust has been spent in each year since the Trust's creation; and what assessment she has made of the impact of that expenditure.  [105219]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 27 March 2003]:</i> The Carbon Trust was created in April 2001, taking over management of the non-domestic part of the Energy Efficiency Best Practice programme (EEBPp) in July 2002 (which it re-launched as Action Energy) and administration of the Enhanced Capital Allowances programme in August 2002. In this time the Carbon Trust has also formulated its programmes, market research and proper financial and procurement procedures. In line with their remit the Carbon Trust have constructed and launched new and innovative programmes such as the Foundation Phase of the Low Carbon Innovation Programme (LCIP) in May 2002. The full LCIP programme has been notified to the European Commission for State Aids consideration.
<P>

<a name="30401w09.html_para3">The Carbon Trust was allocated &#163;26.5 million in 2001&#150;02 by my Department, and a total of &#163;49.6 million for 2002&#150;03 (including &#163;17.1 million from the EEBPp). Carbon Trust spend for 2001&#150;02 was &#163;5.5 million (composed of &#163;3.1 million spend and &#163;2.4 million to enhance the EEBPp), accurate spend figures for 2002&#150;03 are not yet available from the Carbon Trust, however Defra has received and is considering a request for &#163;20 million end year flexibility from the Carbon Trust's 2002&#150;03 allocation.
<P>

<a name="30401w09.html_para4">The Trust has already done much valuable work in its three main programme areas and is taking a proactive role in the energy efficiency arena in its role as the main source of energy efficiency information and advice for non-domestic sector. The impact of the Carbon Trust will be measured in terms of carbon savings, including savings from their Research and Development and Demonstration work. An initial impact assessment programme for the Trust is being developed and should provide preliminary results over the summer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what guidance her Department issues to civil servants on how to deal with claims from organisations that the information they provide to the Department is commercially confidential.  [105555]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w09.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 It is not standard practice to verify claims of commercial confidentiality on receiving information from organisations, as this issue is normally only relevant if the question arises as to whether or not the information should be disclosed to another party. Access to the environmental information which Defra holds is subject to the Environmental Information Regulations 1992. Detailed guidance on implementing the Regulations, including the exception relating to commercial confidentiality, is publicly available on the Defra website at http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/pubaccess/index.htm.




<P>
<P><I>1 Apr 2003 : Column 641W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30401w09.html_para5">Where information is not subject to the Environmental Information Regulations 1992, the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, and the guidance on the operation of the Code, helps officials determine whether information should be disclosed or withheld in response to an individual request. Exemption 13 under the Code relates to a third party's commercial confidences. In deciding whether or not information should be withheld under this exemption, officials must consider whether "unwarranted disclosure would harm the competitive position of a third party". While it is ultimately up to Departments to determine, in accordance with the Code, whether to disclose the information, the third party whose interests may be adversely affected should normally be consulted in order to inform the Department's decision. Even where the exemption prima facie applies, the information in question must still be disclosed if there is an overriding public interest in disclosure. However, under the Code, disclosure of commercially confidential information will usually only be appropriate where the risk to public health, public safety or the environment is substantial and specific. A decision to refuse requested information may be made without consultation with the supplier of information where the case for confidentiality is obvious and overwhelming.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many of the recommendations contained in Farming and Food: A Sustainable Future have been <i>(a)</i> fully and <i>(b)</i> partially implemented.  [105214]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
<i> [holding answer 27 March 2003]:</i> The Government fully accepted the analysis and vision set out in the Policy Commission's report. The vast majority of its 105 recommendations are being implemented within the Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food, which was launched on 12 December 2002. Good progress has already been made. Examples include the establishment of the Food Chain Centre, supporting English Farming and Food Partnerships (EFFP) under the Agricultural Development Scheme, and the launch of a new Entry-Level Pilot Scheme.
<P>

<a name="30401w10.html_para0">The Policy Commission's report made it clear that the onus is not on Government alone to deliver this change. Many of the Commission's recommendations are targeted wholly or partly at the food and farming industry, which has a pivotal part to play.

The Directive sets out clear procedures and deadlines for each stage of the decision-making process by member states and the European Commission. On any assessment, final decisions at EU level on any of the 19 applications are unlikely to be taken before the end of the year at the very earliest. By that time we will have the first set of results from our crop trials, the report of the public debate, and the information provided by the other parts of the work programme on GM that the Government has put in place.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) whether the UK Government is required by EC Directive 2001/18 to give an opinion on each of the 19 Part C marketing consents submitted to EU member states so far this year; and for each application, what the latest date is by which the United Kingdom's opinion is required for each of those 19 Part C applications should the UK Government consider that all the information requirements required of applicants under the Directive have been met;  [105658]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 EC Directive 2001/18 places obligations on all European Union Member States with regard to Part C marketing consents, which includes a timetable for each stage. If a Part C application is made to the United Kingdom, we are requried to complete its assessment of compliance with the Directive within 90 days. This deadline excludes any period during which further information is being sought from the applicant. In the two current cases of such applications, additional information is being sought from the applicants. Accordingly, I cannot predict when a UK opinion on either will be required, since it depends upon when the information is provided. Any favourably assessed application would subsequently be submitted for scrutiny by other European Union Member States.
<P>

<a name="30401w10.html_para4">In the case of a Part C application to another Member State, the United Kingdom has 60 days from receipt of a positive assessment to submit any comments it may have. It is important that we contribute to the thorough scrutiny of these applications. If we were to be concerned that a particular crop may pose a risk to human health or the environment then it is clearly important that the UK submits a reasoned objection. The UK's non participation would not delay the timetable for taking decisions in Brussels. Two applications have reached this stage so far, and in both cases the UK had until 25 March 2003 to submit a response, and in both cases we sought further information necessary to completing our assessment. The deadline for comments on each of the other 15 applications will depend upon if and when positive assessments are submitted by the appropriate lead

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether it is her policy that, under the terms of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, developed countries' production allowance for chlorofluorocarbons for export to meet the basic domestic needs of developing countries should be further reduced below the percentages allowed in the Beijing Adjustment to the Protocol; and whether the United Kingdom will raise this issue as one to be advanced by the EC in this year's meeting of the parties to the Protocol.

<a name="30401w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The UK is keen to ensure that there is no oversupply of CFCs in developing countries as a result of production for basic domestic needs, as this could lead to CFCs being available at lower prices than alternatives and hence could jeopardise developing countries' compliance with consumption controls under the Montreal Protocol. The European Commission is currently finalising a study on the production of CFCs in both developed and developing countries for basic domestic needs and the level of supply of these substances. Based on the conclusions in this report we will consider, with the Commission and other EU member states, what further adjustments to the levels of production agreed in Beijing in 1999 might be appropriate for consideration by the Parties to the Protocol at their meeting this year. The UK is a member of a working group of member states established by the Commission to discuss this.

National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory. Aircraft emissions during the complete take off and landing cycle up to 1,000m are allocated to the airport. Consequently a proportion of the emissions are emitted at some height and horizontal distance from the boundaries of the airport. Emissions are calculated from aircraft movement data. The emissions are based on the number of aircraft movements at the airport in relevant years. Emissions from aircraft support vehicles are based on UK totals for this sector apportioned pro-rata according to the number of aircraft movements.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reasons transporting livestock to and from shows will no longer be exempt from the six-day standstill.  [105642]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We announced in a written statement on 23 January 2003 that the standstill would be reduced from 20 to six days for cattle, sheep and goats with effect from 4 March 2003, but with far fewer exemptions.
<P>

<a name="30401w11.html_para1">The mixing of animals at shows&#151;just as at markets&#151;presents a risk of spreading undetected disease. During the period when the general rule was a 20-day whole farm standstill, it was agreed that an exemption could be allowed for show animals, but only if they were isolated in Defra approved facilities for 20 days before moving to shows and on return home.
<P>

<a name="30401w11.html_para2">The removal of most of the exemptions to the standstill is a counter-balance to the increased risk created by the reduction in standstill period to six days. Pigs&#151;which are still subject to a 20-day whole farm standstill&#151;may take advantage of an exemption if they are individually identified and isolated for 20 days in approved Defra facilities before moving to a show.

 <i>[holding answer 24 March 2003]:</i> The Government are keen to see supermarkets re-examine supply routes to reduce journeys wherever sensible. However, the issues involved are complex and reducing food miles may not always be the most environmentally preferable solution in terms of reducing overall energy consumption. To help clarify the issues, Defra and DfT are supporting a study by Transport 2000 into the scope for reducing food miles in selected product sectors by using local suppliers and different distribution patterns.

Defra has recently commissioned external research on food miles. The purpose of this research is to establish preferred statistical measure(s) of food miles and their validity as indicators for assessing progress towards sustainability in the food chain.

 Official travel should always be arranged by the most cost-effective means and route. The Ministry of Defence operates a range of RAF Trooping and part-charter flights to and from those overseas areas where there is a major and permanent United Kingdom military presence such as Germany, Cyprus, the USA and Brunei. If the journey is covered by a Trooping or MOD charter flight this should be used whenever possible. Where commercial flights are necessarily used, however, the MOD can call upon a number of Discounted Fare Agreements that have been negotiated with major airlines to enable journeys to be completed at reduced cost. If scheduled commercial flights are used in this way, the class of travel is determined by grade and flight time. Those in the grade of Permanent Secretary are entitled to fly business class where the flight time is under 2.5 hours and first class for longer flights. All other grades are required to use economy class for flights of less than 2.5 hours duration and business class for the longer journeys.

It would be open to the Security Council to change these arrangements in the future.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development pursuant to her answer to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam of 26 March, concerning debt stock reductions, how many of the qualifying HIPC countries have started to receive their debt relief.  [106110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w13.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 To date, 26 countries out of a total of 37 eligible countries have qualified for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, and will receive over US$62 billion in debt relief. Of these, eight countries (Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda) have reached Completion Point. At this stage, they receive an irrevocable reduction in their stock of debt. The remaining 18 (Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome & Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Zambia) are receiving interim relief on their debt servicing payments. During this stage of the process, these countries are no longer required to make any further payments on the debt to be written off. We expect most of the remaining 18 countries to reach Completion Point within the next two years when they, too, will receive irrevocable debt relief. It is difficult to predict when the other 11 countries will qualify for HIPC relief, as many are still affected by conflict or severe governance problems. We expect the Democratic Republic of Congo to reach its Decision Point when the Transitional Government is installed and the Central African Republic, Comoros and Cote d'lvoire to do so later this year if appropriate progress is made. The remaining countries (Burundi, Congo Republic, Liberia, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Togo) are a long way from qualifying, as they are affected by conflict or have serious governance concerns. But if the Sudan peace makes progress then debt relief will be made available to Sudan.

 These statements are based on legal advice on the applicability of the 1907 Hague Regulations and the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Article 55 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states that: "To the fullest extent of the means available to it, the Occupying Power has the duty of ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population; it should, in particular, bring in the necessary foodstuffs, medical stores and other articles if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate". Section III of the Hague Regulations sets out the limits of military authority over the territory of an occupied state; parts of the Geneva Conventions are also relevant.

 <sup>1</sup>  This has been calculated by taking the average grant for each UK constituency, and then identifying the median average of those averages.
<BR>
 <sup>2</sup>  We have defined the eastern area as the eastern region. Since regions are defined by local authorities not constituencies some constituencies may cross the regional boundary. This means that some awards will have been included because they are within a constituency, though the postcode may fall outside the region.

 Individual probation areas have discretion over the type of unpaid work that is assigned to offenders sentenced to community punishment (the new name for what was community service). Home Office National Standards for the Supervision of Offenders in the Community require probation areas to ensure that unpaid work is physically, emotionally or mentally demanding, so that it constitutes an effective deterrent to offending behaviour and a credible alternative to custody. Further guidance specifies that activities should take into account the needs of individuals, such as those related to gender, ethnicity or ability, meet health and safety requirements and must not replace work that would normally be carried out by paid employees. Typical unpaid work includes canal clearance, removal of graffiti and the decoration of community centres.

 All prisons and prisoner records are linked to the Inmate Information System (IIS), although any linking of current records to previous custody information is done manually, as I outlined in my answer of 17 March 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 586W, to the hon. Member. It is not possible to provide a percentage of the records that are linked in this way, as no central record is maintained of this information.
<P>

<a name="30401w16.html_para5">However, prisons do routinely receive details of previous convictions from the court or police authorities and everything possible is done to link current records with previous custody information.
<P>

<a name="30401w16.html_para6">The current IIS system is being reviewed and the linking of information, both on previous periods in custody and more widely with other Criminal Justice agencies, will be a major consideration of that review.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 6 March 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1243W, on prisons, what measures the Government is taking to ensure the current planned uncrowded capacity for prisons in England and Wales in 2004 is closer to his Department's forecast average prison population for the same year.  [105237]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w16.html_spnew12"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Government has provided resources for the Prison Service to increase uncrowded capacity from 66,000 places in 2003 to 67,000 places in 2004. It is recognised that uncrowded population in 2004. However, capacity planning assumes that the Prison Service not only uses accommodation efficiently but that some accommodation can be overcrowded where appropriate services and regime facilities are provided. Care is taken by the Prison Service to assess the risks to safety, security and control which increase as population pressures rise. The risks are monitored and all possible steps, including limiting the number of prisoners held in any prison, are taken to mitigate their impact.
<P>

<a name="30401w16.html_para7">The Prison service continues to investigate options for providing further increases in capacity over the coming years, as part of the Government's prison modernisation strategy. This is based on a combination of expanding capacity in existing prisons that we want to keep in the long term, and a programme to build new large multifunction prisons.

We very much welcome the report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation, which is generally very positive and recognises the efforts of the National Probation Service and its partners in ensuring that this new sentencing option is widely available and effectively delivered. The report also reflects a high level of sentencer satisfaction with the DTTO.

 Applications for enforcement can take various forms. Besides an application for the respondent to show reasons why (s)he should not be sent to prison or fined for breaching a previous order, the applicant may also ask the court for directions as to how a contact order can be made to work or the applicant might make a fresh application for contact. While my Department collects data on applications for contact (55,030 in 2001) this does not differentiate between new applications and repeat applications. Statistics on numbers of applications for Directions or for Reasons to Show Cause (enforcement) are not collected.

 The Government's interim response to the "Making Contact Work" report was published on 6 August 2002. It acknowledged the valuable contribution the report made in addressing the difficult, and sensitive issue of children's contact with a non-resident parent. A copy of the report was placed in the Libraries of both Houses. It set out the work being carried out, with representatives from the judiciary, legal professions, CAFCASS, other Government Departments, academia and the voluntary sector, to achieve the improvements envisaged by the Children Act sub-Committee. Work continues in the four key areas of information and communication, safety, child contact centres; and facilitation and enforcement.

 The Court of Protection will only become involved in cases where the minor is also a patient, and the award is at least &#163;20,000. In cases where the Court of Protection is involved, it will appoint a receiver. In the case of a large award the Master of the Court will normally meet the parents/receivers to discuss a monthly budget, any capital which needs to be set aside (e.g. for purchasing property, a car, or special equipment), and the investment of the remainder. The Court will approve an investment strategy. Where the award is large enough to warrant a segregated portfolio, the parent (or receiver in cases where the receiver, is not one of the parents) is given the opportunity to agree the investment broker's proposals for implementing the Court's investment strategy. If the parent/receiver wishes to change the investment strategy, he or she needs to satisfy the Court that the change would be in the child's best interests.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to his oral Answer of 10 February, <i>Official Report,</i> column 636, on the Child Support Agency, what the latest estimates he has made of the numbers of <i>(a)</i> gainers and <i>(b)</i> losers under the new maintenance calculation formula; and what the average amount (i) gained and (ii) lost is for (A) non-resident parents and (B) parents with care.  [98116]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w17.html_spnew10"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Government is reforming the child support scheme to ensure that more children benefit from regular maintenance. The reformed scheme will enable the Child Support Agency to deliver support more effectively to parents with care and their children, will help non-resident parents meet their responsibilities and will help to tackle child poverty. The new scheme will be more transparent, easier for parents to understand, easier for the Agency to calculate maintenance and enforce payment, so children will get the support they need. It will be based on a simple rate, so non-resident parents will know in advance how much maintenance they must pay.
<P>

<a name="30401w17.html_para1">Of those non-resident parents who are earning an income, about 60 per cent. of will have a reduced maintenance liability, and about 40 per cent. will have an increased liability. A further 60 per cent. of those non-resident parents on benefit will have an increased liability for maintenance. Currently, 75 per cent. of NRPs on benefit are treated as having no liability; under the new scheme we expect them to pay a flat rate of &#163;5 to the parent with care.
<P>

<a name="30401w17.html_para2">About 55 per cent. of working parents with care will have a higher maintenance calculation and 40 per cent. will have a lower one. In addition, more than 90 per cent. of parents with care on income support/income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (around one third of a million people) will gain from the Child Maintenance Premium.
<P>

<a name="30401w17.html_para3">We expect that the majority of changes to maintenance liabilities will be for amounts less than &#163;10.
<P>

<a name="30401w17.html_para4">This data is based on an analysis carried out in 2001, and reflects the position had all cases converted to the new scheme on the day of the scan. Since then, average income levels of non-resident parents have increased, which would reduce the fall in the level of maintenance liabilities. To mitigate the effect of substantial change in individual cases, changes may be phased for up to five years.

 Under Pension Credit pensioners will not be subjected to the old weekly means test, which will be replaced by a new form of assessment that is much less intrusive. Claiming Pension Credit will involve a simple phone call on a free telephone line making it easy to apply for. From age 65 most pensioners will have their entitlement fixed for five years. Only significant changes in their circumstances such as marriage, change of address or death of a partner will have to be reported.

In addition to this we are planning to run national and regional press advertising this month and plan further advertising from May onwards.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what plans he has to increase the basic state pension; and if he will re-introduce the link to earnings.  [106092]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w18.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 We have already announced that from April 2003, the basic state pension will increase to &#163;77.45 for single pensioners and to &#163;123. 80 for married couples. Additionally, the minimum income guarantee will increase to &#163;102.10 for single pensioners and &#163;155.80 for couples. Restoring the earnings link does nothing to help poorer pensioners. We will be spending around &#163;7.5 billion extra on pensioners in 2003&#150;04 as a result of measures introduced since 1997. This includes around &#163;3.5 billion that is being spent on the poorest third of pensioners&#151;almost six times as much as an earnings link in the basic state pension since 1998 would have given them. Increases in the basic state pension over the last three years have given single pensioners &#163;1.10 a week more than an earnings link would have given them and &#163;1.75 a week more for couples.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what guidance his Department issues to civil servants on how to deal with claims from organisations that the information they provide to the Department is commercially confidential.  [105554]<P>

<P>
<a name="30401w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 It is not standard practice to verify claims of commercial confidentiality on receiving information from organisations, as this issue is normally only relevant if the question arises as to whether or not the information should be disclosed to another party. The Code of Practice on Access to Government Information&#151;and the guidance on the operation of the Code&#151;helps officials determine whether such information should be disclosed or withheld in response to an individual request.
<P>

<a name="30401w20.html_para0">This code provides a specific exemption&#151;exemption 13&#151;for a third party's commercial confidences. In deciding whether or not information should be withheld under this exemption, officials must consider whether "unwarranted disclosure would harm the competitive position of a third party". While it is ultimately up to the Office to determine, in accordance with the Code, whether to disclose the information, the third party whose interests may be adversely affected should normally be consulted in order to inform the Office's decision. Even where the exemption prima facie applies, the information in question must still be disclosed if there is an overriding public interest in disclosure, but 



<P>
<P><I>1 Apr 2003 : Column 682W</I><P>
disclosure of commercially confidential information without consent will usually be appropriate only where the risk to public health, public safety or the environment is substantial and specific.
<P>

<a name="30401w20.html_para1">A decision to refuse requested information may be made without consultation with the supplier of information where the case for confidentiality is obvious and overwhelming.

 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that the import of chicken from countries outside the European Union is the subject of strict legislation. Chicken must be slaughtered and processed in countries and premises to meet food safety standards at least equivalent to those required within the EU. In addition, it has to meet quality standards required by European Community Marketing Regulations. Third countries must carry out checks on premises to ensure that the required standards are maintained, and take action to deal with failing establishments. The EU also monitors establishments in third countries and can take action to deal with individual establishments or a country that fails to exert appropriate checks and controls.
<P>

<a name="30401w21.html_para1">Chicken from third countries can only be imported into the EU through designated border inspection posts following prior notification.

 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), which has responsibility for food safety matters, that the European Union operates a strict system of controls on imports of products of animal origin from countries outside the EU. All products of animal origin must be pre-notified and presented to a border inspection post. Consignments are subject to

To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his Answer of 6 March 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1203W, on Getting Ahead of the Curve, if he will estimate the short-term transitional costs in establishing the Health Protection Agency; how these costs will be incurred; and what proposals he has to cut services to meet these costs from within existing resources.  [103819]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30401w22.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 There have been and will continue to be some transitional costs.
<P>

<a name="30401w22.html_para0"><i>Initial set-up costs</i>
<P>

<a name="30401w22.html_para1">These comprise largely the costs of a small implementation team and the input of the constituent organizations, which will form the Health Protection Agency (HPA).
<P>

<a name="30401w22.html_para2">These costs, which are in the region of 400,000 to 500,000, have been met from the funding of the organizations moving into the HPA. As staff contributed from a wide range of specialisms, there has been no loss in outputs.
<P>

<a name="30401w22.html_para3"><i>Short to medium term transitional costs</i>
<P>

<a name="30401w22.html_para4">These comprise the establishment of a small separate headquarters for the corporate functions of the HPA pending rationalization of the HPA estate. The cost will be in the region of &#163;500,000 to &#163;600,000 per annum; and
<P>

<a name="30401w22.html_para5">the possibility of a small number of redundancies if&#151;following the application of the change management protocol for filling posts&#151;some staff are left without jobs. This is difficult to quantify at present as organizational structures have not yet been established.
<P>

<a name="30401w22.html_para6">These will be funded from the HPA's allocation from the Department and also underspends/surpluses in 2003&#150;04, which will be rolled forward across the first two to three years of the HPA.
<P>

<a name="30401w22.html_para7">Underspends of almost &#163;3 million revenue and &#163;2.5 million capital have been identified within the organizations which will be subsumed into the HPA; the Public Health Laboratory Service, the National Radiological Protection Board and the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research (CAMR). This is almost entirely slippage of programmes; there have been no cut backs. In addition CAMR has had a very successful trading year, which has resulted in a cash surplus of &#163;5 million to put towards transitional costs.

<P>

<a name="30401w22.html_para9">These projects affect only 164 out of 10,000 wards&#151;less than two per cent., of all wards. To name the trusts involved would give a false impression that the whole trust is not compliant when that is clearly not the case.

 The Department of Health has never endorsed a policy of automatic detoxification of heroin misusers. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to say that the policy of automatic detoxification of patients stabilised in the community on substitute prescriptions has been discontinued. The Department's view is set out in its "Drug Misuse and Dependence&#151;Guidelines on Clinical Management (1999)", which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is important to tailor the treatment needs to those of the individual needs of the presenting patient, especially where substitute treatment for dependence is concerned.
<P>
<BR>
A dose reduction intervention should be shaped by a realistic appraisal of jointly agreed treatment goals and outcomes between the patient, the doctor and other members involved in the patient's care.
<P>
<BR>
Treatment aims and goals should be adjusted accordingly depending on the patients progress.
<P>
<BR>
Methadone maintenance treatment, incorporating psychosocial interventions, can enable patients to achieve stability, reduce their drug misuse and criminal activity, and improve health. For these reasons such treatment should form an important part of drug misuse services.

There is now a choice of substances available for use in opiate maintenance prescribing. There is a need to monitor research progress in this field and to adjust future treatments in the light of new treatment evaluations."

The campaign is based on the successful "SunSmart" campaign in Australia. The campaign has received funding of &#163;120,000 from the United Kingdom Health Departments this year. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign later in the year, with a view to deciding on future funding and campaigns.
<P>

<a name="30401w23.html_para2">The SunSmart campaign consists of a poster and leaflet for the public CRUK website redesign and links to other stakeholders, branding and design of "SunSmart", CRUK commissioned research at the Centre for Social Marketing and a part-time health promotion consultant at CRUK for the duration of the campaign.
<P>

<a name="30401w23.html_para3">The campaign's aim is to increase the profile of the issue of skin cancer and methods of effective sun protection.
<P>

<a name="30401w23.html_para4">The key objectives are to increase knowledge of the causes of skin cancer, increase awareness of actions that can be taken to prevent skin cancer and to influence positively attitudes to sun protection.
<P>

<a name="30401w23.html_para5">Subject to further funding, longer-term aims are to reduce sunlight exposure through changes in behaviour and environment, increase the proportion of people reporting with early stage disease and decrease the proportion of people presenting with late tumours.
<P>

<a name="30401w23.html_para6">The campaign's key messages have been disseminated by way of an alert to the campaign and mailshot pack of posters and leaflets to all GP surgeries and health promotion units nationally, an alert to the campaign and mailshot to secondary schools with 3,500 leaflets and posters and a series of press events over summer 2003 with leaflets/posters targeted in cities and seaside resorts.

 The Department of Health Workforce Census shows that, since the launch of the NHS Plan, from September 1999 to September 2001, there was a net increase in nurses working in the national health service of 20,740. This increase will enable the recruitment of additional nurses to care for cancer patients. This will
