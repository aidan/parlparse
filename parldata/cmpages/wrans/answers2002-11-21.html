<P>
<a name="21121w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 [<i>holding answer 18 November 2002</i>]: The number of soldiers, both trained and untrained, in the British Army as at 1 October 2002 was 111,670; of these 3,580 were non-British personnel. This represents 3.2 per cent. of the total strength. These figures exclude Gurkhas, Full Time Reserve Personnel (FTRS), Royal Irish Home Service and Mobilised Reservists.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what technologies are available to assist the accuracy of the plastic baton round; what he estimates the comparative advantages of L18A1 <i>(a)</i> optical sight, <i>(b)</i> laser sights and <i>(c)</i> other options are; and what the estimated costs are of supplying each.  [80623]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 We believe the L21A1 baton round, fired from the LI04 gun and using the LI 8 optical sight to have state of the art accuracy over its designed range. Such accuracy is critical in reducing the risk of serious injury. The L18A1 optical sight met the accuracy requirement for the baton round and is an intuitive sight to use. It is not possible to cost a laser sight for L21 without examining all the issues of the visibility of a laser spot when viewed through a visor at relevant ranges, against representative targets and in varying lighting conditions. Laser sights can cost between #50 and #1,000 dependent on specification.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what post-development studies have been carried out on the medical effects of the use of the L21A1 baton round;  [80626]
<P>
<UL>(2) what progress has been made in the medical study of the effect of ricocheting L21A1 plastic baton rounds; and if he will place the results in the Library.  [80622]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 An instrumented, technical trial of L21A1 in a typical operational environment has been conducted. This has involved ricochets from street furniture, kerbs, door frames and riot debris as well as inside buildings. The results from the instrumentation are currently being processed and any necessary reruns will be conducted. Once these results are available the medical implications of the ricochets will be assessed. The Sub-Committee, Defence Scientific Advisory Council will be invited to make a statement and it is my intention to place the statement in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="21121w01.html_para2">The L21A1 performance after one year in service was given in my answer on 30 October 22002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 800W. The assessment of the use of L21A1 at ranges from 1m to 20m was reported in the Home Office's answer of 6 November 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 312W.

<a name="21121w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many hours of additional training is required to enable personnel to discharge a baton gun to be fired in situations other than public disorder; what the minimum distance is that a baton round may be discharged at a human target; what level of authorisation is required for this use of the baton gun; and what the reporting requirements are.

<P>
<a name="21121w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Personnel undergo a three-day urban operations package as part of their operational training for use of the baton gun for situations other than public disorder. The circumstances under which members of the Armed Forces may discharge baton rounds at a human target, are set out in the guidance on the Rules of Engagement for the use of baton rounds, which has been previously placed in the Library of the House on 23 October <i>Official Report</i>, column 351W. The tactical use of a baton gun is controlled by either an officer or non-commisioned officer, although ultimate authority is vested in the individual baton gunner who is authorised to use the weapon as and when deemed necessary. If a baton round is fired, a baton log report, giving details of the incident, is completed and forwarded through the chain of command.

<a name="21121w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The 2002 Spending Review provided the Ministry of Defence with an additional #578 million for modernising business information, logistics and support systems across defence. This will help to ensure the delivery of our ambitious efficiency target, freeing resources to strengthen the front line.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many personnel in the <i>(a)</i> Army, <i>(b)</i> RAF and <i>(c)</i> Royal Navy were sent the last Continuous Attitude Survey and encouraged to answer; what proportion of the service members in each service this represents; how his Department ensures that the sample group asked and who reply are representative of the services as a whole; what the differential response rate is in each service by rank; and if he will make a statement.  [81106]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2002]:</i> The number of personnel that were sent the last Continuous Attitude Survey (CAS) for each Service is as follows: Naval Service 2,000; Army 4,006 and RAF 2,000. The proportion of personnel this represented for each Service was 5.3 per cent., 3.9 per cent. and 4.1 per cent. respectively, based on Trained Strength figures for United Kingdom regulars as at 1 September 2002.
<P>

<a name="21121w02.html_para0">In the Naval Service the distribution of the CAS is now carried out through the chain of command rather than directly to the individuals and personnel are encouraged to answer by the offer of participation in a prize draw. The sample groups are entirely random and the sample is sufficient to produce statistically significant results across all ranks.




<P>
<P><I>21 Nov 2002 : Column 213W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21121w02.html_para1">In the Army the Adjutant General writes a personal letter to all unit Commanding Officers asking them to encourage individuals to respond to the survey. The selection criterion works on a rolling basis using the last two digits of Service numbers. The overall population of respondents is large enough to have statistical confidence that the results can be extrapolated against the wider military population.
<P>

<a name="21121w02.html_para2">For the Royal Air Force a letter from the Chief of Staff Air Member for Personnel accompanies each survey encouraging individuals to take part and emphasising the importance placed on the survey. The survey is a rank-stratified random sample. This means that while the number of personnel at each rank to whom the form is issued is determined in advance, taking into account previous response rates, the individuals who actually receive the form are chosen at random, using the last three digits of their Service number. This results in a total sample that is fairly representative of RAF personnel in rank, branch/trade, gender and ethnic group.

<P><I>21 Nov 2002 : Column 216W</I><P>
Dockyard on Friday 15 November; if he will make a statement on a breach of security involving Trident nuclear submarines at Devonport Dockyard on 15 November; what consequential action his Department intends to take; what the state of alert was at Devonport on that day; what the state of security of the nuclear submarines was on that day; and what Royal Navy and other personnel were on the vessel on that day.  [82278]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Naval Base Commander has overall responsibility for security of Devonport Naval Base. Devonport Management Ltd (DML), the owners of Devonport Dockyard and the nuclear licensed site, are responsible for the security of HMS VANGUARD and the refitting/refuelling facility where she is currently undergoing refit. The Naval Base and DML work closely together on security matters.
<P>

<a name="21121w02.html_para12">On the evening of 15 November two anti nuclear protesters gained access to HMS VANGUARD. The submarine, which has no weapons onboard, did not sustain any damage and safety was not compromised. A full inquiry into the incident is being conducted by a team comprising the Head of Security for the Defence Logistics Organisation, a senior MOD Police Officer and a MOD security specialist.
<P>

<a name="21121w02.html_para13">The state of alert at Devonport, and all UK military establishments, on 15 November was XBikini Black Special". Some additional security measures had also been put in place at Devonport in preparation for an anti nuclear demonstration that was expected to take place during the weekend of 16/17 November. VANGUARD'S security status is classified as 'Non Vital Property'. This reflects that there are no weapons on board and also the extensive work the submarine and her reactor are undergoing during refit. At the time of the incident twelve contractors were working within the submarine and three Royal Navy personnel from the submarine were on duty but not onboard.

 The Gurkha Welfare Trust (GWT) is a registered charity independent of the Ministry of Defence. It was established in 1969 to provide financial, medical and community aid to alleviate hardship and distress among Gurkhas and their families when they leave the British Army. The Department recognises the valuable work of the Trust and makes an annual grant in order to pay for the administrative costs of its field arm, the Gurkha Welfare Scheme (GWS). This year the Grant was #710,417. Our Defence Attache in Kathmandu heads the GWS. It spends over #6 million each year in Nepal and our contribution enables nearly all the money raised by the Trust through charitable donations and public appeals to be used for welfare purposes. This includes the payment of welfare pensions to Gurkhas who, in common with many other soldiers recruited to British colours for wartime service, were discharged before completing the requisite period of employment to qualify for a Service pension. The GWS provides, even in the most remote areas of Nepal, primary health care, first aid and emergency treatment, doctors' clinics and elementary dentistry, all free of charge. It is also involved in community projects and the

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the means are of assessing a candidate applying for a competency qualification to fire the L104A1 anti-riot gun; what the minimum number of rounds is a candidate must fire to complete the training course; how many rounds must be fired in test conditions; what the pass score is; what the percentage rate of successful candidates is; and how many hours' training is required before a candidate is ready to take the test.

 All soldiers are, by virtue of their training and experience, considered capable of being trained as a baton gunner. Individuals do not apply to take the L104A1 competency qualification, rather, assessments are made by commanders who then choose who should be trained as a baton gunner. To complete the L21 training course, a minimum of 20 rounds must be fired of which five rounds must be fired under test conditions achieving a grouping of 200mm. There is no score pass or percentage pass rate as such, as training is continued until the standard has been achieved. In addition to the basics of small arms training, it takes a further five hours to train a soldier to safely handle and fire a baton gun.

 Ministry of Defence's plans to withdraw from the Royal hospital Haslar site, following the 1998 decision, are tied to the Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust's development of its Queen Alexandra hospital site at Cosham. It would be premature for the MOD to enter into formal discussions with Gosport borough council until the timescale for the completion of that development is more definite, but informal discussions take place periodically with the Leader of the Council to apprise him of progress, and MOD officials met Council officers on one occasion in 1999 prior to a review of MOD estates in the Gosport and Portsmouth area and after the decision to close Haslar as a MOD site had been taken. At that stage, the local authority&#151;which will ultimately be responsible for determining the future of the site&#151; was reviewing its plans for the local area.

Some of these applications are speculative and not all lead to external appointments being taken up. The rules require only senior officials whose applications are approved by the Prime Minister to confirm to their former department that they have taken up a new appointment on leaving the MOD. Details of such appointments are published in the annual reports of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, copies of which are available in the Library.

 The original objectives of the Defence Stores Management Solution (DSMS) were to manage the single service inventories as a single defence inventory, to build a single system to replace the existing Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force systems, and to provide a deployed inventory management capability. The project had not secured full main gate approval by the time that the project was suspended on grounds of affordability at the time. The requirement, including the continuing need for a deployed inventory management capability, will be addressed as part of a wider end-to-end review of the logistic process, involving the DLO, front-line commands and industry which should complete by mid 2003. Expenditure on DSMS to date totals #140 million and estimated net savings of #650 million over a 10 year period were anticipated from its implementation.

<P>
<a name="21121w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 There are no formal definitions of affordable housing within housing policy. For the purposes of securing affordable housing through the planning system, affordable housing encompasses low-cost market and subsidised housing (irrespective of tenure, ownership&#151;whether exclusive or shared&#151;or financial arrangements) that will be available to people who cannot afford to rent or buy houses generally available on the open market. Local authorities are expected to define through their local plans what they consider to be affordable in the plan area in terms of the relationship between local income levels and house prices or rents for different types of households.
<P>

<a name="21121w05.html_para5">The research report, XDelivering Affordable Housing through Planning Policy", published by DTLR in February 2002, noted that local authorities were not consistent in defining affordable housing, with a tendency in the south to equate affordable housing with social rented housing, and not to consider the full range of alternatives. The report concluded that local authorities should ensure their consideration of affordable housing, including the wider definition given to it by national planning guidance. There are no plans to make the definition less flexible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w06.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The restriction to the number of channels that UKTV can launch under the first and second joint ventures, which were approved in 1997, has not been lifted, but the third and fourth joint ventures, which were approved in 2000, are not subject to a restriction. As BBC commercial service approvals, the joint ventures were not subject to consultation, nor were they publicised.

 BBC Worldwide's joint ventures with Flextech have been subject to my right hon. Friend's approval, but the commercial channels launched by UKTV under the terms of those joint ventures are not.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w06.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 It is a condition of the joint ventures under which UKTV channels operate that they must abide fully by the BBC's fair trading commitment, the commercial policy guidelines and all the requirements of EU and UK competition law. They are also subject to external audit by independent fair trading auditors and to the UK and EU competition authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w06.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The BBC's licence fee funded services are distinct from the BBC's commercial services. The market impact of any new BBC licence fee funded service is one of the factors the Secretary of State must consider in her assessment of a proposal. This is not the case for BBC commercial services. However, BBC commercial services must comply with EU and UK competition law, as well as the BBC's Fair Trading Commitment and the Commercial Policy Guidelines.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w07.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The BBC has statutory responsibility for the administration of the television licensing system and for determining the licensing requirements in specific circumstances. I cannot, therefore, comment in detail on how those requirements would apply in particular cases. However, the requirement to have a licence relates to the installation or use (actual or intended) of the apparatus in question and not simply its capability. A television licence is required for the installation or use of a television receiver. A television receiver is equipment installed or used for the purpose of receiving television programme services, as defined by section 2(4) of the Broadcasting Act 1990. A personal computer which is capable of receiving television programme services, and which is installed or used for such purposes, is therefore a television receiver, and its installation or use as such requires a television licence.

 The Children (Leaving Care) Act commenced in October 2001. This imposed a duty on local authorities to provide a personal adviser to each young person leaving care from their 16th birthday. This adviser must work with the young person to draw up a Xpathway plan" setting out the support that they must have to prepare them for independent living. Part of the adviser's role will be to represent the views of young people and to advocate on their behalf with the agencies whose services will be necessary to prepare them for adulthood. Guidance to the Act also requires local authorities to make provision so that young people may have access to independent advocacy if they need to complain about how services have been provided for them.

 Dentists' fees are set out in the Statement of Dental Remuneration (SDR) which was set in consultation with the profession. The SDR was designed to deliver, after expenses, a target annual net income (TANI) for dental practitioners with an average commitment to the national health service. The TANI was reviewed annually by the Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body on Remuneration (DDRB) who made recommendations on any increase as appropriate.
<P>

<a name="21121w08.html_para10">Since 1994, based on evidence submitted by the Government and the profession including evidence submitted jointly on practice expenses, the DDRB have made pay recommendations based on percentage increases to the gross fees to cover both income and expenses rather than setting a TANI. Since 1999 the Government have accepted the Review Body's recommendations without staging. The current average net income of dental practitioners is considered to be in line with comparable professions.

 The responsibility for funding and compiling the prospectus leaflets was placed with primary care trusts (PCTs), who were encouraged to select the most appropriate and efficient local means of managing all aspects of prospectus production. The Department does not collect centrally the cost to each PCT of the patient prospectus initiative.

 The Health Professions Order provides a register which will be divided into parts in respect of which there will be designated titles.
<P>

<a name="21121w10.html_para0">Under transitional arrangements a person who has not previously been registered may qualify for registration on the basis of safe and effective practice for a specified period or by satisfying the Health Professions Council (HPC) that additional experience and training give him the requisite standard of proficiency to be registered. To benefit from the transitional arrangements a person must apply within two years of the opening of the relevant part of the register. The HPC expect to open the new register in April 2003. Once the register is open no one can use the designated title lawfully unless he is registered or benefits from transitional arrangements.

 The Food Standards Agency has undertaken two surveys investigating added water in poultry and poultry products. The survey reported in October 2000, in the Food Survey Information Sheet 8/00, focused on added water in whole chicken and chicken parts, including half, quarter, boneless and skinless breast, thigh, drumstick and wing, sold mainly in the retail sector. The second survey reported in December 2001, in the Food Survey Information Sheet 20/01, investigated added water, chicken content and hydrolysed protein in frozen chicken breast products supplied to the catering trade. Copies of the two survey information sheets have been place in the Library.

 The Commission for Health Improvement (CHI) expressed serious concerns about anticipatory prescribing of medicines to older people on two wards in Gosport War Memorial hospital in 1998. During the course of its investigation in 2002, the CHI welcomed the introduction and adherence to policies regarding the administration, review and recording of medicines. Anticipatory prescribing was no longer evident on these wards.

 The Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA) became responsible for the issue of pre-payment certificates (PPCs) in respect of applications received on or after 1 October. Applications sent before 1 October should have been dealt with by health authorities and the PPA telephone number for inquiries should therefore have been irrelevant to people who applied for PPCs before that date. A number of health authorities did, however, send applications received before 1 October to the PPA. Rather than return them and thus add further to the time taken to issue certificates, the PPA decided that they would issue the certificates themselves.
<P>

<a name="21121w10.html_para3">The target for issuing pre-payment certificates ordered by telephone is 14 days and that target is being met. The target for issuing PPCs by post is 21 calendar days of the application being received (as shown on the application form) and that target is being met. On 19 November applications received by post on 1 November were being processed. Applications made by phone are generally being processed within seven days. These targets will be kept under review.

 A review of the private finance initiative scheme to develop the Queen Alexandra Hospital site was undertaken in July 2002.

The revenue consequences of this option amounted to #43.2 million per annum. However, the overall conclusion of the review was that this option, including the retention of Haslar, was no more financially advantageous than the preferred development of the Queen Alexandra Hospital site. Moreover, the Xdo minimum" option failed to deliver the strategic service changes and clinical benefits required.

 We have been unable on available information to identify a Joint Universities project licence application of the type described. A similar application was, however, made in 1998 from another source.

<a name="21121w11.html_para4">It is not policy to disclose details of individual applications, but I can tell the hon.

The international donor community has now disbursed $1.3 billion of the $1.8 billion pledge for 2002; of this, a total of $200 million has been paid into the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, which is used by the Afghanistan Transitional Administration to meet recurrent costs and finance the most pressing of reconstruction requirements. Recent payments into the fund mean that the ATA now faces a far smaller potential budget deficit this financial year than was originally feared but my Department is continuing to work closely with other donors to help ensure budget requirements are fully met. In addition, I recently approved a contribution of $20 million in support of Afghanistan's arrears clearance with the major international financial institutions, and am confident this will enable the Asia development bank and world bank to finance the implementation of substantial reconstruction initiatives in the near future.

We understand that UNHCR and WFP programmes for 2002 for Afghanistan have been well-resourced so far (to the order of 90 per cent. and 75 per cent. respectively). So far in the current financial year, the UK has contributed 4 million and 2.2 million respectively to UNHCR and WFP programmes.

<P>

<a name="21121w12.html_para3">The Government will shortly be launching the report of the UK's high level working group on access to medicines. The report is a result of a year's collaboration between representatives of UK industry, WHO, WTO, The European Commission, a developing country and international foundations. It outlines an approach intended to facilitate voluntary differential pricing of essential medicines for the poorest developing countries-and all of sub-Saharan Africa-as the international operational norm. The UK is committed to working with others to take the report's recommendations forward as a matter of urgency. The

The UK has already pledged $200 million over five years to the Global Fund to Fight TB, AIDS and Malaria (GFATM), and has committed over #1 billion since 1997 to strengthen developing countries' health systems.

<P>
<a name="21121w13.html_spmin2"><B>The Solicitor-General</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2002]:</i> The Law Officers are concerned with the legal aspects of the fire dispute in three ways. We are responsible to Parliament for the Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for considering whether to bring prosecutions where hoax calls have been made. We are also legal advisers to the Government. There is a long-standing convention, followed by successive Governments and reflected in the Ministerial Code, that both the content of legal advice to the Government and the fact that it has been given remains confidential. Thirdly, the Attorney General has the power to apply, when he thinks it appropriate, to the High Court for an injunction to prevent breach of the criminal law, including offences under trade union legislation. In making such decisions he acts as guardian of the public interest.

 Under ECGD's Debt Conversion Scheme, a percentage of a country's rescheduled debt stock (usually 10 or 20 per cent.) can be swapped for 'certain' projects. When evaluating such requests, ECGD will consider the potential contribution of any project towards the social, economic and environmental development of the country. ECGD is willing to consider projects involving rainforest protection. Any project must be jointly approved by the debtor Government and ECGD and comply with ECGD's Business Principles.
<P>

<a name="21121w14.html_para3">The Debt Conversion Scheme does not affect debt relief for HIPCs (Highly Indebted Poor Countries), for whom the UK Government have pledged to write-off 100 per cent. of their UK debt.

 Under the legislation covering the private recruitment industry, employment agencies and employment businesses, who have placed job vacancy advertisements in either a newspaper or on the internet, before supplying or introducing a work-seeker to an employer, are required to make all such inquiries as are reasonably practicable to establish that the worker-seeker is suitable and has such qualifications as are required by law and that employment of that work-seeker by the employer would not breach any other duty or restriction imposed by law.

 No research has been commissioned specifically on the effects of marketing on bus usage. However, we have obtained relevant information from research into quality bus partnerships and from surveys on satisfaction with the quality of local bus services.
<P>

<a name="21121w15.html_para6">Bus operators are well aware of the benefits of good marketing of services. Marketing includes a variety of activities such as branding, publicity, timetable information, fares and tickets. A task group established by the Bus Partnership Forum, which comprises industry, local and central government representatives, is examining a number of surveys conducted by Transport for London, local transport authorities and operating companies to evaluate the success of marketing initiatives on particular routes or networks.

 If approved by Parliament, the London Local Authorities and Transport for London Bill will allow London authorities and Transport for London to enforce compliance with signs indicating banned turning movements using camera systems. Owners of vehicles not complying with signs would receive a penalty charge. The Government have no objection to such enforcement in principle and will follow its piloting in London with interest.

The train emissions are for a Virgin Voyager Class 221 with one power car and three trailer cars. It should, however, be noted that the majority of commuting by train is in London and the south east, where the majority of trains are electric and so have zero local emissions. The car and bus data refer to Euro III standards (ie current standards for new vehicles) at an urban speed. The car emissions are averages, weighted by the proportion of petrol and diesel cars in the fleet. A full environmental comparison would need to incorporate occupancy figures but comparative data per passenger km are not available.<P>

 In December 1998 this Government's introduction of a tonnage based corporation tax for UK tax resident shipping companies requires applicant companies to satisfy a minimum training obligation and recruit and train one British Cadet for every 15 officers. We estimate the number of cadets undergoing training for the year, as of October 2002, to be in the order of 650. The total cumulative training commitment for the training year beginning October 2002 is 660. This is an encouraging and significant increase on previous years.

Total expenditure on construction of the channel tunnel rail link to the end of 2000&#150;01 was #1,343 million. An annual breakdown of this figure could be provided only at disproportionate cost. An additional #983 million was spent in 2001&#150;02.<P>

The figures for national roads are not on a consistent basis over the whole period because of a change in the way that the information was classified from 1994&#150;95 onwards. The figures from 2002&#150;03 are for all work on national roads other than maintenance, although actual expenditure will depend on progress on specific schemes.<P>

The table excludes spending on the construction of new local roads because this could be provided only at disproportionate cost.<P>

The JLE figure for 1999&#150;2000 reflects an estimated accrual in London Transport's accounts for 1999&#150;2000 to cover Jubilee line extension works in future years.<P>

 In March 2001 the then DTLR commissioned W. S. Atkins to assess what the effects would be of increasing the current provision of home-to-school transport. The study, which reported at the end of 2001, identified considerable interest in using home-to-school transport among households that were currently not entitled to free home to school transport. It concluded that relaxing the eligibility criteria would have a noticeable impact on car use.

 My Department does not provide specific funding for school transport. Responsibility for the provision of statutory home to school transport lies with the Department for Education and Skills.
<P>

<a name="21121w18.html_para1">However, as part of their Local Transport Plan strategies, whose objectives must include the improvement of safety, the promotion of accessibility and the protection of the environment, local authorities in England can propose strategies to provide support for and improve school transport provision. They may also take advantage of the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) funding route. An example of the latter is Surrey County Council's (Pegasus) School Bus Scheme for which my Department announced 16 million in PFI credits, which will be paid through supporting special grant, in December 2002.
<P>

<a name="21121w18.html_para2">Local authorities are able to fund bus services that would not otherwise be provided from their Revenue Support Grant; in some cases these will be on routes that serve schools. They may also bid for funding for innovative road passenger transport schemes, which may include school transport services, under the Rural and Urban Bus Challenge schemes.

 Officials of HM Treasury and the Ministry of Defence routinely discuss potential contingencies. The cost of any UK contribution to military action would depend on a number of factors, including the scale of the UK contribution and the duration of military action. No decisions have, however, been taken to commit UK Armed Forces to new military action in the Middle East. Military action is neither imminent nor inevitable, and will not be necessary if Iraq chooses to comply fully with UNSCR1441.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w20.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Officials are currently finalising detailed plans in response to the Parliamentary Ombudsman's findings. However, we expect to be writing to around 500,000 individuals to offer further clarification of their SERPS position.
<P>

<a name="21121w20.html_para5">The background to this is that the Pension Service has sent out 5.1 million letters to people who will reach state pension age between 6 October 2002 and 5October 2010. This letter informed them of the changes to the rules regarding the inheritance of SERPS announced to the House by my predecessor on 29 November 2000 and subsequently approved by Parliament in March 2001.
<P>

<a name="21121w20.html_para6">This letter gave people the option of requesting a SERPS estimate, and by 16 November some 1,248,104 estimates had been requested.
<P>

<a name="21121w20.html_para7">This follow-up estimate letter was the subject of exhaustive drafting and an approval process that included the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC) and outside bodies. One key complexity was around how to explain SERPS and its interaction with Contracted Out Deductions (COD).
<P>

<a name="21121w20.html_para8">However, it has come our attention that some people may have possibly misunderstood the estimate despite the caveat in the letter. This group may believe that they stand to receive their full SERPS without appreciating that if they have contracted out, their SERPS will be lower because of their occupational or private pension scheme.
<P>

<a name="21121w20.html_para9">We have therefore decided that officials should write again to all those people who have received an estimate letter and have some COD deductions except people who will reach pension age between now and 5 July 2003-they will get pre-retirement pensions claim material including full personal details of their new final entitlement.

 The Waste and Emissions Trading Bill was introduced in the House of Lords on 14 November. This will set the framework for achieving the targets on municipal biodegradable waste in Article 5(1) and (2) of the Directive to be met by the United Kingdom. For England and Wales, other aspects of the Directive were covered in The Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002 no. 1559).

<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The main environmental problem suffered by Bassenthwaite Lake is eutrophication caused by an increase in nutrient levels, specifically phosphorous, due primarily to diffuse pollution and discharges from waste water treatment works.
<P>

<a name="21121w22.html_para14">Nutrient enrichment of Bassenthwaite Lake will be addressed within the framework of the Environments Agency's national strategy (set out in an Agency publication entitled XAquatic Eutrophication in England and Wales&#151;A Management Strategy") and through a more targeted Bassenthwaite Lake Restoration Programme that is currently being developed.
<P>

<a name="21121w22.html_para15">Two initiatives currently under way are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the use of the Agency's regulatory powers to reduce the discharge of phosphorous from Keswick waste water treatment works. The introduction of phosphorous stripping in 1996 has lead to a significant reduction in the amount of phosphorous being discharged to the lake. Additional upgrades to the treatment works planned for 2004 will further reduce phosphate discharges. The Environment Agency will consider what other enhancements are required to waste water treatment works within the Bassenthwaite catchment for the water utilities Asset Management Process period 2005 to 2010;
<P>
<BR>
the promotion of the Still Waters partnership within the catchment to promote solutions to nutrient enrichment caused by diffuse pollution that are beyond the remit of any one regulatory body or party. Since land use and land management practices are the primary cause of diffuse phosphorous entering Bassenthwaite Lake and diffuse sources are the biggest contributors of phosphorus pollution in the lake, the Still Waters partnership will focus on ways and means of reducing such inputs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In October 2001 we published a consultation document on measures to remove abandoned and untaxed vehicles from the streets more quickly and, for the longer term, bring forward changes to vehicle registration and licensing procedures to ensure greater accuracy of DVLA's vehicle record.
<P>

<a name="21121w23.html_para0">Regulations reducing the statutory notice periods after which local authorities can remove abandoned vehicles from the highway and the storage periods for unlicensed vehicles came into force on 9 April. Local authorities can now remove those vehicles that they consider merit destruction from the highway after the expiry of a 24 hour notice placed on them.
<P>

<a name="21121w23.html_para1">We have supported pilot schemes in the London boroughs of Newham and Lewisham in which the local authority was given DVLA's powers to wheelclamp and remove unlicensed vehicles after 24 hours. Following the success of the Newham pilot on 19 April, we announced that all councils who wished could operate in the same way.
<P>

<a name="21121w23.html_para2">In addition, councils have targeted over 6,000 abandoned unlicensed vehicles in multi-Agency XOperation Cubits" with over 4,000 vehicles crushed and more operations are planned. To date we estimate that the operations have induced more than 15,000 motorists to relicense voluntarily bringing in over #2.3 million in additional revenue.
<P>

<a name="21121w23.html_para3">The Government are currently developing proposals for the reform and modernisation of vehicle registration and licensing, to reduce evasion and to bear down on vehicle crime. In response to the recommendations of a report commissioned by the Department for Transport from the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science DfT have established a Modernising Vehicle Registration Implementation Board (MVRIB). This includes representatives of motorists' organisations, the motor trade, the police and the insurance industry to advise on and develop those proposals.
<P>

<a name="21121w23.html_para4">The 2002 Finance Act contained provisions under which the responsibility for licensing and taxing vehicles will be placed on the registered keeper, who will remain liable for doing so until such time that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) has properly been notified of a change of keeper. These proposals will also mean that it is not necessary for a vehicle to be detected on the road for effective enforcement action to take place. The implementation of these new powers is at the heart of MVRIB's agenda.

 There are no specific regulations in place to control the use of claims for improving mental and physical well-being made on 'functional' foods. Claims on foods are controlled by provisions of the Food Safety Act 1990 and the Trade Descriptions Act 1968, which prohibit false and misleading claims.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the Government's policy is towards the practice of home kills by mobile licensed slaughtermen.  [80460]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w24.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="21121w24.html_para5">The Fresh Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) Regulations 1995 (as amended) require that no person shall carry on the business of a slaughterhouse unless the premises are licensed under the Regulations. Furthermore the regulations also require that no person shall sell fresh meat for human consumption unless it has been slaughtered in a licensed slaughterhouse.
<P>

<a name="21121w24.html_para6">It is unlawful for a mobile licensed slaughterman to kill and dress an animal outside of licensed premises where it is intended that the meat be used for human consumption. In addition, the slaughterman would further contravene the Regulations as he would be supplying goods&#151;the dressed carcase&#151;and a sale would therefore have taken place.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action her Department has taken to ensure that poultry imports meet the same <i>(a)</i> animal welfare, <i>(b)</i> chemical contact and <i>(c)</i> hygiene standards expected of United Kingdom-produced poultry meat.  [81040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21121w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government has made it clear the importance it attaches to developing and maintaining high welfare standards for all animals both domestically and internationally. We have made clear that trade liberalisation must not compromise EU standards of animal welfare and hygiene. Our concerns are fully reflected on the negotiating proposals that the Commission has submitted in the Doha Development Agenda
<P>

<a name="21121w24.html_para7">All poultry in the European Union must be slaughtered or killed in accordance with the requirements laid down in Council Directive 93/119/EC on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing. This Directive should have been implemented in all Member States by 1 January 1995, and has been implemented in this country by the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 (as amended). The Directive contains a requirement that birds imported from third countries must be slaughtered under conditions which offer guarantees of humane treatment at least equivalent to those provided for in the Directive.
<P>

<a name="21121w24.html_para8">In respect of chemical contact where illegal veterinary medicine residues, for example nitrofurans and chloramphenicol, have been detected in imports of poultry meat from third countries there is a requirement under community law to test all consignments at border inspection posts. Consignments are not allowed entry if they are found to contain these chemicals. Nitrofurans and chloramphenicol are not permitted for use in food producing animals in the EU due to public health concerns. Therefore their residues should not be present in food.

<P>

<a name="21121w24.html_para9">Imports into the United Kingdom of animal products are governed by European community legislation, which contains provisions to protect both animal and public health. Under these rules only third countries approved by the Commission on the advice of the Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health may export into the community, and only from establishments which meet community hygiene standards. The lists of countries and establishments allowed to export particular products into the community, are available on the Commission's website at the following address:

<P>

<a name="21121w24.html_para11">Imports of poultry meat from third countries must have been produced to the standards at least equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 71/118/EEC. In addition, all consignments of fresh poultry meat imported from third countries are subject to veterinary inspection on entering the EU to ensure that conditions of import have been complied with and to ensure that they have remained in a satisfactory condition during transport.
<P>

<a name="21121w24.html_para12">Responsibility for ensuring that third countries meet these requirements lies with the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) of the European Commission . FVO reports are published on their website at: http://euroDa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/insDections/vi/reports/index en.html.

<P>
<a name="21121w25.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) was established on 16 October 2001 as a single EU paying agency, combining the functions previously undertaken by the Intervention Board and the Defra paying agencies. RPA's published accounts for 2001&#150;02 (HC 1197) give details of the funding allocated to the Agency in that financial year and for 2000&#150;01 on a comparative basis. Combined figures for prior years covering the activities now administered by RPA have not been produced. RPA's budget for 2002&#150;03 is shown in the table below.
<P>

<a name="21121w25.html_para0">RPA is partway through a #130 million restructuring programme that will deliver a step change in customer service when completed in 2005. These funds are ring fenced and are allocated separately, over and above the amounts quoted.
