<p><a name="40708w01.html_spnew2"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Department issued a consultation paper in May 2003 which included information from the British Dental Association and received a response from the British Dental Association to that consultation paper. The consultation paper and a summary of the responses can be found at http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/crematoria/index.htm .

<p><a name="40708w01.html_spnew4"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Ministers frequently meet with farming representatives for discussions which include the farm gate price of milk. Farming organisations are also represented on the Dairy Supply Chain Forum, chaired by my noble Friend Lord Whitty, which meets quarterly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40708w01.html_para2">
The forum provides a framework in which all within the dairy supply chain, can come together to discuss the challenges facing the sector and develop collaborative solutions to improve the efficiency and promote the sustainable development of the sector. It does not discuss price negotiations, which are a private commercial matter between farmers and purchasers. However, the work of the forum and its various subgroups should help address some of the underlying causes of low farm gate prices.

<p>(5) if she will replace the Vital Villages programme; and if she will make a statement.  [181989]</p>








<p><a name="40708w01.html_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Countryside Agency&#039;s Vital Villages programme was established in 2001. It was always intended as a time-limited means of exploring what would best enable parishes to identify their service needs and have a greater say in their own affairs. The total funding distributed from the start of the Vital Villages programme in 2001 until April 2004 is in excess of &#163;40 million, including an investment of &#163;14 million this year. The agency has met its three-year target and the programme is now closed to new applicants. From April 2001 to date, over 1,044 parishes have received funding for their parish plans. The programme was closed to new applications at the end of March 2004 but the agency will honour all existing commitments, which run until 31 March 2006. The emphasis in the programme from now on will be on sharing the best practice learned from successful projects as widely as possible and encouraging others to take up the ideas. In addition, the agency has commissioned an independent quantitative and qualitative evaluation to measure the impact of the programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40708w01.html_para3">
Announcements about any successor to Vital Villages will be made before the programme ends. With a variety of partners, we are considering how best to promote the lessons of the programme and support rural communities that need assistance through mainstream programmes.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what proportion of UK aid to Burundi is spent on assisting refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo; what discussions he has had with the Burundi Government on assisting refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo; and what plans he has to deliver emergency aid to the Democratic Republic of Congo refugees in northern Burundi.  [182423]</p>








<p><a name="40708w01.html_spnew6"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 A DFID assessment mission visited the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Burundi between 22 and 29 June and is liaising with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and United Nations agencies inter alia to look at support needs for 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Jul 2004 : Column 776W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
DRC refugees in Burundi. DFID&#039;s assessment is that to date, agencies based in Burundi such as International Rescue Committee, Medecins Sans Frontieres and GTZ have mounted an effective response to the influx from DRC. Resourcing of these operations appears to be covered, although we have made it clear that DFID is ready to consider supplementary requests for support on an urgent basis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40708w01.html_para4">
The team also discussed the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees proposal to develop an inter-agency contingency plan to cover any potential larger influx from Eastern DRC. DFID keeps in close contact with the Government of Burundi and the UN Mission in Burundi (ONUB) on the situation of refugees and internally displaced persons and their support needs.

In parallel, DFID has contributed &#163;500,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) under the 2004 UN Consolidated Appeal Process (UNCAP) for Burundi, to support the repatriation of refugees and reintegration of returnees to Burundi during the period March to December 2004.

<p><a name="40708w01.html_wqn8"><b> Tom Brake: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment his Department has made of the loss of humanitarian aid and property in the Democratic Republic of Congo during recent looting.  [182428]</p>








<p><a name="40708w01.html_spnew7"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Two DFID staff visited parts of eastern DRC in late June. They reported that in some areas a large amount of NGO equipment, especially communications, had been lost during recent periods of unrest.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40708w01.html_para6">
DFID is seeking ways to provide quick-disbursing support to enable NGOs to respond rapidly to meet the emerging needs of the vulnerable populations in eastern DRC. This will depend on NGO requirements, but could include increased air services (light aircraft are often the most effective and secure means of travel in much of DRC) and help to replace looted NGO communications equipment and vehicles.

 Some 30 per cent. of managers are female compared with 18 per cent. in 1998, and in the public sector, women account for more than half of managers.

<p><a name="40708w06.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Jamieson  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 5 July 2004]:</i> The draft agreement with the state of Israel is still to be ratified. The agreement itself will confer few rights upon Israel. It will define the areas where the parties agree to work together to their mutual benefit as partners in the programme. It gives Israel the right to enter into negotiations with the European Commission for this purpose and to participate in a Steering Committee established to manage the agreement. Israel may, subject to a further agreement, participate in the Galileo Joint Undertaking and its successors but this will depend on the level of funding that Israel is prepared to invest in the programme.

<p>
<a name="40708w06.html_para8">
The agreement with the United States focuses on achieving full interoperability between Galileo and its Global Positioning System (GPS) without interfering with the performance of either. It provides a framework for co-operation between the parties and defines the compatibility between the GPS and Galileo systems. It also affirms the right to free trade in goods and services related to both civil systems. Each party has a right to object to any proposed changes to the other&#039;s radio signals. The agreement also establishes joint committees that will meet to oversee the working of its various aspects.

 In order to join the statutory Register of Approved Driving Instructors, potential instructors are required to pass a three-part examination comprising practical and theoretical elements. Qualified instructors also undergo a periodic test of continued instructional ability, which will be augmented by a computer-based assessment later this year. While statute does not require formal training or qualifications for those providing training to learner drivers in preparation for the theory test, we strongly recommend

 Tuberculosis screening has been incorporated into the general health assessment which is offered on a voluntary basis to all asylum seekers in the Kent (Dover) and Yorkshire and Humberside induction centres since June 2002 and July 2003 respectively. A check for HIV is not done routinely in the centres, unless it is requested by an individual or a specific need is identified by healthcare staff. The costs of the service vary from site to site and case to case and it is therefore not possible to provide a breakdown.

The Department does not collect information on the numbers of immigrants in England who are tested for TB or HIV.

 The draft legislation and the administration of the scheme is bound by the Race Relations Act 1976, as amended by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000.

<a name="40708w14.html_para4">
The identity cards scheme itself is non-discriminatory as it is intended to cover everyone in the United Kingdom for longer than a specified period (three months). The scheme will not, in general, require people to obtain a specific, additional document, as it will be designed to make use of existing documents that will be designated as identity cards. Most members of the identity cards &quot;family&quot; are likely to be enhanced versions of existing identity documents which are very widely held familiar documents that are already used as proof of identity.

The draft Bill makes no changes to police powers and there is a specific prohibition on introducing regulations which would require a card to be carried at all times.

<a name="40708w14.html_para7">
The draft Bill specifies the information which may be recorded on the National Identity Register. It does not allow for the recording of ethnicity. The register will hold individuals&#039; confirmed identity information securely and an audit of checks made of the register whether via an ID card or otherwise will be held on the database to comply with the Data Protection Act. Disclosure of the details of a person&#039;s entry on the register and audit log records will not be possible without his or her consent other than as authorised under specific provisions in the draft Bill. There will be strict controls and independent oversight of these arrangements.

<p><a name="40708w17.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 As part of our commitment to the expansion of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) across Northern Afghanistan, the United Kingdom deployed an additional 40 personnel to the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Mazar-e Sharif and Meymaneh, which brought the total number of British troops serving in these Teams to around 130. A Forward Support Base was also established in Mazar to support the PRTs in Northern Afghanistan, requiring the deployment of around a further 130 British troops. As part of our long-term commitment to the sustained expansion of ISAF across Afghanistan, the Prime Minister has also offered to deploy the HQ Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (HQ ARRC) to command the Force probably in 2006.

1. Take-up by case load compares the number of benefit recipients, averaged over the year, with the number who would be receiving if everyone took up their entitlement for the full period of their entitlement.<br>

2. Take-up by expenditure compares the total amount of benefit received, averaged over the year, with the total amount that would be received if everyone took up their entitlement for the full period of their entitlement.<br>

3. Figures are not directly comparable over time as estimates are not recast in light of methodological improvements and changes to benefit rules alter the size of the eligible population.<br>

4. Estimates for income support cover pensioners and non-pensioners up to and including figures for 1999&#150;2000. Estimates for 2000&#150;01 and onwards relate to non-pensioners only. Minimum income guarantee relates to pensioners only and came into effect in 1999&#150;2000.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the impact of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 on <i>(a)</i> employment levels of disabled people in the UK and <i>(b)</i> the perception of disability by employers.  [182537]</p>








<p><a name="40708w18.html_spnew5"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 The Government has not made a specific assessment of the impact of the Disability Discrimination Act on the employment of levels of disabled people in the UK or on the perception of disability by employers. Both will have been influenced by a range of factors. However it is not possible to ascertain to what extent change is due solely to the DDA, against other factors such as shifts in social attitudes, and greater awareness and reporting of disability.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40708w18.html_para2">
Comparable figures are not available before 1998, however there has been a narrowing of the gap between the employment levels of disabled people and non-disabled people under this Government. Employment levels for disabled people have risen from 46.0 per cent. in winter 1998 (Labour Force Survey, winter quarter 1998) to 49.3 per cent. in winter 2003 (Labour Force Survey, winter quarter 2003). Over the same period the employment levels for non-disabled people rose from 79.8 per cent. to 80.8 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40708w18.html_para3">
Recent research on employers&#039; responses to the DDA showed that both the legislation and the moral and business cases for making adjustments have influenced employers. The research found that 83 per cent. of employers that had ever employed a disabled person had made adjustments for disabled employees. Overall, 35 per cent. of employers that had made adjustments for disabled employees reported they had done so partly because of the legal requirement, but they more often cited the moral and business cases for making adjustments.

1. Figures are for Great Britain in 2004&#150;05 price terms, using the GDP deflator index, rounded to the nearest &#163;100 million.<br>

2. The savings credit is abolished for those above each age specified in each question from April 2006 with no payments to existing pensioners and no new recipients after 2006. The savings from savings credit are calculated using the Department&#039;s policy simulation model for 2006&#150;07.<br>

3. In modelling these options it is assumed that the proportion of savings relative to gross state pension costs in the first year is constant in subsequent years; therefore these figures should not be treated as forecasts of savings credit expenditure for different age groups.<br>

4. The savings given reflect the changes to savings credit expenditure and do not include the effects of other benefits which may be affected by the abolition of the savings credit.<br>

We are concerned by reports of the forced repatriation of North Koreans by China and have urged China to fully implement the provisions of the 1951 Convention on Refugees, and co-operate closely with the UNHCR to help resolve disagreement over the status of North Korean border-crossers.

The Chinese Government maintains that North Koreans who enter China illegally are economic migrants and not refugees. A long-standing bilateral agreement with North Korea enables China to repatriate these border crossers.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what progress has been made with regard to the establishment of the Sports Institute for Northern Ireland; and whether the institute plans to include a 50 m swimming pool in the development proposals.  [182610]</p>








<p><a name="40708w25.html_spnew0"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 Services for high performance athletes have been provided through the Sports Institute for Northern Ireland since July 2001. These include strength and conditioning advice, physiotherapy and injury management, sports medicine, sports science, athlete career and education and high performance planning. A capital investment programme is currently being finalised which will include facilities for athletes from a wide range of sports. There are currently no plans to include a 50 m pool within the institute.

<p><a name="40708w25.html_spnew1"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 The Soccer Strategy Advisory Panel in its report, &quot;Creating A Soccer Strategy for Northern Ireland&quot; published in October 2001, considered no stadium in Northern Ireland, including Windsor Park, to be of a sufficient standard to host international football matches. In response to the Panel&#039;s report, the governing body of soccer in Northern Ireland, the Irish Football Association (IFA), produced a Development Plan for football in May 2003. This contains a cost proposal for upgrading Windsor Park to the required standard and also includes a statement declaring the IFA&#039;s interest in a shared, multi-purpose facility, capable of hosting international football matches.

With the assistance of the Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS), a survey has been undertaken of those children who are the subject of current proceedings.

<p><a name="40708w25.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 As a Department we are aware of the importance of pupils drinking water during the school day and the benefits that it brings. The &quot;Healthy School Lunches&quot; guidance, published by DfES, contains the Secretary of State&#039;s expectation that drinking water should be made available to all pupils every day, free of charge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40708w25.html_para1">
We have already revised the non-statutory guidance in Building Bulletin 87 Guidelines for Environmental Design in Schools for the design of new buildings (www.teachernet.gov.uk/energy). Section 5 of BB87 describes what DfES considers is adequate provision of drinking water supplies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40708w25.html_para2">
We will also be revising The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 to make the requirements for drinking water clearer. The revision will ensure compatibility with Regulation 22 of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations, 1992.

<p><a name="40708w25.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 Responsibility for the recruitment of headteachers rests with LEAs and governing bodies. However, effective training and development of school leaders to take on senior leadership posts is vital. That is why, in 2000, we established The National College for School Leadership (NCSL) to be the key agent for transforming the quality of leadership in our schools.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what progress he has made in his discussions with the Deputy Prime Minister with regard to the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s proposals for devolving responsibility for learning and skills councils to the English regions.  [181550]</p>








<p><a name="40708w25.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 Chapter 4 of the White Paper &quot;Your Region, Your Choice: Revitalising the English Regions&quot;, set out our proposals for strengthening the links between local Learning and Skills Councils and elected regional assemblies in regions where they are established. The Skills Strategy White Paper of July 2003 emphasised the importance of LSCs working closely with Regional Development Agencies to ensure a close alignment between supply and demand for adult skills in meeting regional priorities. There are no proposals for devolving responsibility for local Learning and Skills Councils to regions. The draft of the Bill that would be needed to establish elected regional assemblies will be published soon. This will set out the powers, functions and structures of elected assemblies.

 The Department allocates funds for education and training in the post-16 learning and skills sector to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The LSC decides the funding allocations at local level.
