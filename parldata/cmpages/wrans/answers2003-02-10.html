 The Government welcome the contribution of the voluntary sector in this area and has published clear guidance on the use and training of volunteers and voluntary organisations in chapter 6 of its core guidance document, "Dealing With Disaster" (3rd edition). This sets out the arrangements, which focus primarily on local authority led mechanisms, for the registration, co-ordination and training of volunteers and voluntary organisations, including the St. John's Ambulance. The document, which is held by all local authority emergency planning units, emergency services headquarters and most of the main headquarters of the national voluntary organisations, is a public document and can be obtained from the Government's resilience website: www.ukresilience.info
<P>

<a name="30210w01.html_para0">The National Voluntary Aid Society Emergency Committee (NVASEC) provides a national United Kingdom-wide forum for addressing voluntary sector matters in respect of national integrated contingency planning.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30210w01.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Local authorities have a statutory duty under the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess the local air quality in their area against the air quality objectives for seven pollutants prescribed in regulations for the purpose of local air quality management. Where it is likely that the air quality objectives will not be met by the relevant deadline, the local authority must designate an air quality management area and produce an action plan setting out the measures they intend to implement to work towards meeting the air quality objectives.
<P>

<a name="30210w01.html_para7">The M5 passes through four local authority areas. Three of these local authorities (South Gloucestershire, Tewkesbury, and Stroud) have declared air quality management areas in respect of nitrogen dioxide emissions in the vicinity of the M5 motorway. All three local authorities have completed a further review and assessment following the declaration of their air quality management areas to further verify the need for the declarations.

 The window for advance payments under the 2002 Suckler Cow Premium Scheme opened on 16 October 2002. Unexpected delays encountered in the development of scheme software mean that despite best efforts, the first payments were issued in December 2002 and progress has been and continues to be slow.
<P>

<a name="30210w02.html_para0">It is unlikely that the Rural Payments Agency's aim to issue advance payments by early March will be achieved in all cases. We are aware of the inconvenience this will cause and regret the delays. Claim processing continues as a high priority with 1,462 claims authorised to receive payment by 6 February. Some 17,289 claims were received under the 2002 scheme in England. Up to date information on progress is available on the agency's website at www.rpa.gov.uk.
<P>

<a name="30210w02.html_para1">The window for 2002 bovine subsidy balance payments opens on 1 April and closes on 30 June. New EU legislation which came into effect from the 2002 scheme year introduced significant changes to the way the bovine schemes operate, including the administrative penalties that apply when producers breach scheme requirements. Under these new rules it is not possible to accurately calculate a producer's premium entitlement under each bovine scheme until all bovine claims that they have submitted have been processed and all validation checks completed. However, the RPA continues to make every effort to ensure that producers receive their 2002 bovine balance payments by the 30 June deadline.
<P>

<a name="30210w02.html_para2">RPA is investing significantly in new software as part of its change programme. This will replace the existing bovine schemes systems with modern, up-to-date technology in 2004&#150;05.

 The Attorney General is not represented at the disciplinary hearing of Mr. Redgrave. A decision was made by the Disciplinary Board which Mr. Redgrave sought to judicially review. The High Court found against Mr. Redgrave, and he sought leave to appeal that decision. Leave was granted, and in so doing. Lord Justice Sedley noted that there were points of wider public importance relating to the operation of the double jeopardy rule and invited the Attorney General to consider whether he eould like to intervene in the public interest.

 Some 4,638 former Icelandic Water trawlermen have been paid a total of &#163;40.1 million under the scheme. Of these, 794 livid in Grimsby, 1,748 in Hull and 355 in Fleetwood. Discounting duplicates, about 2,900 claims have been assessed as not qualifying for compensation. Currently 168 claims remain subject to review, or to appeal to the Independent Adjudicator, or their assessment has not yet been completed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what instructions have been given to the Defence Fire Service <i>(a)</i> in the UK and <i>(b)</i> at the MOD Kineton base to assist local fire brigades in emergencies; and whether these instructions have been altered in respect of dates when the fire brigade is on strike.  [95586]<P>

<P>
<a name="30210w03.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The overriding responsibility of the Ministry of Defence Fire Services is the protection of MOD vital assets, stores, equipment and facilities. There are, however, standard arrangements in place, that allow the provision of assistance in times of emergency when resources are available. Over the years, in certain locations throughout the United Kingdom, the MOD has formalised these arrangements by entering into agreements with local fire authorities to provide first attendance fire cover to specific areas or to assist in emergency situations.
<P>

<a name="30210w03.html_para2">In relation to MOD Kineton a Memorandum of Understanding exists with Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service. This allows the Chief Fire Officer to call upon the services of Defence Fire Service Kineton in an extreme emergency or incident subject to the normal proviso that the Defence Fire Service may not be able to respond immediately owing to commitments within the Depot.
<P>

<a name="30210w03.html_para3">It has always been intended that during the fire dispute all MOUs or similar agreements with local fire authorities should remain effective. A decision was made locally at MOD Kineton that, because the armed forces would provide emergency fire cover both inside and outside the depot during strike periods, the depot fire appliances would not at those times respond to requests for assistance outside the perimeter. It has now been recognised that this instruction was unnecessary and consequently MOD Kineton are now able to fulfil the terms of its agreement with the Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service. All other agreements with local fire authorities remain in force and have not been affected by the fire fighters dispute.

 General health and safety instructions for United Kingdom troops, which cover encounters with depleted uranium (DU), are incorporated in the Mounting Instructions for the operation which have been passed to the units involved. Additional safety instructions, covering all aspects of the hazard management of DU munitions in theatre, will shortly be issued by the Permanent Joint Headquarters through the operational chain of command to all units and formations deployed in the Joint Area of Operations. Furthermore, specific instructions and training packages exist for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), Royal Armoured Corps and support personnel most likely to come into contact with DU munitions or dust. Radiation monitoring equipment-has also been provided to some EOD units.
<P>

<a name="30210w04.html_para3">The safety instructions make clear that the risks from DU are far lower than those from other hazards arising from military operations and that combat and life-saving activities should never be delayed on account of concern over DU. They describe the potential risks and include pragmatic advice on procedures for minimising any potential intake of DU dust. The emphasis is on avoiding situations where DU dust may be encountered and on wearing appropriate respiratory protective equipment and protective clothing when it is necessary to enter potentially contaminated areas. They also include procedures for transporting and handling DU ammunition.
<P>

<a name="30210w04.html_para4">Radiation dosemeters have been issued to those who will spend time in tanks loaded with DU munitions and biological monitoring will be available for all members of the armed forces if DU is used.

<a name="30210w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 HMS Exeter, HMS Glasgow, HMS Newcastle, HMS Lancaster and HMS Southampton have all undergone changes to their programmes to allow their crews to support Operation Fresco. Although they were alongside for varying periods, with the exception of HMS Lancaster, their individual readiness states were not affected and subject to any essential maintenance and training requirements, they could have returned to sea within that readiness profile if their crews had been released from Operation Fresco duties. I am witholding details of ships' readiness in accordance with Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information which relates to Defence, Security and International Relations. HMS St. Albans was damaged by the impact of a commercial ferry in bad weather conditions while St. Albans was alongside in Portsmouth on 27 October 2002. The collision meant that St. Albans was unable to continue with her operational sea training programme and her crew were used in support of Operation Fresco nevertheless, the ship would still be available for tasking within her readiness profile.

 Airwave is a public safety radio service being implemented by police forces across the United Kingdom with the roll out programme due to be completed by 2005. It is Ministry of Defence policy to take up the Airwave service where interoperability with the emergency services is required. To ensure continued interoperability between the UK armed forces and the emergency services, during the police force roll out programme, interim communication arrangements have been out in place. While these interim arrangements do not provide the comprehensive interoperability that will be available when all users are on the Airwave system, they are as robust and flexible as possible: a deployable incident response communications capability is retained within the UK and where possible, the introduction of Airwave to the armed forces is being matched with that of the police forces. There are currently no reported problems with the interim arrangements.

 In July 2000 we commenced a detailed study to determine the long-term requirement for future afloat support, including the capability currently provided by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. As a direct result of this work, a number of broad future requirements were identified, and I informed the House on 17 July 2002 of the formation of the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability (MARS) Integrated Project Team (IPT). The MARS IPT is currently in the early stages of investigating potential solutions to the delivery of Future Afloat Support. At this stage it is yet to be decided the exact mix of vessel type and numbers required to provide this capability and the method by which the capability will be acquired. We expect this programme to deliver the first elements of this future capability by the end of this decade. In the meantime, we remain receptive to innovative and cost effective proposals from industry and industrial consultation is in progress.

There is no evidence to suggest that Iraqi Forces possess a strain or strains of anthrax that would defeat the United Kingdom anthrax vaccine or other vaccines.

<a name="30210w07.html_para11">The protection that people receive if their pension scheme is wound up is very important. That is why we are looking carefully at proposals that would: share out scheme assets more fairly, introduce a centralised "clearing house" or some form of insurance, increase the compensation payable to members in the case of fraud or dishonest; and strengthen the protection for members whose solvent employer chooses to wind-up a scheme.
<P>

<a name="30210w07.html_para12">The Government want to ensure that when a scheme winds up, the assets are divided among scheme members as fairly as possible. Through the Green Paper we are consulting on whether people who are approaching retirement age should be given a higher priority when scheme assets are distributed on wind-up, than at present. Or whether people who have been members of their pension scheme for a number of years should be given a higher priority.
<P>

<a name="30210w07.html_para13">We are also consulting on whether there should be a fairer sharing of assets between those with larger and smaller pensions when a scheme winds up. Possibly setting a cap on the level of pension that those with the highest pensions might receive, if there are limited assets available in the scheme.
<P>

<a name="30210w07.html_para14">We are considering moving pension schemes up the order of priority for payment. Possibly creating a new category of creditor, which would give pension schemes higher priority than at present.
<P>

<a name="30210w07.html_para15">We are also seeking views on other approaches to dealing with under-funded defined benefit schemes that are wound up because their sponsoring employer becomes insolvent:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A form of insurance (possibly a central discontinuance fund) that enables members to be more confident that, if their employer becomes insolvent with an under-funded pension scheme, they will receive the benefits promised.
<P>
<BR>
A centralised arrangement or "clearing house" into which people whose employer became insolvent could pay the funds that they receive on wind-up. The "clearing house" would seek to buy the best available deferred annuity from an insurance company and should be able to negotiate better annuity rates.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30210w07.html_para16">Insurance or a centralised "clearing house" might have advantages, providing better protection for scheme members where a company becomes insolvent and is forced to close its under-funded scheme. However, the costs would need to be balanced against the greater overall level of security offered.
<P>

<a name="30210w07.html_para17">A compensation scheme already exists to provide compensation for losses caused by dishonesty where the employer is insolvent. Proposals to increase the amount of compensation payable to 100 per cent. of the actual loss are set out in the Green Paper.

<P>

<a name="30210w07.html_para18">When solvent employers start winding up their under-funded defined benefit pension schemes, this also leaves many scheme members in financial difficulty. So, we are also seeking views on changes to the debt on the employer provisions that might result in more funds being put into a scheme when a solvent employers chooses to wind it up.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to his answer of 21 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 260W, on benefit payments, how many of the customers who opted for payment into a bank or building society account selected accounts that are accessible via post offices.  [94032]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30210w08.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The information is not available in the form requested. The information we collect within the Department does not differentiate between basic bank accounts and current bank accounts therefore we cannot distinguish which account is available at the post office. However there are now network banking arrangements in place that allow more people than ever before to access their money at post offices.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions under what circumstances someone will be judged to be unable to manage an account under the new direct credit scheme for state pension payments; how long the assessment process will take to judge someone unable to manage an account under the direct credit scheme; what measures are in place to ensure the continuation of payments while an assessment of a person's ability to manage an account is carried out; and whether a recipient of the state pension will be subject to reassessment on the matter of ability to manage an account.

<P>
<a name="30210w08.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 January 2003]:</i> Customers will be provided with information on the account options available as part of the move to direct payment. Customers will be able to consider these options and choose the account that best suits their needs and circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30210w08.html_para3">At present 85 per cent. of our customers (including 90 per cent. of pensioners) already have access to a suitable account for direct payment. We recognise that for some people a full bank account may not be suitable. If a customer feels unable to cope with one of these accounts a basic bank account or a post office card account may be a better option as they are very straightforward to operate.
<P>

<a name="30210w08.html_para4">A basic bank account will not normally have cheque book or overdraft facilities and a post office card account will only accept benefit, pension or tax credit payment into it and it has no other facilities such as overdrafts. Therefore there is no reason why the overwhelming majority should not be able to open an account that they can operate.
<P>

<a name="30210w08.html_para5">The Department understands that clearly there will be some customers, who, for a variety of reasons, cannot or will not open a current or basic bank account, and who cannot open a post office card account. To make these payments we are developing an exceptions service, which will be available at outlets including the Post Office.

<P>
<a name="30210w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The 25 pence age addition was introduced by the Conservative Government in 1971. We have gone much further. We have introduced measures which from October 2003 will mean that the poorest third of pensioner households will have gained over &#163;1,500 a year in real terms.
<P>

<a name="30210w09.html_para0">We have introduced free TV licenses from age 75 worth over &#163;100 a year, winter fuel payments of &#163;200 per year for eligible households paid to some 11 million people in 8 million households and the minimum income guarantee which means that no single pensioner has to live on less than &#163;102.10 and no couple on less than &#163;155.80 from April.
<P>

<a name="30210w09.html_para1">In Scotland, nearly 1 million people got winter fuel payments last winter and some 185,400 are in receipt of minimum income guarantee.

 Over 35,000 people in Lancashire benefit from the Minimum Income Guarantee&#151;a policy we introduced&#151;and receive an average &#163;47 a week. 216,000 pensioners have benefited from the above inflation increases in the State Pension. Additionally 233,000 people received a Winter Fuel Payment of up to &#163;200. Those Lancashire pensioners eligible for Pension Credit stand to gain around &#163;400 a year on average.

<a name="30210w09.html_para5">The creation of The Pension Service provides an ideal opportunity to further encourage pensioners to take up their entitlements.

It has an active local service providing direct support to customers through appointment based and drop in advice surgeries and places a great deal of importance in outreach activity in order to maximise take up.

In their opening addresses, President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa (Chairperson of the African Union) and Amara Essy (Interim Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union) both urged that an African Union Peace and Security Council should be established to lead Africa's work on conflict prevention and resolution. The UK supports the establishment of this body. A communiqu&#233; on conflict resolution was released following the meetings supporting efforts to resolve conflicts throughout Africa and urging that the Iraq crisis continue to be addressed through the UN. We understand that a number of amendments to the AU's Constitutive Act and a range of other issues, such as the roles and involvement of women and the African diaspora in the continent's development, were also discussed.

<a name="30210w10.html_para1">We continue to do all we can to make the Oil For Food (OFF) programme more effective in order to improve the humanitarian situation for the Iraqi people. The Goods Review List (GRL), a UK initiative implemented in July 2002, has significantly improved the flow of civilian goods to Iraq. Only military-related goods are now subject to review by the UN Sanctions Committee. But the Iraqi regime regularly attempts to hamper the programme. It has, for example, failed to spend over $3.8 billion of humanitarian funds lying unallocated in the UN account, and has delayed delivery of up to $2.3 billion worth of goods already approved by the UN.

 My Department's regular funding to the UN and other humanitarian agencies includes provision for emergency preparedness for a variety of contingencies across the world. Following recent discussions with UN OCHA and other donors, I am supplementing this funding with an additional &#163;3.5 million contribution to support UN humanitarian contingency planning for Iraq. This money will be allocated to a range of UN agencies likely to include UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, WHO and UNSECOORD. UN agencies are planning for a variety of contingencies.

It aims to achieve a sustainable pattern of natural resources utilisation in four protected areas in central/southern Botswana, including the CKGR, through support to management, infrastructure, equipment, training and community projects. The EU contribution is Euro6.500.000; (ii) the Wildlife Conservation and Management Programme began in September 2002. Its aims are summarised in my reply to question 4847.

 My Department does not hold such. In his State of the Nation address in October 2001 the President of Botswana said that 2,169 people had relocated in recent years leaving 559 still inside.

 The Community Reintegration Programme (CRP) is helping to re-establish inclusive social, economic and cultural networks at community level in northern Sierra Leone. This is leading to the reintegration of former ex-combatants and other war-affected people into viable and stable communities
<P>

<a name="30210w11.html_para3">The CRP began in March 2001 and initially covered three Chiefdoms within Port Loko District. It has since been extended to 42 northern Chiefdoms within the Districts of Bombali, Tonkolili, Kambia and Port Loko. Management of the CRP is contracted out to Agrisystems Limited, a consultancy specialising in post-conflict management.
<P>

<a name="30210w11.html_para4">The work involves understanding community needs, fostering reintegration and reconciliation, reviving agricultural production, supporting small-scale enterprise development, rehabilitating physical infrastructure and improving water, sanitation and health.
<P>

<a name="30210w11.html_para5">The CRP has worked directly to identify and cater for the priority needs of approximately 100,000 people in more than 200 communities. Indirectly, between 700,000 and 800,000 people are benefiting within the targeted Chiefdoms. Additionally, the CRP is also assisting the work of National Commission for Disarmament Demobilisation and Reintegration (NCDDR) by providing vocational training programmes and toolkits for over 5,000 ex-combatants and unemployed youths.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many people residing in Boston and Skegness <i>(a)</i> have had their initial application for asylum rejected and have submitted an appeal, <i>(b)</i> have applied for asylum and <i>(c)</i> have had an asylum appeal rejected.  [95705]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30210w12.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Asylum applications data are not available at regional level except by port (for those applications made at port&#151;these accounted for 36 per cent. of applications in 2001). Corresponding information on initial decision outcomes, appeal cases and dismissed appeal cases, relating to persons in particular areas of the United Kingdom is also unavailable. The requested information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he is taking to ensure that asylum seekers and recognised refugees who are eligible to vote are on the electoral register.  [96238]<P>

<P>
<a name="30210w12.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 February 2003]:</i> The Representation of the People Act 1983 clearly stipulates who can and cannot vote in the United Kingdom. Asylum seekers are not eligible to vote and neither are refugees unless they become citizens of the United Kingdom. A visa allowing foreign nationals to stay in the United Kingdom indefinitely is not the same as citizenship and therefore, does not entitle a person the right to vote.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proposals he has to use Beachley Barracks, Sedbury, Chepstow, in Gloucestershire as a dispersal centre for asylum seekers.  [96233]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30210w12.html_spnew6"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 This property has not been considered to date by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) for emergency accommodation, dispersal accommodation or as an induction centre for the housing of asylum seekers. Site searching for suitable sites for an accommodation centre has continued as previously announced. We will not be putting into the public domain details of any sites unless and until they are considered to be a serious prospect for the siting of an accommodation centre.

<a name="30210w12.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Heald: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the total level of asylum support <i>(a)</i> fraud and <i>(b)</i> overpayment in each year since the establishment of NASS.  [95130]<P>

<a name="30210w12.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 February 2003]:</i> The Home Office does not currently have an estimate of the level of asylum support fraud or the overpayment that could be related to this. However, we have established a dedicated team to investigate potential fraud in the asylum support system. We have also set up a team to conduct an audit of those cases supported by local authorities to assist the local authorities in identifying potential fraud in those cases. As part of the National Asylum Support Service regionalisation programme the structure and responsibilities of the

<a name="30210w12.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Heald: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 27 January 2003 (refs 91210, 91211 and 91212), what the total level of fraud was in the 1,286 cases where NASS support was terminated; and if he will make a statement.  [95220]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30210w12.html_spnew8"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 February 2003]:</i> The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) does not keep a central record of the level of fraud in individual cases.

: To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many applications have been <i>(a)</i> made and <i>(b)</i> accepted for the Highly Skilled Migrants Programme, broken down by (i) nationality and (ii) occupation.  [95469]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30210w12.html_spnew11"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Since the launch of the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme on 28 January 2002, 2,809 applications have been received up to 5 February 2003. 1,414 of the applications have been approved. The nationality information requested is set out in the table. At present it is not possible to supply the occupational information requested due to the limitations of the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme database. However, the database is being re-written to ensure that information of the type requested is extracted and published during the next financial year.

 The Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme (ISSP) was launched in 2001 to provide the courts with a tough community based programme designed to tackle persistent young offenders. It provides unprecedented levels of supervision, including electronic monitoring, with programmes designed to tackle the underlying causes of the offending behaviour. ISSP is available for those on bail, on community sentences (the Supervision Order and Community Rehabilitation Order) and those on the community phase of the Detention and Training Order. It costs &#163;1,416 per offender per month.

<a name="30210w13.html_para3">Somerset was amalgamated with Avon on 1 April 2001 when the new National Probation Service was created and therefore funding for Somerset was subsumed within Avon and Somerset Probation Board funding for 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03. No separate funding information for Somerset is therefore available. Funding for the new Avon and Somerset Board was &#163;13.480 million and &#163;15.972 million respectively.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to the oral answer by the Under-Secretary of State to the hon. Member for New Forest, East on 20 January, on new measures to simplify the removal of travellers from unauthorised sites, what discussions he has had with the Deputy Prime Minister on the issuing of new Planning Policy Guidance to make it easier for local authorities to obtain planning permission for local authority sites for travellers.  [92957]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30210w13.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Denham  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 27 January 2003]:</i> I understand from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister that Guidance on the planning aspects of sites for gipsies is set out in Department of the Environment Circular 1/94. This guidance applies equally to local authorities' own sites as well as to applications for planning permission from gipsies themselves or others wishing to develop land for use as a gipsy caravan site. Local authorities may grant themselves planning permission for their own development, but they must make planning applications in the same way as any other person and follow the same procedures as would apply to applications by others. The procedures which deal with development undertaken by local authorities are contained in the Town and Country Planning General Regulations 1992. There are no plans for central Government to issue further planning guidance on this matter.
<P>

<a name="30210w13.html_para6">We are though working closely with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to produce operational guidance on managing unauthorised encampments. This guidance will be issued for consultation shortly.

As I have already announced, I have set up a stakeholder group, chaired by Professor David VandeLinde, the Vice-Chancellor of Warwick University, to implement the appropriate recommendations and to identify other areas where we can remove unnecessary bureaucracy in higher education.

<a name="30210w14.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Damian Green: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many students in <i>(a)</i> further education colleges, <i>(b)</i> sixth form colleges, <i>(c)</i> schools and <i>(d)</i> other centres of learning have completed (i) NVQs and (ii) GNVQs in each year since 1997.  [89314]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30210w14.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The number of awards of (i) NVQs and (ii) GNVQs made to candidates, by centre type, in each academic year since 1997 are in the following tables. Information for GNVQs for 2000&#150;2001 is not available on a consistent basis to previous years because of changes to the data collection procedures that came into affect after the launch of Curriculum 2000.

<P>

<a name="30210w14.html_para0">The number of full NVQs awarded per year now appears to have peaked. There are three main reasons for this:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) In some sectors, when NVQs were first introduced, there was significant demand from the existing workforce. However, demand in those sectors is now mainly confined to new entrants and so year on year numbers have fallen.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) Measures taken to improve the quality assurance of NVQs have resulted in the withdrawal of some providers and some employers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) There may have been movement from NVQs to vocationally-related qualifications (VRQs), which have now been accredited into QCA's National Qualifications Framework. The total number of all Vocational Qualifications (including NVQs) awarded has increased from 991 thousand in 1996&#150;97 to 1.047 million in 2000&#150;2001.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="30210w14.html_para1">My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Young People and Audlt Skills has asked the Government's three key partners in this area (QCA, Learning and Skills Council and Sector Skills Development Agency) to produce proposals to develop and implement a new framework for all vocational qualifications. The partners are due to report by the end of March 2003.
<P>

<a name="30210w14.html_para2">GNVQs at all levels are gradually being replaced by other vocational qualifications. In September 2000 New Vocational A levels, also known as AVCEs (Advanced Vocational Certificates of Education) replaced Advanced GNVQs. The first full AVCE awards were made at the end of the 2-year cycle in summer 2002.

 There have been 174 applications approved by the Learning and Skills Council for 'Golden Hello' payments between 1 October 2002 and 13 January 2003 to new recruits to further education teaching in designated shortage subject areas. Take up to date has been modest but we are working with the Learning and Skills Council to develop better awareness of Golden Helios.

 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2003]:</i>As set out in "The Future of Higher Education" (Cm 5735), fair access means that the opportunities that higher education brings are available to all those who have the potential to benefit from them, regardless of their background. We know that raising participation and standards through our reforms of secondary and further education is critical to widening access.Our unified AimHigher programme will raise aspirations among young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.
<P>

<a name="30210w14.html_para3">Students from the poorest backgrounds will be eligible to have up to &#163;1,100 of their fees paid, and student grants of 1,000 will be reintroduced for those from low income families From 2006 any university which wishes to charge variable fees will be required to have an Access Agreement which will be approved and monitored by the Access Regulator The Regulator will seek to extend current good practice through, for example, bursary schemes and other financial measures. The maximum fee will be capped in real terms for the duration of the next Parliament at &#163;3,000. Additionally no student or family will have to pay fees before or while they are studying. Students will be able to defer their fees as for the current maintenance loans. The threshold at which repayment starts will be raised to 15,000, to make repayment easier for everyone. Repayments are income contingent and no real interest will be charged on student loans. Graduates will only be expected to pay back what they have borrowed in real terms.

<a name="30210w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Evidence from the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority's physical education (PE) and school sport investigation suggests that high quality sport impacts on many areas of school improvement, including attainment, behaviour, attitudes to learning and attendance. The changes in behaviour have been particularly encouraging. Where schools have invested in developing high quality PE and school sport at lunchtimes, behaviour has consistently improved. Further information on the results of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority's investigation is available on their website. "Game Plan", a joint report published on 19 December 2002 by the Cabinet Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, examined the effect of sport and physical activity on educational outcomes.

<a name="30210w15.html_para2">The Government are investing &#163;459 million over the next three years (2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06) to deliver a joint Department for Education and Skills and Department for Culture, Media and Sport Public Service Agreement target to enhance the take up of sporting opportunities by five to 16-year-olds. The objective is to increase the percentage of school children who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport, within and beyond the curriculum, to 75 per cent. by 2006.

 The social class of students in HE is derived from data included on the application form which applicants submit to the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS). Applicants aged under 21 provide the occupation of their parent and those aged 21 or over give their own occupation. This information is then used to assign each student to one of six standard social class categories based upon the Standard Occupational Classification published by the Office for National Statistics.
<P>

<a name="30210w15.html_para3">UCAS covers applicants to full-time and sandwich undergraduate courses only, but not all students entering these courses apply via UCAS: some, notably mature students, apply direct to the institution. Data on the social class of students on postgraduate and part-time undergraduate courses is not held centrally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30210w16.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Under the provisions of the Licensing Bill, the cost of an application for a premises licence would remain the same whether a public house applied only for permission to sell alcohol or for multiple permissions including, for instance, the provision of regulated entertainment, including live music.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30210w16.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Regulatory Impact Assessment that was published alongside the Licensing Bill states that just over 9,000 on-licensed premises and registered members clubs hold permanent public entertainment licences or certificates of suitability. An estimated 37,000 temporary public entertainment licences are also issued each year.
<P>

<a name="30210w16.html_para1">Under the provisions of the Bill there will be no separate licence for the provision of public entertainment. Permission to carry on any of the activities licensable under the Bill will be covered by a single premises licence. It will cost no more, in terms of time or money, to apply for a licence permitting the sale of alcohol and the provision of entertainment than it would to apply for one permitting the sale of alcohol only. The Government expect that the removal of the cost deterrent in applying for permission to provide entertainment, along with the provision of a less bureaucratic system and measures to prevent unnecessary conditions being attached to licences by licensing authorities, will encourage many more premises to take the opportunity to provide public entertainment.

 The Giant's Causeway has been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in recognition of its international importance to the conservation of geological features. It is one of only three natural World Heritage Sites in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30210w17.html_para0">World Heritage Sites are places or buildings of outstanding heritage value and, accordingly, the Department of the Environment attaches great importance to their protection for the benefit of future generations as well as our own. Planning policies for the protection of World Heritage Sites applicable to the Giant's Causeway are set out in the Planning Policy Statement (PPS 6): Planning, Archaeology and the Built Heritage. I believe that these policies are proving effective in protecting the Causeway and its immediate vicinity. Development proposals affecting the Giant's Causeway and its setting are carefully scrutinised in order to determine the impact on critical views of and from the site, access and public approaches to the site, and its appreciation and enjoyment by visitors.
<P>

<a name="30210w17.html_para1">The Department is reviewing the planning policy framework for the Giant's Causeway and its setting. The Department's Environment and Heritage Service is preparing management plans for the Causeway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the World Heritage Site. The Planning Service is preparing a new statutory development plan for the Northern Area which involves the Giant's Causeway. The draft development plan will be published in the autumn of 2003.

This is achieved through the funding of places in pre-school settings which meet the Programme's quality standards. In order to give parents a choice of pre-school setting, funded places are available both in statutory nursery schools and units and in some 400 voluntary and private playgroups.

While appreciating the early offer of help, the company has decided to defer detailed discussions with DEL regional staff until a decision has been made on the timing of any actual reductions which may take place and how they may be implemented.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the situation at the Ulster hospital, with special reference to bed capacity, trolley waits, delayed discharges and the level of funding of the hospital from the 1990s.  [95970]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30210w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The recent pressures at the Ulster hospital have exceeded the available bed capacity and have resulted in some patients having to wait on trolleys before a bed becomes available. The staff at the hospital have responded with great commitment and have tried to minimise the impact of these pressures.
<P>

<a name="30210w19.html_para1">A number of actions are being taken to provide a resolution to the underlying problems. There is a very significant expansion and redevelopment scheme under way at the Ulster hospital, which will increase bed capacity and improve acute services in the area. This has included the provision of 20 extra acute beds, which were opened in December 2002.
<P>

<a name="30210w19.html_para2">The Trust is continuing in its efforts to minimise the number of delayed discharges, and the hospital discharge team has been successful in resettling a

<P>

<a name="30210w19.html_para3">The Trust is also working closely with the Eastern Health and Social Services Board and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, on a Service Improvement Project, which aims to improve throughput and maximise the use of bed capacity at the Ulster hospital.

In addition the European Community suspended Burma's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) trading privileges in response to the use of forced labour and HMG does not encourage trade, investment or tourism with Burma.

 The overall human rights situation in Burma remains extremely poor and a matter of grave concern.
<P>

<a name="30210w20.html_para5">There were some very modest improvements in limited areas of human rights in Burma between January 2002 and January 2003, such as the release of political prisoners&#151;over 200 in this period, including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and some cooperation between the Burmese regime, the United Nations and certain international non-governmental organisations.
<P>

<a name="30210w20.html_para6">However, these limited improvements do not provide any assurance that the Burmese regime is now committed to substantively improving its human rights record or ending the violence and abuses in the ethnic minority areas of Burma. And since autumn 2002 there has been increasing reports of fresh restrictions of freedom of expression and politically inspired detentions and arrests in Burma.

On 20 January, the UK Permanent Representative to the United Nations made a statement in the UN that included expressing concern at the use of child soldiers in Burma. We are active in the International Labour Organisation to seek to press for the end of forced labour in Burma.

 The amount of language training offered to staff posted overseas depends on the nature of the job to which they are posted.

This can vary from a few months for basic training in the more straightforward European languages such as French or Spanish to up to two years for the hard languages like Arabic, Chinese or Japanese. For staff whose job overseas does not require them to be able to speak the local language, 100 hours language training is available to enable them to cope with the basic needs of everyday living. This 100 hours is also offered to spouses and partners.

<a name="30210w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister received two letters from East Sussex County Council in response to the consultation on the Review of Formula Grant Distribution and three letters during consultation on the provisional local government finance settlement 2003&#150;04. East Sussex were also able to make representations on our proposals at a meeting with my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green. These raised a number of issues including the implications of our proposals for education, core services, the level of council tax in the county and the consequences for public services. The cost of living and the level of the County's GDP were also raised. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister considered carefully all the comments made alongside all others as we took final decisions on the settlement.

 Revenue: The following table shows the percentage of local authorities' budgets that has been ring-fenced for the years 1998&#150;99 to 2002&#150;03. It also shows the percentage of government funding to local authorities (Aggregate External Finance, AEF) that has been ring-fenced over this period. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has recently changed the definition of ring-fencing, to better encompass the range of grants that have been developed. The key distinction 



<P>
<P><I>10 Feb 2003 : Column 577W</I><P>
remains between grants that attempt to control spending by the local authority, and those that do not. The full definitions are contained in the Freedoms and Flexibilities for Local Government announcement published on 26 November. The following table uses the new definitions. On the old definitions ring fencing in 2002&#150;03 would be 14.8 per cent. of AEF and 11.1 per cent. of budgets.
<P>

<a name="30210w22.html_para4">Government are committed to keeping ring fencing to the minimum necessary. On current plans, the rising trend shown in the table will be reversed and fall below 10 per cent. by 2005&#150;06.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the ways in which the proposals in his statement to the House on 5 February on social housing will enable Preston City Council to respond to its backlog of social housing refurbishment.  [96749]<P>

<a name="30210w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister's statement set out the proposals subsequently published in "Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future". This states that local authorities will be able to choose the right approach for additional investment in the stock that they own from the existing three options of: stock transfer; The Private Finance Initiative; and for high performing local authorities Arms Length Management Organisations. Authorities can use different options from this list for different parts of their stock, as part of an overarching strategy. This has been made possible through the removal of some of the barriers that prevented some authorities from using stock transfer. These options should enable Preston to respond to its backlog.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what proportion of the NHS budget has been spent on learning disability in each year since 1979.  [94418]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30210w24.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Our White Paper, "Valuing People", A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century, published in March 2001, encourages better integration of health and social care services for people with learning disabilities. To gain a full picture of expenditure on this group it is necessary to look at trends in both areas. Their combined spending on learning disability in 2000&#150;2001 was 3.3 billion.
<P>

<a name="30210w24.html_para6">"Valuing People" also encouraged the National Health Service to treat learning disabled people in mainstream services rather than specialist services wherever appropriate. Information about NHS expenditure on learning disability is available only for specialist learning disability services. It is not collected separately on the expenditure associated with their use of primary and secondary care services. Available details of the proportion of total expenditure that went on social services and specialist NHS services for learning disabled people are shown in the table. "Valuing People" announced two new funds. In April 2002, we introduced the learning disability development fund (LDDF). The &#163;22.6 million LDDF revenue comes from that element of the old long-stay adjustment within general health allocations, which is released as former long-stay patients die. This is being targeted on the priorities set out in Valuing People, including modernising day services, completing the re-provision of the remaining long stay hospitals and enhancing leadership in learning disability services. LDDF revenue is also being used to fund the Valuing People support team. LDDF capital, of &#163;16.7 million in 2002&#150;03, is supporting the development of integrated health and social services facilities for children and young people with severe disabilities and complex needs, specialist services for people with severe challenging behaviour and supported living approaches for people living with older carers.
<P>

<a name="30210w24.html_para7">The &#163;2.3 million implementation support fund was introduced for three years from April 2001 and is focussing on advocacy, a national learning disability information centre and helpline, in partnership with Mencap and a number of development projects.

<a name="30210w25.html_para3">Carers are entitled to an assessment to determine their needs as carers and eligibility for support. The carers grant, worth &#163;100 million next year, provides money for local councils to provide short breaks for carers to enable them to continue in their caring role. Following my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's announcement in July 2002, the grant will continue until 2006, during which time it will more than double to &#163;185 million to provide extended care and 130,000 further breaks to carers.

 "Children Missing from Care and Home&#151;a guide to good practice", was issued to every English local authority in November 2002, under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970, which means that, expect in exceptional circumstances, councils must follow its advice.
<P>

<a name="30210w25.html_para7">The guidance requires that, where a child in care is assessed to be missing, the authority responsible for their care must ensure that all is being done to locate them and return them to a place of safety. In order to do this the authority will have to inform the police and other relevant agencies and should also usually inform the child's parents. In individual cases, local authorities will be responsible for deciding on the most effective method for alerting the police and other agencies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will publish the results of annual public opinion polls conducted by the Food Standards Agency on its effectiveness in gaining public trust; what plans he has to commission an independent appraisal from <i>(a)</i> the National Audit Office and <i>(b)</i> other bodies; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="30210w26.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) commissions an annual survey of public attitudes to food safety and standards issues that also examines levels of consumer confidence in the FSA. The surveys were undertaken by an independent research company, following a competitive tendering exercise carried out under Government procurement guidelines. The first Consumer Attitudes Survey was conducted during the first year of the FSA's establishment and was published in February 2001. The second survey was published in February 2002 and the third will be published shortly. Copies of the surveys are available on the FSA's website at www.food.gov.uk or on request from the FSA.
<P>

<a name="30210w26.html_para0">Therefore I see no reason to commission an independent study to measure levels of public trust in the FSA. It is a matter for the Comptroller and Auditor General, as head of the National Audit Office, to determine which subjects to review and whether or not to report to Parliament on them. I understand the NAO currently has an examination of service delivery under way, one part of which is reviewing aspects of the performance achieved by the FSA. The Comptroller and Auditor General will report to Parliament on this in due course.

 The table shows the number of national health service sight tests paid for in West Sussex Health Authority for 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02. Figures for the number of sight tests by age are not collected centrally. The nearest eligibility category for pensioners is those aged 60 and over.
<P>

<a name="30210w26.html_para1">Eligibility to NHS sight tests was extended to those aged 60 and over from 1 April 1999. There was an increase of 2.4 million sight tests between 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000. It is fair to assume that the vast majority of this increase was due to newly eligible people aged 60 or over obtaining NHS sight tests.

<a name="30210w26.html_para5">It is important to remember that a report of a suspected adverse reaction does not necessarily mean that the herbal product, vitamin or mineral caused it.
<P>

<a name="30210w26.html_para6">Herbal medicines and vitamin and mineral products are often supplied without prescription, and are often taken without advice from doctors or pharmacists. It is generally recognised that the reporting rate for medicines supplied over the counter (OTC) is lower than that of suspected adverse reactions associated with prescription medicines. To encourage reporting of suspected adverse reactions with OTC medicines, the Yellow Card Scheme was recently extended to include nurses as reporters, and will be extended to include patient reporting via NHS Direct in the near future.

<i>[holding answer 7 February 2003]:</i> The NHS Plan committed action by 2004 to "initiatives to work with the food industry&#151;including manufacturers and caterers&#151;to improve the overall balance of diet including salt, fat and sugar in food, working with the Food Standards Agency". 75 per cent. of salt in the diet is from processed foods. The Department and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) have been in discussions with industry to gradually reduce the level of salt in manufactured foods, where it is present beyond technical, safety and palatability needs. Sectors of industry have taken some action during the last few years to reduce the salt content of the food they sell. Scope for further reductions have been identified and the Department and the FSA are working with key industry bodies to progress action.
<P>

<a name="30210w28.html_para0">The Department and the FSA also plan to hold a meeting with wider stakeholders later this year to raise the profile of the issue and highlight the role of all stakeholders in addressing dietary salt intakes&#151;including health, manufacturers, retailers, caterers and voluntary organisations. The stakeholders meeting will be held following publication of the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition Sub-group report on salt and health.
<P>

<a name="30210w28.html_para1">Following the publication of this report, the Department and the FSA also plan to more widely publicise the impact of salt and health to consumers and the action they can take to reduce their intakes. At present, the issue of salt reduction is covered in FSA leaflets and on it's website. It is also highlighted on the NHS Direct website.
<P>

<a name="30210w28.html_para2">The five a day communications programme highlights that, although the fruit and vegetables in processed food count towards the five a day target, processed foods high in salt, fat or added sugars should only be eaten in moderation and that it is important to always read the label.

Completed forms were checked briefly on the doorstep for omissions; further forms were issued in cases where contact had not yet been established or where there was some uncertainty about the occupation of the accommodation.

 When this Government came to office in 1997, one third of children were living in households with income below 60 per cent. of the national median: more than double the number in relative poverty in 1979. The increase in the number of children in low-income households between 1979 and 1997 can probably be attributed to an increase in the number of households with no-one in work, restrictions on out-of-work benefits and real increases in earnings of the employed population.

 To receive their entitlement to tax credits, people need to make a claim. Couples must claim the new Child Tax Credit jointly. The Inland Revenue has written to claimants of the existing Children's Tax Credit, inviting claims for the new tax credits. A reminder was sent in the autumn to people who had not responded to the invitation, and a further reminder is being issued in February. Employees receiving Children's Tax Credit through their PAYE codes have received a special insert with their 2003&#150;04 coding notices, reminding them that Children's Tax Credit is replaced in April by Child Tax Credit and encouraging those who have not yet claimed the new tax credits to do so without delay. There is also a prominent reference to the new tax credits in the uprating letter going to all seven million Child Benefit recipients in the run-up to April.

 The Sandler review of the market for medium and long-term retail savings, which was published last July, recommended two changes to the regime for taxing life insurance products. These changes are the abolition of the qualifying policy regime and the replacement of the so-called 5 per cent. tax-deferral rule which applies to withdrawals.
<P>

<a name="30210w31.html_para1">As we announced in the pre-Budget report, the Government are considering these proposals as part of the Budget process and are consulting the industry about their implications. They have received representations from the insurance industry and friendly society movement. The Association of Friendly Societies and the Association of British Insurers have been in frequent contact with Treasury and Inland Revenue officials. Their discussions include considering how the Sandler recommendation to abolish the qualifying policy regime for new life insurance policies would affect savings through qualifying policies, particularly by those on low incomes.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the effectiveness of the Large Companies Office of the Inland Revenue in collecting tax over the period 1997 to 2002.  [94922]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30210w31.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Inland Revenue's Large Business Office (LBO), formed on 1 April 1997, is responsible for dealing with the tax affairs of most of the largest companies and employers operating in the United Kingdom. It ensures such companies' tax affairs are handled by highly knowledgeable and experienced tax officials. The office explains the Inland Revenue's view of how tax law applies in particular circumstances and oversees the process by which large businesses account for the tax they are due to pay.
<P>

<a name="30210w31.html_para2">As part of that process LBO staff make inquiries into companies' tax returns on the basis of an assessment of the risk to the Exchequer. This can result in large adjustments to profits returned for tax, which sometimes require litigation. The additional tax recovered as a result of such LBO action may therefore fluctuate from year to year. The annual yield has been 1998&#150;99&#151;&#163;1.9 billion; 1999&#150;2000&#151;&#163;1.9 billion; 2000&#150;01&#151;&#163;2.2 billion; and 2001&#150;02&#151;&#163;1.6 billion. The office has met the overwhelming majority of its operational targets and has been highly effective, a view confirmed in the Government's 2001 Review of Links with Business and more recent taxpayer research.

 Deterring and countering tax evasion and avoidance is a major part of the Inland Revenue's work to ensure that everyone understands and pays what is due. This work ensures that everyone contributes to the UK's needs. The National Audit Office has recently concluded an investigation into the Inland Revenue's effectiveness at countering fraud and will be publishing its report in due course.
