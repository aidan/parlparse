The four Christmas receptions held in Northern Ireland in 2007 were attended by over 1,400 members of the public drawn from the criminal justice, policing, military, business, charity and community sectors. The guests included families of the security forces and serving personnel, representatives of victims groups, churches and businesses, as well as many others working in the community sectors across Northern Ireland.</p>

External forecasts from third parties such as travel companies, insurance firms and banks were used as the basis for assumptions. Information was received from a spread of ATOL license holders, including the four largest air travel tour operators, five medium sized operators and two online tour operators.

 The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) creates a market for first generation biofuels which in turn helps to set the right conditions for the development of commercially viable second generation biofuels. The UK will be required to modify the RTFO in order to implement the Renewable Energy Directive in 2010. The directive incentivises second generation biofuels through requiring member states to count their contribution towards renewable energy targets as twice those of first generation biofuels. We shall be consulting later this year about how to take forward the implementation of the directive in UK legislation.</p>

Last autumn the Government also announced that the Department anticipates contributing up to &#163;3 million per year over the next two financial years to the Carbon Trust&#146;s Advanced Bioenergy Directed Research Accelerator.

In 2008-09 DFT will provide Chorley borough council with special grant funding of &#163;280,000 for the improvement to statutory concessionary travel; this is in addition to the existing formula grant funding from CLG. The Special Grant Funding represents a 33 per cent. increase in funding over and above Chorley borough council&#146;s declared costs of &#163;0.85 million for concessionary travel in 2007-08.</p>

 HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) administer almost 20 different taxes and duties and several other collection and payment regimes such as tax credits, national insurance and child benefit. All of the regimes make provision for administrative financial penalties to underpin compliance.</p>

 HMRC announced the planned closure of these three offices in February 2008. While we cannot rule out compulsory redundancies, our aim is to avoid them as far as is reasonably possible, and there have been none so far.</p>

 In the nuclear test ban era, laser physics is one of the principal areas of research essential to underwrite the safety and reliability of the UK's nuclear warhead stockpile.

Under the contract, the company will provide a temporary vessel which will result in an acceptable provision of an interim service until the arrival of new permanent vessels which are in the process of being built.
