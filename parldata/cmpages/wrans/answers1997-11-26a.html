 The Government have set out their policy on tackling youth crime and its causes in three consultation documents published since September 25: "Tackling Youth Crime", "New National and Local Focus on Youth Crime" and "Tackling Delays in the Youth Justice System". We have sent out over 2,000 copies of each to interested parties, including youth organisations. As of 21 November, we had received a total of 955 responses. The consultation period is now over and we aim to provide a report to Parliament on the responses as soon as is practicable.

 <i>[holding answer 24 November 1997]:</i> The United Kingdom is not a member of Schengen and under the Treaty of Amsterdam the Schengen acquis will apply as a matter of European law in all member states except the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The Treaty of Amsterdam provides for the

<P>
<P>
<a name="71126w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I understand that the necessary Memorandum of Understanding has been signed by President Mandela and that designation of the United Kingdom under the Extradition Amendment Act 1996 was approved by the South African parliament during its last session. The designation is to be published in the Government Gazette shortly and will come into effect on the date it is published.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71126w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Wallace: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what proportion of compensation claims made under the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997, excluding option C claims, had been settled in <i>(a)</i> the Surrey County Constabulary area, <i>(b)</i> the Metropolitan Police area, <i>(c)</i> the Northern Constabulary area, <i>(d) </i>Orkney and <i>(e)</i> Shetland by 1 November; [17658]
<P>
<UL>(2) what proportion of claims, excluding option C claims, for compensation for those who surrendered weapons and ancillary equipment under the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 had been settled by 1 November: [17657]
<P>
(3) by what date he expects all compensation claims under the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997, excluding option C claims, to have been settled; and if he will make a statement. [17659]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71126w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 It has always been recognised that the pressure of claims received over the short hand-in period was bound to mean processing delays, and claimants were advised that they may have to wait several weeks before receiving any payment.
<P>

<a name="71126w01.html_para0">The target for the completion of claims submitted under Option A and B is the end of March 1988, and that for the completion of claims submitted under Option C, the end of December 1998, although the great majority of claims will have been settled well within these target times. Claims are dealt with in the order in which they are received. Information about the number of claims submitted by different force areas is not yet available. 



<P>
<P><I>26 Nov 1997 : Column: 543</I><P>
As at 21 November 1997, 39,553 claims had been received, including those for small-calibre pistols submitted under the ex-gratia scheme. Of these, 18,673 payments had been made, to a value of &#163;24 million.
<P>

<a name="71126w01.html_para1">A number of measures have been taken to increase the processing rate by minimising distractions to examining staff. Weekend overtime is being worked, staff have been temporarily promoted to boost examiner numbers, and efforts are being made to recruit additional staff. I would like to pay tribute to the hard work of everyone in the Home Office and in individual police forces who is working so hard to cope with the challenge. It is appreciated that any delay will irritate those who have handed in their weapons, especially those who were opposed to this legislation. However, we are honouring the commitments made by the previous Government during the passage of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 and doing as much as is reasonable to minimise delay, consistent with the need to control public expenditure, while fulfilling the clear will of Parliament.

<a name="71126w01.html_para4">Within the framework of the EC-Israel Agreement, Customs are carrying out inquiries to establish the true origin of a wide range of products imported from Israel. The Subjects of these inquiries include fruit juice. Customs experts from all Member States will meet shortly to discuss what further measures can be taken to verify Israeli origin declarations. EC officials will meet Israel representatives soon, following consultations with Member States, to seek a solution to this problem.

<a name="71126w02.html_para1">The UK pays 6.568 per cent. in assessed contributions of the total yearly cost of every UN peacekeeping operation.

 We gather information from a wide range of reliable sources. We are in close contact with our Embassy in Cairo who, in turn, are in contact with the Egyptian government.
<P>

<a name="71126w02.html_para2">Information from these sources has been distilled into the travel advice notice issued on 18 November as follows:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
"In a major incident near Luxor on 17 November gunmen killed more than sixty tourists, including at least six British visitors. Since 1992 extremists have conducted a campaign of violence against the Egyptian Government, mainly in the provinces of Minya and Assiut (half way between Cairo and Luxor) but with sporadic attacks in other areas. Most of these incidents have been directed at the police, or were sectarian in nature.
<BR>
Extremists have warned tourists not to visit Egypt. In April 1996 gunmen killed 18 Greek tourists in Cairo. On 18 September two men, acting alone, killed 10 people, mainly German tourists, also in Cairo.
<BR>
The Luxor attack suggests that the threat to tourists visiting Upper Egypt has increased. British visitors are advised to exercise great caution when visiting Upper Egypt (defined as the area of the Nile valley south of and including Minya province). They are strongly advised to avoid the Luxor area until further notice.
<BR>
Visitors to all other parts of Egypt, including Cairo, the Red Sea and Sinai, are advised to be vigilant and to respect any advice from the local security authorities.
<BR>
Local driving conditions and poor vehicle maintenance make road travel outside the main cities hazardous, especially at night. In the event of an accident emergency medical facilities are limited.
<BR>
Travel advice is widely available to the travel trade and tour operators. We would be prepared to offer further advice to tour operators if asked. None have approached us following the events in Egypt on 17 November.

Amongst the 16 museums my Department directly sponsors, there are five that were once funded by the Metropolitan County Councils, and the Greater London Council (the National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside; the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester; the Geffrye Museum; the Horniman Museum and the Museum of London). An annual allocation is made to these institutions following an assessment of their needs as expressed in their respective corporate plans. In addition the Museums and Galleries Commission currently awards an annual grant to the Tyne and Wear Museum Service, following their assessment of the relative needs of the various client bodies funded by them.
<P>

<a name="71126w03.html_para1">Allocations are made on grounds of affordability and need. Institutions and museum services are very different and are funded on different bases from different sources. Funding levels are therefore not directly comparable.
<P>

<a name="71126w03.html_para2">My Department is currently considering all of its public funding commitments as part of its contribution to the Government's comprehensive spending review.

 The principle of the carry-over of government bills from one session to the next was set out in the First Report of the Select Committee on Modernisation of the House of Commons (HC 190) which was approved by the House on 13 November. The exact procedure for carry-over will now be developed in consultation with the House of Lords. The Government have not yet identified any bill to be subject to such a procedure this session. No recommendation about the procedure nor any statement about bills which might be carried over is imminent. I am not aware of any public bills being hybrid this session and I am not responsible for private bills.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71126w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Ann Taylor: </B> 
 Supply days were replaced by Opposition and Estimates Days in 1982. At the same time Consolidated Fund Bills ceased to be debated, with the same time allocated instead for overnight private Members' adjournment debates. The separate debate on public expenditure plans was amalgamated with the Budget debate when the unified budget was introduced in 1993 and a debate on the summer economic forecast was introduced. Estimates days and three Wednesday mornings now provide up to 12 opportunities for debates on select committee reports which did not exist in 1979.
<P>

<a name="71126w04.html_para0">Money resolutions and ways and means resolutions, if taken on the same day as the second reading of the bill, are now put without debate, but are debatable for 45 minutes if taken at other times. The second reading of Law Commission Bills is now normally taken in a second reading committee but may still be taken on the floor of the House.
<P>

<a name="71126w04.html_para1">Similarly, the committee stage of consolidation bills may be dispensed with and the third reading taken without debate. Although more statutory instruments and EU documents are now taken in committee rather than on the floor of the House, they may be debated on the floor.
<P>

<a name="71126w04.html_para2">Since 1979 the only item of business which has ceased to exist is the Private members' motion. Until 1994 up to about 18 Members a year moved such motions, mainly on Fridays. These, together with the three overnight sittings on the Consolidated Fund Bill and the last day before recess debates, have been replaced under the Jopling reforms by private Members' adjournment debates on Wednesday mornings. A total of 128 hours was spent on such debates in the last normal-length session (1995-96) compared with 106 hours on the previous business in the session before the change. These have created some 160 separate opportunities each session for backbenchers to raise subjects of their choice.

 My Department is represented on the Panels dealing with Natural Resources and Environment (NRE), Construction, Marine and Transport. The process by which the Department's research priorities are established takes place in parallel with the Panel's own priority-setting process. Foresight informs a broad range of priorities within the Department, including specific programmes. We consider all relevant Foresight priorities during the planning process, and modify research requirements accordingly.
<P>

<a name="71126w05.html_para0">For example, the Department has embedded many Foresight findings within the Construction Research and Innovation Business Plans. The Business Plans and their Key Priorities set the agenda for the Department's future involvement in construction research and innovation. This includes a new LINK Programme, "Meeting Clients' Needs Through Standardisation", funded by the Department and the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC). The Department is also helping the Panel to follow up its recommendations on the social and environmental impacts of construction by funding research into indicators of sustainable construction.

<a name="71126w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Existing Planning Policy Guidance on Transport (PPG13) encourages local authorities to be flexible in the requirements for off-street residential parking space and reduce them or waive them where necessary in order to provide good-quality and affordable high-density development in areas with good access to other means of travel.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="71126w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Nearly 100 responses out of the approximately 700 received supported the concept of phasing. We are considering all the issues raised by the Green Paper and will announce our decisions in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what guidance he issues to planning authorities in respect of the design of dwellings for single person households. [17710]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71126w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Planning policy guidance on housing (PPG3) and several regional planning guidance documents advise local planning authorities to take account of demographic and social changes in the region, including the increasingly varied types of housing required, such as for single persons, small households and the elderly. The guidance, however, is concerned with the mix of types of housing, and does not give advice on the design of dwellings as such.

<P>

<a name="71126w05.html_para5">We consider that the most appropriate way of tackling the loss of dry stone walls is by encouraging their upkeep.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what guideline rents he proposes for local authority tenants in England for 1998-99. [18125]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71126w05.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 We are proposing that the average guideline rent for 1998-99 should increase from &#163;35.38 to &#163;36.35 a week. This is 97p per week more than the current year's guideline rent in cash terms. Guideline rent increases for individual authorities would range between 72p and &#163;1.22.
<P>

<a name="71126w05.html_para6">To encourage authorities to keep their rent increases within the guideline increase, we propose to continue with the present rule that limits rent rebate subsidy. This gives authorities a strong incentive to keep rent increases down to reasonable levels, but does not affect tenants' entitlement to housing benefit.
<P>

<a name="71126w05.html_para7">Total provision within the subsidy system for expenditure by authorities on management and maintenance in 1997-98 will be more than &#163;3.3 billion. This is about the same per dwelling as in the current financial year.
<P>

<a name="71126w05.html_para8">Our proposals are set out in the draft Housing Revenue Account Subsidy and Item 8 determinations for 1998-99, which we have sent to housing authorities today. Authorities have been invited to let my Department have their views by 17 December 1997.
<P>

<a name="71126w05.html_para9">So that they can make full use of the extra capital resources released under the Government's Capital Receipts Initiative, the draft determinations also provide for authorities to receive additional revenue support where there resources are used in respect of council housing.
<P>

<a name="71126w05.html_para10">Copies of the draft determinations have been placed in the House Library.

The Government recognises the value given by the Cadet Forces to both the civilian community and to our Armed Forces. The Ministry of Defence's financial contribution in support of Army, Sea and Air cadets during each of the last five financial years and the forecast for the current financial year is shown in the table. Similar detail in respect of the Combined Cadet Force has been included. The Department has not yet finished its financial planning for 1998-99 and the forecast for that financial year will not be available until Class I Supply Estimates for 1998-99 are published in March.

 The BAe 146s, BAe 125s and Wessex helicopters of No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron are required to be maintained to RAF standards, which are at least as robust as those applying to civil aircraft. The terms of the engineering support element of the multi-activity contract at RAF Northolt stipulate that contractor personnel should be capable of maintaining the aircraft to the same standards as would be required of RAF personnel. The Squadron also operates Twin Squirrel helicopters provided and maintained by a different contractor, which are required to meet CAA standards.

The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking how many people to date have lost their Reduced Earnings Allowance (REA) in each of the benefit districts in Wales.

I have assumed your question refers to Adjudication Officer's decisions to transfer over pension age REA recipients to Retirement Allowance (RA) following the introduction of the Social Security (Industrial Injuries and Diseases) (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1996 on 24 March 1996.

<BR>
The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the current arrangements for the medical examinations of persons claiming War Disablement Pension.
<BR>
Most examinations, where considered necessary for the individual case, are conducted locally by War Pensions Examining Medical Practitioners, the majority of whom are General Practitioners.
<BR>
The Benefits Agency Medical Services (BAMS) who organise examinations for Social Security benefits are responsible for recruiting and training doctors to undertake medical examinations and for arranging these examinations for the War Pensions Agency (WPA). Doctors undertaking medical examinations for War Pensions must be registered with the General Medical Council and be experienced in medical examinations for Benefit purposes. BAMS are responsible for ensuring the satisfactory completion of the training of the doctors who conduct examinations for the WPA. The training of these doctors is based on the Handbook for Examining Medical Practitioners (War Pensions) which has been written and recently revised by Medical Advisors employed by the WPA. The WPA Medical Advisors make, on the medical evidence, decisions as to whether a condition is attributable to or aggravated by service and the degree of any disablement.
<BR>
The monitoring of completed examination reports is the responsibility of the WPA. All medical examination reports are reviewed by the WPA's Medical Advisors. Any reports which do not fulfil the WPA's requirements are returned to BAMS. In addition to these arrangements the WPA is currently developing a structured monitoring scheme to provide formal feedback to BAMS on the general quality of the examining doctors' medical reports.
<BR>
In the specialist area of hearing loss claims, audiometric examinations are conducted for the WPA by British Medical International, part of General Healthcare Group PLC. The reports from these examinations are considered by the WPA Medical Advisors as part of the evidence in these cases. These arrangements are formally monitored, both internally by the WPA Medical Advisors and through a regular external professional scrutiny.
<BR>
In addition to War Pension medical examinations, the WPA also requests specialist and Regional Consultant medical examinations. Specialist appointments are arranged through BAMS who in many cases nominate a local specialist with suitable expertise. In some cases the WPA's Medical Advisors nominate a specialist, normally the specialist who has been responsible for the clinical care of the claimant/pensioner.
<BR>
Regional Consultants are recognised authorities in their speciality and are appointed by the DSS Chief Medical Adviser. Regional Consultant examinations are requested by the WPA to resolve conflict of medical opinion and also in exceptionally complex cases. A list of Regional Consultants is held in the WPA and the WPA Medical Advisor is responsible for nominating the Regional Consultant. BAMS are responsible for arranging appointments on behalf of the WPA.




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>26 Nov 1997 : Column: 567</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
All the specialist and Regional Consultant reports are reviewed by the WPA's Medical Advisors. Any unsatisfactory reports are returned directly to the specialist or Regional Consultant. BAMS would be advised of any specialist who consistently provided unsatisfactory reports and use of that specialist's services would cease. Any Regional Consultant who consistently provided unsatisfactory reports would be notified to the Chief Medical Advisor with a view to removal from the list.
<BR>
I am satisfied that these arrangements work satisfactorily.
<BR>
I hope you will find my reply helpful.

During the cold weather season for 1996/97 4,964,966 cold weather payments were made at a total programme cost of &#163;42,202,211 and an administrative cost of &#163;7,512,414.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71126w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 November 1997]:</i> I have made no such estimate. Businesses which take appropriate action now are unlikely to become insolvent as a result of this problem, but the longer a business with a serious problem delays the greater the risk it runs. That is why the Government has recently launched the Action 2000 initiative under the chairmanship of Don Cruickshank.

<P>
<a name="71126w10.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Dafis: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade what is her estimate of <i>(a)</i> the total liabilities of the nuclear power industry and <i>(b)</i> the liabilities which are currently unfunded. [17297]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71126w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The total lifetime nuclear liabilities of the UK nuclear power industry at 31 March 1997 were &#163;15.1 billion. This total arises from the contributions of three companies. The individual components are:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
British Energy: &#163;5.2 billion
<BR>
BNFL: &#163;1.481 billion
<BR>
Magnox Electric: &#163;8.4 billion

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="71126w10.html_para2">These figures are discounted at 3 per cent. for British Energy and Magnox and 2 per cent. for BNFL. In the case of British Energy the above figures take into account the new and revised BNFL contracts announced on 4 June 1997.
<P>

<a name="71126w10.html_para3">British Energy's nuclear liabilities comprise decommissioning and backend fuel costs, and the company has made provision in its accounts for &#163;3.8 billion of those liabilities. A segregated fund has been set up to cover the costs of decommissioning. This was endowed, by British Energy, with &#163;228 million and receives payments of &#163;16 million per year. It is designed to cover 110 per cent. of decommissioning costs based on independent engineering assessments. Payments for backend fuel disposal will arise over many years. Funds for dealing with those payments will come from existing funds and amounts built up from future business operations.
<P>

<a name="71126w10.html_para4">BNFL has already made provisions in its accounts for &#163;1.158 billion of its nuclear liabilities. A further &#163;323 million will be provided, in accordance with company policy, from the income generated over the remaining lifetime of plant which is still operating. More than half of the amount provisioned is in a separate fund, the bulk of which is held in gilts.
<P>

<a name="71126w10.html_para5">Magnox Electric has significant assets to meet its nuclear liabilities, most of which will not fall due for payment for a considerable number of years. Furthermore, the proposed integration of Magnox and BNFL will bring additional benefits in the cost and management of these liabilities. At 31 March 1997 there was a gap of &#163;682 million between the company's assets and liabilities. This is covered by a long-standing Letter of Comfort from the Government originally given to Nuclear Electric in 1990.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what plans she has to authorise OFTEL to require providers to establish packages tailored for low-use businesses; and if she will make a statement. [17741]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71126w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Low-use businesses are increasingly offered a variety of packages by telecommunications providers in today's competitive multi-operator market. Low-use businesses are also protected from price increases by the regulator Oftel. Oftel has required BT to provide a safeguard tariff package for small businesses for which the call charges are the same as those paid by residential customers whose prices are covered by the RPI-4.5 per cent. price cap. The package also ensures that

To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make a statement on the United Kingdom's progress in the implementation of <i>(a)</i> the Convention on Biodiversity and <i>(b)</i> the principles of the 1996 Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and their incorporation into United Kingdom legislation. [17803]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71126w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle:  (a)</B> 
 The United Kingdom is undertaking a range of activities at home and abroad to work towards the three goals of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity: to conserve biodiversity, ensure its sustainable use, and achieve the equitable sharing of the resultant benefits. Domestically, a Government-led partnership is implementing our national biodiversity action plan, with individual action plans for a range of species and habitats, and for particular localities, building on existing domestic and European legislation. Internationally, we recently hosted a conference to help Central and Eastern European countries plan and implement their own biodiversity strategies, and through both our general aid programme and the Darwin Initiative, we continue to support developing countries' efforts to meet their Convention obligations. Our first national report under the Convention, due by the end of this year, will record these efforts in detail.
<P>

<a name="71126w10.html_para6">(b) The Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine contains a wide range of provisions covering a number of complex ethical and legal issues. The Government is considering the implications of the provisions carefully. No decisions on a timescale for signature or ratification have been made.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade pursuant to her answer of 15 July 1997, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>141,</i> if the redemption of the Government's special share in British Telecommunications plc has now taken place; and if the Government holds any other shares in BT. [18058]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71126w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Government redeemed the Special Share, in exchange for a payment by BT of &#163;1, on 10 September. This means that the Government no longer holds any share which has a direct influence on the terms of the company's Articles of Association. HM Treasury retains for the time being a residual holding of some 10.7 million BT Shares (around 0.2 per cent. of BT's overall share capital) remaining from earlier flotation offers. As has been the policy since privatisation, the Government will not vote with these shares.

<a name="71126w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Register was introduced in 1983 as a voluntary guide to ISO 9000 certification bodies and the companies they certify. The Register was compiled and published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office. My Department's role, as the accreditor of certification bodies, was to invite accredited certification bodies to contribute to the Register and to check the accuracy of those contributions before they were published. My Department also provided a complimentary copy of the Register to each contributing certification body.
<P>

<a name="71126w10.html_para7">In 1995 my Department established, as a company limited by guarantee, the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) as the sole national accreditation body for certification bodies, testing and calibration laboratories and inspection bodies. Accreditation consequently passed from the public to the private sector, although my Department retains firm links with UKAS through a memorandum of understanding and a licensing agreement, As a result of this shift in responsibility, UKAS was asked to consider taking over my Department's functions in relation to the Register.
<P>

<a name="71126w10.html_para8">In 1996, following the privatisation of Her Majesty's Stationery Office, compilation and publication of the Register passed to The Stationery Office Ltd.
<P>

<a name="71126w10.html_para9">I have now agreed with UKAS and The Stationery Office Ltd. that the functions previously undertaken by my Department will pass to UKAS. In recognition of this, and of the increasingly international nature of accreditation and certification, the title of the Register will be amended to the QA Register with effect from the 1998 edition. The Stationery Office Ltd. will continue to publish the Register. The precise content and style of the Register will be matters for UKAS and The Stationery Office to decide jointly.
<P>

<a name="71126w10.html_para10">My Department will continue to fund complimentary copies of the Register for each contributing certification body. This provision will be reviewed after two years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71126w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 The Government has given a firm commitment to strengthen the role which science plays in its decision making. One important aspect of this is ensuring that the OST's guidelines are taken fully into account across Government and, following consultation with Ministerial colleagues, I am now introducing a number of measures to achieve this. A Minister is being designated within each Department with special responsibility for ensuring that the Department's general procedures for taking account of scientific advice are consistent with the guidelines. In addition, departmental Chief Scientists will be reporting regularly to Sir Robert May, the Government's Chief Scientific Adviser, on how the guidelines are being taken into account by departments and on any emerging scientific issues of which other departments should be aware.

 The United States Administration share our desire for an enduring peace and lasting political settlement in Northern Ireland. This was all the more evident during my recent visit to the United States. We greatly value their rejection of violence; their commitment to the talks process; their support for the principle of consent; and their continuing support for the International Fund for Ireland, which has contributed significantly to Northern Ireland's economy. The President himself takes a close personal interest in Northern Ireland affairs; the First Lady visited Northern Ireland last month and Senator George Mitchell and Donald Johnson are playing a vital independent role in the talks and on decommissioning respectively.

Our approach in these meetings has been to listen to Sinn Fein's concerns and to explain the Government's policy which is that the British Government will continue to honour its obligations under the Convention on the transfer of sentenced persons.

 As the table showed in my previous answer, the United Kingdom had shortfalls against target in a number of its MAGP III segments as at the end of 1996 and does not currently qualify for EU funding in respect of vessel construction or modernisation grants, other than for safety-related improvements, which do not result in an increase in fishing effort.
<P>

<a name="71126w13.html_para0">Under the terms of MAGP IV, these shortfalls continue to have to be met in addition to our new objectives, which the Commission has still to confirm. The resulting percentage reductions will vary according to the segments and fisheries concerned and will in some cases be expressed in terms of fishing effort rather than tonnage. It is not possible to give definitive figures in advance of the Commission's formal Decision. As far as future expenditure is concerned, the Government are still considering the position in relation to decommissioning but have no plans to pay upgrade grants other than under the existing safety schemes.

 There is no Codex ban on vitamins. The Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses is currently in the process of drawing up guidelines on supplements containing vitamin and minerals. These address a number of issues, including the setting of maximum vitamin and mineral content of supplements. The latest draft, which is due to be discussed again in September 1998, includes a number of possible options for this. One of these provides for the vitamin and mineral content of supplements to be limited to 100 per cent. of the recommended daily intake. Other options included establishing maximum limits on a case by case basis, and having no maximum at all.

<a name="71126w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The Department's control total for 1998-99 is &#163;13,372 million. We are committed to working within the Department totals for 1998-99 which we inherited from the previous administration and therefore this sum is the same as that announced in November 1996 except in respect of agreed inter-Departmental transfers. I have reallocated this expenditure to align the Department's programmes with the Government's new objectives, policies and priorities.
<P>

<a name="71126w14.html_para0">The voted expenditure for 1998-99 will be supplemented by up to &#163;856 million from outside the control total, financed by the windfall tax, for the welfare to work programme and the New Deal for Schools. In addition, the bulk of expenditure on schools is provided through the local authority finance settlement. The level of expenditure next year on the New Deal for people with disabilities or a long-standing illness, and the New Deal for lone parents, will be announced when plans are finalised.
Schools
<i>Local authority finance</i>
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the Budget an addition to local authority Education Standard Spending of &#163;1,017 million, a year on year increase of 5.7 per cent., taking the total to &#163;19,384 million including the transfer back into local government finance of the deduction made for the Nursery Voucher Scheme introduced by the previous administration. The details of the local authority finance settlement will be announced next week by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister. It is for local authorities to decide how to allocate the available funding, but the Government expects that the funds will be passed on to schools and devoted to raising standards.
<i>Under fives</i>
We are returning to local education authorities the deduction of &#163;527 million from standard spending assessments made by the previous administration. These funds will allow authorities to work in partnership with the private and voluntary sectors to develop their Early Years Development Plans, designed to provide a high quality nursery education on demand to all four-year-olds. Central government funds of &#163;135 million will provide additional grant support to local authorities, to support expansion of the number of places available, and the development of Early Excellence Centres.
<i>School standards and effectiveness</i>
We have set up a new and expanded Standards Fund, replacing the Grants for Educational Support and Training programme. The total Standards Fund programme expenditure is to be &#163;500 million.
<i>Schools capital and the New Deal for Schools</i>
&#163;250 million will be made available from the windfall tax in 1998-99 for the New Deal for Schools, to start tackling the backlog of repairs to school buildings and to develop public private partnerships to maintain an repair schools. The total includes &#163;15 million for school security, to be deployed as part of the Standards Fund. These sums are in addition to the existing schools capital 



<P>
<P><I>26 Nov 1997 : Column: 589</I><P>
programme of &#163;648 million, including the Department's contribution to the Government's local authority capital challenge fund.
<i>National Grid for Learning</i>
&#163;50 million of the New Deal for Schools funds in 1998-99 will support expenditure of &#163;100 million on the capital and infrastructure requirements of setting up the National Grid for Learning, to give schools easier access to high quality materials to support the raising of standards. This will be delivered through the Standards Fund.
<i>Specialist schools</i>
The specialist schools programme will be increased by &#163;6 million to &#163;41 million to support public/private partnerships, allowing the expansion of the programme to 330 schools by September 1998. At the same time we shall broaden the reach of the programme, ensuring that it is open to as many children as possible--both those attending specialist schools, and those in neighbouring schools enjoying their facilities.
<i>Teacher Training Agency</i>
The total grant for the Teacher Training Agency will be &#163;206 million in recognition of the central role they have to play in the Government's drive on standards through action to recruit sufficient high quality entrants to teaching; to ensure that new and existing teachers receive the support and training they need to raise pupil achievement, particularly in the priority areas of literacy, numeracy and ICT; and to underpin effective school leadership.
Lifelong learning, further and higher education
<i>Lifelong learning
</i>
The Government is committed to creating a learning society. This will involve both greater and wider participation, giving access and opportunity to those hitherto excluded so that equality of opportunity and lifelong learning become a reality. We have been able to redirect expenditure so as to make a start on the recommendations of the Kennedy report to widen participation in lifelong learning amongst disadvantaged groups with low or no qualifications.
<i>Further Education</i>
A total of &#163;83 million, including &#163;63 million of new public funding and an estimated &#163;20 million increase in employers' contributions to course fees, will be available to the further education sector in 1998-99, taking the Further Education Funding Council's grant for 1998-99 to &#163;3,114 million.
<i>Higher Education</i>
I have already announced a package of measures that will allow an extra &#163;165 million to be spent on higher education in 1998-99. Universities and colleges will have an extra &#163;125 million to maintain quality and improve standards and to make a start on the backlog of maintenance and equipment replacement. There will be a &#163;36 million access package to benefit part-time students and those facing particular hardship, allowing the doubling of access funds. &#163;4 million will be made available to increase HE participation through sub-degree programmes. The grant for the Higher Education Funding Council will be set at &#163;3,504 million.
<i>Training and Enterprise Councils</i>
The Government is committed to the role of TECs in meeting local needs and contributing to local economic development. The Department's programmes to be delivered through TECs in 1998-99 amount to &#163;1.3 



<P>
<P><I>26 Nov 1997 : Column: 590</I><P>
billion. In addition, TECs will be playing an important strategic role as a key local partner in a wide range of other initiatives including New Deal, the Single Regeneration Budget, and European funding schemes.
<i>Employment programmes</i>
<i>Welfare to work</i>
The Government is committed to helping unemployed people, particularly the most disadvantaged, enhance their employability and get into work as quickly as possible. Following my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's announcement in the Budget, we will be spending up to an additional &#163;606 million in 1998-99 for the introduction of the New Deal for unemployed 18-24 year olds and for those over 25 unemployed for two years or more. The New Deal for unemployed 18-24 year olds will be launched in January next year in pathfinder areas, with the national start in April. The New Deal for the long-term unemployed will start in June 1998.
<P>

<a name="71126w14.html_para1">In addition, the Secretary of State for Social Security and I are working closely together on plans for launching the New Deal for people with disabilities or a long-standing illness, using up to &#163;195 million which the Budget made available, and on plans to launch the national roll out of the New Deal for lone parents with an additional &#163;150 million, over the lifetime of the Parliament.
<i>Employment Zones</i>
We have reallocated expenditure within the Employment Service to allow &#163;30 million to be deployed in 1998-99 to setting up the first prototype Employment Zones, which will offer new help for unemployed people, providing innovative pathways into sustainable work.
<i>Other measures for helping the unemployed</i>
In addition to the above, we have refocussed some &#163;289 million provision within the Employment Service to enable it to help other unemployed people and those with disabilities back to work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71126w15.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Ritalin can be used as a treatment for attention deficit disorder (ADD) in cases when medication is considered to be appropriate. Ritalin has been subjected to controlled trials and can be effective when given to the right children. Other types of medication can also be used as alternative or complementary treatment but Ritalin is the most comprehensively researched medication and is usually considered to be the drug of choice. It should be used under the supervision of a specialist in childhood behavioural disorders as part of a comprehensive treatment programme, which also includes psychological, educational and social measures, to stabilise children with a behavioural syndrome.
<P>

<a name="71126w15.html_para2">The Department of Health has not commissioned any research into alternatives to the use of Ritalin in the treatment of children. The main agency through which the Government supports medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council. The MRC supports a number of studies into the causes and treatment of ADD, but is not currently supporting any research into pharmacological interventions. However, the MRC always welcomes high quality applications for support into any aspect of attention deficit disorder and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding. Awards are made according to their scientific quality and importance to human health.

Figures are rounded to the nearest 10; totals may not sum due to rounding. Figures for care orders include both Interim, full and deemed Care Orders, and relate to the latest recorded legal status when the child ceased to be looked after.<P>

Figures exclude children who are accommodated under an agreed series of short-term placements.<P>

Where a child already looked after moved into respite care, that child is regarded as having ceased to be looked after for the purposes of this statistical analysis.<P>

These figures include estimates for missing data. The West Midlands figure covers the Government Office Region, excluding Solihull for which no data are available.<P>

[17214]<P>

<P>
<a name="71126w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Measures are being taken to reduce the number of hoax calls in a joint initiative between emergency services and telephone operating companies. Ambulance services are also introducing priority dispatch systems which will help identify unnecessary calls. If hoax calls are a particular problem, ambulance services may develop local policies and protocols for not attending in such cases. These must be agreed with local clinicians.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71126w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The most recent central information on numbers of radiotherapy exposures is for the financial year 1992-93 but this did not record the site of the cancer treated. Since then information has not been collected from radiotherapy departments. The number of women receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer includes women who receive it as part of the primary treatment to the breast and surrounding areas and those who receive it for treatment of recurrent breast cancer in the breast or other parts of the body, particularly the bones. In 1992 in England (latest year for which Office for National Statistic figures are available) 30,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer and it is estimated that around half of these would have received radiotherapy as part of primary treatment. Statistics are not routinely collected on the adverse effects of treatments in any medical discipline although this is done in clinical trials.

 The Central Research and Development Committee has recently recommended that the structure of the centrally funded R and D programmes of the National Health Service should be reconfigured around three broad themes--Health Technology Assessment, Service Delivery and Organisation and New and Emerging Technologies. The latter theme is Foresight related; the full scope of the projects to be included in this new theme has yet to be agreed.

 <i>[holding answer 24 November 1997]:</i> Outbreaks of influenza occur every winter and measures to ameliorate illness and cope with the increased demand on health care services are part of routine planning. The first priority for health authorities and National Health Service trusts is to make adequate provision for emergency care and there will be plans in place for responding to any increases in demand for treatment. There is currently no reason to believe that this year's flu season will be worse than those seen in recent years. The Department recommends that people with underlying diseases which put them at increased risk of serious illness should they develop flu should receive flu vaccine each

year. Doctors were reminded of this policy in August 1997, and at the launch of flu awareness week in October. We know that those most 'at risk' for flu, the complications of flu and those most likely to be admitted to hospital for flu are patients with chronic risk conditions: studies have continued to show that those in 'at risk' groups benefit most from vaccination.

nurses are encouraged to make sure they give flu vaccine to as many people at risk from the complications of flu as possible. Leaflets entitled 'Flu vaccination' and 'What should I do about flu?' have been made available to practices through the Department of Health. Copies are also available in the Library. Flu activity is reported on a weekly basis. We monitor the situation closely once the normal winter increase in flu activity begins and situation reports are used to keep health authorities advised of any unusual levels of activity.
