<i> [holding answer 22 March 2010]:</i><i> </i>The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) is responsible for ticketing for the London 2012 Games. LOCOG's ticketing approach will ensure that it raises the funding required to stage the games and that it provides affordable and accessible tickets to deliver full venues, including Hadleigh Farm. LOCOG is working now to finalise the sports competition schedule and venue seating plans, and this work needs to be completed before LOCOG will know the numbers of seats and tickets. It is critical that as many tickets as possible end up in the hands of the public. Tickets will go on sale in 2011.</p>

 Gangs are part of the wider serious youth violence agenda, on which the Government have spent £17.3 million since September 2007 as part of the Tackling Gangs Action Programme (TGAP) and Tackling Knives and Serious Youth Violence Action Programme (TKAP). On 17 March 2010 my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism announced a further £5.5 million for tackling serious youth violence in 2010-11. £1.5 million of this funding has been made available through the Community Fund, ensuring that 150 voluntary and community sector organisations are able to deliver intensive interventions at a local level to young people involved in serious youth violence, including gangs.</p>

The £17.3 million funding since September 2007 to tackle gangs and serious youth violence has included £1.6 million to the four cities that were the focus of the TGAP programme, London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool, to assist in the multi-agency risk management of violent offenders, including gang members. In Merseyside, for instance, this funding has resulted in the UK's first Violent Offender Management Unit. The Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) have also jointly established a team of experts from police forces, local authorities and central Government that will be available to local partnerships to deliver focused advice and guidance on gangs.</p>

<i> [holding answer 22 March 2010]:</i> The only anti-terrorism legislation in the UK which provides for the detention of individuals is section 41 of and schedule 8 to the Terrorism Act 2000. This provides for persons arrested as terrorist suspects to be detained pre-charge (for up to a maximum of 28 days). The Home Office does not hold statistics on how many foreign nationals are, or have been, detained under these provisions. However, the Home Office does collate statistics on the number of individuals arrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and the length of time that these individuals are detained pre-charge. These are included in a Bulletin published for the first time on 13 May 2009 (Statistics on Terrorism Arrests and Outcomes Great Britain 11 September 2001 to 31 March 2008).

The Protocol provides increased clarity on commissioning and funding arrangements and on access standards for patients. It ensures patients who live in border regions and who access health services across the border will continue to see improvements to their services.

 The law currently requires individuals to declare all spent convictions where they are applying to work with vulnerable people as this is an area of activity falling within the Exceptions Order to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. This obligation applies even if the conviction has been deleted from the Police National Computer. We are aware that a conviction for buggery, before aspects of the offence were decriminalised, may relate to consensual homosexual conduct between adults. Therefore, it is our intention to bring forward an amendment to the Exceptions Order so that an individual does not have to disclose a conviction for buggery where this was for behaviour which has subsequently been decriminalised. However, elements of the offence of buggery under the Sexual Offences Act 1956 remain criminal today; therefore the amendment will not affect the obligation to declare a conviction for buggery where the behaviour which attracted the conviction would still be a criminal offence.</p>

 Clause 90 of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill was shared with Opposition representatives as it was developed, and was welcomed widely across the House. By requiring returning officers to take reasonable steps to start the counting of votes by 2 am and to give a reasoned account when they fail to do so, the clause creates a clear expectation that, in line with the clearly expressed view of Parliament on this issue, the counting of votes should start by 2 am, where possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_497"><a name="100323w0006.htm_para3"><a name="10032375000665">It is particularly important for the purposes of the new duty that returning officers look carefully at existing arrangements and past practice and consider the additional steps which they can reasonably take in order to start the counting of votes given on ballot papers by 2 am. Past practice is not necessarily a guide to whether the duty to take all reasonable steps to start the count by 2 am will have been fulfilled. Clause 90 would preserve the operational independence of the returning officer, while providing fresh impetus towards counting votes as quickly as possible. In striking this balance, clause 90 respects the important discretion of the returning officer to make decisions to take account of local circumstances, such as the particular geography of a constituency. In this way, the location of the count remains a matter for the returning officer in each case, taking into account both the legislative framework and local circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_518"><a name="100323w0007.htm_para17"><a name="10032375000752">In July 2008 a second moderation process was mistakenly carried out to consider moves for customer operations staff in the Chorley office to the Tax Credit Office in Preston. As an outcome of this moderation on 29 July 2008 HMRC wrote to customer operations staff at Lingmell House, Chorley, who were within reasonable daily travel of Preston, to indicate that they could be relocated to the Tax Credit Office at Preston.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_519"><a name="100323w0007.htm_para18"><a name="10032375000753">The outcome of this second moderation is invalid, as it was not carried out in accordance with the processes agreed between HMRC and departmental trade unions. These processes required that Chorley customer operations staff be moderated within their own business stream-customer operations-and were therefore not eligible to be moderated with the tax credits office in Preston. Changes to the business and staffing requirements in the Tax Credit Office in the second half of 2008 resulted in recruitment of further staff stopping, with no likelihood of future vacancies in that location.</p>

 On 15 December 2009 the Department for Work and Pensions launched its housing benefit consultation exercise: 'Supporting people into work: the next stage of Housing Benefit reform'. The consultation concluded on 22 February 2010. The Department will consider the detailed policy design of any new measures, including any changes to the calculation of local housing allowance rates, once it has considered all responses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_553"><a name="100323w0009.htm_para20"><a name="10032390000072">The local housing allowance was rolled out from 7 April 2008 and is a more transparent way of calculating the rent element of housing benefit for people living in the deregulated private rented sector. The local authority uses the appropriate local housing allowance rate, based on the area where the person lives and the size of their household, to determine the maximum amount to be included in the housing benefit calculation. This rate is currently based on the median of rents within the local area. However, customers in some areas have benefited more than others from the local housing allowance, and high rents in some areas have driven up benefit rates. As part of its consultation exercise, the Department for Work and Pensions asked its stakeholders for input into how local housing allowance rates should be set in future to ensure customers can afford decent but not luxurious accommodation.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what percentage of <i> (a)</i> the general population, <i> (b)</i> children and <i> (c)</i> pensioners in Milton Keynes was living in poverty in each year since 1997. [321868]</p>

<p><a name="st_239"><a name="10032390000130"><a name="100323w0010.htm_spnew3"><a name="10032390000401"><b>Helen Goodman:</b>
 The Government strongly believe that the best way to tackle adult poverty is through work. Those in work in the long term are better off than on benefits as training, promotion and career opportunities can enable many workers to attain a better standard of living for themselves and their families. We are therefore placing an increased priority on helping all groups of people, including disabled people and those with health conditions, lone parents and long term unemployed people get into rewarding and sustainable jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_564"><a name="100323w0010.htm_para6"><a name="10032390000131">The Government's declared aim is to eradicate child poverty by 2020. Our determination to do so is as firm as ever and this is demonstrated by introducing the Child Poverty Bill. The Child Poverty Bill will bring new impetus to eradicating child poverty by 2020. It will provide a definition of success and sets a framework to guarantee that Government and its partners at national and local levels make a clear and vital contribution towards ending child poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_565"><a name="100323w0010.htm_para7"><a name="10032390000132">Between 1998-9 and 2007-8 some 500,000 children were lifted out of relative poverty. Measures announced in and since Budget 2007 are expected to lift around a further 550,000 children out of poverty. Absolute poverty has been halved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_566"><a name="100323w0010.htm_para8"><a name="10032390000133">Addressing pensioner poverty has been a priority for this Government. We have targeted help on the poorest pensioners, those who need it most, while providing a solid foundation of support for all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_567"><a name="100323w0010.htm_para9"><a name="10032390000134">With the help of targeted support and additional funding there were 900,000 fewer pensioners living in relative poverty (after housing costs) in 2007-08 than in 1998-99.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_568"><a name="100323w0010.htm_para10"><a name="10032390000135">Estimates of poverty, published in the households below average income series, only allow a breakdown of the overall number of people in poverty at Government Office Region level. Therefore, information for Milton Keynes is not available, though figures relating to the South East Government Office Region are. These are given in the tables.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_569"><a name="100323w0010.htm_para11"><a name="10032390000136">Poverty for all individuals is presented both before and after housing costs. Child poverty is presented before housing costs and pensioner poverty is presented After housing costs, in line with the relevant Public Service Agreements. The most commonly used figures relate to those with incomes below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income for the three groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_570"><a name="100323w0010.htm_para12"><a name="10032390000137">Three-year averages are used to report regional statistics as single-year estimates are subject to volatility. Figures are quoted rounded to the nearest percentage point. The tables show the percentage of all individuals (Table 1), children (Table 2) and pensioners (Table 3) in the South East Government Office Region who have incomes below 60 per cent. of the contemporary median income.</p>

4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
5. The figures are based on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development equivalisation factors.<br>

<i> [holding answer 22 March 2010]:</i> The communal violence in 2008 was caused by a range of complex socio-economic issues. The Orissa State Government has taken a number of steps to prevent further communal violence. A draft Prevention of Communal Violence Bill to provide for the prevention and control of communal violence, the speedy investigation and trial of cases and rehabilitation of victims has been introduced to the Upper House. The State Government commissioned a judicial probe led by Justice Mohapatra to look into the causes of violence.

 The "Sex. Worth talking about" campaign highlights that there are 15 contraceptive options available, including two types of contraceptive pill. It aims to raise awareness of the longer acting methods which are more effective in typical use and are less well known among the public. The campaign is designed to encourage people to investigate all their options and to consider which method might best fit their lifestyle. It advises a discussion with a health-care professional in order to clarify these options, as medical considerations may impact an individual's final choice. It is too early to know if there has been an effect on usage of the oral contraceptive pill but the annual NHS Contraception Services Report, due October 2010, will be the first indication of any changes in the profile of contraceptive methods chosen by women.</p>

1. Data at PCT level is taken from the ePACT system (Prescribing Analysis and Cost Tool), which stores data for 60 months. Data for the final quarter of 2009 is embargoed until after the publication of the associated National Statistic in April 2010. The ePACT system covers prescriptions prescribed by general practitioners (GPs), nurses, pharmacists and others in England and dispensed in the community in the United Kingdom. For data at PCT level, prescriptions written by a prescriber located in a particular PCT but dispensed outside that PCT will be included in the PCT in which the prescriber is based. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions written in hospitals/clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals, dental prescribing and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data. It is important to note this as some British National Formulary (BNF) sections have a high proportion of prescriptions written in hospitals that are dispensed in the community.<br>
2. The BNF describes three uses for Methadone, as a cough suppressant, for analgesia and for the treatment of substance dependence. Figures for each of these have been given but the classification does not guarantee that it was used for that purpose.<br>

 The national carers strategy, "Carers at the Heart of 21st Century Families and Communities", identified the funding that was available within primary care trust (PCT) baselines to improve support for carers. A copy has already been placed in the Library. It announced that £150 million would be given to PCTs to provide carers' breaks (£50 million in 2009-10, and £100 million in 2010-11). Although this is new money, it is part of PCT baseline allocations and PCTs have not been advised of individual sums for carers' breaks.

The Competition Commission investigation of the home credit market in 2006 stated that APRs in the home credit market range from 150 to 500 per cent. One of the remedies introduced by the Commission was the requirement for all home credit providers to include their products on a website, lenders compared, to enable customer comparison of prices. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation reported that the break-even APR for a not-for-profit home credit company was between 123 and 129 per cent.

A key element of this work has been the introduction in 2008 of the new local performance framework, which aimed to lessen the burden and bureaucracy of assessment on local government, by reducing the number of performance indicators on which councils are measured from around 1,200 to 188-and replacing the old Comprehensive Performance Assessment with the new, lighter touch Comprehensive Area Assessment in April last year. We have already reduced the number of inspection days in councils by a third, while the cost of the independent inspection has been reduced by 30 per cent.</p>

We have strengthened the opportunity for local people to take action for themselves, promoting the transfer of assets from local government to local people where these could be better run for community benefits, and introducing community contracts, where residents and local agencies agree on the priorities for their area and the action both will take to achieve them. We have funded the Participatory Budgeting Unit to support local authorities in activities to involve local people in prioritising specified budgets and have increased councillors' powers to raise issues up the agenda of the local authority by introducing the Councillor Call for Action, which enables any councillor to refer an issue to the overview and scrutiny committee. We have also recently passed legislation that will give citizens greater power to hold local authorities to account and influence local services. This includes a new duty for local authorities to respond to petitions from local people; and the extension of scrutiny arrangements, enabling local people, through their councillors, to influence decisions which affect their day to day lives and give them more say over what their council is doing for them and complementing measures to increase engagement and empowerment in key local services.</p>

In addition, "Putting the Front-line first: Smarter Government" published on 9 December sets out how Government will meet new challenges and deliver better public services for lower costs by: driving up standards through strengthening the roles of citizens and civic society; freeing up public services by recasting the relationship between the centre and the front-line and streamlining central Government, saving money through sharper delivery.</p>

The NCA is then compared to the previous year's reference value increased by the caps. The minimum of these two values was used as a proxy for the bill after transition. The figure derived from dividing the total of all proxy bills for 2010-11 in the city of York by the number of hereditaments on the draft 2010 rating list used for the Department's 2010 transitional relief modelling is £16,300.</p>

 Ordnance Survey's policy for the recording of encampments and Traveller camps reflects normal data capture policy. The location of buildings, roads, tracks, hedges, fences and similar structures which meet the relevant map specifications are surveyed and recorded when they are considered to be permanent features in the landscape.
