To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what are the Government Actuary's estimates of the effect of the Budget proposal to end dividend tax credits on the ability of funded public sector pension schemes to meet their current and future liabilities; and if he will estimate the increased contributions that will be necessary for each scheme. [7403]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The position will vary from scheme to scheme depending on factors such as the type of scheme, the make up of its investment portfolio and its financial circumstances. For example, many schemes have surpluses which can be used to cushion the effect. Pension schemes should also benefit from improved company performance as a result of encouraging quality long-term investment.
<P>

<a name="70716w01.html_para4">The employers' contribution rates to each individual funded public sector scheme are determined by the funds' own actuarial adviser--not necessarily the Government Actuary. Actuarial revaluations take account of all relevant considerations, including the high returns earned by many funds in recent years, as well as the changes to dividend tax credits.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply as Director of the Office for National Statistics to your recent question on average domestic fuel costs of a state retirement pensioner household.
<BR>
Average weekly expenditure on gas, electricity and other fuels by households all of whose adult members are above minimum state retirement age is estimated, from the Family Expenditure Survey (FES), to have been &#163;10.90 in 1993-94, &#163;10.60 in 1994-95, and &#163;10.50 in 1995-96, and are estimated with an accuracy of plus or minus 35 pence.
<BR>
FES figures are in the prices of each survey year and have not been adjusted for inflation. Any comparison between these figures would need to allow for inflation.

<P>
<a name="70716w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The biennial British Crime Survey (BCS), conducted by the Home Office, already provides a regular measure of the extent of violence against both women and men in England and Wales. The next sweep of the BCS will take place in early 1998.
<P>

<a name="70716w02.html_para4">There is ongoing work by survey designers to improve the measurement of sexual and domestic violence in particular. The most recent sweep, in 1996, contained a particularly detailed component on domestic violence. The data are currently being analysed and findings will be published in due course.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
<BR>

<BR>
There were 1,580,000 incidents of contact crime (wounding, common assault, robbery and snatch theft) aimed against women during 1995. In total, 39 per cent. of violent incidents measured by the BCS in 1995 were against women.
<BR>
Women are less likely than men to be victims of all types of violence except domestic violence (defined as woundings and common assaults committed by relatives, partners, ex-partners or other household members). In 1995, 1.3 per cent. of women responding to the survey reported one or more such incidents, compared with 0.7 per cent. of men. The risks are greatest for women under thirty: 3.3 per cent. of such respondents reported a domestic violence incident in 1995 to the survey.
<BR>
0.7 per cent. of women were victims of mugging (robbery and snatch theft) in 1995. The risks were highest for younger women: 1.3 per cent. of those aged 16 to 29 had been mugged compared with 0.5 per cent. of the older age group.
<BR>
Thirty-five per cent. of violent incidents against women measured by the BCS were reported to the police in 1995. Muggings were most likely to be reported (71 per cent.), domestic incidents and other violence from people known to the victim the least likely (32 per cent. and 27 per cent. respectively).

<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Domestic violence is not a legally defined offence and the police are not currently required separately to identify domestic violence incidents in their statistical returns to the Home Office or to record the relationship between victim and offender. Crimes of domestic violence, if they reach the courts, could be prosecuted as threatening behaviour, affray, common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm, indecent assault, rape or attempted rape, threats to kill, attempted murder, manslaughter or murder. For this reason it is difficult to assess centrally exactly how many cases of domestic

<P>
<a name="70716w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 It is very important that the prison and probation services work together closely and effectively. They are both responsible for protecting the public from harm; and where prisoners are released from sentences which are served partly in custody and partly in the community they are subject to probation service supervision. There need to be the best possible arrangements for sharing information about prisoners and co-ordinating effort on risk assessment, resettlement planning and programmes directed to reducing offending and dealing with problems such as drug or alcohol misuse, which get in the way of successful rehabilitation.
<P>

<a name="70716w03.html_para1">We therefore intend to look at ways in which the better integration of the two services could improve their performance and effectiveness. I have asked my hon. Friend the member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Ms Quin) who has ministerial responsibility for both services within the Home Office, to lead this work.

Officials will send copies of the draft code of practice to a number of individuals and organisations, inviting their comments by the end of September. Copies will be placed in the Library and additional copies of the draft code are obtainable from the Home Office.

 Having consulted my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland, we intend shortly to make suitable regulations. These will build on those proposals on which consultation was completed last year and will be accompanied by a simple guidance package. We hope to lay the regulations before Parliament rises for the summer recess. I understand from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that she intends to lay equivalent regulations for Northern Ireland before the end of the year.

<a name="70716w04.html_para3">Since 1992, exceptional leave to remain has been granted to those who came from Bosnia but did not qualify for refugee status. The situation now, following the Dayton Agreement and subsequent developments, makes that policy unnecessary and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have recently said that certain categories of persons could reasonably be expected to return to Bosnia.
<P>

<a name="70716w04.html_para4">The Government share UNHCR's hope that many Bosnians will wish to return home voluntarily. However, leave will not be withdrawn from Bosnians already granted exceptional leave to remain on having been refused refugee status, or from former Yugoslavs admitted under the Temporary Protection Programme; and, subject to personal acceptability, extensions of stay will normally be granted.
<P>

<a name="70716w04.html_para5">From today, applications for asylum from Bosnians will be considered on their merits in the normal way. Exceptional leave will not be granted automatically if the application is unsuccessful, but it will be considered in individual cases where there are genuine humanitarian reasons. Those falling within the categories who UNHCR say may reasonably be expected to return home will no longer, in general, be granted exceptional leave to remain and will be expected to return home.
<P>

<a name="70716w04.html_para6">Since August 1992, as a concession, the United Kingdom has not normally sought to return asylum seekers from the former Yugoslavia to safe third countries through which they had transited, if they had spent less than a day or two in each country. Asylum applicants from the States of the former Yugoslavia will now be treated in the same way as those from other countries. This will mean that they will be returned to safe third countries where we are satisfied that the applicant is not a national or citizen of the third country concerned; the applicant would be safe in the third country concerned; and the applicant either had an opportunity to claim asylum in the country concerned or was otherwise admissible there. However, we would not normally 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 1997 : Column: 178</I><P>
remove an applicant where there were immediate family members in the United Kingdom, such as a spouse, a minor child or, if the applicant were a minor child, a parent.
<P>

<a name="70716w04.html_para7">Since December 1992, nationals of the former Yugoslavia have been granted a visa abroad where they could demonstrate that they had a claim to refugee status or had been displaced from their home as a result of the conflict and that they had close family here. In view of the improved situation in the former Yugoslavia, this concession is now being withdrawn and the normal arrangement for obtaining visas to claim refugee status in the United Kingdom will apply.
<P>

<a name="70716w04.html_para8">We have agreed with UNHCR that the temporary protection programmes announced in 1992 and 1995 are to end, although those people already accepted who can go straight into the community will continue to be allowed to take up their places. A total of 2,660 people have been brought to the United Kingdom and given temporary refuge under the two programmes.

<P>
<a name="70716w04.html_wqn4"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many decisions by his Department were challenged by way of judicial review in each Parliamentary session since 1991-92; and if he will list in how many cases <i>(a)</i> the Department's decision was upheld, <i>(b)</i> the court found for the applicant, <i>(c)</i> the Department submitted to the judgment and <i>(d)</i> the Department appealed successfully against the judicial review decision. [7841]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The detailed information requested is not readily available. The Home Office has been involved in several thousand judicial review applications since 1991-92. It is estimated that the Department's decision was upheld in more than 90 per cent. of these applications. The table below gives some information on immigration cases, which form the vast majority of all judicial review applicants brought against the Home Office.

For any given year, the total number of cases decided will not necessarily tally with the number of applications in which leave was granted, since applications may not be dealt with in the year in which they are lodged.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We have no plans to do so at present. Criminal sanctions are already available in appropriate cases. A person knowingly making a false report to the police which tends to show that they have evidence material to police inquiry may be charged with wasting police time and could be liable on conviction to imprisonment up to six months or a fine of &#163;1,000. A person making a statement to a court which is material to the proceedings and which they know to be false may be liable to conviction for perjury and could face a prison sentence for up to seven years. The more serious common law offence of perverting, or attempting to pervert, the course of justice is committed where a person acts or embarks upon a course of conduct which has a tendency to, and is intended to, pervert the course of justice. It is a matter for the prosecuting authorities to decide in any such case whether there is sufficient evidence to mount a prosecution and whether it would be in the public interest. There are around 200 prosecutions for perjury a year, of which a high proportion of cases result in convictions, as indicated in my reply to my hon. Friend on 26 June, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>574</i>.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 22 May, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>111</i>, how many outstanding claims for financial compensation for individuals found by the Court of Appeal to have been wrongfully convicted have been outstanding for <i>(a)</i> more than 12 months, <i>(b)</i> more than two years, <i>(c)</i> more than three years, <i>(d)</i> more than four years and <i>(e)</i> more than five years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 July 1997]:</i> There is a total of 149 cases outstanding where, following the reversal of a conviction, a decision to pay compensation has been taken in principle but the claim has yet to be settled. Of these, <i>(a)</i> 11 have been outstanding for more than 12 months; <i>(b)</i> 102 for more than two years; <i>(c)</i> six for more than three years; <i>(d)</i> one for more than four years; and <i>(e)</i> 16 for more than five years. By far the most significant factors in delaying a settlement in these cases

have been either delay by applicants or by their representatives in submitting final claims, or reluctance on their part to accept the offers made.<i></i><i></i><i></i>

<a name="70716w05.html_para0">The figure at <i>(b)</i> include 93 claims stemming from the quashing of a high number of drink-driving convictions in Greater Manchester following possible contamination of blood samples.<i></i>
<P>

<a name="70716w05.html_para1">I regret that in the answer I gave to my hon. Friend on 22 May, a number of these cases were overlooked: at that time the total number outstanding was in fact not 52, as given in my reply, but 106, in 54 of which representations had yet to be received from the claimants. Of the 93 such cases currently outstanding, representations are awaited from 41 and the remaining 52 are being processed.

<a name="70716w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 There are 37 executive agencies that have regional administrative structures. Of these, three have boundaries that coincide with the Government Offices for the Regions. They are Social Security Benefits Agency, Social Security Child Support Agency and Social Security Contributions Agency.

 It is the responsibility of the departmental Minister to set the framework within which the department's executive agencies are to operate and therefore to determine which matters are to be assigned to a Chief Executive under the terms of an Agency's framework document.

<P>
<a name="70716w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Erosion is a widespread, natural process which may be exacerbated by a range of causes, including land use practice, atmospheric pollution and recreational activities. Earlier this year MAFF commissioned a three year project to identify the precise causes of upland erosion and propose potential solutions. Agri-environment schemes including Environmentally Sensitive Areas, the Moorland Scheme and (in England only) Countryside Stewardship are contributing to the positive maintenance of upland habitats, including through the encouragement of extensive grazing and improved management practices.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The docking of piglets' tails is not unlawful under the Welfare of Livestock Regulations 1994 where there is evidence on the farm that injuries to animals are otherwise likely to occur. We are currently examining the application of these rules to make sure that the objective of protecting pig welfare is properly met.

 The safety of foods produced using genetic modification is assessed by the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes and is underpinned by scientific research work carried out by the Department. I see no need for the Government to commission research into the segregation or labelling of genetically modified food. The Government is pressing at European level for all foods which may contain genetically modified ingredients to be clearly labelled whether they have been fully segregated or not.

 <i>[holding answer 7 July 1997]:</i> In cases where an application has been refused solely on primary purpose grounds and an appeal is pending the Home Office will remit the papers to the Entry Clearance Officer for issue of entry clearance, subject to there being no change of circumstances. In cases where no appeal was lodged, posts will issue if further representations are made, subject to no change in circumstances. Where applicants have been refused and an appeal dismissed, applicants may re-apply for entry clearance in the normal way.
<P>

<a name="70716w05.html_para2">In fairness to those who have already re-applied, any new re-application resulting from the abolition of the Primary Purpose rule which is submitted by an individual who has already completed the appeal process will take its normal place in the queue. The maximum waiting time laid down for considering settlement re-applicants is nine months, although in practice the actual waiting time is significantly less than the maximum allowed. We shall continue to make every effort to process these re-applications quickly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on what date in 1997 the British embassy in Caracas made representations to the Venezuelan Government concerning the cases of Paul Loseby and James Miles. [8779]<P>

<P>
<a name="70716w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 No representations have been made this year. The British Ambassador in Caracas wrote to the Judge on 10 April and 10 July to request medical checks for Paul Loseby.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what plans he has for the implementation of the provisions of the Amsterdam treaty if it is not ratified by one or more of the member states. [8575]<P>

<P>
<a name="70716w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The Treaty must be ratified by all 15 Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements, before it can come into force. Should any Member State fail to ratify the Treaty, it could not be implemented in its current form.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1) if the definition of human rights, as referred to in the new article F1 of the treaty on European Union as created by the draft Amsterdam treaty, will be the same as that in the European convention on Human Rights; [8852]
<P>
<UL>(2) if the definition of human rights, as referred to in the new article F1 of the treaty on European Union as created by the draft Amsterdam treaty, will include <i>(a)</i> freedom of information, <i>(b)</i> rights to welfare, <i>(c)</i> rights for the disabled, <i>(d)</i> rights for gays and lesbians, <i>(e)</i> employment rights, <i>(f)</i> the rights of refugees and asylum seekers, <i>(g)</i> health and safety provisions, <i>(h)</i> the right to strike and <i>(i)</i> social rights; [8854]
<P>
(3) what scope there is for the definition of human rights as referred to in the new article F1 of the treaty on European Union as created by the draft Amsterdam treaty to be widened beyond the scope of the European convention on Human Rights; [8853]
<P>
(4) what is the definition of human rights as referred to in the new article F1 of the treaty on European Union as created by the draft Amsterdam treaty. [8851]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The reference to human rights and fundamental freedoms in Article F.1 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) is clarified by Article F.2 as "fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights (ECHR) and Fundamental Freedoms signed in Rome on 4 November 1950 and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law." The second part of that definition may differ from or go beyond the rights guaranteed by the ECHR. Article F.2 does not by itself confer such rights as freedom of information, welfare rights, rights for disabled people, rights for gays and lesbians, employment rights, rights of refugees and asylum seekers, health and safety provisions, the right to strike or social rights. It requires EU and Community Acts in any of those areas to respect the relevant requirements of the ECHR or other rules on fundamental rights.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans he has to ensure diversity, choice and quality in the provision of radio programming in the independent broadcasting sector.[8687]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 The Radio Authority is statutorily responsible for licensing and regulating independent radio services in the UK. The Radio Authority is already required under the Broadcasting Act 1990 to do all that it can to secure the provision within the United Kingdom of a diversity of national services, each catering for the tastes and interests different from those catered for by others, and to secure a range and diversity of local services. The Authority is also required under the 1990 Act to facilitate the provision of licensed services which (taken as a whole) are of high quality.
<P>

<a name="70716w07.html_para0">The substantial increase in the number of independent stations presided over by the Authority over the past six years has fostered diversity and choice. In my hon. Friend's constituency, for example, there are now three national and four local independent stations (including the newly awarded small-scale local licence for Huddersfield), compared with none and two respectively. Positive quality is not so readily measured, but worthwhile radio programming is not confined to the BBC; audience figures suggest that the public is satisfied with the output of the independent sector and the Authority actively monitors programming to hold broadcasters to their promises of performance and to maintain standards.

<a name="70716w08.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Goodlad: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what aid programmes for Cambodia are currently in place; and what are her future plans for aid to Cambodia. [8699]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w08.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 July 1997]:</i> Under our bilateral development programme, which will be worth some &#163;3 million in 1997-98, we are supporting projects in health, education, urban poverty and landmine clearance.
<P>

<a name="70716w08.html_para0">In health, we are financing four projects designed to improve Cambodian capacity to deliver basic health services to poorer people, improve reproductive health especially for women, reduce malaria and slow the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. In education, we are helping to improve the teaching of English in secondary schools and funding the preparation of a master plan for teacher training. In urban poverty, we are funding a UN project designed to improve physical and social conditions for poor people in Phnom Penh. We are also contributing with other donors to a UN Trust Fund which finances landmine clearance.
<P>

<a name="70716w08.html_para1">In addition, under our Joint Funding Scheme, we are helping to finance the programmes of a number of British Non-Governmental Organisations involved in areas such as health, community development, landmine clearance and support for landmine victims.
<P>

<a name="70716w08.html_para2">We are obviously concerned by recent events in Cambodia and will be monitoring the situation there closely through the British Embassy. The FCO has advised UK nationals to leave Cambodia, but our understanding is that most UK aid staff intend to stay. Given that our programme is designed to help poorer people in Cambodia, we propose to maintain it.
<P>

<a name="70716w08.html_para3">As the UK delegation at the recent Cambodia Consultative Group meeting in Paris made clear, future commitments of government to government assistance will depend not only on political stability, but also on the Cambodian Government's performance on the rule of law, transparent financial management and forestry policy. A key factor will be progress towards free and fair democratic elections scheduled for 1998.

<P>
<a name="70716w08.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 July 1997]:</i> The UK Government's objective is the achievement of human rights for all people. We welcome and support the Commonwealth's commitment to the high standards set out in the Harare Declaration. A government's commitment to human rights will therefore be taken into account when decisions are made on development cooperation. My department will focus in its main efforts on promoting the rights essential for eliminating poverty and for achieving sustainable livelihoods and dignity for disadvantaged people in poor countries. This will frequently include aspects of good government and improved institutions. We will work in partnership with government, NGOs and civil society.

 <i>[holding answer 15 July 1997]:</i> Total bilateral aid expenditure is currently expected to be about &#163;30 million in the 1997-98 financial year. It is not possible to predict the size of the programme for 1998-99 in advance of the annual Resource Allocation Round. But the level of assistance will take account of our current policy review of international development and the extent to which Britain can work in partnership with the Government of Kenya, as well as the private sector and NGOs, to reduce poverty in Kenya.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of the role of organic produce in assisting <i>(a)</i> Caribbean countries and <i>(b)</i> other developing countries to increase their international trade; and if she will make a statement. [8735]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w08.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I am keen to explore the potential for organic production in developing countries. My Department has seconded an agricultural specialist to the Delegation of the European Commission in the Eastern Caribbean to serve as Donor Co-ordinator to the Banana Industry. The Co-ordinator is working with Government and banana industry representatives on how the Windward Islands might best respond to any proposed erosion of the preferential trade agreement for bananas with the European Union. This agreement comes to an end in 2002. A range of options are being considered for improving the quality of Windward Islands' bananas and to identify niche markets.
<P>

<a name="70716w08.html_para6">Some Caribbean producers are beginning to take an interest in organic exports. The European Commission is helping farmers in the Windward Islands to consider the potential of organic production.




<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 1997 : Column: 196</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70716w08.html_para7">My Department recently commissioned a study from the Henry Doubleday Research Association and Coventry University on the potential for further development of organic agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. This study concluded that in the short-term there is limited scope for small-scale farmers in Kenya and Ghana to export organic produce. I will place a copy of this report in the Library of the House once it is finalised.
<P>

<a name="70716w08.html_para8">There is, however, considerable interest in adopting individual organic technologies which conserve resources. But, with the exception of some non-perishable crops such as coffee and tea, it would appear that, without some assistance, few resource-poor farmers will be able, in the short to medium-term, to achieve international standards of organic accreditation.
<P>

<a name="70716w08.html_para9">Through our Sustainable Agriculture Strategy my Department will work with poor farmers to develop and use technologies which conserve resources and minimise the use of agricultural pesticides. Where this is appropriate we will also help groups of farmers to achieve organic accreditation, thus increasing their incomes by exporting produce or selling to urban centres.

2. Costs are rounded to the nearest &#163;5 million, gainers to the nearest 10,000.<P>

3. The estimate for income support and jobseeker's allowance (JSA) has been combined due to difficulties in separately identifying the unemployed not in receipt of contributory benefit on the FRS.<P>

4. This is a deadweight estimate: there is insufficient information on which to estimate possible behavioural responses.<P>

5. A number of benefit units on family credit would be better off on income support/JSA as a result of this change. It is assumed that they do move onto out of work benefits, and the IS/JSA(Income Based) cost is net of the family credit saving.<P>

6. No figures are collected directly on the cost of running cars and motorcycles. Instead, costs are estimated using mileage rates (42 pence per mile for cars and nine pence per mile for motorcycles). Outlying cases have been ignored.<P>

2. Category C contributions are paid by employers and are recorded on the P14 End of Year Return when an employee has no liability due to reaching State Pension Age. They may also be paid where people have multiple employments and earnings are expected to exceed the Upper Earnings Limit for National Insurance, thus avoiding a rebate of contributions. It has been assumed that for all women in the tax year of their 60th birthday, Class C contributions arise after that birthday and therefore signal that the woman has not retired reaching State Pension Age.<P>

<a name="70716w10.html_para2">The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to provide you with some further details following the answers to your recent Parliamentary Questions asking about the policy on Benefits Agency staff giving their name during telephone calls to honourable Members and claimants and about Benefit Agency staff giving information on constituency cases to honourable members over the telephone and in writing.

<P>

<BR>
The Benefits Agency (BA) has a clear policy on the giving of names to any customer who contacts us by telephone, in person, or in writing and this is published in the BA Conditions of Service Manual. When dealing with honourable Members and members of the public, staff are required to give their name over the telephone on request. There has been no revision of this policy since its introduction in June 1992. We propose to include this service commitment in our revised BA Customer Charter which is due for publication later this year.
<BR>
The BA Parliamentary Guide provides advice to staff on giving information on constituency cases to honourable Members. Copies of the relevant extracts are attached and have been placed in the Library. The Parliamentary Guide was revised in March 1997 and is available to all staff.
<BR>
Guidance is also provided to staff on the disclosure of information to representatives acting on behalf of benefit customers, and includes reference to honourable Members. Where enquiries are received by telephone, the enquirer's name and telephone number should be taken so that their identity can be confirmed before any information is disclosed. Written requests for information from customer representatives normally include the customer's written consent, although in constituency cases it should be assumed that the customer has given their consent for information to be disclosed by the Benefits Agency. This guidance was last revised in 1994, and is available to all staff.

<a name="70716w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 An overall aim of the Government is to streamline services to provide better, simpler and more efficient services to clients. As the staffing of the Benefits Agency is a matter for Peter Mathison, its Chief Executive, I have asked him to write directly to the hon. Member and for his reply to be published with the answer.

Parliamentary approval for this expenditure will be sought in a Supplementary Estimate for Class XIV, vote 3. Pending that approval, urgent expenditure estimated at &#163;700,000 is being met by a repayable advance from the Contingencies Fund.

<i>Letter from Leigh Lewis to Mr. Terry Rooney, dated July 1997:</i>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
<BR>

<BR>
The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about advice given to Employment Service (ES) staff on giving information on constituency cases to Honourable Members. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.
<BR>
The Employment Service sets clear standards for handling telephone and written correspondence for all enquiries. The guidance is contained within two ES guides, the ES Corporate Style and ES Disclosure Guides, and in a circular on Open Government. The guidance makes clear that every effort should be made to be as helpful as possible in dealing with such enquiries.
<BR>
The ES Disclosure Guide refers explicitly to requests from Members of Parliament in outlining the parameters within which Business Managers can comply within the terms of the Data Protection Act 1984. The other guidance does not explicitly refer to MPs, but I would expect all ES staff to meet these standards in contacts with Members of Parliament and others.
<BR>
You asked about information on when this guidance was updated. The ES Corporate Style Guide was updated in March 1996, the ES Disclosure Guide in 1992 and the ES Circular on Open Government in 1994. This guidance is available to everyone working in the ES.
<BR>
More generally we encourage all Honourable Members to contact their local Jobcentre Business Manager or District Manager, who are best placed to provide a quick and informed reply on local constituency matters, whenever they need to do so.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

 In April 1996, the Department of Health launched a poster and leaflet campaign--"The Prevention and Treatment of Head Lice"--which advises families and teachers on the options for dealing with this problem. So far, over 1 million copies of the leaflet have been sent to parents, teachers and health professionals. Further guidance was included in the Department's publication, "Child Health in the Community: A Guide to Good Practice" issued in September 1996. National figures on the incidence of head louse infestation are not collected because not all cases are detected. However, the number of prescriptions for lotions to treat infestation quadrupled between 1991 and 1996 from 583,000 to 2,161,000.

 The first medicinal product for human use for a shampoo containing permethrin was granted a marketing authorisation in November 1988. This product is indicated for the treatment of head lice. Before any medicinal product can be granted a marketing authorisation, applicants must submit data which demonstrates the efficacy of their product for the indications claimed. The data are fully assessed and scrutinised by experienced clinicians at the Medicines Control Agency. Additionally, all products containing an active ingredient not previously authorised in a medicinal product are further considered by the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The CSM considered the application and the efficacy of permethrin in 1988. A marketing authorisation can be issued only if the applicant has satisfactorily proved the efficacy of the product to the satisfaction of the Licensing Authority.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, pursuant to her answer of 23 June, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>404,</i> if she will ensure that the Child Support Agency specifically sets out in every relevant letter to absent parents that part of the required periodic payment which relates to arrears. [7718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 Responsibility for this subject has been delegated to the Northern Ireland Child Support Agency under its Chief Executive, Mr. Patrick Devlin and I have asked him to arrange for a response to be given.
<i>Letter from Mr. P. Devlin to Mr. Robert McCartney, dated 11 July 1997:</i>
<P>

<a name="70716w15.html_para0">I am replying to your parliamentary question in which you asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to ensure that the Child Support Agency specifically sets out in every relevant letter to absent parents that part of the required periodic payment which relates to arrears.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
<BR>

<BR>
When a maintenance assessment is completed the absent parent is advised of the weekly amount which he is required to pay. He then receives a separate notification telling him of the method and frequency of payment. If any arrears are outstanding for the period between the effective date of the assessment and the date it is made (the initial payment period), he is also advised of this amount. He is asked either to pay this amount in full or to contact the agency to arrange an arrears agreement. If such an agreement is made the absent parent is again advised of the breakdown of his regular payment.
<BR>
Should the maintenance assessment change the absent parent is again advised of the new total to be paid and how it is made up.
<BR>
In those cases where an absent parent refuses to make an arrears agreement, or fails to keep to an agreement, he is warned that further action will be taken to recover the debt, including, where appropriate, the imposition of a deduction from earnings order. That notification shows the amount which he should have paid to date, the amount he has paid and the arrears. At that stage the amount to be included in a deduction from earnings order for arrears is not known so the notification does not include this information. The absent parent is advised to contact the agency to make an agreement and avoid the necessity of the order.
<BR>
I hope you will see from this that the Agency does its best to keep absent parents fully informed. It is also open to any client to request a statement of account at any time.
<BR>
I hope you find this information useful.

Anglia Railways has been awarded the Cycle Mark under the code of practice for its Bikes on Trains initiative. A number of other operators are also making improvements in facilities for cyclists who wish to take their cycle on the train or park it at the station. We welcome these developments.

 I am publishing the report by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch on the grounding and subsequent salvage of the tanker Sea Empress at Milford Haven between 15 and 21 February 1996 today. A copy has been placed in the Library and will be distributed by the Stationery Office. The report is open for public comment for a period of six weeks. Thereafter, the Government will issue a detailed response to the report. In the meantime, I have asked my officials to begin a review of the 1987 Pilotage Act. I have also asked Lord Donaldson of Lymington to conduct an independent review of salvage and intervention operations and their command and control, having satisfied himself that the Marine Accident Investigation Branch's report provides a reasonable basis for his review. Lord Donaldson's review will form part of the Government's ongoing review of the National Contingency Plan for Marine Pollution. The detailed terms of reference of these reviews will be announced later.

 I understand that the Water Regulations Advisory Committee is proposing that the use of non-siphonic flushing systems should be allowed in order to encourage the development of WCs with lower flush volumes. The committee is also proposing that such devices, whether manufactured in the United Kingdom or abroad, should be required to meet stringent performance specifications so that any possible leakage will be greatly outweighed by water savings from the considerable lower flush volumes that can be achieved.

 All applications for marketing authorisations for veterinary medicine products must be supported by data relating to their safety, quality and efficacy. Assessments of the data are scrutinised by the Veterinary Products Committee (VPC), which advises Ministers and has twice reviewed OP sheep dips in the last five years. On both occasions the VPC advised that, provided they are used safely and in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, there is no scientific justification for withdrawing them from the market. Any reports of human suspected adverse reactions to veterinary medicines (including sheep dips) are monitored through a surveillance scheme run by the Government's Veterinary Medicines Directorate.

during dipping and the steps that can be taken to control it and are described in leaflet AS29 "Sheep dipping". The Government have also commissioned both epidemiological and toxicological research, which continues. From the information available, it is clear that taking a large dose of OP sheep dip into the body will almost certainly result in immediate ill-health, but that it can be avoided if the proper control measures are adopted. It has also been suggested that prolonged, low-level exposure without immediate symptoms can cause chronic ill-health but scientific studies have so far revealed scant evidence for this. A major research project is however underway to investigate effects of this kind.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals he is considering to introduce a new rural business use class. [8922]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 A consultation paper was issued in July 1996 seeking views on the possible introduction of a new rural business use class. There were 291 responses, copies of which have now been placed in the Department's library. The majority of those responding felt that the new class would be very difficult to operate in practice. In particular, a wide range of concerns were expressed about the feasibility of using traffic levels to assess business intensification. Doubts were also expressed about the need for the new use class and a majority of respondents expressed support for existing planning mechanisms such as planning conditions in balancing the needs of rural businesses with environmental considerations. In the light of these comments, the Under-Secretary of State for Wales and I have decided not to proceed with this proposal or with the working group set up in February to take it forward.
<P>

<a name="70716w17.html_para3">In England, PPG7 explains how the existing provisions of the planning system can assist rural businesses. In Wales, equivalent guidance is provided in the first revision of "Planning Guidance (Wales): Planning Policy", which is being finalised for publication. Our manifesto outlines a range of wider measures which we will be taking to promote both rural and urban enterprise. The Government attach particular importance to the encouragement of sustainable development in rural areas. We want a healthy rural economy that creates employment opportunities but also respects the countryside.

 <i>[holding answer 14 July 1997]:</i> The purpose of part VI of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 is to prevent or minimise damage to the environment from the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In considering applications for consent to release GMOs, the risks to human health and the environment, including long term effects, are assessed before a decision is made. A consent is granted only if the risks of the proposed release are low or effectively zero.

 <i>[holding answer 15 July 1997]:</i> The European Commission's proposals for reform of the European Structural and Cohesion Funds after 1999 are due to be published on 16 July. Detailed proposals for amending the regulations will come at a later date and will be the basis for negotiation. This may lead to substantial changes to the current structure, including the system of objectives. It will be a Government priority to secure reform which delivers a system that is affordable, efficient, durable and fair. It is too early to estimate the likely effect on specific regions.

 Lord Simon is no longer an active member of BP's long-term performance plan. In accordance with the rules of the scheme, he gave up his active membership when he took over as Chairman in 1995. The plan continues to hold shares in trust for Lord Simon which relate to the period prior to his Chairmanship. He cannot influence these holdings in any way. These shares cannot be released under the terms of the plan before 7 May 1998 and 1 January 1999. These trigger dates relate to the required retention period in the rules for performance plans entered into before 1995.

 Identifiable costs for the TA for 1997-98 are &#163;334 million which is approximately 1.6 per cent. of the Defence Budget.

<P>

<a name="70716w19.html_para3">The allocation of funds to the TA for the next three years will be determined as part of the MOD's long-term costing which is the process by which the Department re-costs and adjusts its internal plans.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the number of military and civilian students at the Joint Service Command and Staff College <i>(a)</i> under the proposals in the defence costs study, Front Line First and <i>(b)</i> currently attending. [8193]<P>

 The current year is unrepresentative because a number of courses were cancelled or truncated to facilitate the closure of single service colleges and moves to interim JSCSC accommodation. Figures are therefore also provided for 1998.
<P>

<a name="70716w20.html_para0">All figures exclude students on ISSC distance learning courses, which are non-residential, as well as other regular and occasional courses, e.g. for Reserves. Civilian students attend the Higher Command and Staff Course (HCSC), the Advanced Command and Staff Course (ACSC) and the RN Initial Staff Course (RNISC).

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list for the Strategic Defence Review <i>(a)</i> the expected completion date and <i>(b)</i> the cost of conducting the review. [8234]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w20.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 We expect the work of Strategic Defence Review to be completed around the turn of the year. Although maximum use will be made of existing structures to conduct the review, extra costs will be incurred, including in the process of outside consultation. It is too early to predict the total additional cost.

<P>

 The Strategic Defence Review is making maximum use of existing structures. It is being co-ordinated by the Directorate of Defence Policy, but a large number of military and civilian personnel across the Department are involved in work relating to the review.

<P>
<a name="70716w20.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 It is my Department's policy to assist the work of the Department for International Development (DFID) whenever it is practicable to do so. My Department is not voted funds for this purpose and any extra costs involved are recovered from DFID. The military assets involved depend on the nature of the task; no element of our Armed Forces is specifically maintained to provide this support.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I have examined the progress of the disposal of 14 MU RAF Carlisle and am satisfied that the MOD should negotiate with the local councils over how the future use and ownership of the site can be determined to the benefit of both the taxpayer and the local economy. I believe in the special circumstances of this case that the councils should be given the option of acquiring the core of the site with the remaining outlying areas being sold on the open market.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w20.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The estimated operating costs of the Army and RAF in Germany for the current financial year are &#163;1,163 million and &#163;184 million respectively. These costs represent about 5.3 per cent. of the Defence budget in the case of the Army and 0.8 per cent. for the RAF.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w20.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Keith Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what sum is allocated to maintaining the Joint Rapid Deployment Force in the current financial year; and what it is as a percentage of the defence budget. [8184]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w20.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Joint Rapid Deployment Force (JRDF) is not a standing force. Rather, it brings together existing forces and equipment from the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force to form the most appropriate joint force for the circumstances. It is not however possible to determine what proportion of their costs might be attributable to JRDF roles, since this fluctuates over time.
<P>

<a name="70716w20.html_para1">The Chief of Joint Rapid Deployment Force Operations is the peacetime focus for the JRDF and as such is separately identifiable. He and his staff, who are embedded within the Permanent Joint Headquarters and would form the core of a deployed headquarters, together cost some &#163;1.5 million per year. As this represents only a

single, small element of the JRDF concept, it is not sensible to compare their costs to the overall Defence Budget.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on his Department's contribution to the Millennium celebrations; and what the cost to his Department will be. [8186]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w20.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 My Department intends to give the Millennium celebrations its fullest support both in the United Kingdom and, where possible, overseas. It is represented on the Millennium Co-ordinating Group chaired by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and has tabled a number of alternative proposals for consideration.
<P>

<a name="70716w20.html_para2">Until a choice has been made on the options offered, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of cost to the Department.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will assess the advantages of introducing a United Kingdom equivalent of the American Ministry for ex-Service Affairs; and if he will make a statement. [7495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w20.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Government are giving very careful and detailed consideration to the proposals for an ex-Service Affairs Unit and will be looking into the matter in some detail.
<P>

<a name="70716w20.html_para3">In doing so, we will have regard for the fact that many of the benefits offered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs are already available to ex-Servicemen in this country under the National Health Service, the War Pensions Agency and other elements of our social security system.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what environmental and safety information has been provided to his Department by those contracted to destroy outstanding British chemical weapon grenades, 9140-M6-CN-DM, held at RAF base Bad Wulfen. [4302]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70716w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Pursuant to my recent answer of 25 June regarding chemical weapon grenades <i>(Official Report, </i>column<i> 547</i>), it should have been pointed out that the grenades at BAD Wulfen were of US origin, not British, and are believed to have been abandoned at the base during a brief period of US occupation in June 1945. The British Army had no grenades of that type.
