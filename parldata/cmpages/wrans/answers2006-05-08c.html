A Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa was ratified in November 2005. A key element is the elimination of discrimination against women. DFID seeks to encourage and support African Governments in their work at country level to put this into practice. DFID has provided financial support to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), who has developed an African Gender and Development Index which shows specific gaps in the status of women at country level.</p>

This rising level of insecurity threatens to reverse progress made in 2005. Over the last four months alone, 200,000 people have been driven from their homes by the violence. The ability of the UN and NGOs to access the most vulnerable people is becoming a critical issue with no or very limited access to up to 650,000 people in Darfur.</p>

We have also increased the availability of carer's allowance by abolishing, in 2002, the age limit which precluded carers aged 65 and over from claiming carer's allowance. This change also gives older carers access to the additional amount for carers in pension credit.

This approach has been taken to allow us to consider, following the recent consultation on the development of a Supporting People strategy, how best to approach future programme grant allocations. Full programme grant allocations for all Supporting People authorities will be confirmed before the 2006 summer recess.</p>
