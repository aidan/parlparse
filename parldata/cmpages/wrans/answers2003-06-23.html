<a name="30623w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what actions the Government is taking to assist African nations to produce their own generic pharmaceutical drugs.  [119192]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w01.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The UK Government are committed to significantly improving access to medicines, both branded and generic, in developing countries. We need to work with others, including our G8 partners, to tackle the issues affecting access if we are to make lasting improvements.
<P>

<a name="30623w01.html_para0">The factors recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) that can improve poor peoples' access to medicines are: affordable pricing, sustainable financing, reliable health and supply systems, and the rational selection and use of existing drugs.
<P>

<a name="30623w01.html_para1">In line with this, since May 1997, DFID has committed over &#163;1.5 billion since 1997 to support the strengthening of health and supply systems in developing countries, which will help to build capacity to deliver medicines to the poor and to make effective choices about the selection of drugs. The UK has also pledged $280 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM). This will help pay for increased access to medicines for the three diseases and some associated health systems strengthening.
<P>

<a name="30623w01.html_para2">My predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short) chaired a High Level Working Group on Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in the Developing World, which examined the key factors above in detail. The Working Group made a series of recommendations for action, which are being taking forward by a number of other stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="30623w01.html_para3">The recent G8 Summit at Evian also secured commitment to action on these issues in line with the Working Group's recommendations.
<P>

<a name="30623w01.html_para4">With regard to generic production in particular the UK is also engaged in seeking a solution to the outstanding mandate from the Doha Declaration on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and Public Health&#151;the issue of how countries with insufficient or no manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector can make effective use of compulsory licensing procedures within the TRIPS Agreement. It is important to find a solution to this issue, both for its own sake and in order to allow the international community to focus on the many other issues affecting access to medicines.

<a name="30623w01.html_para5">On the wider question of trade and transfer of technology, within the WTO, the Doha Declaration mandated a new WTO Working Group to examine the relationship between trade and transfer of technology, including possible recommendations on steps that might be taken within the mandate of the WTO to increase flows of technology to developing countries. The UK Government takes the view that as a general rule, the transfer of technology is most effectively facilitated through the provision of open markets and good regulation.

<P>
<a name="30623w01.html_wqn1"><B> Norman Lamb: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what reports he has received on whether <i>(a)</i> the military air traffic control system sold by BAe Systems to the Tanzanian Government is in use and <i>(b)</i> a civilian air traffic control system supplied subsequently to Tanzania is now in use.  [121015]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w01.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID has received information from the Government of Tanzania and the Tanzanian Civil Aviation Authority that the air traffic control system sold by BAe Systems to them is in use. They have reported that it has dual military and civilian use.

To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development how many <i>(a)</i> small, <i>(b)</i> medium and <i>(c)</i> shared loans were provided to poor people in Andhra Pradesh as a result of Departmental programmes in each year since the project began; what the target was for these years; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w01.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Access to credit is a critical issue for many poor people in Andhra Pradesh and elsewhere in India, with indebtedness being a major cause and symptom of poverty. Over the last few years, the state government has strongly supported activities in this area, particularly the formation of women's self-help groups. More than 450,000 groups (with membership of around 6 million women) have been established in Andhra Pradesh&#151;the largest number in any state in India. These groups are centred on savings and credit, enabling the members to build up their own savings and to borrow from group funds to cover unexpected expenses eg illness, or as start-up capital for income-earning activities eg purchasing livestock. DFID is supporting this work under the Credit and Small Household Enterprise (CASHE) project, which provides funding to local organisations. The project operates in five of the poorest districts in Andhra Pradesh, and also districts in Orissa and West Bengal. The CASHE project works with around 250,000 groups in Andhra Pradesh, helping to facilitate their establishment and providing training to enable them to operate effectively. The group members keep their own records and make the decisions on the amount and number of loans that will be made from their group savings. No targets are set and no central records are kept of the transactions.

To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development how many children have been taken out of labour in Andhra Pradesh as a result 



<P>
<P><I>23 Jun 2003 : Column 533W</I><P>
of Departmental programmes in each year since the project began; what the targets were for these years; and if he will make a statement.  [120485]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w01.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Andhra Pradesh has one of the highest incidences of child labour in India. Since 2000, DFID has been supporting the International Labour Organisation's Integrated Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour (ILO-IPEC) in the state. This programme works with trades' unions, parents, employers, and non-governmental organisations to build support for eradicating child labour. It works in parallel and as a support to the state government's own efforts to eliminate child labour and to ensure that all children attend school; the government has set universal primary education as a target to be reached by 2005. It is not possible to determine how many children have been taken out of child labour by the ILO-IPEC project and how many from government's own efforts. The government has estimated that combined effect of these actions in 2002 was that almost 500,000 children were taken out of child labour.
<P>

<a name="30623w01.html_para6">In Andhra Pradesh, the Government of India's District Primary Education Programme (DPEP) includes establishing "bridge" schools for former child labourers. Children attend these schools for around four months with the aim of moving into mainstream schools at the end of the period. DFID is one of the donors supporting DPEP in Andhra Pradesh, providing up to &#163;46.5 million over 9 years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to <i>(a)</i> limit the distances that stock can travel without rest periods and <i>(b)</i> prevent animals from staying overnight at livestock markets; and if she will make a statement.  [120535]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 20 June 2003]</i>: The Government would prefer animals to be slaughtered near to the point of production and for long distance transport for slaughter to be replaced by a carcase trade. EU Commissioner David Byrne has said that he will shortly bring forward proposals to amend the current rules on animal welfare in transport including maximum permitted journey times and rest periods. Between March and May we consulted on a package of biosecurity measures for the livestock industry 



<P>
<P><I>23 Jun 2003 : Column 534W</I><P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what aid, including financial assistance, has been provided to bee farmers by her Department to help combat the threat of varroa in each of the last five years.  [119971]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 June 2003]:</i> Combating varroa as been the greatest single challenge to UK beekeeping since the mite was first detected in Devon in 1992. Defra funds a range of bee health measures to assist bee farmers and the beekeeping sector generally, the cost of which has been around &#163;1.3 million in each of the last five years. Under these measures, the National Bee Unit (NBU), part of the Central Science Laboratory, provides a free diagnostic and inspection service to beekeepers in England as well as training and technical advice to help them become more self-reliant through improved bee husbandry. In addition, the NBU has been carrying out routine screening throughout England and Wales for varroa mites that are resistant to authorised treatments, having first detected them in August 2001.

<P>
<a name="30623w02.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 There are no plans to introduce a statutory requirement to mark Dartmoor ponies. However, the Government is planning to introduce legislation by the end of 2003 which will require all equines to have an identity passport. Dartmoor ponies, the owners of which hold grazing rights on Dartmoor, will not be required to have a passport until they leave Dartmoor for the purposes of sale, slaughter or veterinary treatment. These animals will be recorded in a list held by the Dartmoor Commoners' Council. The list will record all the details which would be contained 



<P>

 I have been asked to reply.

<a name="30623w03.html_para1">The Government set out their energy policy, including action to encourage renewable energy and CHP, in their Energy White Paper, "Our energy future&#151;creating a low carbon economy", which we published in February.
<P>

<a name="30623w03.html_para2">The land use planning system promotes the use of brownfield over greenfield sites whenever possible and appropriate, but makes no distinction as to the type of development which should take place. Decisions to proceed with renewable energy or CHP developments would be made on a commercial basis, and would be subject to the local planning process. Each case should be considered on its merits taking full account of the views of the local population and the various planning and environmental considerations.
<P>

<a name="30623w03.html_para3">Developers wishing to develop in brownfield areas may be eligible to benefit from the framework of measures already in place to support renewables and CHP. Developers may, depending on the technology in question, apply for funding from our Renewable Energy R&D programme or from capital grants such as the Clear Skies Programme which is specifically targeted at smaller community-based schemes. Once operational, if the installation is using an eligible renewable source, their electrical output will be eligible for inclusion under the Renewables Obligation. The &#163;50 million Community Energy capital grant programme is another incentive for development. This three-year programme aims to increase the development and installation of community heating schemes, mainly based on CHP, across the UK.

 There are some 54 United Kingdom service men and women attached to the Iraq Survey Group. Over the next few weeks the UK contribution of military and civilian personnel will increase to between 90 and 100.
<P>

<a name="30623w03.html_para4">Investigation into Iraq's programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction remains a high priority for all coalition forces in Iraq.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The Government are very grateful to the members of the Reserve Forces who provided support to the military action against Iraq. The use of Reservists to support such operations is fully in line with the Strategic Defence Review, namely having more capable, usable, integrated and relevant reserve forces that support their regular counterparts on operations overseas.
<P>

<a name="30623w03.html_para5">As previously reported to the House, a call-out order was made on 7 January in support of Operation TELIC. Over 5,000 reservists were accepted into service in sufficient time to be deployed to the region of Iraq before the start of hostilities on 19 March. This was by far the biggest call-out since the 1950s. The call-out procedures worked well. The Reserve Forces produced the necessary manpower and skills. Some served with regular units, helping to bring units from peacetime to war fighting complements, while others served with reserve units.
<P>

<a name="30623w03.html_para6">Now that the period of combat operations is over, we are withdrawing assets and personnel where possible. However, there is still a need to maintain an appropriate military presence for as long as necessary. Thus, reservists who have a role to play in the stabilisation and rebuilding of Iraq will remain there to complete a six month deployment. In addition, others will continue to be called-out to support these activities.

<P>
<a name="30623w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Coalition forces are currently investigating Iraq's programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction, including by debriefing Iraqi prisoners of war, interviews with senior regime figures, and information from other Iraqi military and civilian sources. The breadth of such contacts means that it is not possible to quantify the number of interviews on this subject to date.

 The coalition's extensive investigations into Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are at an early stage. But we are committed to what may be a long process.

 The United Kingdom Government remain committed to making the world a safer place. This means maintaining a strong and authoritative United Nations and doing all that is practicable to promote peace, democracy and good governance. Our armed forces are involved in peacekeeping operations throughout the world, for example in the Balkans, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia/Eritrea and Sierra Leone. Acting as a force for good around the world, the UK participates both in peacekeeping operations as formally defined and contributes to other multinational operations that help maintain peace and security.

 The United Kingdom abandoned its offensive biological and chemical warfare programmes in the late 1950s. However, a number of states and terrorist groups have, or want to acquire, such weapons. The UK therefore maintains defensive capabilities against biological and chemical weapons. The UK is fully compliant with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.

 The maintenance of Boer War graves has been the responsibility of the South African Government since 1957. Since that time, the United Kingdom Government have supported the South African authorities in this task through an annual financial contribution. The basis upon which this contribution was originally calculated is not known, although it is clear that it was never intended that it should cover the full cost of maintenance. In recent years, the annual contribution has increased substantially&#151;from &#163;3,100 in 1992 to the current &#163;15,000. The Ministry of Defence holds no information on the total annual spending by the South African authorities on the sites concerned.

It is not the Department's role to direct the way in which sponsored bodies are managed but many, such as the Royal Parks Agency and the National Science Museum, are proactive and take a leading role in sustainability and biodiversity.

 In the 2002 Spending Review Settlement the Government announced plans to reach, by March 2006, at least 650,000 pre-school children living in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged wards in England through integrated children's centres. We are making available &#163;435 million over the next three years to achieve this.

 The agreement is about making better use of the existing &#163;25 billion which is spent each year on schools as well as deploying extra resources cost effectively. The overall increase in funding for schools and local education authorities is &#163;2.7 billion in 2003&#150;04. Our plans allow for a further increase of &#163;1.4 billion between this year and 2004&#150;05 and a subsequent increase of &#163;2.1 billion in 2005&#150;06. The amounts available to individual primary and secondary schools up and down the country to support the agreement will inevitably vary according to a number of factors, including pupil numbers, teachers' pay and the way in which school budgets are determined. For 2004&#150;05, we are working with representatives of schools and local education authorities (which will consider the position of schools with licensed deficit budgets) to ensure that every school receives a reasonable per pupil settlement.

 Overall capital investment is set to rise from &#163;3.8 billion this year to over &#163;5 billion in 2005&#150;06. Much of this capital investment is delivered to local authorities by formula and in accordance with their local asset management processes. It is, therefore, up to local authorities to decide on their priorities in consultation with local schools. In addition, from 2005&#150;06, we will be rolling out the proposed Building Schools for the Future programme, details of which will be announced shortly. In the meantime, we have also invested &#163;50 million over the two years 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04, specifically to address school workforce issues. This funding was allocated by formula to all local education authorities for them to address their priority needs in accommodating Schools' Workforce.

pressures this year on some school budgets he has decided to help schools manage their budgets by allowing them, in discussion with their Local Education Authorities (LEAs), to use their devolved capital funding to support their day-to-day running costs. This is to be for this year only and must be a decision taken by the school with the agreement of the LEA.
<P>

<a name="30623w07.html_para1">On 16 May 2003, my Department made detailed guidance available to schools and to LEAs to enable them immediately to discuss locally where this capital flexibility can be used. This guidance makes clear that schools which seek to use this flexibility would irrevocably forego their capital allocation. They would, therefore, lose the benefits over the longer term of the capital investment in their school buildings to pupil standards. This flexibility has an opportunity cost, and should only be used where failure to do so would lead to excessive instability within the school. We did not intend to increase the total funding available to any school.

 <i>[holding answer 17 June 2003]:</i> My Department has received a number of representations which propose the introduction of a career structure and national pay scales for school support staff, including science technicians.
<P>

<a name="30623w07.html_para3">Since the Royal Society (RS) and Association for Science Education (ASE) published their report on January 2002 we have been working closely with them and with the Consortium of Local Education Authorities for the Provision of Science Services (CLEAPSS) to develop a career structure for science technicians. The work is being taken forward in consultation with the wider scientific community and will take account also of broader advice on school support staff roles being produced by the National Joint Council for Local Government Services. We are aiming to publish guidance this autumn.
<P>

<a name="30623w07.html_para4">As part the Government's investment and reform strategy for further education and training, the new DfES Standards Unit will be trialling best-practice teaching and learning materials and teacher training in Level 3 biology, chemistry and physics this summer. The trials will lead to larger scale pilots from September and will give a real boost to science teaching and to the vital support work by science technicians.
<P>

<a name="30623w07.html_para5">The Government's position on pay remains that the terms and conditions of employment of school support staff including science technicians are best determined locally, in light of local needs and circumstances. This means that local arrangements can reflect the fact that, for example, the duties and responsibilities of technicians vary widely between schools. The National Agreement on Raising Standards on Tackling Workload, signed by the Government, local authority employers and school workforce unions on 15 January this year, will improve training and career progression opportunities for support staff and makes clear that we expect their pay to reflect their level of training, skills and responsibilities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Two schools in Colchester wrote to the Secretary of State in March 2003 about funding issues for schools with a large proportion of pupils who are children of Service personnel. There is no need for specific or additional funding from central Government for such schools. The Regulations which govern local education authority funding formulae for schools permit the use of factors which give extra funding for high turbulence levels, or compensation for significant falls in numbers on roll. The Essex formula for school funding already has a turbulence factor. If the schools believe this to be inadequate, they should seek reconsideration at local level, perhaps through the Essex schools forum.

 The total amount of debt outstanding at the end of financial year 2001&#150;02 was &#163;10,015 million. Of this total debt, &#163;1,621 million was privately owned mortgage style debt. &#163;8,394 million of the debt was publicly owned, and includes both mortgage style and income contingent loans. The debt outstanding includes loans issued but not yet due for repayment.
<P>

<a name="30623w08.html_para1">The information on future estimates is not available without disproportionate cost. Future loan liabilities will depend on a wide range of factors, including: the number and composition of students who enter higher education; the proportion of students who take up a loan; the amount of loan they take out; subsequent graduate earnings and hence future repayments; and the rate of inflation (which affects the nominal value of outstanding debt). After 2006&#150;07, loan liabilities will also depend on the fee levels charged by universities of their full time undergraduates, and the extent to which those students exercise the new option to defer those.

 <i>[holding answer22 May2003]</i>: The Sure Start Unit was allocated funding in the 2002 spending review to establish children's centres to serve 650,000 children living in the most disadvantaged wards in the country. The Government's longer term aim is to establish children's centres services for all children living in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged wards. Sure Start also funds local authorities, in all areas, to create, support and sustain good quality childcare provision through the Early Years and Childcare Grant.

 The table shows the average annual salary of full-time regular qualified teachers in the maintained sector in England by LEA at 31/3/2001. This is the latest information available. Figures cover all grades and include any allowances paid. The figures are provisional.
<P>

<a name="30623w08.html_para2">The average salary figures include some threshold payments that were made before March 2001, following the introduction of the threshold in September 2000. Some threshold assessments were not made in time for the associated payments to be reflected in the March 2001 data, but these were ultimately backdated to September 2000. As a result the figures in the table will be an under estimate of the actual average salary in March 2001.

However, the Department is committed to working with and giving young people a real say in shaping transport policy and influencing decisions for the future. The Department is due to publish an Action Plan, setting out how it intends to work better with young people to achieve this.

 As far as I am aware, neither the DTI nor the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have awarded any regeneration funding to Asda or Tesco over the last five years. Specifically, neither firm has received any regeneration funding support from the DTI in the form of Regional Selective Assistance, and neither firm has received any support from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in the form of grant aid. My officials have consulted with the Regional Development Agencies and the LDA and have been advised that none of these agencies has awarded any funding to the two retailers during the last five years.

 A number of measures are in place to maintain the network of rural post offices. These include the formal requirement placed on the Post Office in November 2000 to prevent any avoidable closures. We also have a &#163;2 million rural post office capital start up fund to support volunteer and community initiatives to maintain or re-establish a rural post office facility where the traditional post office is under threat of closure or has recently closed. Under this scheme, grants of up to &#163;20,000 are available to support the costs of relocating or refurbishing alternative premises. At the end of May 180 grants had been approved, totalling &#163;1,335,173, and payments of &#163;1,073,067 had been made nationally. I understand from Post Office Ltd. that the company is yet to receive any applications under this scheme from sub-postmasters in Morecambe and Lunesdale.
<P>

<a name="30623w10.html_para5">Rural post offices will also benefit from the &#163;450 million package of financial support for the rural post office network that I announced on 2 December 2002. And the rural network also benefits from investment in the network generally. For example, the rural network benefits from the considerable investment in the network's IT, and in new products, including universal banking services. On automation alone the Government has made the largest ever investment in the Post Office network&#151;&#163;480 million&#151;much of it on the rural network. There is no breakdown of the proportion of this funding that has been spent on supporting rural sub-post offices in the Morecambe and Lunesdale constituency.

From 1 April 2003, the new Counter Fraud and Security Management Service (CFSMS) special health authority took over lead responsibility for tackling violence against NHS staff. The programme of work they will be taking forward includes introducing a strengthened national reporting system to record incident of violence and aggression against staff using a common definition with the ability to track cases through to conclusion. This is intended to give the NHS hard and accurate information around incidents and outcomes, particularly where a criminal or civil sanction is pursed to deal with offenders.

 Independent sector diagnosis and treatment centres (DTCs) contracts will be service-based contracts and not subject to rate of return regulation: bids have been invited for given volumes of clinical activity needed by National Health Service commissioners to met 2005 waiting times targets.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his Answer of 9 June, ref.116290, if he will make a statement on the difference in the cost to a foundation hospital accessing an amount of capital via loans they will be expected to repay as compared to the charge another health organisation accessing capital through the Department of Health and strategic health authorities would have to meet for borrowing the same amount.  [118856]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The principal way national health service foundation trusts will access capital will be through borrowing from private or public lenders. The difference in cost to the NHS foundation trust of this borrowing, compared to the charges they would pay as a NHS trust accessing capital through a strategic health authority, will depend upon the interest rate at which they borrow. I anticipate that the financing facility, which the Department of Health will make available, will lend at rates not dissimilar to the prevailing rate for the National Loans Fund.

 The table shows how many ophthalmic surgical medical staff including consultant surgeons were practising in England in each of the last 11 years. Information on Scotland and Wales are matters for devolved Administration. Information for Northern Ireland is the responsibility of Ministers in the Northern Ireland Office, while the institutions there are dissolved.
<P>

<a name="30623w13.html_para11">Consultants in ophthalmology have increased by 18 per cent. between September 1997 and March 2002. We expect to see further increases in the number of trained specialists available to take up consultant posts. Latest projections suggest that there will be around 820 consultants in ophthalmology by September 2004. This is part of the substantial planned expansion of the consultant workforce.
<P>

<a name="30623w13.html_para12">As part of our radical approach to free up the training system in 2003&#150;04, trusts will have the opportunity to fund up to 40 additional training posts in ophthalmology. This will support further increases in consultant numbers.

 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued guidance on the use of newer (atypical) antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia in June 2002. It is recommended that atypical antipsychotics should be considered as options for the treatment of schizophrenia. The clinician responsible for prescribing the medication should do so following appropriate assessment of the patient and taking into account the views of the patient (or their advocate if appropriate), and the relative benefits and side effects. The statistics currently available on the use of atypical antipsychotics indicate a continuing rise in the prescribing of these products, but no estimates are available of the number of patients who may not be receiving treatment in accordance with NICE guidance.

We will include this as part of our dialogue with the Kenyan Government on human rights issues. We are also, through our High Commission in Nairobi, supporting Kenyan civil society organisations, such as the Kenya Land Alliance, which seek to address the problem of women's property rights and advocate a fairer and more transparent land policy.

The main reason for these increases is that fees, which where set before the service was operational, have been found to be unrealistically low.

<a name="30623w18.html_para7">These figures include those applications that have been returned to the customer for additional information or further documentary evidence. Essex county council has been notified of these applications and until this information has been received, the Criminal Record Bureau (CRB) cannot process these applications. The CRB has undertaken several initiatives recently to reduce the number of aged applications in the system that are causing delays to other applications. The number of applications outstanding over 10 weeks and six months are reducing week by week. The Bureau continues to improve its output and anticipates that the number of aged applications will be reduced to no more than 5 per cent. of work in progress by September 2003.

<i>[holding answer 11 June 2003]:</i> On 31 March 2003, there was one man and no women in Prison Service establishments in England and Wales for defaulting on the payment of a fine for using a television without a licence. This represents 0.001 per cent. of the male prison population in England and Wales.

<P>
<a name="30623w20.html_spnew7"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 In July 2002 we started a phased implementation of special measures to assist vulnerable or intimidated witnesses to give their best evidence. Vulnerable witness&#151;who are defined by section 16 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 as being persons (not the accused) who are aged under 17 years or whose quality of evidence would be diminished by reasons of a mental disorder, or impairment of intelligence and social functioning, or a physical condition or disorder&#151;can now apply for the following special measures in the Crown Court:

<a name="30623w20.html_para4">The magistrates' courts, implementation has been limited so far to live link and video recorded evidence in chief for witnesses aged under 17 in certain categories of case, including sexual and violence offences. Further rollout of the special measures is planned for 2003&#150;04 following evaluation of the first phase.
<P>

<a name="30623w20.html_para5">Two of the special measures&#151;video recorded pre-trial cross-examination and examination of the witness through an intermediary&#151;are novel and complex and will be the subject of pilot projects before they are introduced nationally. Preparations are being made for intermediary pilots to begin later this year. A scoping study on options for piloting video recorded pre-trial cross-examination will be commissioned shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to set up a national Women's Justice Board.  [119444]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w20.html_spnew8"><B> Paul Goggins </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 June 2003]:</i> We have no plans to establish a separate Board with specific responsibility for women. The Correctional Services Board was established last year to set the overarching strategy for the correctional services and to identify key strategic issues. Within its remit the Board considers how correctional services could be improved to meet the needs of particular groups. The Board's focus so far has been on services for 18 to 20-year olds, but with a view to expanding it to include other groups, which could include women.
<P>

<a name="30623w20.html_para6">We also have the national Criminal Justice Board, with ministers and senior representatives (including agency chiefs) from across the criminal justice system (CJS), who support the delivery of the CJS Public Service Agreement targets on the justice gap and confidence. The Board has specific responsibility for combating inequality and discrimination within the CJS.
<P>

<a name="30623w20.html_para7">The Government are also responding to the need to improve services and provision specifically for women in the criminal justice system, through the Women's Offending Reduction Programme. This promotes gender consideration in the delivery of services, programmes and other interventions and encourages departments and agencies to work together to tackle the factors that affect women's offending.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how much funding has been allocated for teaching autistic children by applied behaviour analysis in each of the five education and library boards in the last five years; and how many children in each board have been taught by the ABA programme in the last five years.  [117790]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w21.html_spnew1"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 It is not possible to quantify the total funding of ABA (Applied Behavioural Analysis) provision in schools for the last five years, as this cannot be separated from other elements of educational intervention, provided on a day-to-day basis, for children with an autistic spectrum disorder.
<P>

<a name="30623w21.html_para2">Education and library boards support pupils with an autistic spectrum disorder in their areas in a variety of appropriate ways. An eclectic approach using a range of methods is used and this accords with the recommendations of the Task Group Report on Autism. These methods will include aspects of TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic Children and those with related Communications Handicaps), PECS (Picture Exchange Communication Systems) and ABA.
<P>

<a name="30623w21.html_para3">In addition, all educational psychologists are trained in ABA techniques as part of their degree qualification.
<P>

<a name="30623w21.html_para4">The Belfast Education and Library Board and the South-Eastern Education and Library Board are each currently funding four children on specific ABA programmes at an average cost of over &#163;13,000 per child, per annum.

<a name="30623w23.html_para1">As regards the legislative changes, a Statutory Rule, which came into operation in June 2002, removed certain permitted development planning rights from telecommunications code system operators.

Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that has fully implemented this recommendation. The much stricter ICNIRP public exposure guidelines have now also been adopted throughout the UK.

 I was comprehensively briefed on all of the conservation and heritage aspects of this proposed retail scheme prior to making my decisions.

<a name="30623w23.html_para13">In assessing the proposal, I concluded that the regeneration benefits to the City Centre, in line with the Regional Development Strategy and the Belfast Urban Area Plan, outweighed the loss of the Kitchen Bar and other buildings in the Conservation Area, and that, on balance, the regenerative benefits to the City Centre outweighed the losses to the built heritage.
<P>

<a name="30623w23.html_para14">Regeneration of the City Centre through investment will, by breathing life into areas in decline, provide a firmer foundation for revitalising and securing the future of the City Centre's built heritage.

Prior to 1995, notification of babies to the National Congenital Anomaly System (NCAS) was confined to 10 days from birth. The removal of this restriction resulted in an increase in the notifications of all congenital anomalies in 1995. Reporting to the NCAS is voluntary and since 1998 regions with local registers have exchanged information with the NCAS, leading to more complete notification. This has resulted in a large increase in notification rates for several types of anomalies since 1998.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w25.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many frontline Customs officers will be remaining in Wales following the proposed operational changes to primary use of the National Strike Force; and where they will be based.  [118541]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w25.html_spnew0"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Modern criminals are well orgainised, well financed and highly adaptable and use ever more sophisticated methods. To tackle them, Customs is continuing to develop a more skilled, flexible and keenly targeted organisation, replacing predictable and often unproductive activities.
<P>

<a name="30623w25.html_para0">Under Customs proposals, a permanent law enforcement presence will be maintained at Holyhead, Swansea and Cardiff. Customs law enforcement activity throughout Wales and the West Midlands will be by targeted, flexible and less predictable attendance, in variable numbers, drawn from a contingent of approximately 100 Detection and 215 investigation officers based in Wales: Bristol and the West Midlands. They will be directed and supported by intelligence resources located within analytical teams, joint intelligence cells and central teams based in Wales, elsewhere in the UK and in key strategic locations overseas. Over and above the purely regional resources in Wales and the West Midlands, Customs can call on additional resources from the 120 strong National Strike Force. This capability to conduct intelligence-based targeted operations of greater intensity will help provide a real deterrent to serious criminals&#151;not only professional smugglers and bootleggers&#151;and will better safeguard communities throughout Wales.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w25.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Over the past two years, the Customs Officers based at Swansea and at Pembroke have not detected any illegal immigrants at Swansea. Last year Customs teams based in Pembroke took part in a 3-day exercise with HM Immigration at Fishguard during which a number of illegal immigrants were detected.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w25.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many Independent Financial Advisers are operating in the United Kingdom; and how many Independent Financial Advisers had confirmed that they had obtained professional indemnity cover, as at 30 May 2003.  [119844]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Financial Services Authority (FSA) tell me that between 1 September 2002 and 31 May 2003 2,911 Independent Financial Advisers (IFAs) were due to renew their Professional Indemnity (PI) cover. 2,001 IFAs have confirmed that they have done so and 116 have been granted a waiver of the requirement to have PI cover because they have adequate resources.
<P>

<a name="30623w25.html_para1">The FSA is in discussion with the other firms, and works with them to find a solution in light of their individual circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30623w25.html_para2">IFAs may be reluctant to confirm that they have PI cover until they have a policy document, even if they have agreed terms. This means that the reported position can appear less positive than it is.
<P>

<a name="30623w25.html_para3">Last month the FSA authorised a new insurance company that intends to provide cover for IFAs. The FSA also published a consultation paper on its future PI policy in February 2003 and is currently analysing the responses. The FSA is in ongoing discussions with IFAs, PI insurers, PI brokers and other interested parties about the situation in the PI market.

<P>
<a name="30623w25.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Howard: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list the occasions since January 2000 in which a HICP target of 2 per cent. plus or minus 1 per cent. would have failed to have been met, and would have occasioned a letter from the Governor of the Bank of England; and what conclusions he draws about such a target for the conduct of UK monetary policy.

<P>
<a name="30623w25.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 19 June 2003]:</i> The Monetary Policy Committee's target since 1997 has been RPIX inflation of 2&#189; per cent. Since 1997 the Governor has not had cause to write a letter because inflation has not deviated from the target by more than 1 percentage point.
<P>

<a name="30623w25.html_para4">In his statement on 9 June, the Chancellor said that, the advantage of the internationally recognised index of consumer prices&#151;HICP&#151;is that it is a better measure, will improve the quality of our target, is in line with best international practice and is used by every other G7 nation but Japan and by our neighbours in Europe.

 Following a Cabinet Office Review, which reported in November 2002, into the organisation of controls on products of animal origin, fish, plants and forestry products, responsibility for anti-smuggling activities relating to illegal imports of meat arriving from third countries was transferred to Customs on 11 April.

<sup>(44)</sup> The cause of death for intentional self harm was defined using the International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes E950-E959 for the years 1997 to 2000, and, for the year 2001, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes X60-X84.<P>

<P>

<sup>(45)</sup> The cause of death for injury undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes E980-E989 excluding E988.8 for the years 1997 to 2000, and, for the year 2001, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10 codes Y10-Y34 excluding Y33.9 where the Coroner's verdict was pending. It is assumed likely that most of these deaths at ages over 13 are cases where the harm is self-inflicted but there was insufficient evidence to prove that the deceased deliberately intended to kill themselves. As there were no intentional self harm deaths on children under the age of 13, data for undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted have not been included.<P>

<P>

<sup>(46)</sup> Figures are for deaths occurring in each calendar year from 1997 to 2001.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w26.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Stephen O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the Government's policy on controlling risk in financial markets in the UK.  [117679]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government established the Financial Services Authority to regulate the operation of financial markets in the UK, including how they manage risk. The Financial Services Authority also working through a standing Committee, has joint responsibility along with the Bank of England and HM Treasury for addressing issues which may have implications for financial stability in the UK.

<a name="30623w26.html_sbhd1"><H3 align=center>Sunset Clauses</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w26.html_wqn1"><B> Bob Spink: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make it his policy to include a sunset clause in all new legislation promoted by his department unless a specific case can be made to exclude a sunset clause.  [120755]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 It would be inappropriate to include a sunset clause in all legislation. The need to legislate repeatedly on the same subject matter would increase uncertainty for those who are affected by the legislation. The use of sunset clauses is therefore best assessed on a case-by-case basis.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w26.html_wqn2"><B> Jim Knight: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the proposed changes to the national scheme to refund national museums and galleries the VAT they incur on purchases when they allow free admissions to the public, originally noted in Budget 2001, HC279, paragraphs 5.97 and 5.98.  [121065]

<P>
<a name="30623w26.html_spnew2"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Section 33A VAT refund scheme for those main national museums and galleries to which the Government are committed to ensure free access came into effect in September 2001. Paragraph 5.87 of the 2002 Economic and Fiscal Strategy report (HC 592) described the success of the scheme in achieving free access to all those main national museums and galleries. The scheme is continuing to operate successfully and there are no plans to change it.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w26.html_wqn3"><B> Jim Knight: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what implications the recent judgment of the European Court of Justice in the case Customs v the Zoological Society of London (Case C-267/00) has for the way zoos, museums and similar bodies are required to account for VAT on their admission charges; and whether Customs has issued guidance on this issue.  [121066]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w26.html_spnew3"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 HM Customs and Excise are assessing the impact of this judgment. In the meantime, Customs will continue to look into the circumstances of any individual bodies who feel they may be affected by this judgment on a case-by-case basis. Guidance on the exemption from VAT for these bodies is contained in Customs' Public Notice 701/47, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the total expenditure on advertising by the Department was in <i>(a)</i> 2001&#150;02 and <i>(b)</i> 2002&#150;03; and what the level of planned expenditure is for (i) 2003&#150;04 and (ii) 2004&#150;05.  [114439]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w26.html_spnew4"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Department for Work and Pensions has spent the following sums on advertising to inform the public on its rights, entitlements and responsibilities: &#163;11.3 million in 2001&#150;02 and &#163;8 million in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="30623w26.html_para0">For 2003&#150;04 the figure for major advertising campaigns is likely to rise. This is because a number of key welfare reforms will start to impact directly on the public during this year and campaigns are needed to ensure that the public are aware of their rights and responsibilities. These are expected to include: Pension Credit, Direct Payment, New Deal targeting benefit fraud.
<P>

<a name="30623w26.html_para1">However media schedules are currently being finalised so it is not possible to give figures at this stage.
<P>

<a name="30623w26.html_para2">We are currently planning advertising for 2004&#150;05 and are as yet unable to give indicative costs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what consultations he <i>(a)</i> has had and <i>(b)</i> plans to have with independent housing advice agencies about their engagement in the new advice services for older people.  [115526]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w26.html_spnew5"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Department has been in contact with many service providers, eg Department of Health, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, local authorities and the voluntary sector (Age Concern, RNIB, Citizens Advice) assessing current services and identifying opportunities for integration. There have been consultations at a national level with Shelter and Citizens Advice, and meetings are on-going to ascertain the views of as many interested parties as possible.
<P>

<a name="30623w26.html_para3">At a local level, The Pension Service are currently engaged with a number of information and advice providers on housing related matters in relation to the Supporting People initiative. Over the coming months we would expect this involvement to strengthen and deepen.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w26.html_wqn6"><B> Sir Sydney Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if it is his policy to make regular deductions from benefits payments of people in receipt of certain benefits <i>(a)</i> to repay debt and <i>(b)</i> to pay for current energy consumption.  [120594]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w26.html_spnew6"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The Third Party Deduction Scheme provides protection as a last resort for vulnerable people with fuel debt who are threatened with the disconnection of a fuel supply.
<P>

<a name="30623w26.html_para4">Deductions may be made from income support or, in some cases, from jobseeker's allowance, for both arrears and current fuel consumption. These deductions are paid direct to the fuel supplier until the debt is cleared. Where people have a history of chronic mismanagement of fuel or utility bills, deductions may continue for current consumption. Either the benefit recipient who has accrued fuel arrears or their supplier may ask to take part in the scheme.

<P>
<a name="30623w26.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Calton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to his answer of 3 June 2003, ref 115520, what plans he has to institute mechanisms for the collection of information on <i>(a)</i> the numbers of claimants delayed from claiming benefits in the previous 12 months because the nature of their incapacity prevented them from claiming and <i>(b)</i> how long that delay was.  [118237]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w26.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 There is a three-month time limit for claiming incapacity benefit, and a rule whereby a claim for income support can be backdated for up to three months where the person making the claim is ill or disabled (and it has not been reasonably practicable to obtain help in making the claim earlier). These rules make the system relatively simple to operate and for people to understand, while also emphasising the importance of people making their claims promptly.
<P>

<a name="30623w26.html_para5">We have no plans to extend benefit claim forms in order to gather information about those for whom there has been a delay in making a claim. However, we are in the process of amending the claim forms for incapacity benefits (SC1, SSP1 and IB (Y)) to include more information about the time limits for claiming.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the rules on buying-back past years of full national insurance contributions for married women who have paid the reduced rate.  [119923]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w27.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Where the National Insurance Contributions Office decides that a married woman seeking advice from departmental officials about her National Insurance contribution choice was given wrong information which led to her electing to pay reduced-rate contributions when it was not beneficial for her to do so, it is their policy to place the woman in the position she would have been if this advice had not been given. This means that she may pay full rate contributions for the affected years. In other circumstances, it is not possible for married women to buy back past years of full rate contributions for periods when they had a valid reduced rate election.
<P>

<a name="30623w27.html_para4">The married women who opted to pay reduced rate contributions made an informed choice. They were required to give written notice of their decision on a form attached to a leaflet. The leaflet went to great lengths to describe the consequences of that decision and required them to sign a declaration that they had read and understood the leaflet. Employers could not make this decision on behalf of their employees. Women who chose to pay reduced rate National Insurance contributions were given a certificate to give to their employer. An employer was not allowed to deduct reduced rate National Insurance contributions without this certificate. It would be unfair to those married women who chose to pay the full rate contribution to retrospectively put married women who paid the reduced rate contribution in the same position.

 The Children Act Sub-Committee (CASC) of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Board on Family Law under lord justice Wall published a report last year called "Making Contact Work". The report made a number of recommendations in relation to enforcement of contact orders. This included consideration of the power to impose a community service order when a parent failed to comply with a contact order. As part of the Government's work on responding to the report's proposals, a stakeholder group on facilitation and enforcement of contact was established in June 2002. The group has been considering ways in which parents can be supported to reach workable agreements, how contact might positively be achieved, as well as how enforcement mechanisms can be made more effective. It is anticipated that a full response to the CASC report's recommendations will be published later this summer.

 The move into administration of the Accident Group (TAG) represents a significant individual business failure but it will not prevent people with genuine claims obtaining access to justice. They can do so either by approaching solicitors firms direct or via other accident intermediaries. The Government believe that the personal injury market is able to absorb the loss of TAG as it did previously after the failure of Claims Direct last year and to pick up the bulk of the business.
<P>

<a name="30623w28.html_para2">Many solicitors have or are forming large marketing networks to pool expertise, raise awareness among consumers and to provide a better service. New intermediaries entering the market are able to do so with better knowledge of how the market works and what lessons need to be learnt from recent business experience. Those who provide funding for intermediaries and after the event insurers are now better placed to ensure adequate due diligence checks are carried out on new business models and existing operations are thoroughly audited.

For this reason, and following informal consultations with the Electoral Commission, electoral administrators and the political parties, we have concluded that the sub-administrative unit for conducting the European Parliamentary elections (including the count) in Great Britain in 2004 should be the local authority area rather than the parliamentary constituency.

conviction of certain offences, He does so by paying by the charge specified in a fixed penalty notice issued by a police constable and, for an endorsable offence, by submitting his licence for endorsement with the prescribed number of penalty points. The constable remains able to report for prosecution instead of issuing a fixed penalty notice, if in any particular case he considers that more appropriate, and the driver remains free to opt for prosecution rather than pay the fixed penalty.
<P>

<a name="30623w28.html_para5">The provisions of the system are set out in Part III of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, as amended by the Road Traffic Act 1991. Under section 54(3)(b) of the Act, a police constable can offer a fixed penalty only when he is satisfied that the driver, if prosecuted and convicted, would not be liable to disqualification for exceeding the permitted number of penalty points. Should a fixed penalty notice be mistakenly issued in contravention of section 54(3)(b), section 61 of the Act applies. This provides that when the driver delivers his licence for penalty point endorsement and it appears to the fixed penalty clerk that conviction would involve liability to disqualification, the licence must not be endorsed. Instead, it will be returned to the police with a view to the driver's prosecution.
<P>

<a name="30623w28.html_para6">The courts are involved only where a driver is prosecuted. When cases come to court and there is a conviction, the magistrates will decide the appropriate penalty in each case in accordance with its particular circumstances. Guidelines from the Magistrates Association suggest starting points for sentences, which can be increased or decreased depending on the means of the offender and on any mitigating or aggravating features in individual cases.

</FONT></UL>
<a name="30623w29.html_para2">The OSS has produced robust management information that shows how they intend to build on their performance over the next 3 years in order to reach and exceed acceptable standards overall.

This amounts to &#163;345,000 over three years. The initiative aims to create 2,000 new volunteering opportunities by June 2004 and provide public access to electronic pro bono advice.

 The Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002, which contains wide-ranging provisions to improve leaseholders rights, includes provisions that will protect leaseholders from ground rent abuses. These provide that a leaseholder will not be liable to pay ground rent unless the landlord has sent a written demand in a prescribed format. They also provide that the landlord cannot take forfeiture action unless a breach of the lease has been admitted, or determined by a Leasehold Valuation Tribunal. In addition, a landlord cannot take forfeiture action for amounts which are less than a sum to be prescribed by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister&#151;unless the amount has been outstanding for more than a prescribed period. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister aims to bring these provisions into force in early 2004.

 Local authorities annually report the numbers of households on their housing register (excluding tenants awaiting a transfer) as at 1 April. Their activities under the homelessness provisions of the Housing Acts are reported on quarterly returns and include the number of households accepted as homeless and in priority need during the quarter, along with the number in temporary accommodation on the last day of the quarter. A summary of this information is available in the Library in the Library of the House.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what recent representations he has had from the National Housing Federation regarding the supply of affordable social housing in the south-east region; what response he has made; and if he will make a statement.  [120726]<P>

<P>

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has not had any recent representations from the National Housing Federation (NHF) about the supply of affordable housing in the south-east.
<P>

<a name="30623w30.html_para7">The NHF is an important partner in the region, and is represented on the Regional Housing Board in a non-executive capacity. There is regular dialogue between my officials at the Government Office for the South East and the NHF on affordable housing and other housing and regeneration issues, and the NHF also plays an active role within the Regional Housing Forum.
<P>

<a name="30623w30.html_para8">The NHF in the south-east led a working group on affordable housing for the last Regional Housing Statement, which was published in February 2002, and have also been actively involved in working towards the new Regional Housing Strategy to be published in July 2003. It is expected that the NHF will make a full response to the consultation on the first draft of the strategy, which ends on 7 July 2003, and this is likely to include comments on affordable housing in the region.

 In general, planning applications should be determined in accordance with adopted plans.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w30.html_spnew14"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Development plans form the framework within which decisions on proposals for development are taken. It is therefore important that plans are kept up to date and properly reflect national and regional policy guidance.
<P>

<a name="30623w30.html_para9">Planning Policy Guidance Note 3, "Housing" (PPG3), explains that local planning authorities should revise their plans to take account of the guidance set out in PPG3, and that they should seek to do so as quickly as possible by incorporating revised policies and proposals either in replacement plans or by alteration of existing housing policies. In considering planning applications for housing development in the interim, before development plans can be reviewed, local authorities 



<P>
<P><I>23 Jun 2003 : Column 645W</I><P>
should have regard to the policy contained in PPG3 as a material consideration which may supersede the policies in their plan.
<P>

<a name="30623w30.html_para10">Proposals to develop any greenfield land for housing which, in themselves or as part of a wider but contiguous allocation for housing, relate to a site of five hectares or more, or comprise 150 dwellings or more regardless of size of site, and which the local planning authority resolves to approve, should be notified to my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister before permission is granted. The notification provides an opportunity to check general compliance with the guidance set out in PPG3, and to consider whether an application should be called in for his own determination.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many affordable houses have been built in each year since 1997 in the Romsey constituency; if he will list each development and the cost; and if he will make a statement on plans for the future.  [120439]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w30.html_spnew15"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 154 Affordable houses have been built in the Romsey Constituency during the period 1997 to 2003, with another 78 planned for 2004&#150;05. Details are tabled together with site details and Grant cost.
<P>

<a name="30623w30.html_para11">The "Sustainable Communities: building for the future" document published in February 2003 set out the Government's future housing plans. The housing challenges addressed within the document and through the programme of activity vary across the regions. The Regional assemblies (Preparation) Act 2003 will allow devolution of responsibility for housing to regions that opt for Elected Regional Assemblies. Steps have already been taken to ensure that housing policies can be better integrated with planning and economic strategies at a regional level, to ensure sustainable communities.
<P>

<a name="30623w30.html_para12">Regional Housing Boards have been set up in each region to ensure delivery of policies and they are charged with producing a Regional Housing Strategy as a basis for advice to Ministers on strategic housing investment priorities in the region.
<P>

<a name="30623w30.html_para13">Each region has been asked, by July 2003, to have a Regional Housing Strategy at least in outline form and be in a position to make recommendations on the allocation of resources for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06. In the south east region a draft regional housing strategy has recently been widely distributed as a consultation document with comments requested by the end of June 2003.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects over 5,000 homes to be approved in small rural settlements alone between 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06. As announced in the Sustainable Communities Plan, the Housing Corporation's rural target to approve a total of 3,500 affordable homes for both low-cost rent and ownership over the years 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 in settlements with fewer than 3,000 people is being increased. This builds on the Rural White Paper commitment for the Housing Corporation to approve 1,600 homes in small settlements annually by 2003&#150;04, double the number in 2000&#150;01. Under the new regional arrangements, it will be for Regional Housing Boards to consider rural housing needs in advising on the allocation of resources.
<P>

<a name="30623w30.html_para15">In January, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister made it easier for local authority landlords to restrict resales of homes in rural areas originally sold under the Right to Buy scheme. A buyer who wants to resell must either:

 The next actuarial valuation exercise of Local Government Pension Scheme pension funds takes place, as required by the Scheme's governing regulations, on 31 March 2004. The outcomes of that exercise will, therefore, not be known until later in the financial year 2004&#150;05. No actual expenditure consequences for contributing employers can come into effect until 1 April 2005 at the earliest.

<P>
<a name="30623w31.html_spnew2"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill does not provide for local planning authorities to take over the county council's strategic planning role. The abolition of structure plans as provided for by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill does not mean that county councils will no longer have any strategic planning role in the reformed system. They have continuing and important service delivery responsibilities, which need to be reflected in the new spatial regional and local plans as well as retaining their minerals and waste planning responsibilities. They will be statutory consultees in relation to both levels of plan-making, can be partners in the production of joint local development documents under the Bill and can be appointed as agents of the regional planning bodies as appropriate in the exercise of the duties as set out in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30623w31.html_para0">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has issued transitional guidance in the form of supplementary planning guidance to PPG11. This guidance provides for structure plans to be saved for a period of three years, provided they have reached deposit by commencement of the Act or adoption, whichever is later.

 The provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 place restrictions on the disclosure of personal data. Publication of the remuneration of public officials for whom the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is responsible would, therefore, be affected by this Act. Paragraph 12 of Part II of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information also exempts personal information about an individual from the commitment to provide information under the Code. Paragraph 8 exempts personnel records (which would include details of remuneration) of employees of public authorities.

[120719]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30623w31.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government have not issued guidelines on the financial relationship between local authorities and regional chambers or other regional bodies. Use of local authority subscriptions to fund regional chambers is a matter for the parties concerned and the Government have made no estimate of the amounts involved. Local authorities need to have regard to the terms of the Code of Practice for Local Government Publicity, which my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has issued under section 4 of the Local Government Act 1986.
<P>

 There is no Chancellor's Fund for the English regions. No decisions have yet been taken on future allocations of the planning delivery grant to regional planning bodies. For 2004/05, the distribution of the further &#163;6 million regional planning moneys is likely to be on the same basis as the allocations for the current financial year but has yet to be discussed with the regional planning bodies. The moneys allocated for this year should be drawn down against a business plan identifying planning objectives in accordance with which moneys can be varied between different cost headings.

 All the English Regional Chambers have decided to take on regional planning responsibilities. Under clause 2 of the new Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill it is proposed that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister should be able to give directions recognising such regional planning bodies. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's policy as set out in the Planning Green Paper, "Planning: delivering a fundamental change", published in December 2001, is that these bodies should be representative of key regional interests and not just local authorities. There will be public consultation on the draft regulations prescribing which regional planning guidance should become regional spatial strategies (RSSs). Future revisions to RSSs will be subject to extensive public consultation and engagement with the safeguard of an examination in public. Anybody who is aggrieved by a draft RSS revision will be able to make representations to my right hon. the Deputy Prime Minister.

 In London and the south-east housing demand continues to outstrip supply. Delivery of annual rates in Regional Planning Guidance for the South East (RPG9) for the 15 years from 2001 to 2016 would provide for 930 thousand households. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's latest household projections, published in October 1999, show that in the RPG9 area the number of additional households likely to form over these years is 1.1 million.
<P>

<a name="30623w32.html_para0">In 2001 RPG9 identified four areas for potential housing growth; Ashford, the Thames Gateway, Milton Keynes and South Midlands, and the London-Stansted-Cambridge corridor. These areas were chosen as all were considered to have the potential to accommodate significant further growth, within sustainable communities, and the growth area studies were commissioned to evaluate this. The additional growth in these areas will make better use of land and will reduce the amount of greenfield land required for future growth.
