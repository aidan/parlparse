<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50614w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The Controller of Her Majesty&#039;s Stationery Office (HMSO) within the Cabinet Office is the Queen&#039;s Printer of Acts of Parliament, and responsible for the publication of Acts of Parliament. HMSO has considered the publication of Acts prior to 1988, which is the earliest date when these were available electronically, but has decided not to do so as many have been heavily amended and to publish them in their original form would be misleading for many users. The Government are, however, taking forward development of a Statute Law Database which will contain the fully revised and updated text of all legislation from 1275. It is expected that this will be made available to the general public during 2006.

 We are carefully considering the recent recommendation of the Spoliation Advisory Panel that legislation should be introduced to permit the return of items where possession was lost during the Nazi era.

For many halls the fees would be &#163;100 and &#163;70 respectively. Once granted a premises licence, village halls will have the flexibility to provide licensable activities on their premises to a wide variety of users.

New and/or redeveloped markets will include the one now being built at Cirencester which is p art funded by the Defra Rural Enterprise Scheme. In other markets there may be opportunities for business diversification. We continue to monitor the network of auction markets, and remain in regular contact with the Livestock Auctioneers Association and the Meat and Livestock Commission.

 Canada geese were introduced to this country to add interest to parks and are another example of unwise introductions. They are large aggressive birds, now resident and breeding in Britain. The population estimate is 96,000 in England, with a suggested annual increase in population of 10 per cent. Its size and aggressive nature enables it to dominate other native species in terms of feeding and nest site selection, which can result in other species being unable to breed. There are also reports that breeding success of other birds is affected by trampling of nests, eggs and young. The Canada goose can also interbreed with other goose species, resulting in hybrids.

 There have been no meetings between Ministers at the Department, Network Rail and the Health and Safety Executive to discuss the siting of whistleboards. The railway industry has a duty under health and safety legislation to ensure that risks to those on or near railway lines are reduced. The location of whistleboards is the responsibility of Network Rail, who apply the requirements laid down by the Health and Safety Executive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50614w05.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_43">Train drivers are required to sound train horns where whistleboards are located: on the approaches to footpath crossings and at unprotected crossings, in order to alert pedestrians to approaching trains. This is an important safeguard for those using footpath and level crossings, as there have been a number of fatal accidents at such locations.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport on how many occasions in the last 12 months for which figures are available when the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) initiated court proceedings against people who were believed not to have paid excise duty (VED), the DVLA <i>(a)</i> withdrew proceedings and <i>(b)</i> lost a case in court because the vehicle keeper showed that he or she had paid VED; how much the DVLA estimates such proceedings cost public funds; what steps the DVLA will take to improve its administration procedures to avoid the initiation of this type of unnecessary proceedings; and if he will make a statement.

A breakdown of why these cases were unsuccessful is not available but the main reason is likely to be that VED was paid after the summons had been issued.

Notes:<br>

1. The costs are for Great Britain in 2005&#150;06 price terms, using the Gross Domestic Product deflator index, rounded to the nearest &#163;1 billion.<br>

2. Basic State Pension (BSP) expenditure is estimated by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department, consistent with Budget 2005 assumptions, made using 2003 based population projections.<br>

3. Pension credit and the winter fuel payment expenditures are estimated by the Department for Work and Pensions forecasts based on 2005 Budget assumptions.<br>

4. The eligibility to the basic State Pension is assumed not to change and to achieve the minimum basic State Pension payable (25 per cent.) a person will normally need 10 or 11 qualifying years.<br>

5. It is assumed that the full rate of basic State Pension is increased to the level of the individual guarantee credit in 2005&#150;06 and is increased in line with earnings. Category B pension paid to married women and basic State Pension paid to people entitled to less than the full rate of basic State Pension are increased by the same proportion.<br>

6. Both pension credit and the winter fuel payment are assumed to be abolished for the different age groups from April 2005 with no payments to existing pensioners and no new recipients after 2005.<br>

7. These figures do not take into account any offsets of tax.<br>

8. Entitlement to additional State Pension, housing benefit, council tax benefit and other pensioner benefits are all assumed to be unchanged.<br>

<a name="50614w07.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_49">Under this proposal the pensioners already in receipt of pension credit would be no better off and a substantial number of pensioners would be worse off. This would be because they would lose pension credit and winter fuel payments and any additional amounts that pension credit gives them for caring responsibility, disability and certain housing costs.

<p><a name="st_70"><a name="50614w08.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Plaskitt  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 13 June 2005]:</i> No housing benefit or council tax benefit assessments need to be revisited solely because of an incorrect tax credit award. Both housing benefit and council tax benefit take into account the actual amount of tax credit in payment at the time. This means that when someone is getting a higher amount of tax credit than they are due, they will receive less housing benefit or council tax benefit. However, when the tax credit is reduced on account of an earlier overpayment, the individual will receive a higher amount of housing benefit or council tax benefit.

The allocation of funds was based on bids made by housing associations to the Housing Corporation. The bids were needs led and based on local priorities identified by local authorities in consultation with local domestic violence agencies.

It was the responsibility of local authorities in partnership with the domestic violence agencies to identify gaps in refuge service provision at the time bids were being formulated.

Notes<br>

1. The numbers of visits are estimated from data collected by the ONS International Passenger Survey. This year-round survey interviews approximately one in 500 passengers at all major UK airports, sea ports, and tunnel routes, as they arrive in or depart from the UK.<br>

2. The data refer to number of visits to the UK rather than the number of people, since some may have travelled more than once.<br>

3. The data presented here relate to non-UK residents arriving in the country, either as returning residents or as visitors or new migrants. <br>

 During the quarter ending December 2004, 654 dentists in Northern Ireland registered new patients for treatment under the NHS, that is, patients who had not been registered with them at the end of the previous quarter.

Registrations may also have been due to registering for the first time, for example, children or people coming to reside in Northern Ireland.

 The Health and Personal Social Services (HPSS) Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Strategy, published in March 2005, sets out the long term vision for the use of ICT in the HPSS. It outlines a framework of activities to develop ICT in support of service modernisation. The HPSS ICT Programme, developed to deliver the HPSS ICT Strategy, was formally launched in March 2005. This programme encompasses the projects and activities required to develop and roll out new and enhanced ICT systems and support structures over a 10 year period, focusing on new and improved systems for electronic care records, electronic care communications and electronic information.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50614w23.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_116">Among the many activities identified, the HPSS ICT Programme aims to establish an electronic integrated record for each individual using community services by 2008, with electronic care records in use across the whole of the HPSS by 2010. Also by 2010, technology will be available to care professionals at the point of need, whether at remote locations or in clinics, hospitals or health centres. The programme will also introduce electronic transfer of pathology results and digital imaging which will enable early diagnosis. Electronic referral and booking systems as well as electronic prescribing will give patients more choice and convenience.

 Porphyria is not one single condition but a group of seven related disorders that can cause a variety of signs and symptoms. Most of the conditions are inherited but some may be acquired. The treatment provided to people with porphyria will depend on which type of porphyria a patient has and the severity of the condition. A patient may be seen by consultants from general medicine, chemical pathology, dermatology or a combination of these as appropriate. In addition, the medical genetics service can offer appropriate genetic advice and gene testing.

In January and February this year the Tigris was polluted by oil slicks emanating from sabotaged pipelines.

Oil pollution is also evident in the marshland and desert areas around Basra, particularly where saboteurs breached pipelines.

Separate reports of children playing with the uranium powder on the site have also been made, but we have seen no confirmation of these. The site has now been secured, and the radio-active material there returned to safe storage. We are not aware of any further looting taking place, and much of the remaining material was subsequently removed from Iraq by US experts, with the consent of the Iraqi Interim Government and keeping the IAEA informed. Initial indications are that there was little or no immediate radiation sickness evident in the population, but there might well be longer term health risks to people who were exposed to radiation. An inter-agency task force was set up in Baghdad in October 2004 to take forward action on recovering radio-active material that has been taken from the site, and monitor the long-term health of people at risk of exposure to radiation.

 The Government&#039;s policies provide over &#163;2 billion every year in tax relief on savings through individual savings accounts (ISAs) and other forms of personal saving incentives.

<a name="stpa_152">As well as ISAs, the Government introduced the Child Trust Fund in April to ensure assets for all children, regardless of family background, strengthen financial education and promote positive attitudes to saving.

 Pension tax simplification replaces the numerous existing tax regimes with a universal regime for tax-privileged pension savings providing greater flexibility to some 15 million pension savers.

<a name="stpa_154">Currently most pension funds may invest in residential property, and many do. Under the new simplified regime small self-administered schemes (SSASs) and self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs) may invest in residential property from 6 April 2006. Around 200,000 people, compared to over 15 million pension scheme members, hold these specialist pension vehicles. Creating a single set of allowable investments across all pension schemes fits the requirement to create a single regime for tax privileged pension saving and corrects an existing distortion by giving investors greater choice.

<a name="stpa_155">The regulatory impact assessment (RIA) Simplifying the Taxation of Pensions&quot; published in April 2004, which can be found at http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ria/simplifying-pensions.pdf set out an assessment of the potential impact of the whole pensions simplification package, including the changes to the lifetime allowance and ages at which pensions can be taken, together with allowing residential property into SIPPs and SSASs. These elements cannot easily be separated and therefore the RIA estimates the overall cost of the pensions simplification package to the Exchequer at around &#163;&#188; billion within four years. Paragraphs 55 and 56 deal specifically with the potential consequences of allowing residential property into SIPPs and SSASs.

 The thrust of the workforce reform agenda&#151;which is supported by school workforce unions and employers, as well as by Government&#151;are to encourage schools to make the most effective use of all their resources. In many cases, using cover staff rather than supply teachers will be the best option&#151;in terms of educational benefit as well as value for money. But deployment will depend on a number of factors, including how much short term absence&#151;much of which is unforeseeable&#151;a school needs to cover.

 It is difficult to estimate precisely the number of EU students that may be eligible for higher education maintenance support because of the uncertainty involved in projecting future numbers of EU students and the limited data available centrally on the number of years people in this group may have been resident in the UK. An EU student will still need to satisfy the requirement of three years residence in the UK prior to the start of his or her course in order to be eligible for maintenance support.

 The available information is given in the table. It is the responsibility of local authorities (LAs) to provide suitable education for those children of compulsory school age who, by reason of illness, exclusion from school or otherwise, may not otherwise receive it. Therefore each LA will decide how many PRU places it needs, in line with its own policies, the efficient use of resources and DfES guidance.
