Where the erection of polytunnels for agricultural purposes is deemed to constitute &#039;development&#039; under these provisions, &#039;permitted development rights&#039; under part six of the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO) 1995 may be available, subject to criteria set out in the Order.

 The Department for Transport does not hold information on the estimates for the number of people standing on trains. All train operating companies are required by their franchise agreements to manage crowding by ensuring that adequate capacity is provided to meet passenger needs as far as possible. All rolling stock has a nominal capacity. Under normal circumstances for journeys of 20 minutes or more, the capacity is taken to be the number of seats provided, and no passenger should need to stand for more than 20 minutes. For journeys of less than 20 minutes an allowance is made for no more than 30 per cent. of passengers to be standing.

<a name="50621w15.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_48">In addition, London and Edinburgh commuter operators are subject to specific standards for managing crowding in the morning and evening peaks. These are that the average number of passengers carried does not exceed the nominal capacity by more than 4.5 per cent. in either peak taken in isolation, or more than 3 per cent. for both peaks combined. The Strategic Rail Authority publishes data in National Rail Trends about the commuter operators&#039; performance, and this is in the Library of the House.

<sup>(7)</sup> For the year 2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used by ONS to define alcohol-related deaths are listed below:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>

For the years 2001&#150;04 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>

Deaths were selected using the original underlying cause.<br>

The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in:<br>

Baker A and Rooney C (2003). Recent trends in alcohol-related mortality, and the impact of ICD-10 on the monitoring of these deaths in England and Wales. &quot;Health Statistics Quarterly&quot; 17, pp 5&#150;14.<br>

 It is in the interests of children that parents use the Child Trust Fund voucher to open a Child Trust Fund account as soon as they feel ready to do so. The sooner vouchers are invested, the sooner Child Trust Fund accounts can start to grow.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50621w17.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_63">The loss resulting from a delay in investing the voucher depends on a large number of factors such as the value of the initial voucher, the type of account invested in and the rate of return on this. If parents, friends and family intend to make contributions once the accounts are opened, delaying will further compound the loss of growth.

It is not possible to calculate the effects of the compensation for the landfill tax on employer NICs beyond 1998&#150;99 due to structural changes to employers&#039; NICs in 1999, which abolished the &#039;entry fee&#039;, replaced the series of four rates with a single rate and aligned the point at which individuals and employers pay national insurance with the personal allowance for income tax.

 The Saddam Hussein regime paid its creditors little or nothing since August 1990, when United Nations Security Council resolution 660 came into force. The Paris Club of official creditors negotiated a debt deal with the Iraqi Government in November 2004. This treatment sought to restore Iraq&#039;s debt sustainability and to tailor Iraq&#039;s future debt payment schedule to its capacity to pay. Iraq has committed to negotiate settlements with non-Paris Club creditors on terms comparable to the Paris Club deal. Private individuals and small businesses will therefore benefit from Iraq&#039;s new willingness to service as much of its debt as it can reasonably afford.

 For the tax system to be effective, everyone needs to pay their fair share of taxes. Tax avoidance undermines the ability of the tax system to deliver its objectives, imposing significant costs on society. The Government have always made it clear their determination to ensure that the tax system is fair and is seen to be fair. The Government have taken a series of steps to prevent abuse of the tax system including structural reforms that make the system less vulnerable, closing loopholes in the law and improving the way HM Revenue and Customs delivers its compliance function. Paragraphs 5.99 to 5.101 of the Budget 2005 Red Book set out a series of further steps to improve direct tax compliance, those measures are included in the Finance (No.2) Bill 2005.

One of the specified target groups is the oldest children in the final pre-school cohort (those with July and August birthdays) who are the only children who are actually aged four when they enter their final pre-school year.

That advice was that the balance of risks and benefits for the treatment of depressive illness in under-18s is judged to be unfavourable for paroxetine (Seroxat), venlafaxine (Efexor), sertraline (Lustral), citalopram (Cipramil), escitalopram (Cipralex) and mirtazapine (Zispin). It is not possible to assess the balance of risks and benefits for fluvoxamine (Faverin), due to the absence of paediatric clinical trial data. Only fluoxetine (Prozac) has been shown in clinical trials to be effective in treating depressive illness in children and adolescents, although it is possible that, in common with the other SSRIs, it is associated with a small increased risk of self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Overall, the balance of risks and benefits for fluoxetine in the treatment of depressive illness in under-18s is judged to be favourable. This advice was reiterated in December 2004, when the report of the expert working group was published.

 The Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004 No. 1031) that implement the European Union Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC in the United Kingdom came into force on 1 May 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50621w28.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_135">The regulations provide a statutory basis for the regulation of the commencement and conduct of clinical trials of medicines. Most of the provisions were part of 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Jun 2005 : Column 964W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
existing UK clinical trials regulation. The regulations require a positive opinion from an ethics committee and an authorisation issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50621w28.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_136">To achieve this, the regulations provided for the UK Ethics Committee Authority to recognise ethics committees and oversee the ethics review system. The regulations also provide for a single UK-wide opinion for multi-centre studies and set a defined time period&#151;60 days&#151;and restrict previous time-consuming reiteration of correspondence passing between applicant and committee. This has streamlined previous procedures while reinforcing the protection of research subjects. Throughout the first year of these regulations UK ethics committees have operated well within the 60-day target.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50621w28.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_137">The regulations shortened MHRA&#039;s statutory response times to 30 days from 35 days and the Government agreed a pharmaceutical industry competitiveness task force performance target for response to applications for phase I trials of a mean of 14 days, with a maximum of 21 days. In the first year following implementation, the MHRA has met its deadline of 14 days for phase I applications and of 30 days for all other applications. The MHRA has no additional application process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50621w28.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_138">For regulatory approval for pharmaceutical company trials, the documentation required under the new legislation is similar to that required under the previous system. Non commercial researchers have a simplified application procedure requiring an application form and protocol and minimal supporting data. This is similar to the procedure before the clinical trials regulations came into force. The new application form is the same for all types of trial and has been designed to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy. It uses check boxes rather than free text and typically takes 20 to 30 minutes to complete.

 The Lord Chancellor has been receiving monthly information reports from the coroner for Teesside since June 2004. The reports provide details of performance in relation to all coroner cases (including inquests) in the region and specifically the numbers of cases received, disposed of and outstanding on a monthly basis. The Lord Chancellor will consider whether he requires the coroner to continue with the provision of monthly reports after the end of June 2005.

 Her Majesty&#039;s Courts Service (HMCS) were launched as a new agency from 1 April 2005. For the first time all magistrates, Crown and county courts will operate together creating a more effective organisation and deliver efficiencies through merging of local activities, estates integration and more efficient use of corporate resources. HMCS plan to deliver efficiency savings of &#163;14 million/&#163;24 million/&#163;31million and reduce its workforce by 400/600/800 over the SR04 period. The staff reduction will not be achieved through redundancies but through other means such as not filling new vacancies over the period. These efficiencies will be delivered through local plans in each of the 42 areas.

 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs for what reasons the thresholds for criminal legal aid set out in the proposed Criminal Defence Services Bill are different to those established for civil legal aid.  [6001]</p>




<p><a name="st_227"><a name="50621w30.html_spnew7"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 As a general principle, the Government believe that the potential loss of liberty confronting an individual who faces criminal prosecution by the state is sufficiently serious to justify broad distinction from civil proceedings. For this reason, it is considered important to establish separate thresholds for both the criminal and civil legal aid schemes. In addition, the threshold for criminal legal aid 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Jun 2005 : Column 975W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

 The Framework Document published alongside the Criminal Defence Service Bill includes an undertaking to carry out an annual review of the proposed financial eligibility thresholds. In all normal circumstances, we would expect to update these thresholds in line with one of the established indicators such as the Rossi index. These proposals will be included among the draft regulations setting out the specific mechanics of the new means testing model. The regulations are expected to be published in autumn 2005 and will be subject to a full consultation exercise, the outcome of which will help to inform the final design and operation of the new scheme.

In October 2003 the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) published &#039;The Skills for Life Survey: A national needs and impact survey of literacy, numeracy and ICT skills&#039;. The survey assessed the literacy, numeracy and ICT skills of around 8000 adults aged 16 and above in England. The findings for the nine government office regions are shown in the following tables. The assessment levels correspond to the new literacy and numeracy core curriculum and National Standards: Level 1 is broadly equivalent to a lower grade GCSE (grade D-G) and Level 2 to a higher grade GCSE (A*-C).

<p>
<a name="50621w32.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_0">Overall around 16 per cent. of adults had literacy skills below Level 1: this varied between 21 per cent. in the north-east and 12 per cent. in the south-east. Likewise, 47 per cent. of adults had numeracy skills below Level 1 and this varied between 55 per cent. in the north-east and 40 per cent. in the south-east.

<p><a name="qn_26"><a name="50621w37.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Stephen O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many departments of <i>(a)</i> Chinese, <i>(b)</i> Arabic, <i>(c)</i> chemistry, <i>(d)</i> physics and <i>(e)</i> mathematics there were in higher education institutions in England in each year between 1994 and 2004; and what the projected numbers are for each year from 2005 to 2010.

<p><a name="st_26"><a name="50621w37.html_spnew0"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 Information on the closure, merger or opening of particular university courses and departments is not collected by the Department. Higher Education Institutions are autonomous organisations responsible for their own academic direction and strategic use of funds, and any decisions on closures of departments are made by them, not by Government or the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE).

<a name="50621w37.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_49">The then Secretary of State for Education and Skills wrote to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) at the beginning of December 2004 asking their advice on what types of action should be considered to strengthen and secure subjects of strategic national importance, including mathematics and science. HEFCE have set up an expert group to look at this issue and to report to the HEFCE board this month. The board will inform Ministers of the outcome.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to the Answer of 13 June, Ref 4022, regarding home-school agreements, if she will request from Ofsted the number of schools that have drawn up home-school agreements.  [5023]</p>




<p><a name="st_27"><a name="50621w37.html_spnew1"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Ofsted does not collect this information. During inspections Ofsted looks generally at whether a school is meeting its statutory requirements. However, it does not look specifically at whether a school has a Home-School Agreement (HSA) in place. As I said in my earlier reply, we expect all maintained schools to have HSAs in place.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will extend the London fringe allowance for teachers to include Castle Point; and if she will make a statement.  [5796]</p>




<p><a name="st_28"><a name="50621w37.html_spnew2"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 There are no plans to extend the London fringe allowance for teachers&#039; pay. However, any teachers may be paid recruitment and retention incentives and benefits of any value or nature in addition to their salary, and this is a matter for their schools to decide in the light of local circumstances.

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="50621w37.html_spnew3"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The Department has not conducted research on the impact on teacher recruitment and retention east of the A130. The Department does evaluate the impact of teachers&#039; pay arrangements and the strategies used to support recruitment and retention. Recent evidence to the School Teachers&#039; Review Body, submitted jointly with our partners from teacher unions and employers, points to the positive impact these strategies are having on teacher recruitment and retention while accepting that there continue to be pressures in places. All schools have discretion to use recruitment and retention incentives to ease any local pressures they face.

 We have appointed Jim Rose to make recommendations on best practice in the teaching of early reading and synthetic phonics in primary schools and early years settings, covering content and pace of learning.

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="50621w37.html_spnew7"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The demand for building new schools will depend on local factors such as pupil numbers, the capacity of existing schools, and the condition and suitability of existing buildings. Whether it is better value to refurbish or extend an existing school or to build new is a matter for local option appraisal and discussion. Local authorities assess these factors and we do not collect this information centrally.

 We are working with People 1st (the sector skills council for the hospitality, leisure, travel and tourism industries), the Food Standards Agency, the Teacher Training Agency, the Learning and Skills Council and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to review and build on the range of catering qualifications that are currently available, including NVQs. Our aim is to ensure that we have a ladder of qualifications that include information on nutritional standards where appropriate, meet the skills needs of all catering staff, and support progression from the level 1 VRQ.

<p><a name="st_37"><a name="50621w37.html_spnew11"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The Government considers that learning at home is an essential part of the good education to which all our children are entitled. We know, and Ofsted confirm, that a well organised homework programme helps children and young people to develop the skills and attitudes they will need for successful, independent life long learning. Currently my Department does not collect information on individual school&#039;s homework policies or the amount of homework they set. We believe it is for schools themselves to make their own decisions in this area, taking account of the Homework Guidelines for Primary and Secondary Schools we provide. Home-school agreements, which we introduced in 1999, promote partnerships between schools and parents, and assist parents in supporting their children&#039;s learning at home, including their completion of homework.

The figures are taken from the HESA student record which has been collected annually by the Higher Education Statistics Agency since 1994/95, and cover home and overseas students obtaining masters qualifications at English higher education institutions. There is a pronounced drop in the number of students in the &#039;combined&#039; category for 2003/04&#151;this is due to a change in the way the Open University returns its data to HESA.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Total spending on schools by LEAs is not yet available. The figures provided show the funding allocated to each LEA by the Government for pupils aged 3&#150;10 and 11&#150;15.<br>

2. Total funding includes funding via the relevant sub-blocks of the Education Formula Spending settlement / Standard Spending Assessment and revenue grants allocated at an LEA level. It includes the pensions transfer to EPS and the Learning and Skills Council, and is in cash terms.<br>

3. Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES Departmental Expenditure Limits relevant to pupils aged 3&#150;10 and 11&#150;15, and exclude EMAs and grants not allocated at LEA level. For those LEAs in receipt of advance of grant under the transitional support arrangements for 2004&#150;05, advance grant funding is included in the year of payment (2004&#150;05). There will be a consequential reduction in DfES grant for these LEAs in future years (either 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 or 2008&#150;09, depending on the terms on which the advance was given to the LEA).<br>

4. The pupil numbers used to convert &#163; million figures to per pupil are those underlying the SSA/EFS settlement calculations plus PLASC 3-year-old maintained pupils and estimated 3 to 4-year-olds funded through state support in maintained and other educational institutions where these are not included in the SSA pupil numbers.<br>

5. Rounding: Per pupil figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10. Total allocation figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 million.<br>

6. 2005&#150;06 figures are provisional as some grants have not yet been finalised/validated.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what estimate she has made of the cost of building <i>(a)</i> a special school and <i>(b)</i> a mainstream school under the Building Schools for the Future programme.  [5419]</p>




<p><a name="st_49"><a name="50621w40.html_spnew3"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The cost of a school will depend on the number of pupils and their needs which will vary locally in each case. As an example, under Building Schools for the future programme, an estimated cost for an average 900 place mainstream secondary school without a sixth form may be approximately &#163;15 million gross cost and an estimated cost for an average 72 place special school for pupils with severe complex needs may be &#163;7.5 million gross cost. These cost estimates are current and are based on DfES cost data averaged across a range of schools. They include for furniture, fittings ICT and equipment, professional fees, an average location factor and an allowance for abnormal costs e.g for site works. The costs for the mainstream secondary school are based on the agreed basic net cost rates per square metre of &#163;1,224/m <sup>2</sup> . The cost rate used for the special school for pupils with severe and complex needs is the proposed rate of &#163;1,554/m <sup>2</sup>  and is subject to the public consultation of the draft improved building standards in 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Jun 2005 : Column 1022W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much public funding has been spent on repairs to school buildings in Gloucestershire in each year since 1997.  [5193]</p>




<p><a name="st_50"><a name="50621w40.html_spnew4"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Revenue expenditure figures on the maintenance and improvement of schools are likely to vary from year to year depending on the unique circumstances of a particular LEA. For example, revenue expenditure will increase in years where there have been adverse weather conditions (e.g. repairing storm damage) and is also likely to vary with the number and age of the school buildings within the LEA. Revenue expenditure will also be affected by the amounts of capital expenditure employed at a school. Capital spending in Gloucestershire LEA on school buildings has increased from &#163;7.95 million in 1997&#150;98 to &#163;36.78 million in 2004&#150;05.

<sup>(50)</sup> Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;1,000.<br>

<sup>(51)</sup> Figures for 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02 cover the repair and maintenance of buildings, fixed plant and grounds which includes all expenditure on non-capital building works, including repairs and maintenance of buildings, and non-capital expenditure on fixed plant and grounds. Figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 are the combination of the revenue expenditure on building (including fixed plant) maintenance and improvement and grounds maintenance and improvement (CFR categories E12+E13). Any capital expenditure on school buildings is not included in this table.<br>

<sup>(52)</sup> Figures for 2002&#150;03 onwards will not be directly comparable with the figures for earlier years as figures for 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02 are for all LEA maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools (pre-primary expenditure accounts for &#163;8,500, &#163;15,000 and &#163;138,000 of the respective totals in 1999&#150;2000, 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02) while nursery figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 are not available and have therefore been excluded for these two years. Also, for some LEAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LEA part of the form in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 and would therefore be excluded from the totals for those years although the precise amount of this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>

In addition, successful and popular secondary schools may apply direct to the Department for a contribution to the capital cost of any necessary building work.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what measures are being taken to reduce truancy in schools.  [5907]</p>




<p><a name="st_64"><a name="50621w42.html_spnew0"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 We are concerned about all forms of absence from school, but truancy is of particular concern. We continue to work with parents, pupils, schools and local authorities to improve school attendance and to tackle truancy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50621w42.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_63">We have put in place a range of measures such as extra support for schools and local authorities from expert advisers and through additional resources. We promote effective practices to improve school attendance including national truancy sweeps, first day contact with the parents of absent pupils and electronic registration systems. We have also introduced the &#039;Fast-track Framework&#039; a system to ensure early identification of attendance problems and a time-limited approach to solving them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50621w42.html_para1">

support they need and help them focus on what needs to be done to improve their child&#039;s attendance. However, where parents are not unable, but simply unwilling, to fulfil their responsibilities, they face strong measures such as penalty notices, prosecutions and compulsory Parenting Orders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50621w42.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_65">By September 2007, we expect all secondary schools to be working together in collaborations, with funds devolved from their local authorities, to manage support and provision for persistent truants as well as pupils who are excluded or at risk of exclusion.
