 I refer the hon. Member to the answer which my hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Murphy) on 16 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 756W. The Ministry of Defence Consultation Document on the Joint Compensation Review is not confined to arrangements for Gulf veterans, but seeks views on the general eligibility for claims under a new compensation scheme. We will give careful consideration to all views put forward during the consultation phase. The proposals resulting from the review do not envisage changing the eligibility for claims under the DSS administered War Pension Scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 8 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 633W, on malaria, and his subsequent letter, how many service personnel of the 200 deployed to Sierra Leone without anti-malarial treatment have since been diagnosed with malaria; to which regiments they belong; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="10323w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Information is not available as to the specific reasons why each individual leaves the armed forces prematurely. Each service does, however, run leaver surveys. In the past three years these surveys have indicated that, more often than not, it is the cumulative effect of several factors rather than a single item that has the most impact on retention. From these surveys it is possible to say that dissatisfaction with pay is not one of the most influential factors in an Officer's or Other Rank's/Rating's decision to leave.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when he will publish the inspection report of the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate in respect of the London borough of Hackney.  [155728]




<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10323w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report was published today in respect of the London borough of Hackney and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para6">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para7">The reports main conclusion is that the standard of service provided to benefit claimants over the past three years has been very poor. The council contracted out its Benefits and Revenues services in 1997 and the BFI reports that flaws in the contract coupled with a failure to invest sufficient resources in the client side management, has contributed to the present situation.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para8">Inspectors found that a poorly designed claim form, considerable backlogs and very poor processing performance was having an effect on other parts of the service leading to significant delays and a sharp increase in the numbers of complaints to the Local Government Ombudsman.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para9">The report notes that some measures were introduced to improve customer service. But the effectiveness of these measures is being seriously undermined by long waiting times and inefficient use of the caller centre.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para10">Inspectors found that since April 1999 Hackney has failed to comply with the requirement to notify claimants of their benefit entitlement and subsequent changes. The report also noted major concerns in the prevention and recovery of overpayment. In 1999-2000 the HB debt was &#163;17.8 million.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para11">The report notes the introduction of a strong management structure of the council's counter fraud unit and a number of good practices. But limited resources were resulting in poor quality fraud investigations and a failure to make full and proper use of all investigative practices and powers.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para12">The report notes, however, that a new Managing Director took up post during the BFI inspection and its clear that considerable effort is being put in to address some of the significant weaknesses in performance.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para13">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10323w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Goggins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when he will publish the inspection report of the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate in respect of Glasgow city council.  [155729]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10323w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report was published today in respect of Glasgow city council and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para14">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para15">Overall, inspectors found a number of weaknesses and poor standards of performance in benefit administration and counter fraud work that needed immediate attention. 



<P>
<P><I>23 Mar 2001 : Column: 368W</I><P>
They also identified inconsistent and ineffective work practices and substantial delays with appeals and review boards.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para16">The BFI notes the council's lack of effective performance standards and targets, inadequate management information, weaknesses in checks and controls, the poor management in the recovery of benefit overpayments and inadequate standards in fraud investigations.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para17">The report notes that the council was preparing for the possible bulk transfer of its council housing stock to the private sector. Should this go ahead, the implications for the delivery of benefits service are enormous.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para18">The report concludes that BFI has serious concerns about Glasgow's performance in managing and delivering a secure benefits service. More positively, however, the report notes that the council has recognised the significant challenges it faces and is committed to and already acted upon a number of BFI's recommendations.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para19">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10323w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Goggins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when he will publish the inspection report of the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate in respect of Sheffield city council.  [155730]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10323w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report was published today in respect of Sheffield city council and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para20">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para21">Inspectors found a number of weaknesses and poor standards of performance in benefit administration and counter fraud work. Performance is failing to meet contractual expectations in a number of key areas.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para22">The report notes the council is struggling to cope with significant backlogs of work which are resulting in lengthy delays in claims processing and reduced customer services. The council has introduced measures to resolve the backlogs and some progress is being made towards restoring an effective benefits service.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para23">Benefits administration needs to be improved with regard to verification, overpayment classification and implementation of effective qualify checking controls. Although some weaknesses were found in the control and management of overpayments work Inspectors found the council to be pursuing recovery of debts effectively.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para24">The report notes that although there is some good counter fraud work, it is not focused and management controls are largely ineffective and provide little assurance. Inspectors found investigation work to be of poor quality and insufficient to tackle the estimated level of fraud in the council's area.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para25">Inspectors were pleased to find effective corporate policies and measures were in place to encourage an anti-fraud and corruption culture.




<P>
<P><I>23 Mar 2001 : Column: 369W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para26">The report concludes that the council has shown a positive commitment towards improving its performance and is developing an action plan to address the issues raised by the inspection. Some remedial action had already taken place by the time the inspection finished.
<P>

<a name="10323w01.html_para27">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.

 The office of the Independent Case Examiner (ICE) has already recruited two extra staff. A further four staff members will be in post by the end of April 2001, and two more in May 2001.
<P>

<a name="10323w02.html_para0">All cases referred to the ICE are dealt with as quickly and effectively as possible. Cases are dealt with in the order they are received to ensure that all customers receive a similar service. In exceptional circumstances, such as where a customer's health is being affected by their case, it will be dealt with more urgently.
<P>

<a name="10323w02.html_para1">The current Independent Case Examiner, Mrs. Anne Parker, was appointed on a part-time basis and the intention is that her replacement will also be part-time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10323w02.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We have no plans to commission research into commercial cheque cashing services.
<P>

<a name="10323w02.html_para2">No benefit recipient should have to pay for benefit cheque encashment. The facility exists for people without a bank account to return crossed girocheques to their local Benefits Agency office and have them replaced by lower value girocheques which can be encashed at a Post Office.
<P>

<a name="10323w02.html_para3">Most high street banks now offer basic accounts which are free to open and run. These are available to the majority of benefit recipients and can be used to clear crossed benefit cheques or Housing Benefit cheques issued by local authorities.

 Information regarding income gains over the Parliament for poorer pensioners is available in "The Pension Credit: A consultation paper" (Cm 4900). As the document sets out, by next April 1.7 million of the poorest pensioner households will on average be at least &#163;15 a week better off and half of the poorest pensioner households will on average be over &#163;20 a week better off as a result of tax and benefit measures introduced by the Government since 1997.

 The National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI), announced today, is a partnership between all the United Kingdom Health Departments, the Medical Research Council, the Cancer Research Campaign, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, the Marie Curie Research Institute and the pharmaceutical industry. The greatest benefit for patients is likely to be achieved if all the main funders of cancer research work together to ensure the best use of research resources.

<a name="10323w02.html_para7">The NCRI will be established from 1 April. It will provide the focus for cancer research conducted across the UK, and provide strategic oversight of that research.

 The tables provide a list of the grants paid by the Department of Health to the two local authorities Royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster city council for the periods required.

<a name="10323w02.html_para9">The grants are as follows:
<P>

<a name="10323w02.html_para10"><i>AIDS Support Grant</i>
<P>

<a name="10323w02.html_para11">Paid to local authorities to support social care provision for those with severe HIV disease or an AIDS diagnosis.

<a name="10323w02.html_para12"><i>Asylum-Seekers Accommodation Grant (Adults)</i>
<P>

<a name="10323w02.html_para13">From the 1999-2000 financial year the Special Grant for Asylum Seekers (adults) became the responsibility of the Home Office. The background to these payments was that in 1996, changes in Department of Social Security benefit legislation left some asylum seekers destitute and unable to claim financial support. The then Government introduced Special Grants, administered by the Department of Health, to local authorities towards meeting the cost of providing accommodation for destitute asylum seekers under either the National Assistance Act 1948 or the Children Act 1989. The Special Grant was split between single adults, families and unaccompanied children. Under the conditions of these grants, local authorities have been reimbursed for the direct costs they have incurred in supporting asylum seekers.

<P>

<a name="10323w02.html_para17">The Secretary of State launched the Quality Protects Programme for Health in September 1998. Initially providing funding of &#163;375 million over three years, the programme is intended to improve the management and delivery of social services for children. In October 2000, the Secretary of State for Health announced that the programme would be extended from a three to a five year programme, matched by an increase in the Special Grant from &#163;120 million in 2000-01 to &#163;290 million by 2003.

<a name="10323w02.html_para18"><i>Community Care Special Transitional Grant</i>
<P>

<a name="10323w02.html_para19">This grant was paid to local authorities in England from 1993-99 to enable them to meet their new responsibilities under Part III of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 which was fully implemented in April 1993. Implementation required local authorities to establish arrangements to assess people's needs for community care services. It also placed new duties on social services authorities to purchase independent sector residential and nursing home care for those people who required public support to enter such homes. Social services authorities now assess an individual's needs for services and in the light of that assessment decide whether or what services should be provided.

 As part of the national programme to improve accident and emergency services funded from the Capital Modernisation Fund in 1998-99 and 1999-2000, &#163;417,000 was invested in providing improved security for staff and patients through the provision of CCTV systems in a number of hospitals across the region. &#163;8,000 was spent separately at Crewkerne and Wincanton hospitals. Other schemes funded in this programme included investment on CCTV and security improvements, however, it is not possible to identify separately the expenditure on this element in these schemes. Other improvements to hospital security will have been made locally from National Health Service trusts' block capital allocations.

 <i>[holding answer 5 March 2001]:</i> At our request, the European Commission has agreed a number of changes and flexibilities in CAP scheme rules to protect payments to British farmers affected by flooding this winter, details of which have already been announced. EU funding was discussed as a possibility under the England Rural Development Programme but the views of rural stakeholders expressed in consultations were that restoration from flooding was a lower priority in this long-term programme than measures to conserve and improve the environment and to assist the creation of a more productive and sustainable rural economy.

<P>
<a name="10323w04.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 March 2001]:</i> Exports of sheep from England and Wales to another member state are required to be covered by export health certification under harmonised EU conditions. Under normal circumstances, additional border checks constitute an illegal impediment to trade. However, since the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, surveillance at Holyhead Port has been increased. We are not aware that there have been any illegally exported consignments nor have any been reported to MAFF by the Irish Authorities.

<a name="10323w04.html_para1">Less than 1 per cent. of sheep legally moved between Great Britain and Ireland as a whole went direct to the Republic of Ireland between 1 February 2000 and 31 March 2001. A significant proportion of trade to the Irish Republic goes via Northern Ireland. Suspicions of illegal trading of sheep, involving misleading certification, arose there last year; increased port surveillance and tracing of animals to their final destinations were put in place and the trade had in consequence virtually stopped by January 2001. Any evidence submitted to us of illegal consignments between England and Wales and the Republic of Ireland would be carefully investigated.

My statement to the House on 20 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 192, outlined some preliminary measures to alleviate the immediate financial hardship of small businesses in rural areas. The taskforce will continue to look at this issue and I will make further announcements in due course.

<P>
<a name="10323w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Owing to the foot and mouth disease outbreak, movements of FMD susceptible livestock may only take place under licence. We expect all hauliers to take seriously their obligations not to spread the disease. But we will nevertheless arrange for a high proportion of longer distance movements to be supervised and accompanied. In addition, checks are made by the police and local authorities to ensure compliance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10323w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Under the UK Coal Operating Aid Scheme, aid is payable to loss-making production units only in respect of losses incurred through the production of qualifying (industrial) coal. Thus any reduction in such losses will reduce the level of aid payable, and any mine making an actual net profit before subsidy in any given financial year will not be eligible for subsidy in that year. However, the level of subsidy payable is not directly affected by the overall level of profits or losses made by the applicant company as a whole.
<P>

<a name="10323w06.html_para4">Applications for aid, and payments of aid if European Commission approval is given, are made on the basis of forecast losses. However, once each of the applicant company's relevant financial years encompassing the subsidy period is over, there will be a reconciliation process in which the forecasts are compared with actuals for the applicant production unit in that subsidy period. If actual losses have been less than forecast, any consequent overpayment of aid will be set off against any further subsidy payments due or otherwise recovered.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what was the total amount of money spent on medical research <i>(a)</i> using animals and <i>(b)</i> using alternatives to animals by (i) Government and (ii) industry in 2000-01.  [153373]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10323w06.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 March 2001]:</i> It is impossible to put a precise figure on medical research spend that has required either the use of animals or alternatives to animals. All experimental work with animals is subject to approval by the Home Office. The majority of medical research projects do not involve any animal procedures. It is not possible to determine how many of these projects could have been pursued using animal experiments, and would have been issued licences, if the alternative approaches had not been available. Once alternatives to a specific experimental method have been successfully developed and shown to be effective, the Home Office will not issue a licence to conduct the same type of work using animals. All experiments using animals must satisfy the strict regulation of the 1986 Act.

<P>

<a name="10323w06.html_para5">Secondly, where research projects depend on some animal experimentation, it is not possible to disaggregate easily the animal-related and other costs of medical research projects. For example, a research group studying how a mutated gene contributes to cancer might gain much information by studying individual cells in a laboratory, but might also need to examine how the gene contributes to disease in a whole animal, such as a mouse, to gain full understanding of the problem.

<a name="10323w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 2001]:</i> The Hawley group was established at the instigation of my noble Friend the Minister for Science and Innovation in October 1999. The group was chaired by Dr. Robert Hawley, Chairman of the Engineering Council, and consisted of representatives from the Engineering Council, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Education and Employment. My noble Friend received regular progress reports from Dr. Hawley throughout the course of the Hawley Review and also chaired public events on 23 May 2000 and 14 February 2001. DTI officials on the group were closely involved in the development of the review and they consulted colleagues within the Department, including those in the Office of Science and Technology, on a wide range of issues. Significant contributions were also received from officials in the DETR.
<P>

<a name="10323w06.html_para6">The Hawley group report entitled "Making the Best of Valuable Talent" was published in December 2000 and contained some 43 recommendations for re-positioning the Engineering Council to meet the needs and aspirations of an increasingly diverse and non-traditional engineering community. The report was circulated widely for discussion within the engineering community and the initial response proved most favourable. During the consultation exercise my noble Friend spoke directly to a number of senior representatives of the engineering community, from industry and from many of the engineering institutions, to seek their views on the contents of the report. All were strongly supportive.




<P>
<P><I>23 Mar 2001 : Column: 389W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10323w06.html_para7">The culmination of the consultation process was a public event held at the Institution of Electrical Engineers on 14 February 2001 which was attended by senior representatives of the engineering profession, engineering industry, academia and Government. The meeting voiced its overwhelming support for the broad thrust of the report and gave a mandate for the Engineering Council to evolve into the Engineering and Technology Board. The Hawley group ceased to exist as of the end of the meeting and a series of six working groups have now been established to carry forward the process of change.
<P>

<a name="10323w06.html_para8">We have consistently expressed our support for the aims of the Hawley Review and welcomed the proposals outlined in the Hawley report. However, ownership of the process remains firmly with the engineering community itself and the shape and remit of the new Engineering and Technology Board is a matter for them alone. We are, of course, willing to provide continued support and encouragement during the transitional phase and DTI and DfEE officials will be taking an active role in a number of working groups.
<P>

<a name="10323w06.html_para9">The Engineering and Technology Board is due to come into existence in October 2001 and it will, therefore, be some time before a sensible assessment can be made of the impact of the new arrangements on the engineering and technology base in the UK. However, the Hawley group, led by Dr. Robert Hawley, can take a great deal of credit for initiating a wide ranging and radical assessment of the current structures within the engineering profession and encouraging a much needed debate on the future of engineering.
<P>

<a name="10323w06.html_para10">A copy of the Hawley report has been placed in the Library of the House.

<P><I>23 Mar 2001 : Column: 390W</I><P>
Cancer" on 6 March 2001. (Documents of the NRPB Vol 12, No 1, 2001). Copies have been placed in the Library of the House. The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB), an independent body set up under statute and who provide scientific advice to Government issued a response statement which can be found on the NRPB website www.nrpb.org.uk.
<P>

<a name="10323w07.html_para0">The report states that any possible risk of childhood leukaemia relates to those exposed at relatively high levels of domestic exposure but that these are not necessarily associated with proximity to overhead transmission lines. The NRPB consider that the report provides no additional scientific evidence to require a change in the guidelines to limit exposure to extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields.
<P>

<a name="10323w07.html_para1">The Government will consider carefully the recommendations of the NRPB and commission appropriate research with regard to that which is already under way. In the light of the available evidence and the advice from the NRPB it is too soon to state whether particular approaches will be taken.
<P>

<a name="10323w07.html_para2">The advice of the NRPB is welcomed and will be considered in a Government response to a European Union Recommendation on limiting public exposure to electromagnetic fields.
<P>

<a name="10323w07.html_para3">With regard to the proposed Lackenby to Shipton power line, this has been routed away from communities and individual dwellings on grounds of general amenity and was the subject of an environmental assessment and statement at the public inquiries. There are no houses under the proposed line. The existing 275kV line from Lackenby to Norton--30 km long (around the south and west of Middlesbrough) will be dismantled after the construction of the new 400kV line. There are 5,000 homes within 200 metres of the line to be dismantled compared with 250 homes within 200 metres of the new line. There is therefore a considerable net benefit in terms of general amenity.

Friend under section 30(1) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, with which local authorities may establish and maintain airports, and under section 20(3) of the Airports Act 1986 with which they may acquire shares in airport companies which they do not already control. Manchester city council applied for consent on behalf of Manchester airport's 10 shareholder authorities, and the issuing of the consents to the city council empowered the airport company, which is a subsidiary of the city council, to purchase the shares. The consents were issued without prejudice to any regulatory approval which might be needed.

Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was required to consider whether to refer the proposed purchase to the Competition Commission under the mergers provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1973 for a full investigation. He took a decision not to do so, in accordance with the recommendation of the Director General of Fair Trading. The primary consideration in the Director General's advice, and in the decision whether to make a reference, was the likely effect of the proposed purchase on competition in the market for airport services.

<P>
<a name="10323w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I do not think it appropriate to consider abolishing retentions, or to demand that central or local government clients no longer use them. Retentions are symptomatic of a lack of trust between clients, contractors and sub-contractors that is common in construction. This goes to the heart of the issues raised by the Construction Task Force in its report, "Rethinking Construction".
<P>

<a name="10323w09.html_para0">There are significant signs of a shift in the construction industry towards a more co-operative and collaborative approach. If clients and suppliers can build a culture of trust throughout the supply chain, this may lead to a corresponding change in practice on retentions.
<P>

<a name="10323w09.html_para1">Leading central Government construction clients are moving towards performance based partnering contracts encouraged by revised guidance on procurement from the Office of Government Commerce which should reduce the need for retentions in future.
<P>

<a name="10323w09.html_para2">The Local Government Task Force, which was formed to promote "Rethinking Construction" in local government, has concluded that retentions are not compatible with collaborative approaches such as partnering. The Task Force will encourage authorities to replace retentions with robust quality control assurance systems.

<P>
<a name="10323w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Lacock Post Office already receives 50 per cent. mandatory rate relief under the existing village shop rate relief scheme. This scheme gives 50 per cent. mandatory relief to the sole general store or post office in a qualifying small rural settlement. I understand that North Wiltshire District Council has increased this relief to 80 per cent. under the discretionary powers which enable billing authorities to top up the mandatory relief to 100 per cent.

 We have today published jointly with the National Assembly for Wales our "First Consultation Paper on the Implementation of the EC Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC)". The paper, which is the first in a series of planned consultations, marks the first stage in translating the Water Framework Directive into practical action in England and Wales. The paper invites views on our proposed approach to some initial questions and also provides an introduction to the Directive's provisions. I have placed copies of the paper in the House Libraries.

The logo and house-style for the Wales Office, its predecessor Department, was put in place before 1997.

Since 1999-2000, the Home Office has embarked upon a number of new major projects to modernise its IT systems, for example the Sirius and Quantum programmes, and its future accommodation the Home Office Central London Accommodation Scheme project (HOCLAS) which accounts for much of the year-by-year increases in costs.<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the Employment Service is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked Leigh Lewis to reply to your questions about the contracts which we are awarding for adult training from April 2001 and the number of Chamber of Commerce training programmes which are likely to close after the take-over by the Employment Service of contracting arrangements for the Government's Work Based Learning for Adults (WBLA) programme. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to Mr. Lewis as Chief Executive of the Agency. I am replying on Mr. Lewis' behalf.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It may help if I explain that the White Paper "Learning to Succeed" announced that responsibility for the Government's WBLA programme would transfer to the Employment Service from Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) with effect from April 2001. At the same time the Government has also taken the opportunity to redesign WBLA, in order to better align the training it provides with the needs of employers in each local area. The objective is of course to increase the programme's effectiveness in helping unemployed people to improve their employability and to secure jobs.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To deliver the best possible training provision of local relevance, the Employment Service ran a full scale competitive tendering round for contracts to deliver WBLA. At the same time, in order to ensure continuity of training for all those unemployed people who are participating in WBLA at the point of its transfer to the Employment Service in April, we have offered all existing providers contracts to support the completion of those courses.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Clearly, any competitive tendering round will result in winners and losers. I am aware of instances where organisations currently involved in the delivery of WBLA training programmes have not been successful in winning new contracts. I am however confident that, where this has happened, there are sound reasons for it. We have evaluated tenders submitted by organisations wishing to contract for WBLA using clear national criteria which are intended to ensure that successful tenderers are those organisations which can demonstrate the highest quality and who can offer our clients the best opportunities for progression into employment.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In regard to the Chamber of Commerce training programmes, we are currently in the process of notifying those bidders who have succeeded in winning contracts and offering those who have not the opportunity to seek feedback on the reasons why other organisations have been selected ahead of them.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We do not as yet have a full picture of all the outcomes of the contracting round. That said, we are aware that Chambers of Commerce, like other organisations with a national presence, will have been successful in some areas of the country and unsuccessful in others. Where Chambers have not succeeded in winning contracts for the areas in which they currently deliver WBLA, they will have been offered contracts which enable them to complete training courses for those people who are participating in WBLA on 26 March 2001.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We appreciate that it will be disappointing for those organisations who have not won contracts. As an accountable organisation we will always respond fully and fairly when such organisations write to us to state their case. As I have said, I am confident that the contracting process has been properly conducted, but we would re-examine any individual case raised by an unsuccessful organisation. If we were not satisfied both that the contracting process had been fairly conducted and that the outcomes were reasonable in all the circumstances, we would take appropriate action.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="10323w11.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 2001]:</i> The range and quality of training for unemployed people aged 25 and over is being enhanced across the country next year. We are investing &#163;200 million in improving the New Deal 25 plus. From April it will provide flexible, individually-tailored help, including training and work experience, to all those who have been unemployed for 18 months or more. In England, a re-designed Work- Based Learning for Adults programme will provide a range of job-focused training for those who have been out of work for shorter periods of time. At the same time we are investing heavily in training to help those who need to improve their literacy and numeracy. Taken together, these measures will greatly improve the help on offer to adults who need to improve their skills in order to find work.

<P>
<a name="10323w11.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Truancy has a damaging impact on the educational and life chances of children. We are determined to tackle it. Over the next three years we are investing at least &#163;500 million in projects tackling truancy and school exclusion and other initiatives to get children back into school and learning. In addition, we are giving schools in Excellence in Cities areas funds to recruit Learning Mentors, who can directly help children at risk of truancy.




<P>
<P><I>23 Mar 2001 : Column: 408W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10323w11.html_para2">To enable schools to reduce truancy further it is vital that they have accurate and speedy information to monitor attendance of pupils. Where schools have introduced electronic registration of attendance, independent evaluation has shown that truancy can be reduced by 10 per cent. in the first two years. I am very pleased to announce an additional &#163;11.25 million from April 2002 from the Government's Capital Modernisation Fund to introduce electronic registration systems in schools for recording pupil attendance.
<P>

<a name="10323w11.html_para3">Our aim is to ensure that at least 500 secondary schools with poor attendance levels will be able to benefit from this additional funding. The extra money is an important element in our overall drive to reduce truancy in school and get all our children learning and preparing for adult and working life.
