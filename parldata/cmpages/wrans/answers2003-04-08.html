 My right hon. Friend has regular discussions with business organisations and trades unions about a range of matters including economic policy and taxation matters. I concur with my right hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The manufacturing sector continues to be of vital importance to the Scottish economy and remains a substantial employer with significant linkages to the rest of the economy. Despite the impact of difficult global conditions the sector has an excellent export record and is well placed to benefit from the wide range of supporting measures in the Government's manufacturing strategy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 I refer the hon.

 To ask the President of the Council what proposals he has to improve scrutiny of legislation throughout the Parliamentary Session.  [107453]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The proposals agreed by the House last October for more routine publication of Bills in draft, for consultation with opposition parties on the broad shape of the legislative year and more flexibility in programming, and for carry-over of Bills, should contribute to improved scrutiny of legislation.

 To ask the President of the Council if he will arrange for the regular publication of <i>(a)</i> commencement dates of all new legislation and <i>(b)</i> the repeal date of all repealed legislation.  [107454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The commencement date of new legislation and the repeal dates of repealed legislation are all set out either in primary legislation or in secondary legislation, and are therefore already published in that form by the Queen's Printer (and accessible via: www.hmso.gov.uk). To make things easier for users, commencement instruments are numbered as a separate sub-series of the statutory instruments. These are identified within the SI issue list, published daily by The Stationery Office Ltd., on behalf of the Queen's Printer.
<P>

<a name="30408w01.html_para1">There are a variety of commercial publications which distil and re-present the information published by the Queen's Printer, and there seems to be no need to supplement them.

 The Ministry of Justice would be responsible for the whole of the law, both civil and criminal, whereas at present, the Lord Chancellor's Department is responsible for the former and the Home Office for the latter. The distribution of responsibilities between Whitehall Departments is a matter for the Prime Minister. The present distribution of business between the Lord Chancellor's Department, the Home Office and the Crown Prosecution Service supports the effective and efficient discharge of public business and delivery of public services.

 We are always ready to consider whether electoral practices in other countries could usefully be adopted for UK elections. The responsibility for researching and assessing such matters now rests with the Electoral Commission. I understand that practice elsewhere has helped inform the Commission's current review programme covering various aspects of our electoral arrangements, the results of which they hope to present to the Government shortly.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department pursuant to her answer of 20 March 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 908W, on portfolio holdings held by the Court of Protection for minors, what measures are in place to ensure that depreciation in the value of funds held by the Public Guardianship Office is kept to a minimum.  [105967]<P>

<P>

 Any equity investment in respect of Public Guardianship Office's (PGO) clients is undertaken by external fund managers either by a panel

<P><I>8 Apr 2003 : Column 125W</I><P>
fund manager appointed by the PGO or by a manager chosen by the receiver on behalf of the child and approved by the Court of Protection. Equities are held in a diversified portfolio, comprising holdings in individual shares or in unitised funds, so as to spread the risk. The performance of the fund managers is regularly monitored and any underperformance investigated.
<P>

<a name="30408w02.html_para0">In giving its directions for the investment of funds, the Court of Protection recommends investment strategies that are deemed suitable for the individual requirements of each case. These will provide for some, and sometimes all, of the award to be held as a cash deposit in the Special Account operated by the Court Funds Office, which currently pays a favourable rate of interest of 6 per cent. This is to ensure that commitments over the shorter term can be met without there being any obligation to sell securities at a time when they may have fallen in value, and also to modify risk in the overall portfolio.
<P>

<a name="30408w02.html_para1">Equities have suffered badly over the past three years, but they are still recommended as the best means of achieving a return that matches or exceeds the rate of inflation over the longer term.
<P>

<a name="30408w02.html_para2">There are no specific measures in place to ensure that there is no depreciation in the value of such funds. The only way to do that would be to hold all the funds in the form of cash, but that would run the risk of failing to match future rates of inflation and mean that clients' funds would perform less well relative to equity markets when they were rising.

Chancellor's Department and the agencies and non-departmental public bodies for which the Lord Chancellor is responsible, are required to undertake gender equality audits of pay and related systems. In most cases these audits have either been completed or are nearing completion. The Children and Family Courts Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) proposes to conduct an equality audit later in the year, once terms and conditions of its staff have been harmonised. Audits which have been completed indicate that there are no significant gender imbalances, and action plans drawn up from the audits will indicate how any imbalances will be addressed.

 We announced in a written statement on 23 January 2003 that the standstill would be reduced from 20 to six days for cattle, sheep and goats with effect from 4 March 2003, but with far fewer exemptions. The removal of most of the exemptions&#151;including the exemption for shows&#151;is a counter-balance to the increased risk created by the reduction in the standstill period.
<P>

<a name="30408w03.html_para2">These changes took account of the emerging findings from the risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis of animal movement standstills. A report of those findings, and a supporting document explaining our decision to reduce the standstill, have been placed in the Library and published on the Defra website. The second phase of the analysis is now under way and is due to report at the end of May 2003. We will take account of the final reports&#151;and any other new evidence&#151;when deciding what rules should apply from 1 August 2003 and beyond.

<a name="30408w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government is keen to encourage the development and deployment of low carbon technologies including micro CHP. As the Performance and Innovation Unit Report on energy policy noted, micro CHP has the potential to deliver carbon savings towards the targets in both the Climate Change Programme and the Energy White Paper. It might also be able to deliver lower fuel bills for consumers which in turn could contribute to meeting the Government's targets in its Fuel Poverty Strategy.
<P>

<a name="30408w04.html_para0">However, the technology is not yet commercially available in the UK. It is therefore not yet possible to assess the level of carbon or fuel bill savings which might be achieved in normal use of this technology. I understand that The Carbon Trust, working with the Energy Saving Trust and others, including Defra, will be commissioning a pilot field trial for micro CHP starting later this year. I understand the trial is expected to feature a range of technologies and end use applications across the residential and commercial sectors, in order to provide an objective assessment of the benefits that micro CHP can offer.

More recently, Defra has liaised closely with ECGD over revisions to that Department's Case Impact Analysis Process.

However, the Vital Villages Community Services Grant, administered by the Countryside Agency for Defra, can be used to fund 'Pub is the Hub' style projects. Since April 2001, there have been 24 funded pub schemes in England, of which four are in the eastern region, one in Suffolk and none in the constituency of Bury St. Edmunds.

<P>
<a name="30408w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Sea levels have been and will continue to be monitored in the Bristol Channel as a part of the National Tide Gauge Network, operated by Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (POL) and funded by Defra.
<P>

<a name="30408w05.html_para16">Tide gauges are monitoring sea levels constantly at the following sites, Mumbles, Newport, Avonmouth, Hinkley Point and Ilfracombe. The Environment Agency also monitor levels at West Quay Bridgwater for local operational reasons. This information is used to provide tidal predictions and for monitoring long term sea levels and relative land levels.
<P>

<a name="30408w05.html_para17">Through analysis of the Tide Gauge data and information from global climate change modelling POL have made predictions of future trends in sea levels all round the UK. These have informed the recommended Defra allowance of 5 mm rise per year for this area of the coast that takes account of both sea and major land level movements. It is also compatible with a range of future scenarios published by Defra last year as part of the UK Climate Impacts Programme in "Climate Change Scenarios of the United Kingdom", copies of which can be found in the Libraries of both Houses.

 <i>[holding answer 1 April 2003]:</i> There is no parcel service to the Gulf.

 The Ministry of Defence has received representations from two ex-Service organisations, the Forces Pension Society and the Royal British Legion, and a small number of individuals affected. Those pensioners who have been found to have paid tax incorrectly have received from the Inland Revenue a refund of tax, and, in appropriate cases, the statutory repayment supplement. Officials are currently considering whether there is a case for any further payment to be made to compensate for the consequences of the error, and I would expect this work to be completed by the summer.

 The Ministry of Defence is committed to ensuring that its staff should use the most efficient and economic means of travel commensurate with meeting the Department's operational needs. To deliver this commitment, travel by rail is co-ordinated, managed and negotiated centrally within the MOD. Central negotiations are undertaken with the Association of Train Operating Companies and the MOD secures contracts for discounted travel.

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, who are responsible for the cemetery which contains the graves of nearly 11,000 British and Commonwealth graves from the two World Wars, took immediate action to remove the paint.

The French Government and the people of Etaples were greatly embarrassed by this regrettable incident and acted with commendable speed to condemn those individuals who carried out this shameful deed.

 Of the total debt currently owed to the UK Government by developing countries over 95 per cent. is owed to the Export Credits Guarantee Department.

 At the forthcoming Spring Meetings the UK will continue to promote a flexible approach to the additional debt relief or 'topping-up' that may be provided at Completion Point to ensure that countries that have had to contend with exogenous shocks benefit from a lasting exit from unsustainable debt. The UK will be seeking agreement that the calculation of topping-up should exclude the additional bilateral voluntary debt relief, to ensure fairer burden sharing among creditors and provide truly additional relief to HIPCs.

 The UK believes that structural reforms should focus on poverty reduction and strongly promotes the streamlining of IMF conditionality. The IMF, with the creation of Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) has been further improving its support to low-income countries. Conditionality has been reduced and streamlined, focusing on key areas of IMF responsibility; further progress has been made in supporting poverty and social impact analysis of key reforms and improved public expenditure management. The IMF is also discussing further improvements in, and increasing alignment of, the PRGF and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).

 The UK Government is committed to helping achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.

<P>

<a name="30408w09.html_para6">Debt relief will provide vital finance to help achieve the MDGs, but if overall aid resources were unevenly allocated in favour of debt relief, fewer resources would be available to finance poverty reduction in other countries perhaps equally poor but not highly indebted. It is important to maintain equity between the two thirds of low-income countries that are highly indebted and the other third that are not.

<a name="30408w10.html_para3">The A57/A628 and A14 schemes are expected to relieve the local road networks of traffic which is currently using those routes to avoid the trunk roads. This should result in a reduction of 9.125 million vehicle miles per year on local roads in the vicinity of the A57/A628 and 2.875 million vehicle miles per year on local roads around the A14. However an increase of up to 40 per cent. is expected in the traffic on the A628 corridor from induced traffic using the new bypass.
<P>

<a name="30408w10.html_para4">There is no reason to suggest that there will be a significant increase in road miles at A45/A46 Tollbar End as this is a junction improvement.

<a name="30408w10.html_para6">There will be an increase of 14,068 tonnes per year of carbon dioxide emissions on A57/A628 Mottram, Hollingworth and Tintwhistle Bypass, 4,835 tonnes per year on A14 Ellington&#151;Fen Ditton and 5,604 tonnes per year at A45/A46 Tollbar End.

 My officials are in contact with the industry to address the issue of demand for drivers.

The measures aim to recruit more young people to the industry, develop a UK specification lorry driver training simulator and will look at ways of protecting employer investment in training. The Modernisation Fund is intended as a pump-priming initiative and the industry must achieve a self-sustaining position where operators recruit, train and retain staff in sufficient numbers and with the relevant skills to support their future needs.

It is estimated that extending the statutory minimum half-fare travel concession to men aged 60&#150;64 would have cost about &#163;30 million.

<a name="30408w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We have provided an extra &#163;50 million in the local government finance settlement 2003&#150;04 to cover the additional cost of concessionary travel for men aged 60&#150;64 in England. This amount is distributed by Formula Spending Shares in the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services block, which take into account various factors such as deprivation and population density and sparsity. Because the distribution of this &#163;50 million was considered alongside other costs falling on local authorities in deriving the formulae, it is not possible to provide a meaningful FSS allocation for individual authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w15.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30408w15.html_para6">Virtually all of the debts of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries to the UK Government are owed to the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). The UK participates fully in the enhanced HIPC initiative under which bilateral creditors are typically required to offer 90 per cent. debt relief. These costs are borne entirely by ECGD and hence are additional to any aid spending by the UK.
<P>

<a name="30408w15.html_para7">The UK goes further than is required under the HIPC initiative and always provides 100 per cent. debt relief. The Department for International Development (DfID) reimburses ECGD for the cost of this additional bilateral voluntary debt relief. To ensure that funding for the HIPC Initiative is additional these costs are carefully considered and agreed in each spending review.
<P>

<a name="30408w15.html_para8">However, even the provision of 100 per cent. debt relief to all low-income countries would still fall short of the resources needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals. For this reason the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for International Development have proposed an International Finance Facility (IFF) that would seek to double the amount of development aid from just over US$50 billion a year today to $100 billion per year in the years to 2015.

 DFID's contingency reserve for 2003&#150;04 has been set at &#163;100 million, of which &#163;75 million has been earmarked for Iraq. We have allocated &#163;15 million to Iraq from other DFID budgets and have been allocated an additional &#163;120 million from the Treasury reserve for expenditure on Iraq.

 Recent reports from the UN Office for Project services (UNOPS) indicate that an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 people have been newly displaced in northern Iraq since the onset of the current crisis though some have returned to their homes. Approximately 90 per cent. of these are staying with families or friends. The needs of the remainder are being met by local authorities and humanitarian agencies.

 Much of my Department's work on renewable energy is undertaken through our Knowledge and Research (KaR) programme, which has, over recent years, included both technical and institutional issues to promote their use in developing countries. The technologies have included solar, wind, biomass and small hydropower.

 Rwanda is a very poor country with a recent history of genocide and great humanitarian needs. Scores against basic humanitarian indicators place Rwanda in the bottom half of most rankings within sub-Saharan Africa. However, the country is recovering from the genocide, and substantial development resources are being deployed in an attempt to lift its people out of poverty.
<P>

<a name="30408w16.html_para4">Earlier this year, unseasonably dry conditions over southern and eastern Rwanda in February and early March 2003 raised concerns about food security. However, an assessment in early March found that most household coping strategies (e.g. casual work and informal cross-border trade) were working well. Rains came in mid-March and food insecurity has since eased across the country.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what help is given to local education authorities in Somerset for teachers of dyslexia; and what the average size of grants for statemented children was in the last three years.  [107320]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Funding is not made available to support specific categories of special educational needs, nor is it made available directly for statemented children. Rather, funding is allocated and distributed via LEAs, who have a duty to provide appropriately for all children in their area, including children with statements.
<P>

<a name="30408w17.html_para2">Opportunities for professional development for teachers are supported through the special educational needs standard fund grant, from which Somerset LEA has received &#163;1.9 million in the years 2001&#150;04. One of this grant's objectives is to support special educational needs and disability training and professional development for teachers, learning support assistants and other staff. This is in addition to the &#163;614.5 million Somerset has received in Education Formula Spending Share (previously known as Education Standard Spending Assessment) in 2001&#150;04. It is for individual LEAs and schools to decide how they spend this funding, taking account of their statutory duties towards children with special educational needs.

has been asked. The table sets out the information requested in relation to <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i>. It also sets out <i>(c)</i> the reduction in Standards Fund grant between 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 as a result of the Government's commitment to reduce ringfenced funding for schools <i>(d)</i> the difference on a like-for-like basis between the total resources available for schools in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 and <i>(e)</i> the level of additional grant announced on 25 March. The purpose of the additional funding is not to compensate authorities for the loss of individual Standards Fund grants but to to ensure that the effective increase in total education funding for LEAs and schools between 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 is no less than 3.2 per cent. per pupil for all authorities.

 The national minimum wage does not apply to apprentices who are under the age of 19, or to apprentices aged 19&#150;25 and in the first 12 months of their apprenticeship. We do not routinely collect information on the wages paid to those undertaking a Modern Apprenticeship. However, the fourth report of the Low Pay Commission notes that the lowest quartile pay of apprentices aged 16&#150;25 was &#163;3.72 per hour according to the spring 2002 Labour Force Survey.

 Graham Island is the tip of a small volcano 30 miles off the coast of Sicily which emerges from the sea occasionally for short periods. In 1831 the Royal Navy claimed it but in 1832 it re-submerged. We doubt whether the 1831 claim subsists and have never sought to revive it. We understand that the Italian government claims the island.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1) what measures the Government is taking at the UN Security Council to ensure that the embargo on rough diamond sales and arms exports, and the travel ban on key personnel from Liberia will be extended and that a ban on timber exports will be adopted when these issues are discussed in May;  [105888]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w19.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The UN imposed sanctions on Liberia as a result of the Liberian Governments' complicity in fuelling the conflict in Sierra Leone. Liberia remains a serious threat to the stability of the sub-region. We believe sanctions should be maintained until Liberia stops its destabilising efforts in the region and meets in full the demands of the UN Security Council.
<P>

<a name="30408w19.html_para3">We share the concern of the UN Panel of Experts that the revenues from timber sales are being used to fund arms purchases in breach of UN sanctions. In resolution 1408(2002) the UN Security Council called on the Government of Liberia to undertake the audit of shipping and timber revenues and to use the revenues from the timber trade for social, development and humanitarian purposes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 We take a close interest and play an active role in the promotion of human rights in Sudan. This includes our strong support for the work of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (HCHR) there. The UK has until now been the main contributor of funding for the Office of the HCHR in Khartoum. As a member of the EU, the UK has consistently supported successive EU-sponsored resolutions at the UN Commission on Human Rights and the UN General Assembly. We believe that it is important to maintain the mandate of the Special Rapporteur as part of the general effort to improve the human rights situation in Sudan. The UNCHR is currently discussing human rights in Sudan in Geneva.

 We do not record the number of applicants who are advised to withdraw their application at the pre-assessment stage. To ask Posts to provide this information now would require them to carry out a manual search of their records. This could be done only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many asylum seekers the Home Office has placed through Clearsprings Ltd. in the last two years.  [107316]<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the level of employment of asylum seekers is in the UK.  [107322]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w22.html_spnew6"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The information requested is not available. Statistics on employment are not broken down by immigration status. Asylum seekers who had not applied for permission to work prior to 23 July 2002 are not entitled to work.
<P>

<a name="30408w22.html_para3">Information is not available on the numbers who previously sought asylum and were granted permission to work under the employment concession (which was abolished on 23 July 2002), and could be produced only at disproportionate cost. The concession allowed asylum seekers who had waited at least six months for an initial decision on their claim to apply for permission to work.
<P>

<a name="30408w22.html_para4">The concession was established when widespread delays occurred in the asylum system, and we always made it clear that we would review its operation in light of our on-going reforms to the asylum system. By the time I announced its abolition in July, it had become largely irrelevant and applicable to only a minority of applicants. In 2002 the number of asylum seekers awaiting an initial decision fell to the lowest level for more than 10 years.
<P>

<a name="30408w22.html_para5">Provisional data shows that 60 per cent. of applications (excluding withdrawals and third country cases) received in 2001&#150;02 had initial decisions reached and served within two months, 78 per cent. within four months and 84 per cent. within six months. We are committed, with our programme of increased resources and on-going legislative reforms, to further improving the speed of the system for new applicants.
<P>

<a name="30408w22.html_para6">We also believe that while we continued to operate the concession, an incorrect perception existed that all asylum seekers had permission to work while their cases were considered.

<a name="30408w22.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Liddell-Grainger: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the ethnic background will be of asylum seekers the Home Office plans to place in Sedgmoor.  [107324]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w22.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) bases its dispersal policy around the language groups that a cluster area is able to accommodate and for which there are local support services available. Dispersal to cluster areas does not take place solely on the ethnic background of an asylum seeker. The language groups for the Taunton and Bridgwater cluster area of which Sedgmoor is a part are still being finalised at present following consultation between NASS and the local consortia.

 The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) is committed to a full consultation process with the regional consortia on dispersal strategy. NASS consults with the consortia as to the number of asylum seekers that each cluster or region can successfully accommodate both from the integration angle and without causing/increasing racial tension in an area. The aim is to achieve a proportionate dispersal of asylum seekers both within cluster areas and across the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w22.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how much funding has been awarded to schemes under the reducing burglary initiative in Buckinghamshire in the last 12 months for which figures are available; and what targets have been set to reduce crime under the schemes.  [106767]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w22.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Reducing Burglary Initiative (part of the Crime Reduction Programme) ran from 1999 to 2002, and the last projects were approved in January 2001. Under the initiative we funded a total of four projects in Buckinghamshire.
<P>

<a name="30408w22.html_para7">In 1999&#150;2000, under round 1 of the initiative, two linked projects in High Wycombe were awarded funding. One project, in the Castlefield area, was awarded &#163;59,677, with a further &#163;11,623 awarded in 2000&#150;01. The other project, in the Downley area, was awarded &#163;59,677, with a further &#163;10,323 awarded in 2000&#150;01. Between them, the projects aimed to reduce burglary by 20 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30408w22.html_para8">In 2000&#150;01, under round 2, funding was awarded to two projects in Milton Keynes. One project, in Fenny Stratford Ward, was awarded &#163;7,560; it aimed to reduce burglary in a small residential neighbourhood by 20 per cent. The second project, in Netherfield, was awarded &#163;35,000 and aimed to reduce burglary by 30 per cent.

<a name="30408w23.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many young offenders have participated in family group conferencing since its inception in 1999 as set out in paragraph 2.17 of Command Paper 5778.  [106787]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w23.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Family group conferencing is one of a range of restorative approaches available to Youth Offending Teams to engage young offenders and their families to prevent re-offending. National figures are not available on family group conferencing but, as an example of its local development, in Essex between June 2000 and the end of March 2003, 77 family group conferences have taken place and eight are pending.

<P>
<a name="30408w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The issue of the commercial confidentiality of information received from organisations only becomes relevant if the question arises as to whether the information should be disclosed to another party. In such cases, the Home Office will respond in line with guidance on how to deal with commercially confidential information outlined in The Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

<a name="30408w23.html_para0">The Code of Practice contains a specific exemption&#151;exemption 13&#151;that protects commercially confidential information from being disclosed. In assessing whether information ought to be withheld under this exemption, officials must determine:

 Regulations have recently been changed so that officers joining the police now can be required to give a DNA sample as a condition of service; for officers who joined before that change, it continues to be a voluntary matter whether they give a sample or not. Samples from police officers are added to the Police Elimination Database (RED), not to the main National DNA Database (NDNAD). As at 28 February 2003, there were 61,800 records retained on the RED from English and Welsh police forces, about 48 per cent. of the number of serving officers. The purpose of the RED is to eliminate DNA which officers may unintentionally deposit at a crime scene that they attend in the course of police duties. As a substantial proportion of officers do not attend crime scenes, they have never been asked to provide a sample. If an officer is suspected of committing a crime, they may be required to give a sample for the National DNA Database in the same circumstances as other members of the public.

Friend the Home Secretary, attended two events in March where he spoke on Race and Diversity and Community Cohesion issues, attended by members of the Asian community. My noble Friend (Lord Filkin), who holds lead responsibility for community relations, has met two Sikh individuals and six Muslim, Hindu and Arab groups over the same time period.
<P>

<a name="30408w24.html_para8">It is important however to recognise that it is the nurturing of a variety of open communication channels between Government and a range of different representatives which is key to preserving good community relations in this country. The level and nature of this dialogue has significantly changed for the better since the previous Gulf conflict in 1991.
<P>

<a name="30408w24.html_para9">Lord Filkin has recently written to leading representatives of the Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and Sikh communities reassuring them of the Government's commitment to providing protection to all its citizens and communities, and encouraging them to report any incident that makes them feel frightened or insecure to the police.
<P>

<a name="30408w24.html_para10">We will of course continue both during and in the aftermath of the current conflict in Iraq, to give sympathetic consideration to any specific requests for meetings that we receive from individuals or groups representing particular communities.

<a name="30408w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Police Pension (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2003, which came into force on 1 April, amended certain provisions in the Police Pensions Regulations 1987 in order to underpin the new procedures agreed by the Police Negotiating Board on 30 January for the fairer and more consistent management of ill-health retirement. We consulted the Police Negotiating Board on the draft amendment regulations before they were made, but apart from drafting points we have received no representations about them.

 The Carter report, a copy of which was placed in the Library on 26 February 2002, was welcomed by Ministers at the time of its publication. Much work has been done to develop the issues raised in the recommendations, particularly those involving the development of a performance improvement programme and the development of large-scale multi-function prisons.

<a name="30408w25.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 6 March 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1243W, on prisons (1) how many prisoners were held in police cells in each year between 1995 and 2002; and if he will make a statement;  [106665]
<P>
<UL>(2) what his estimate is of how many prisoners will be held in police cells each year between 2003 and 2006.  [106664]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w25.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 From January 1995 to May 1995 an average of 205 prisoners a month, who would normally be held in Prison Service accommodation, were held in police cells under Operation Container. No prisoners were held in police cells from mid-1995 to July 2002. From 12 July 2002 to 20 December 2002 an average of 199 prisoners a month were held in police cells under Operation Safeguard.
<P>

<a name="30408w25.html_para6">It is not possible to predict how many prisoners will be held in police cells at any point in the future. The use of police cells is dependent on the population pressures at the time, and the number used can vary on a daily basis. Their use is carefully monitored by the Prison Service and every effort is made to locate prisoners held in police cells to a prison as soon as possible.

<a name="30408w25.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proportion of young prisoners with mental health needs since 1997 <i>(a)</i> had already had those needs identified and <i>(b)</i> were already receiving mental health services before coming into custody; and if he will make a statement.  [107201]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w25.html_spnew9"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The information sought is not available in the form requested. In 2000, the Office for National Statistics published a report, 'Psychiatric Morbidity amongst Young Offenders in England and Wales', which contained further analysis of data obtained during the survey of mental ill health in the prison population of England and Wales that it undertook in 1997. This report indicated that 13 per cent. of young men on remand, 11 per cent. of sentenced young men and 29 per cent. of all young women said they had received help or treatment for mental, nervous, or emotional problems in the year before they came into prison.




<P>
<P><I>8 Apr 2003 : Column 218W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30408w25.html_para7">Only people who had been in prison for less than two years were asked this question because it was felt that people who had been in prison for longer would not be able to recall the information accurately.
<P>

<a name="30408w25.html_para8">In comparison, 11 per cent. of young men on remand, 14 per cent. of sentenced young men and 23 per cent. of all young women reported receiving help for such problems in prison during the past year, or, if they had not been in custody that long, since coming into prison.
<P>

<a name="30408w25.html_para9">Young offenders who had been receiving help for mental or emotional problems in the year before coming into prison were more likely to report receiving such help while in prison. While 29 per cent. of young men on remand and 43 per cent. of women who said they had been receiving treatment before coming into prison reported receiving treatment in prison, this was true for only 8 per cent. and 16 per cent. respectively of those who had not had treatment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w25.html_spnew10"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 On the reception of a prisoner into a prison, information is collected by reception and health care staff. It includes personal details and any outstanding court appearances. An assessment is made of the prisoner's immediate physical and health care needs, and to identify recent substance abuse, and the potential for self-harm or harm to others. Prisoners are also asked about any urgent domestic issues and are permitted to make a phone call.

 There are three different types of intensive prison drug rehabilitation programmes. The average length of treatment intervention is given in the following table:

<P>
<a name="30408w25.html_spnew12"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 On arrival at Styal prison, each prisoner sees a doctor and has an opportunity to discuss any drug misuse problem. Statistics are not routinely collected on the number of women prisoners reporting drug misuse problems. However, those members of staff working with drug misusers at Styal estimate that over the last two years approximately 75 per cent. of the total number of receptions have had drug problems.

 In the Avon and Somerset probation area staff are regularly supervised by managers to assess workload issues and to enable effective workload management. The Probation Board has agreed a workload prioritisation framework with staff through their respective Trade Unions, which assists staff and managers to be clear about priorities in the event of a shortfall in resources. Specific training is provided for specialist staff.

<P>
<a name="30408w26.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Probation Officers benefit from a range of help to assist them in completing casework on time, including through training leading to a Diploma in Probation Studies. Home Office National Standards for the supervision of offenders in the community sets out minimum standards of expected performance. The National Probation Directorate (NPD) carries out regular performance monitoring and provides feedback to probation areas. NPD has produced a workload prioritisation framework, which has been issued to all areas, and has also developed a workload measurement project. Both of these provide guidance to areas to enable the active management of workload and ensure effective service delivery while maintaining a duty of care towards employees.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The White Paper "Respect and Responsibility", published on 12 March, takes account of views received from a variety of practitioners and members of the public up and down the country.
<P>

<a name="30408w26.html_para5">Young people are more likely to be the victims of anti-social behaviour than the perpetrators.

 Ministers at the Home Office have had no direct discussion with UNICEF on the Sexual Offences Bill. UNICEF UK has, however, provided useful contributions to the process which has brought the Bill before Parliament in the form of responses to the various consultation processes which preceded it. Most recently, UNICEF UK was one of approximately 40 organisations which responded to the publication of the command paper, 'Protecting the Public'; and one of those which responded to the recent, limited consultation on our proposals to reduce the period that sex offenders may plan to spend abroad before they are required to notify the police of their travel plans.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many staff in his Department, agencies and non-departmental public bodies receive paid leave to undertake union duties; how many days they are allocated; and what has been the cost to public funds in 2002.  [106768]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w26.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Employment Protection Act 1975 gave trade union officials a statutory right to reasonable paid time off from employment to carry out trade union duties. In the Civil Service, since April 1996, departments and agencies have been given the freedom to set their own levels of facility time and make other facilities available to their trade union accredited representatives.

<P>

<a name="30408w26.html_para6">In accordance with Departmental Facilities Agreements between the Home Office and recognised trade unions, 63 union representatives in the Home Office and its agencies receive up to 100 per cent. paid leave to undertake union duties. A further 820 accredited representatives are allocated 25 days a year to spend on union duties and 16 are allocated 40 days a year. Related costs in 2002 amounted to approximately &#163;4,759,000.

 We have included a proposal in the Licensing Bill, currently before Parliament, to enable the police to confiscate sealed alcohol containers, in addition to opened containers, from young people who are drinking in a public place, or where a police officer reasonably believes that the young person intends to drink alcohol in that public place. If Parliament approves these strengthened police powers we intend to bring them into force as soon as possible following Royal Assent, which we expect during the summer.

 The proposals put forward by each of the six shortlisted cities are being considered against the European Union's criteria, which are set out in Decision 1419/1999/EC, and the additional criteria set out by the Government in the document Criteria and Information for Applicants. The city which is selected as our nomination for European Capital of Culture 2008 will be the one which, in the opinion of the independent advisory panel and the Government, best meets all the criteria and will organise the most successful year-long programme in 2008.
<P>

<a name="30408w27.html_para0">Regeneration is not specifically mentioned in either the European Union's criteria or the Government's additional criteria. However, a number of the criteria relate to the development of the cultural infrastructure, architecture and the urban environment.

<a name="30408w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 As a result of the recommendations in the joint DCMS/Strategy Unit Report&#151;Game Plan&#151;and a Quinquennial Review, Sport England is undergoing a modernisation and restructuring programme which will turn it into a more strategic and customer focussed body. The programme will involve the devolution of more responsibility for funding decisions on community sports projects to its regional offices. These offices, in conjunction with reconstituted regional sports boards which will be sub-committees of Sport England, will prepare regional sports strategies reflecting national sports priorities in consultation with all interested organisations and agencies in the region. The regional strategies will inform funding decisions in the region.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w27.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The South West Regional Development Agency spent &#163;10,000 on tourism in 2001&#150;01 and awarded &#163;470,000 to be spent over two years in 2002&#150;03. The English Tourism Council granted &#163;536,770 (2001&#150;02) and &#163;537,766 (2002&#150;03) to South West Tourism. The South West also benefits from the work of the British Tourist Authority, which received &#163;49.7million (2001&#150;02) and &#163;54.5 million (2002&#150;03) from the Department, and the English Tourism Council, which received &#163;13.8 million (2001&#150;02) and &#163;15.4 million (2002&#150;03).

 Central Government support for domestic tourism in England during 2002 was provided via the English Tourism Council (ETC), which had no remit for promotion. In 2002, it concentrated on research and product development activity, as did Defra in respect of rural tourism. Following a review of priorities for the tourism industry, the roles of the ETC and British Tourist Authority were combined on 1 April 2003 to form VisitBritain, which will have marketing of England as its key domestic tourism role.

 Central Government's subsidy to local authorities for the administration of council tax benefit during 2000&#150;01 amounted to &#163;155.1 million. Of this sum, &#163;74.2 million was funded by this Department using a formula agreed with the Local Authority Associations, and based mainly on the size of the council tax benefit caseloads, with additional elements for accommodation and staffing costs.
<P>

<a name="30408w28.html_para6">The remaining &#163;80.9 million was funded by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Executive through the Revenue Support Grant (Grant Aided Expenditure in Scotland) within their local government finance settlements.

 The information is in the table. It shows the Government is spending less on the costs of unemployment&#151;so that the annual bill is now around &#163;5 billion lower than in 1996&#150;97.

 The Department welcomes the publication of the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI) report into maternity services at the Ashford and St. Peter's Hospitals national health service trust.

 Nurses have a significant contribution to make to the care of people with respiratory conditions. Pulmonary rehabilitation is increasingly offered in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly to older people, to help people achieve their highest level of function and independence. However, information on local service configuration in England such as the number of pulmonary rehabilitation services, and their staffing profile, is not collected centrally.

 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is currently developing a guideline on the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary and secondary care. NICE is due to publish the guideline in 2004.

 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued its full guidance on the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for diabetes in February 2003. The guidance states that insulin pump therapy is an option for some people with Type 1 diabetes.

 The Department of Health published the "Dual Diagnosis Good Practice Guide" as an addition to the "Mental Health Policy Implementation Guide" in May 2002. The guide explicates the policy and good practice in the provision of mental health services to people with severe mental health problems and problematic misuse of any drug including alcohol but not tobacco.
<P>

<a name="30408w30.html_para6">The National Treatment Agency for substance misuse (NTA), in partnership with the Department of Health, has recently published "Models of Care", which sets out a national framework for the commissioning of an integrated drug treatment system for adult drug misusers in England. This includes detailed guidance on provision of services for psychiatric co-morbidity (dual diagnosis) and the document also cross-references the "Dual Diagnosis Good Practice Guide" for mental health services.
<P>

<a name="30408w30.html_para7">The Department of Health also commissioned the Royal College of Psychiatrists to publish an information manual for multi-disciplinary practitioners based on expert review of the evidence and its implications for safe and effective practice entitled "Co-existing Problems of Mental Disorder and Substance Misuse (Dual Diagnosis)&#151;An Information Manual" in 2001.

 To date, 42 national health service acute trusts are making use of NHS Professionals, which represents 17 per cent. of all NHS acute trusts. In addition 13 other NHS trusts are making use of NHS Professionals. The Government's aim is that by April 2005 all NHS trusts should be using the NHS Professionals service exclusively to source temporary nursing staff.
<P>

<a name="30408w31.html_para7">Currently, each provider of NHS Professionals has sourced their own facilities and information technology (IT) solutions. The new special health authority for NHS Professionals will be responsible for the future long-term strategy for the core business processes of the NHS Professionals service, including call centre management, employment services, payroll, payments to agencies, invoicing trusts, management reporting and IT. National targets for the expansion of NHS Professionals were set out in Health Service Circular (HSC) 002/2001 published 16 February 2001.
<P>

<a name="30408w31.html_para8">The new special health authority for NHS Professionals will be responsible for the future long-term strategy for training. Criminal records checks will be carried out on NHS Professionals nurses as laid down in Departmental Guidelines. In common with checks for other staff groups, theses are subject to some delay at the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) but the position is improving. Such checks are not mandatory except in the case of appointments to posts caring for children within the terms of the Protection of Children Act 1999, which require a check to be made against the Protection of Children Act List. In these cases, a fast-track facility for checks is available at the CRB.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Community pharmacists have an important part to play in our plans to expand national health service services, thereby relieving pressures on general practitioners whilst making better use of their own skills. They already provide advice on minor ailments and sell a wide range of medicines which help people take care of their own health. Patient group directions can enable pharmacists to supply groups of patients direct with prescription-only medicines.
<P>

<a name="30408w32.html_para7">Pharmacists are increasingly involved in providing support and detailed advice to patients and to doctors on the use of medicines. The first repeat dispensing schemes will begin shortly. Pharmacists will supply medicines for up to a year, without the patient needing to go back to their general practitioner for a further prescription. Later this year, the first pharmacists will become supplementary prescribers. With the patient's

<P>

<a name="30408w32.html_para8">The new general medical services contract proposes new ways to assess whether services could be offered by other health professionals, especially where these services could be accessed more easily and more cost-effectively than through traditional general practice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w32.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Under the National Health Service Act 1977, it is the responsibility of national health service primary care trusts (PCTs) to arrange the provision of pharmaceutical services in their area. This includes determining whether it is necessary or desirable to secure adequate provision of services by granting new applications. The Health and Social Care Act 2001 also empowers PCTs to devise contracts for local pharmaceutical services which address particular local needs.
<P>

<a name="30408w32.html_para9">In January 2003, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) published a report, which recommended that there should be no controls on the opening of new NHS pharmacies. In answer to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann), on 26 March, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, announced that the Government favours change to open up the market and to improve quality and access, so that more NHS patients can use the skills of community pharmacists for advice, information and services. The OFT report had also noted that in a more competitive environment problems could arise through the possible effect of deregulation on the ability of patients in some areas to access high quality pharmacy services. The Government is therefore examining these issues further. It intends to come forward with a balanced package of proposals before Parliament rises in the summer.

 Securing adequate numbers in the pharmacy work force and developing the roles of pharmacists and their staff are central to the success of our pharmacy strategy. There are over a third more new pharmacy students now than 10 years ago. We forecast a 12 per cent. increase in the pharmacist work force between 1998 and this year. New schools of pharmacy should provide additional graduates from 2007 onwards. At the Department's request, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain has established a pharmacy work force planning and policy advisory group to scope future work force needs and advise on managing supply and demand. The group is expected to report in 2004.

The review will enable us to consider regulatory and other changes affecting the historic environment that have been introduced since PPG 15 was issued in September 1994 and to consider the extent to which these should be reflected in updated guidance. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister aims to publish draft revised guidance later this year for public consultation and this will provide the opportunity for representations to be made.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what progress has been made in meeting the commitment made by his Department in April 2002 to improve the collection of data concerning the number of possession orders and evictions by social landlords; and what discussions have taken place with the Lord Chancellor's Department about this issue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w33.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Discussions between the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Court Service are continuing and we remain committed to finding ways of achieving a better breakdown of the data currently collected on the number of possession actions and evictions by social landlords. Enhancing the data will enable us to monitor trends on possession actions and improve our understanding of the causes of homelessness.

<a name="30408w33.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what action he is taking to promote urban renewal.  [107149]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w33.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Government's policies for delivering an urban renaissance were set out in the Urban White Paper, "Our Towns and Our Cities: the Future", published in November 2000. This provides the framework within which Government policies and programmes affecting urban areas in England are co-ordinated.
<P>

<a name="30408w33.html_para5">In February 2003, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister launched "Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future"&#151;a &#163;22 billion action programme to improve housing and communities, including over &#163;5 billion to regenerate deprived areas. This programme builds on the policies and actions in the Urban White Paper and the Rural White Paper, "Our Countryside: the Future".
<P>

<a name="30408w33.html_para6">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is investing over &#163;4 billion through the Neighbourhood Renewal National Strategy Action Plan to tackle deprivation, and extend prosperity and opportunity to the poorest neighbourhoods in the country. This money is used to encourage the better targeting of services and mainstream public funds to the most deprived areas and to provide evidence of best practice through pathfinder programmes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w33.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister when he expects to publish the research commissioned by his Department in 1999 into youth homelessness as part of the Homeless Action Partnership <i>(a)</i> to provide a reliable estimate of the number of young people affected by various types of homelessness and <i>(b)</i> to provide a tool kit for local authorities to produce accurate figures locally; and how much has been spent on each of these pieces of research.  [103133]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30408w33.html_spnew11"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Two research projects were commissioned in 1999 to assist the Youth Homelessness Action Partnership. The first looked at the effectiveness of a range of initiative working with young people to prevent homelessness. Publication of a good practice guide and a research summary is planned for late spring 2003.
<P>

<a name="30408w33.html_para7">The second study, to investigate methods of estimating numbers of young homeless people and to provide a local authority toolkit, has proved much more problematic because of the difficulties in achieving reliable estimates. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no plans, therefore, to publish this work.
<P>

<a name="30408w33.html_para8">The costs of the work were &#163;78,918 and &#163;67,517 respectively.
