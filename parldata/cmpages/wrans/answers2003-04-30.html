<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. John Reid: </B> 
 My Department has a commitment that there should be no unfair treatment of staff on the basis of age. The Privy Council Office has implemented the recommendations of the Performance and Innovation Unit report, "Winning the Generation Game", in particular that permanent staff can stay on up to the age of 65 subject to operational requirements.

 The Government supports causes of a charitable nature (such as international development, help for elderly people and animal welfare) through the relevant Departments, whose programmes include work through the voluntary sector. The Government has also demonstrated its support through the Budget 2000 'Getting Britain Giving' package of tax reliefs to encourage charitable giving, and further reforms in Budget 2002. Tax reliefs are now worth &#163;2 billion a year to charities.
<P>

<a name="30430w01.html_para2">The Treasury itself supports charities through practical means. Both Treasury and the Inland Revenue have provided secondments to the Giving Campaign which is also funded jointly by the Inland Revenue and the charitable sector; we have opened the Payroll Giving scheme to our own staff; and we are considering donating life-expired computer equipment for use in developing countries.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will set out the basis for his calculations of increased corporation tax receipts, as summarised in paragraph C46 of Budget 2003.  [110228]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The increase in corporation tax receipts shown in Budget 2003 is largely due to the expectation that financial company profits will return to their medium-term trends as recovery in the world economy becomes more firmly established and gathers pace.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 No macroeconomic modelling has been done of the impact of early retirement on the economy over the next 10 years. Increased early retirement in the near future would tend to reduce the supply of labour available to employers and so, all other things equal, potentially reduce the growth of employment and output in the near future. However the recent pensions Green Paper explained that the average UK age of withdrawal from the labour force of retirement is relatively high compared to most other EU member states, and set out a range of measures to enable those wishing to work for longer to do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w01.html_spnew12"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 There are several measures of inflation published monthly by the ONS, including RPIX and HICP.

 In order to provide a complete picture of changes in saving patterns over time, one would need disaggregated household data covering all asset classes&#151;from liquid financial savings to longer-term investments such as pensions and housing&#151;as well as debt. Such a comprehensive survey of assets and debt does not currently exist in the UK. However, as the recent pensions Green Paper made clear, it is essential to develop good-quality data about people's saving over time; their overall assets; and the savings and assets of partners. Action is being taken to address these issues. The Office for National Statistics recently reviewed pension contribution statistics. This review highlighted a number of new data sources that are currently planned or under way, including a survey of assets and wealth.

<a name="30430w03.html_wqn1"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many cubic metres of low-grade nuclear waste from decommissioned power stations have recently been identified by the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee.  [109621]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee's (RWMAC's) Advice to Ministers on the Management of Low Activity Solid Radioactive Wastes Within the United Kingdom was published in March 2003. What the Committee pointed out is that as nuclear site decommissioning plans, including those on which nuclear power stations have operated, progress, and radioactive contamination is identified and characterised, substantial volumes of building rubble and soil with levels of contamination at the bottom of the low level waste activity range&#151;of the order of that of the very low level wastes produced by small users&#151;are being identified. Initial estimates of volumes are set out in Annex 4 of the RWMAC report and amount in total to more than 3,300,000 cubic metres, of which more than 3,000,000 cubic metres is attributed to the Sellafield site. The Committee believe that a substantial proportion of this very low activity waste from nuclear site decommissioning and clean-up activities has not been included in past inventories, although they acknowledge that, at this stage, estimates are very approximate.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w03.html_wqn2"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what definition of nuclear waste was used as the criterion for inclusion in the Government inventory of nuclear waste.  [109622]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The latest 2001 United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory describes four categories of waste&#151;high level wastes, intermediate level wastes, low level wastes and very low level wastes. The definitions of these categories correspond with those given in the 1995 White Paper, "Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy: Final Conclusions" (Cm2919). The inventory records total UK stocks and projected future arisings under the first three of these categories, based on latest estimates provided by those responsible for the wastes. The fourth, the very low level wastes category, which is intended to apply in particular to wastes produced by "small users" of radioactivity&#151;such as hospitals, universities, research laboratories 



<P>
<P><I>30 Apr 2003 : Column 382W</I><P>
and non-nuclear industries&#151;contains very little radioactivity, and no central records of arisings are compiled or contained in the inventory.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w03.html_wqn3"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what method is to be used to dispose of the low-level nuclear waste recently identified by the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee.  [109623]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 This is a matter for those responsible for the waste to propose, and to secure, regulatory agreement. All disposals of radioactive waste must be the subject of application to, and authorisation by, the environment agencies&#151;the Environment Agency in England and Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in Scotland&#151;operating under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and in accord with current UK Government and Devolved Administration radioactive waste management policy.

<a name="30430w06.html_para8">The MOD has recently conducted a detailed review of its response to the threat from international terrorism. The Home Office and other Departments and agencies were involved in this work, and the MOD actively sought the views of the public. The results were published in the White Paper, "The Strategic Defence Review: A New Chapter" (CM5566 volume 1), presented to Parliament on 18 July 2002. These include improvements to the regional command and control mechanism across the United Kingdom, the formation of 14 Civil Contingencies Reaction Forces (drawing on the Armed Forces Reserves) and an enhanced role for 2 Signal Brigade. All of these improvements are designed to enhance the MOD's capacity to provide support in the event of a serious terrorist incident in the UK. These enhancements are currently being implemented, at an estimated cost to the defence budget of &#163;60 million over four years.

Since 17 April 2003, delegates from the 10 EU accession states have also been invited to attend most EU committees, including the Visa Working Party, as active observers. The Visa Working Party holds a regular meeting once a month, and occasional extraordinary meetings are held as necessary. It discusses a range of EU-related visa matters relating mainly to the development of a common visa policy under the Schengen acquis, including the introduction of a uniform format visa. This forms part of the process of negotiation which culminates in legislative proposals being considered by the Council of Ministers. Domestically, such legislative proposals are submitted to Parliament under established scrutiny procedures and are considered and reported on by the House of Lords European Union Committee, the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee, and the devolved administrations in Wales and Scotland.

 Deliberate refusal to obey any court order (breach) is contempt of court that can be punished with a fine or imprisonment. The court might also consider a change in the child's place of residence.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>November 2002&#151;January 2003 (advertising at local cinemas, on local radio stations and on outdoor poster sites)</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para7">Other marketing activity has been focused on communicating with stakeholders, practitioners and the wider public via specialist, sector and regional press.
<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para8">At a national level, the total expenditure on the above nationally funded marketing to date has been &#163;3,446,898.21.
<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para9">Individual partnerships receive grant funding from the Department to provide services for young people. Part of that grant is spent on marketing. The National Unit does not require partnerships to provide information on spend to the level of detail that would allow a meaningful figure to be provided for the total expenditure for all partnerships to date.
<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para10">The effectiveness of Connexions' national marketing is evaluated in two ways tracking research conducted pre and post advertising activity and quarterly media evaluation to assess the effectiveness of our media activity and penetration across our target audiences.
<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para11">Tracking research was conducted for both bursts of advertising to assess its effectiveness by monitoring levels of awareness of Connexions among 13&#150;19 year olds. Following the February to March advertising campaign, awareness of Connexions among young people rose from 27 per cent. to 36 per cent. Pre-advertising research also showed that 32 per cent. of young people didn't know what Connexions was&#151;this figure fell to 19 per cent. following the advertising.
<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para12">Research conducted before the second burst of advertising in November 2002 recorded awareness levels of 35 per cent.. Following the advertising this figure increased to 51%. Young people also reported that their use of the Service during the period of the advertising rose from 9 per cent. to 16 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para13">Separate ongoing evaluation of media coverage for the Connexions Service is also conducted. The latest report (to the end of January 2003) shows that reach among adults in England is at 39 per cent. with 100 per cent. of articles appearing in the last quarter as strongly or slightly favourable.

: To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what involvement young people have had in the design and delivery of services provided by Connexions; and through what mechanisms this involvement has occurred.  [109730]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 One of the key principles of Connexions is that Partnerships will listen to, and take account of, the views of young people in the design, delivery and evaluation of the service. In the first operational year over 18,000 young people were involved in shaping the service through local activity and at a national level. All Partnerships employ at least one person with responsibility for youth participation and they support youth forums and other activities.
<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para16">Connexions has involved young people in a variety of ways. Young people from all backgrounds and ages have been involved. They have undertaken specific roles, ranging from consultation to peer research.
<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para17">Young people have played a key role in the selection of Partnership staff up to and including Chief Executives.
<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para18">Young people have also helped to develop guidance for Connexions Partnerships on such subjects as involving young people in the governance of Connexions Partnerships, developing Connexions Youth Charters and involving 'hard to reach' young people.
<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para19">Their feedback has directly influenced policies and procedures. Over 200 one stop shops have been established as a result of young people's views.




<P>
<P><I>30 Apr 2003 : Column 405W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para20">The achievements of Connexions in actively involving young people were recognised in December 2002 by being awarded runner up status in the Young People's category of the Institute of Public Policy Research/Guardian Public Involvement Awards.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w09.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Hendry: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what strategy the Connexions service has to enhance the effectiveness of voluntary organisations working with young people.  [109732]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 In October 2002, the Connexions Service National Unit published its "Strategy for Engaging the Voluntary and Community Sector in Connexions". That strategy includes many actions which will enhance the effectiveness of voluntary organisations working with young people. Examples include the creation of "VCS Liaison Officer" type posts to encourage the participation of smaller organisations and to provide information and support; VCS representation on Connexions Boards and other local fora; establishment of a Good Practice Database; development of a set of clear goals and performance indicators for Connexions Partnerships working with the VCS and newsletter and electronic mailing.
<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para21">Connexions Partnerships will decide how to implement the strategy locally, including any grant awards for capacity building.
<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para22">In addition the Department for Education and Skills' National Voluntary Youth Organisation (NVYO) Grant Scheme is the only source of direct Government support for the voluntary youth sector. The current cycle of grants to the headquarters of 90 NVYOs supports a total of 98 projects.
<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para23">DfES has also made allocations from the "Transforming Youth Work Development Fund" to the NVYOs. &#163;2 million was allocated in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;1 million in 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="30430w09.html_para24">A further aspect of the DfES' strategy is the Neighbourhood Support Fund (NSF). The NSF supports local (and often small) voluntary and community organisations to provide innovative projects, and aims to create and develop local capacity to address the issues associated with the hardest to reach young people. There are currently around 650 NSF projects within 40 of the most deprived local authority areas with a total budget of &#163;60 million (until September 2003). In the next phase we plan to embed NSF fully into Connexions.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w09.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Our guidance to connexions partnerships requires them to involve employers on their Boards. In some cases the independent Chair has a business background. We also encourage the inclusion of local employers on local management committees.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w09.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Connexions Partnerships are required to operate within the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. Bespoke personal adviser training and guidance to partnerships on the professional conduct of personal advisers and the assessment of young people's needs cover confidentiality. They make it clear that personal advisers should work with the informed consent of the young person.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Planning Duties under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 require local education authorities (LEAs) in England to develop accessibility strategies and schools to develop accessibility plans. LEAs must make their strategies available for inspection to interested parties at reasonable times. Schools must publish information about their accessibility plans in their governors' report to parents. LEAs strategies and school plans were required to be in place by 1 April 2003.
<P>

 The Department does not keep statistics on how many children fail to gain a place at the school of their choice at primary, secondary and special schools. Individual local education authorities may have information. Collecting reliable data is difficult, because many parents apply for places at more than one school and it may not be clear which is their first preference. Research published by the Department in June 2001 suggested that, nationally, 96 per cent. of parents receive an offer of a place at at least one of the schools for which they express a preference.

 The Department for Education and Skills does not itself have any PFI contracts. It has a PPP arrangement for the provision of the Connexions Card but this does not involve Amey pic. The Department does not have any agencies but is responsible for a number of Non Departmental Public Bodies which are separate contracting authorities. Schools PFI contracts in England are between Local Authorities and the private sector and 56 such contracts have been signed to date. Typically they are contracts for between 25 and 30 years. Two of these contracts involve consortia including Amey pic. However, since contract signature Amey has sold its equity stake in these projects although it continues to deliver support services. The position of equity holders in projects can vary over time but this does not necessarily impact on the quality, continuity or the ongoing financial viability of the project itself. The procurement process includes an assessment of the financial viability of bids to ensure they are robust over the long term and the contracts include arrangements for dealing with possible early termination.

<a name="30430w12.html_para5">Since the publication of the White Paper in May 2002, there has not been any specific development of this Department's training and development programmes to raise awareness of devolution and regional awareness, but the recent launch of "Delivering Through People: A Human Resource Strategy for DfES" commits the Department to developing HR action plans to maximise the contribution of each of our four sites in delivering the Department's business.

<a name="30430w12.html_para6">Interchange is the exchange of staff between the civil service and other public and private sector organisation in the regions for periods of a few weeks up to five years. Interchange promotes better understanding between organisations and is a practical and effective form of personal development as it gives staff first hand experience of a different work environment and the issue and challenges which the people working in it face. Secondees have an opportunity to learn new skills, new ways of working, and new ways of dealing with problems. The DfES is actively committed to making interchange available to peoples at all levels as it can be a real benefit to the individual and to the Department as a whole.
<P>

<a name="30430w12.html_para7">From 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2003 interchange between HQ an organisations in the regions was 368, an increase of 9 per cent. on the previous year.

The signatories to the Agreement, including unions and employers, are now ensuring that it becomes a reality in schools. From this September, for example, a range of administrative activities that have routinely been undertaken by teachers will be transferred to support staff and information and communications technology. Resources are being made available to enable schools to recruit at least an additional 50,000 full-time equivalent support staff over the lifetime of this Parliament.

 The Department of Health is committed to transforming the health and social care system so that it produces faster, fairer services that deliver better health and tackle inequalities. For example, we have established a young people's reference group as part of the Quality Protects Programme so that we can hear the contemporary views of young people as we develop policy affecting them. In March 2001 we published a national service framework (NSF) for older people, which sets as a priority the elimination of age discrimination in access to, and quality of, health and social care services offered to older people. The NSF provides a programme of actions and milestones to be achieved over the next 10 years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will estimate the total cost to the NHS in England of <i>(a)</i> prescription charge evasion fraud and <i>(b)</i> measures to help reduce prescription charge evasion, including payments to pharmacists, in real terms, in each year since prescription charges were introduced; and if he will make a statement.

risk measurement exercises (accurate to plus or minus 1 per cent.) designed to reveal levels of losses and, through repeated exercises, reduction in such losses. The National Audit Office have audited this process and are satisfied to its accuracy. Phase one of these exercises (examining patient fraud losses) included pharmaceutical patient fraud. The following table details the results.

<a name="30430w15.html_para6">A statistically valid sample of those prescriptions prescribed during March 2003 has been taken for a further measurement exercise to be completed. Further fraud reductions are anticipated and the figures will be produced later this year.
<P>

<a name="30430w15.html_para7">There was no accurate measurement of pharmaceutical patient fraud prior to the commencement of these exercises in 1998&#150;99.
<P>

<a name="30430w15.html_para8">Point of dispensing (PoD) checks were introduced in all community pharmacies on 1 April 1999 to help deter this type of fraud. The check requires pharmacists to ask patients, who are claiming free prescriptions, if they have evidence to support their claim to exemption from prescription charges.
<P>

<a name="30430w15.html_para9">In 1998&#150;99, pharmacists received an addition to their global sum, of &#163;1.85 million, for set-up costs to enable PoD checks to commence. In 1999&#150;2000, a sum of &#163;12.25 million, (at 1998&#150;99 prices) for undertaking PoD checks was incorporated within the overall figure, representing 1.67 per cent. of the global sum. This sum covers pharmacists' NHS remuneration and has been uprated annually since then. The proportion for PoD checks is not separately identified.
<P>

<a name="30430w15.html_para10">Where a patient wrongly fails to pay any amount in respect of NHS charges or obtains goods or services to which they are not entitled, the amended National Health Service Act 1977 (sections 122A and 122B) provides for a civil penalty charge to be imposed. The penalty charge is calculated as five times the recoverable amount, up to a maximum of &#163;100, in addition to the original charge. In cases of non-payment a surcharge of up to &#163;50 may be imposed. Between 1 August 2001 and 31 March 2003 &#163;1,362,000 has been recovered through the penalty charge system.

<P>
<a name="30430w16.html_wqn0"><B> Joyce Quin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what progress his Department has made towards the aim in the White Paper, Your Region, Your Choice, of assessing the balance of staff between the centre and the regions in terms of effective policy design and implementation; and what examples there have been since the publication of the White Paper of the Department deciding between locating new streams of work <i>(a)</i> in and <i>(b)</i> outside London and the South East;  [108573]

<P>
<UL>(2) what progress the Department has made towards the goal set out in the White Paper, Your Region, Your Choice, of <i>(a)</i> ensuring that regional awareness and devolution feature strongly in Civil Service training and development, <i>(b)</i> increasing the mobility of civil servants between headquarters offices, regional offices, and the Government Offices and <i>(c)</i> encouraging interchange between the civil service and organisations in the regions.  [108583]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 In the Department of Health, over 40 per cent. of the Department's 4,900 staff are now based outside London and the south-east, including nearly 1,000 headquarters staff in Leeds. The Department's regional directors of public health and their teams are based in the Government offices of the regions. In addition, from October 2002, 28 strategic health authorities&#151;located around the country&#151;have assumed a range of functions previously undertaken by the Department. Further progress towards effective decentralisation is a major component of the Department's current change programme, which will in turn be reflected in training and development priorities. In the meantime, staff awareness of regional and devolution issues is being raised by a variety of means, including intranet sites, staff interchange, and extensive day-to-day contact with regional and local services.

The primary diagnosis is the first of seven diagnosis fields in the HES data set, and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.3. Figures in this table have not yet been adjusted for shortfalls in data.Waiting time statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and waiting times for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment at a given point in time and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the waiting time as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.The data has been cumulated from grouped waiting time counts of admissions. An admission classified in the category 'more than 6 months' would also be counted in the 'more than 3 months' category. Total in year admissions from waiting list and booked cases can be calculated as the sum of the counts for 'under 3 months' and 'more than 3 months'.<i>Source:</i><P>

<UL>(2) whether the Child Support Agency is able to make deduction from earnings orders against liable persons not resident in the United Kingdom but employed by a company based or registered in the United Kingdom; and in how many cases this has been done.  [109889]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w17.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 To make a deductions from earnings order the Child Support Agency needs only to know the name and address of the employer which must be registered in the UK; not necessarily based in the UK. Before the Deductions from Earnings Order is made the non-resident parent must be notified of his child support maintenance liability and any arrears. This may be done via his employer, for example if no home address is known. The non-resident parent must also be notified by his employer of the amounts to be deducted from earnings.
<P>

<a name="30430w17.html_para0">We do not have information available to identify such cases. There are around 9,000 non-resident parents with a deductions from earnings order for whom the agency does not hold a valid postcode, these will include cases where the non-resident parent lives abroad.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what procedures are in place to claim child support from liable persons not resident in the United Kingdom; and in how many cases these have been applied.  [109890]<P>

: A non-resident parent who is not habitually resident in the United Kingdom but works for a company whose payroll is based in the UK may be liable for child support under the Child Support Act 1991. Wholly reliable information is not available; the best estimate is that in 2002&#150;03 the Child Support Agency was able take such action in fewer than 200 cases. In other cases child maintenance can be applied for through the relevant courts in the country where the non-resident parent resides.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what percentage of local authorities spent their total allocation for Discretionary Housing Payments in 2001&#150;02; how many claimants applied for assistance; how many were awarded DHPs; and what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the scheme.  [105970]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30430w17.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Discretionary Housing Payments replaced exceptional hardship and exceptional circumstance payments from 2 July 2001. The scheme is funded in part by a central Government contribution to each local authority and any unspent contribution is returnable. Authorities may also spend more than the Government contribution, up to an overall limit.




<P>
<P><I>30 Apr 2003 : Column 435W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30430w17.html_para1">406 local authorities provided expenditure figures for the period 2 July 2001 to 31 March 2002, of which 3.9 per cent. spent their total Government contribution or more. Figures are not collected centrally on the number of people who apply for or receive Discretionary Housing Payments. However, statistical returns from 404 authorities show that a total of 20,563 awards were made between 2 July 2001 and 31 March 2002 <sup>1</sup> .
<P>

<a name="30430w17.html_para2">We have commissioned the University of Birmingham to carry out a research project on how the Discretionary Housing Payment arrangements are operating. This will help us to determine a more effective mechanism of setting and distributing the Government's contribution to Discretionary Housing Payments for future years. The project is expected to report its findings later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what progress his Department has made towards the goal set out in the White Paper, Your Region, Your Choice, of <i>(a)</i> ensuring that regional awareness and devolution feature strongly in Civil Service training and development, <i>(b)</i> increasing the mobility of civil servants between headquarters offices, regional offices and the Government Offices and <i>(c)</i> encouraging interchange between the Civil Service and organisations in the regions.

 Staff within The Department are expected to be knowledgeable about the requirements and features of local labour markets, social trends and patterns and any legislative or funding issues which affect their region. Managers at various levels in our regional and district structure frequently obtain briefings, statistics concerning local labour market and other social trends. In addition, Policy makers and other Senior Managers are expected to maintain very close links and nurture relationships with Regional Development Agencies and other Government bodies and NGOs. This helps supplement knowledge gained from other sources, such as briefing information.

<a name="30430w17.html_para3">Arrangements have been developed, as part of the programme of work to establish the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), to facilitate movement of staff between the component businesses of DWP. These Regional Change Implementation Programme Executive (RECIPE) arrangements ensure that migration of staff between and within businesses is effectively managed to avoid surpluses and shortfalls of staff, including movement of staff between headquarters and regional offices. RECIPE groups also liaise with other government departments and the Government Office in their region to ensure, for example, a coordinated approach to recruitment, and to facilitate inter-departmental moves.
<P>

<a name="30430w17.html_para4">DWP is an outward facing department and encourages its staff to. undertake interchange with a wide range of organisations, in particular those at a regional and local level, many of whom are our partners in the delivery of our business. Centrally held interchange records do not provide detailed breakdowns of all interchange activity and records of activity undertaken during 2002&#150;03 are still to be collated from the regions and businesses. There have been positive moves undertaken by the DWP central Interchange Team to work with Government Offices on encouraging interchange between this department and the regions. The team has attended Interchange events in Government Office&#151;North East and in London. In addition, the team has presented DWP Interchange proposals at the Heads of Personnel Forum in GO South West. Very recently the team has engaged with GO North East Staffing Forum to encourage interchange between our department and civil service departments in the region. Finally the DWP central team has developed strong working relationships in establishing opportunities for interchange with a number of government departments including: the Inland Revenue, Home Office and Cabinet Office.

 The Government aims to deliver the Manifesto commitment to improve services for older people by better integrating health, housing, benefits and social care into a "third age service". To this end we are now managing the 6 Care Direct pilots in the South West to identify good working practices and incorporate them into improved local services.
<P>

<a name="30430w17.html_para5">The Department has also been making considerable progress in working with other service providers e.g. Department of Health, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Local Authorities and the Voluntary Sector (Age Concern, RNIB, NACAB), assessing current services and identifying opportunities for integration. Partnership working is being developed between The Pension Service, Local Authorities with social care responsibilities, Primary Care Trusts and the Voluntary Sector.




<P>

<P>

<a name="30430w17.html_para6">We are also looking at other opportunities beyond the Care Direct pilots to deliver services which can offer face to face contact for customers unable to use the telephone. These will build on existing initiatives offering a single point of contact through local surgeries or home visit.
