<a name="90524w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 April 1999]:</i> No formal assessment has been made of the environmental impact of herbicide-resistant oil seed rape varieties created by conventional plant breeding methods or the adequacy of the regulatory systems for crops created by conventional plant breeding in respect of their potential environmental impact.
<P>

<a name="90524w02.htm_para0">However, concern over the environmental implications of herbicide-tolerant crops (whether produced by genetic modification or conventional methods) have been raised on several occasions by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE), in particular in their annual reports for 1996-97 and 1998.
<P>

<a name="90524w02.htm_para1">The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is co-funding research on the management of genetically modified herbicide tolerant crops through the so-called BRIGHT project.
<P>

<a name="90524w02.htm_para2">The guidelines developed by the industry grouping SCIMAC (Supply Chain Initiative on Modified Agricultural Crops) for growing herbicide tolerant crops also applies to both conventionally bred and genetically modified crops.
<P>

<a name="90524w02.htm_para3">In their report on the EC Regulation of Genetic Modification in Agriculture at paragraph 178, the House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities recommended that, from now on, any crop with novel traits which may have the potential to impact significantly on the environment should be subject to an oversight system.
<P>

<a name="90524w02.htm_para4">In responding, the Government recognised that regulating on the basis of process rather than product could lead to anomalies and undertook to ask ACRE to advise what might be done to address the issue raised by the Committee. ACRE have now taken this task on. However the Government consider it right that the focus is on the genetic modification of organisms since this can result in the crossing of species barriers where potential risks have to be particularly carefully assessed and managed. The EC legislation on genetically modified organisms reflects this view.

 The Government announced on 31 July 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>637</i>, their intention to seek to establish, when a suitable legislative opportunity arises, an independent national police authority for the British Transport Police (BTP). Subject to Parliament's approval the legislation would also place the jurisdiction of the BTP for all railway land (including the London Underground and the Docklands Light Railway) on a statutory basis. Following consultation the Home Secretary is also considering an extension to the BTP's jurisdiction outside the railways in specific circumstances. If acceptable this would also be included within the legislation. My officials meet regularly with senior officers from the BTP to discuss a range of issues.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Department follows the advice of the "Green guide for managers on the government estate", published in March 1999 to promote more sustainable construction. This guidance refers to the importance of using recycled materials and ensuring future recyclability in obtaining best value. The Environment Agency has adopted a target for the engineering works it procures that 20 per cent. of the aggregates used should be from secondary sources, while the Highways Agency is encouraging the adoption of material specifications which make recycling technically practical.
<P>

<a name="90524w02.htm_para5">The Department is helping the Government Construction Clients' Panel to develop a methodology for assessing how well Departments and Agencies procure and manage their built assets against indicators of sustainability, which are expected to include criteria relating to the re-use and recycling of materials. In addition, the Department is working with representatives of the whole construction industry to develop a strategy for more sustainable construction. This strategy, which will set out how the industry intends to contribute to sustainable development, is due to be published later this year.

<a name="90524w02.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I am aware of the recent report in "Nature" about the possible adverse effects of pollen from genetically modified insect resistant maize on the Monarch Butterfly in America. The maize in question has had a gene from a naturally occurring soil bacterium "<i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt)" inserted which allows it to produce a toxin that kills corn boring insects.
<P>

<a name="90524w02.htm_para6">Information from this laboratory study will be considered carefully, and ACRE will be asked to advise about the implications for existing approvals for the planting of this GM crop in the European Community. The GM crop used in the study is not being released in the United Kingdom, either experimentally or commercially. Since the European Corn Borer, the pest controlled by the Bt toxin, does not occur in the UK, this GM crop is unlikely to be grown here.
<P>

<a name="90524w02.htm_para7">DETR are aware of potential risks of GM insect resistant crops to non-target and beneficial organisms, and are funding research to investigate these. This research will underpin regulatory decision making and inform ACRE's deliberations.

 We regularly receive correspondence from Members of Parliament and the public on this issue.
<P>

<a name="90524w03.htm_para3">The standards for the ventilation of the passenger compartments of aircraft form part of the requirements under which individual aircraft types are certificated. The standard for new types of aircraft being placed on the UK register is contained in Joint Aviation Requirement 25--Large Aeroplanes. These requirements have not been changed in the last three years. However, they are in the process of being amended to reduce the maximum permitted amount of carbon dioxide to bring them into line with the equivalent US requirement.
<P>

<a name="90524w03.htm_para4">The degree of re-circulation is determined by the aircraft designer and in some cases may be adjusted by the crew. Even when the air conditioning is set at its lowest level, the air in a modern aircraft cabin is changed every three minutes on average. The oxygen used by passengers is a small proportion, approximately 5 per cent. of the oxygen supplied at the minimum flow rate. The oxygen level in the cabin therefore remains at around 20 per cent. for the duration of a flight, which is almost the same as normal atmospheric oxygen levels.
<P>

<a name="90524w03.htm_para5">There is no evidence of links between air quality, flow rates and the spread of disease. The filters used in most modern aircraft are similar to those used in critical wards of hospitals, operating theatres and burns units, and provide protection against the circulation of biological agents such as viruses. However, the spread of disease is facilitated when large numbers of people gather in close proximity. This has nothing to do with air quality but is a matter of personal contact.
<P>

<a name="90524w03.htm_para6">While the re-circulation of air poses no risk, the air pressure in aircraft in flight, which is roughly equivalent to the atmospheric pressure at 8,000 feet above sea level, can affect people with respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and bronchiolitis. Those affected are advised to consult their own doctor and the airline before travelling.

I am, however, aware that the thoughtless misuse of fireworks by a small element of the population, mostly unsupervised children, can result in local disturbance, nuisance and harassment.
<P>

<a name="90524w03.htm_para9">It is important, therefore, to regulate the sale of fireworks. Relevant legislation comprises the Explosives Act 1875, as modified by the Control of Explosives Regulations 1991 and as amended by the Explosives (Age of Purchase) Act 1976, the Consumer Protection Act 1987 and the Fireworks (Safety) Regulations 1997. Under the 1875 Act, it is an offence to discharge a firework in a street or public place. The 1997 Regulations, among other provisions, make it an offence to sell certain types of firework to any members of the general public and to sell other types to anyone under 18, or in some cases, under 16. There is a maximum penalty of &#163;5,000 or six months' imprisonment or both.

<a name="90524w04.htm_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 There is no question of creating a European army and there have therefore been no discussions on this matter with Mr. Prodi. We have, of course, already identified a need for renewed debate on European Union common foreign and security policy and the statement of principles agreed at the British-French Summit at St. Malo was an important step forward. Our aim is clear: to enable the European Union to have a more united and influential voice in world affairs. This must be backed up, when the need arises, by effective military capability. We are taking a leading role in this debate. We have, however, made clear that the deployment of forces must remain a decision for national Governments.

 <i>[holding answer 18 May 1999]:</i> The Government have not seen any peer-reviewed epidemiological research data to support the claims that there has been an increase in ill-health in southern Iraq, attributed to the use of depleted uranium based ammunition by coalition forces during the 1990-1991 conflict.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list for each type of cancer the type and effectiveness of the screening tests currently available on the NHS; and if he will make a statement.  [84688]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 There are currently two cancer screening programmes routinely available on the National Health Service.
<P>

<a name="90524w05.htm_para0">The NHS Breast Screening Programme invites women aged 50-64 years for screening by mammography every three years. Since 1988 when the programme was introduced the United Kingdom death rate from breast cancer has been falling faster than the European average. Based on current detection rates it is estimated that the programme is saving up to 1,250 lives each year.
<P>

<a name="90524w05.htm_para1">The NHS Cervical Screening programme invites women aged 20-64 years for a PAP test at least every five years. The test is designed to detect cervical abnormalities which if left undetected and untreated might develop into cancer. The incidence of cervical cancer has been falling at a rate of about 7 per cent. each year since the national programme was introduced in 1988 and experts estimate that the programme prevents around 3,900 cases of cancer per year. Further evidence from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund suggests that the cervical screening programme may have prevented 800 deaths in 1997.

 The Green Paper "Our Healthier Nation", invited comments on the contribution which fluoridation can make to improved oral health.

<a name="90524w05.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Department and the Department for Education and Employment issued joint guidance in October 1996 on "Supporting pupils with medical needs in schools". The guidance, which was sent to health authorities and local education authorities, covers treatment and the development of healthcare plans for pupils suffering from potentially life threatening medical conditions, including anaphylaxis. It was produced after extensive consultation with interested parties, including professional bodies and voluntary organisations such as the Anaphylaxis Campaign.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w06.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Royal Commission's report has already stimulated an important debate on this complex issue and the Department has been happy to assist that, as well as responding to the hundreds of contributions received in correspondence from individuals and organisations. We will continue to take account of the views of all interested parties and use these to inform decisions we make on the proposals over the coming months.

<P>
<a name="90524w06.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Investing in Dentistry (IID) initiative only applied to General Dental Services in England. IID was launched in September 1997 and continued until April this year. Requests for funding could be submitted to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State at any time during this period. To date, 282 IID funding requests have been approved, primarily to help towards the cost of opening new dental practices, relocating existing practices to larger premises, and providing extra surgeries. A further 140 are currently being assessed.

<P><I>24 May 1999 : Column: 20</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90524w06.htm_para0">Mr. Carlin's Investing in Dentistry funding request was refused because it did not meet the requirements of the IID scheme. The criteria used in deciding on proposals is set out in the circular Health Service Guidance (97) 38, copies of which are available in the Library.

<P>
<a name="90524w06.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B>

<P>
<a name="90524w06.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Digital technology in hearing aids is very new so at this stage only manufacturers' evaluations are available and there is no independent cost benefit analysis. National Heath Service trusts purchase hearing aids from a range that is supplied by the NHS Supplies Authority and they may also purchase hearing aids from commercial suppliers to meet individual clinical need.

 <i>[holding answers 13 May 1999]:</i> The Government today reached agreement in principle with ICL about the continuation of the Horizon project to computerise the Post Office network and automate the payment of benefits.

<a name="90524w06.htm_para2">The changes to the Horizon project are aimed to put it on a sustainable footing for the future and allow the Post Office to move as quickly as possible to the computerisation of post office counter services.

<P>

<a name="90524w06.htm_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>First, we will be moving forward as planned, as quickly as possible with the automation of Post Office Counter services. For the first time ever, Post Offices will have an up to date automation platform, helping them to provide a better service to their customers, and representing a major investment in the future of the nationwide network of Post Offices.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90524w06.htm_para5"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have agreed with ICL to remove the magnetic strip benefit payment card from the project. Given the delays, this is now an outdated concept and the Banks, among others, are already moving away from magnetic strip in favour of the next generation technology--the smart card. For the future, we intend to move from the traditional paper-based methods of payment to a more modern and efficient way of paying benefits through the Post Office network, building on banking technology. POCL and DSS/BA will be working together on plans to introduce the new arrangements in 2003. The Government can give an assurance that those benefit recipients who wish to collect their benefits in cash at Post Offices will continue to be able to do so.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90524w06.htm_para6"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the interim, we will be using bar-coding on order books to tackle benefit fraud. This will provide savings of around &#163;100 million a year, a saving originally promised by the last administration but not yet delivered.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90524w06.htm_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We and ICL believe the target of achieving the computerisation of the network of 18,000 Post Offices by the end of 2001 is more realistic. This will give customers a better service and help to secure a viable future for the network of Post Offices.

<P>

 From time to time it is necessary to amend the EC Regulations, which co-ordinate the operation of Member States' social security schemes, to take account of changes in legislation of the Member States or to effect improvements in the provisions where a deficiency in the existing arrangements comes to light. The social security provisions agreed at the Luxembourg General Affairs Council on 26 and 27 April related to amendments of this type. The only amendment of direct concern to the UK was to an Annex of the co-ordinating Regulations. This was to clarify which is the competent State for payment of UK Family Credit and Irish Family Income Supplement for workers who are resident in Ireland and work in the UK, or vice versa.

 Until December 1997 bi-communal contact was possible but difficult. The High Commission worked hard in the period May 1996 to December 1997 to bring members of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities together. They created the Westminster group to promote the principles of democracy through bi-communal contacts with members of all professions and organised its meetings, arranged meetings of Chevening scholars, and brought members of both communities together through other events such as the Queen's birthday party and the Education fair. In addition, members of the High Commission have assisted with and participated in many other events sponsored by the UN and other bodies to bring members of the two communities together.
<P>

<a name="90524w08.htm_para0">Since December 1997 most bi-communal contacts have been banned by the Turkish Cypriot side. We have therefore found it effectively impossible to arrange bi-communal contacts on-island.

 Advice and guidance for United Kingdom-based relatives of persons involved in the Kosovo crisis has been drawn up by the Home Office in consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the British Red Cross and the Refugee Council. This has been distributed to all Government Departments and non-governmental organisations concerned including any ethnic Albanian organisation that requested it.
<P>

<a name="90524w08.htm_para2">The Kosovo Unit of the Home Office has dealt with in the region of 1,000 telephone calls from United Kingdom-based relatives of persons involved in the crisis and offered appropriate guidance on the steps they, and their relatives, should take. This advice is that those members of the public who wish to bring their families to the United Kingdom from the Kosovo region should contact the British Red Cross United Kingdom Family Reunion Service who are liaising with UNHCR and the Home Office in the compilation of family lists.
<P>

<a name="90524w08.htm_para3">UNHCR have recently confirmed that they are unable to undertake this role other than in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In order to help UNHCR and at their request, a Home Office team went out to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on 9 May to assist with the process of registering refugees. We are considering how this initiative might be widened to assist with family reunion applications in the wider region. These will be considered in accordance with our family reunion concession. This provides for close family members (spouse and minor children and in exceptional circumstances, a family member who formed part of the family unit before fleeing to seek asylum) to join any persons who are settled or granted asylum in the United Kingdom. This concession is being extended to families in the United Kingdom who have been granted exceptional leave to enter as part of UNHCR's Humanitarian Evacuation Programme.
<P>

<a name="90524w08.htm_para4">Revised guidance is being prepared to reflect these new arrangements, also in consultation with UNHCR, the British Red Cross and the Refugee Council. The initial advice to family members to register details of relatives in the region with the offices of the British Red Cross in the United Kingdom remains valid.

 The number of prisoners employed in public sector prisons on work which involves payment from the private sector is approximately 4,500.

<P>
<a name="90524w09.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Conventional recruitment and retention measures are now supplemented at Feltham by arrangements with the local NHS mental health secure unit to provide a number of qualified psychiatric nurses to assist Feltham's delivery of health care. Meetings are also being held with the local health authority to produce a specification for the provision of nursing services at Feltham.

<a name="90524w09.htm_para0">The Prison Service's Directorate of Health Care has commissioned research to look at the current national problem of recruitment and retention of health care staff within the Service. This will produce recommendations on the best way forward.

 The Government have accepted the recommendations in the report of the joint Prison Service/National Health Service executive working group on the future organisation of prison health care, published on 29 March 1999, aimed at providing that the National Health Service takes a greater role in the provision of health care to prisoners, especially those with mental health problems.
<P>

<a name="90524w09.htm_para1">Implementation of the recommendations should greatly assist the assessment and transfer process. The Department of Health strategy document "Modernising Mental Health Services--Safe, Sound and Supportive", published last December, indicated that, among other measures, steps were being taken to expand the number of secure psychiatric places within the NHS.

 The Government have no plans to introduce a separate profession for prison officers working with young offenders.

It is also revising its selection criteria to enable establishments with offenders under 18 to recruit the most suitable staff.

 Feltham has until now been able to provide the Sex Offenders Treatment Programme without specific funding.
<P>

<a name="90524w09.htm_para2">However, the current review of the secure juvenile estate will bring about changes to Feltham's accommodation and regime that may make it difficult for the establishment to continue to provide the Programme without extra funding. Its continuation will, therefore, depend on the outcome of the reviews which are currently taking place of the juvenile estate and regimes for young offender institutions, and the outcome of a bid for capital funding.

 There is no recommended ratio for the number of probationary and qualified prison officers to under 18 year olds in young offender institutions, and we do not have plans to introduce one. The proportion of newly appointed to experienced staff varies from one establishment to another because the turnover of staff varies. The Prison Service is preparing to introduce selection and training arrangements tailored to the needs of establishments in the new under-18 estate which should help address some of the recruitment and retention difficulties some establishments experience.

 The Young Offender Institution Rules 1988 (as amended) require the provision of 15 hours academic education per week for sentenced prisoners under the age of 17 years. The education provided includes English, Mathematics, life skills relevant to their age, and Information Technology and a minimum of five hours of physical education per week. In the case of sentenced prisoners aged 17 years with learning difficulties, there is a requirement to provide education appropriate to their needs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w12.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It is too early to make such an assessment, as under the arrangements announced in July 1998 vessel owners will have until July 2000 to let us know which of the available options they intend to use to demonstrate an economic link. One of those options requires 50 per cent. of the crew to be normally resident in a UK coastal area and would, if used, have a direct impact upon employment opportunities for British fishermen. Other options include either the landing of fish at UK ports or the purchase of goods and services here, either of which may impact indirectly upon onshore employment opportunities. Some early indications suggest an increase in landings at UK fishing ports and the offer of fish quota for the use of the inshore sector. These measures should have beneficial effects on employment in fisheries related sectors.

 We have made clear our intentions to modernise the welfare state. As part of our plans for improving the Social Security system we are introducing important changes to the decision making and appeals processes. On 22 March this House debated and approved the necessary regulations. The changes will be implemented during the latter half of this year, starting with Child Support on 1 June. The changes aim to help get decisions right first time, resolve disputes at an early stage and deal with appeals more efficiently and quickly.

 Income Support (and income based Jobseeker's Allowance) is available to assist disabled adults who have a low income.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_wqn2"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what representations his Department has received from social landlords and independent care providers on the Government's proposals for funding sheltered housing under new housing benefit arrangements.  [84832]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 In response to the publication of the consultation document "Supporting People: A new policy and funding framework for support services" on 10 December, we received a total of 128 representations about our proposal for including sheltered housing in the new Supporting People funding arrangements. Sixty-five of those representations were from Registered Social Landlords and independent care providers, and 31 from local authorities.
<P>

<a name="90524w16.htm_para0">Responses from providers of sheltered housing welcomed the integration of support services for older people, as well as the fact that access to support funding would no longer be tied to type of tenure. The main concern expressed related to the practicalities of implementing the new funding regime.
<P>

<a name="90524w16.htm_para1">We decided to include sheltered housing in the long-term proposals because our aim is to improve the integration of supported and sheltered housing within local strategies for housing and community care. Working alongside existing Government programmes, the new Supporting People funding regime will give the provision of support services, such as those provided by wardens in sheltered accommodation, the priority it deserves. Supporting People will bring long-term stability to the sector by placing for the first time the funding of support services on a secure, sustainable and legal footing.




<P>
<P><I>24 May 1999 : Column: 56</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90524w16.htm_para2">We recognise the importance of getting the practical details right. That is why we are committed to working with interested parties to ensure that the new system delivers on its objectives and becomes an effective and workable reality.
<P>

<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Her Majesty's Customs and Excise do not presently use bulk X-ray equipment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The marking of tobacco products for fiscal purposes is not currently required in the United Kingdom. The report of the Alcohol and Tobacco Fraud Review, published in July 1998, recommended that marking should be considered. While the form of marking proposed by that Review has proved impractical for legal reasons, Customs and Excise is currently reviewing other marking options.

<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 16 April 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>387-90</i>, on taxation, if he will publish the figures on the basis of the assumptions for household spending and council tax payment which were used in the answer to the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) of 11 December 1996, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>190-202</i>.  [81712]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Estimating the impact of indirect taxes on the basis of average assumptions about household spending is imprecise as spending patterns vary widely between households with the same composition and income, with the consumption of the majority of goods and services far from universal. For example, only around one third of adults are smokers. This can be contrasted with direct taxes and benefits where at specified earnings and for particular household types there is a known benefit entitlement or tax liability.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will state the reasons for not applying the VAT (Sport, Sports Competitions and Physical Education) Order 1999 from 1 April; and when he expects to bring it into force.  [85110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Following discussion of the proposed legislation with sports representative bodies, HM Customs and Excise are making changes to the draft Order. A further announcement will be made as soon as possible.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Maude: </B>

<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 This year's Finance Bill allows Customs and Excise to provide new electronic services including VAT returns on the internet.
<P>

<a name="90524w16.htm_para5">In response to an announcement in the VAT Notes, issued to all VAT registered businesses, over 300 representations have been received, 99 per cent. of which not only welcomed this initiative but also stated a preference for an internet-based service.
<P>

<a name="90524w16.htm_para6">No formal consultation exercise is planned. Some businesses and individual taxpayers will wish to send tax information on paper and we will continue to offer this option.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the implications for the VAT (Input Tax) Order 1992 of the judgment of the European Court against the Republic of Italy (Case C-45/95).  [85098]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_spnew8"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 This European Court judgment does not directly affect the VAT (Input Tax) Order 1992, as the effect of the judgment is to introduce new exemptions from VAT. However, implementing these exemptions will involve some consequential changes to the Order. Details of these, and of other proposed related changes, are set out in a Technical Note issued by HM Customs and Excise on 21 April 1999, a copy of which has been placed in the House of Commons Library.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_wqn9"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what external legal advice he has received regarding the VAT treatment of the supply of an interest in land and buildings following the judgment of the European Court against the Republic of Italy (Case C-45/95); and if he will make a statement.  [85097]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_spnew9"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Customs have met with Treasury Counsel over this issue and they are awaiting his written opinion. Most property transactions are, however, already exempt from VAT.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_wqn10"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the VAT liability in respect of <i>(a)</i> room hire, <i>(b)</i> creche facilities and <i>(c)</i> catering franchises contracted out by local authorities.  [85109]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_spnew10"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The VAT liability of supplies made by local authorities is no different from that applying to other suppliers. VAT charged on supplies made to local authorities can normally be reclaimed from Customs and Excise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_spnew11"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Following the recent Budget, I asked Customs to work further with business to explore whether it is possible to cushion the impact of VAT registration on growing businesses. This further work, together with representations received during the 1998 consultation exercise on the VAT registration threshold, will inform future Budget decisions on this issue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_spnew12"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_spnew13"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 In their technical note which asked businesses for comments on the changes covered by this Order, Customs expected that the Order would take effect from 1 September 1999, but this will depend on the comments received from businesses and on the process of parliamentary drafting.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_wqn14"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the revenue implications for the Exchequer following the judgment of the European Court against the Republic of Italy (Case C-45/95).  [85113]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_spnew14"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Customs and Excise expect there to be a revenue gain of around &#163;15 million per year, because some businesses will be unable to recover input VAT on expenses associated with the newly exempt sales of business cars. They expect this to be offset in the first year by a revenue loss of &#163;10 million, arising from repayments made to certain non-profit making bodies, under a related change that will permit them to recover VAT on publications supplied to members.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_wqn15"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the definition of a car for VAT purposes following the judgment of the European Court against the Republic of Italy (Case C-45/95).  [85112]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90524w16.htm_spnew15"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 This European Court judgment does not directly affect the definition of a car for VAT purposes, though the proposed legislation to implement the new exemption will make certain minor--and unrelated--technical changes to the definition. Details of these, and of other proposed related changes, are set out in a Technical Note issued by HM Customs and Excise on 21 April 1999, a copy of which has been placed in the House of Commons Library.

 <i>[holding answer 10 May 1999]:</i> There are currently no plans to provide replacement income through the Working Families Tax Credit for families where a person takes up their right to unpaid parental leave.
