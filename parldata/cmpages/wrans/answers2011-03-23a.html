 The community right to build proposals are contained in the Localism Bill introduced to Parliament on 13 December 2010.

Any benefits generated from developments under the community right to build will stay within the community and be used for the community's benefit.

 The assessment is being developed in collaboration with an independent group of specialists in health, social care and disability, including disabled people. We know it is essential that it accurately captures the needs of disabled people with autistic spectrum disorders and this is something that the development group is considering. For example, they believe that the new assessment should explicitly take account of the impact of a health condition or impairment, including autistic spectrum disorders, on an individual's ability to communicate. This would set it apart from the current DLA assessment. Both I and departmental officials have met with the National Autistic Society to discuss our reform proposals and to seek their views on how the new benefit can best support those with autism.

 On 6 December 2010 we launched a consultation on the reform of disability living allowance with the key proposal of a new benefit, to be known as personal independence payment, which will be introduced from 2013. The consultation proposed that personal independence payment will have a six month qualifying period and a six month prospective test. The consultation closes on 14 February.</p>

Other support is available to provide necessary financial support, such as NHS travel costs, free prescriptions, aids, and adaptations provided by the NHS or the local authority and through a range of social security benefits depending on their circumstances during this period, including access to employment and support allowance. As for disability living allowance, claims for personal independence payment may be made during the qualifying period meaning that dependent upon the nature of the impact of their disability claimants may not have to wait six months before payment can start.</p>

 The universal credit award is intended to be paid as a single amount per household, including couple households. We are allowing members of the couple to decide between them whether the money goes into a joint account or if it is received by one or other of them. It is then for the household to decide who in the family has access to funds and how any money, including benefit income and wages, is used to budget for household costs. There may be exceptional cases that require state intervention to ensure that the rest of the family, including the children, benefit from the payment: we are considering the best ways of providing support in those cases.</p>

The reforms would extend the ATOL scheme to Flight Plus holidays sold by travel agents and tour operators. Such trips closely resemble package holidays but are not covered by the existing legal definition and so currently fall outside ATOL.</p>

 As the Secretary of State said on 17 March 2011, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 494-83, an unprecedented wave of change is now sweeping across the Arab world. Almost every middle eastern country has been affected at the same time by demands for greater political openness and democratic freedom. In Egypt and Tunisia, it has led to new interim governments and the hope of a more democratic future. In Libya, legitimate protest has been followed by bloody civil strife at the hands of a government willing to countenance any loss of life in order to cling to power. In each instance of instability, there have been implications for thousands of British expatriates who live and work in these countries.</p>

 The Department for Education has not issued any specific guidance to schools on reducing obesity since October 2010 and has no plans to issue further guidance in the next six months. However, this Government recognise that through physical education, competitive school sport and healthy eating, schools can help address the problem of childhood obesity. In the past, the Department has made available guidance and resources to help schools provide a healthy environment by providing nutritious school lunches, improving participation in high quality PE and sport opportunities, helping children learn about health through Personal, Social, Health and Economic education and practical activities such as cooking. Guidance from DFE and Department of Health has also issued to schools on how they can support the National Child Measurement Programme, which collects essential height and weight data on primary school pupils in Reception and Year 6.</p>

The strongest negative is on risky behaviours (smoking, drinking, teenage pregnancy) where we are among the worst.

It is also the case that the surveys that have been carried out on this issue, typically report on sexual activity below age 16, rather than under 15, given that the age of consent is 16. The most authoritative and relevant of the surveys in this area is the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL), which is conducted every 10 years. NATSAL 2000 identified that among the 16 to 19-year-olds interviewed, 30% of young men and 26% of young women reported that their first sexual experience occurred before they reached age 16. This was consistent with the findings for young men and women in the survey who were aged 25-29, indicating that there had been no change in the proportion of young people having sex before age 16 over the preceding decade. The median age of first sex among 16 to 19-year-olds in the survey in 2000, was age 16.</p>

However, a range of separate smaller scale surveys that have been undertaken since 2000 have consistently shown between a quarter and a third of young people reporting that they had their first sexual experience before age 16. A tracking survey that was used to assess young people's reactions to the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy's media campaign showed that in 2007, the mean age for first sex among young men was 16.48 years and for young women was 16.53 years. These results were the same as the results from the same survey carried out in 2004.</p>

1. From Q1 2010-11, the calculation of accident and emergency (A and E) performance changed. Prior to 2010-11, the calculation identified the proportion of breaches with respect to all A and E attendances, irrespective of whether the time spent in A and E was known. The new calculation uses the breaches as a proportion of total attendances for which the time spent in A and E is known. Any attendances for which the time spent in A and E is unknown are excluded from the total attendances for the purpose of this calculation.<br>
2. Figures shown include all acute trusts in England. Percentage figures calculated including activity at partner primary care trusts or independent sector providers.<br>

Prior to 2010-11 the calculation identified the proportion of breaches with respect to all A&amp;E attendances, irrespective of whether the time spent in A&amp;E was known. The new calculation uses the breaches as a proportion of total attendances for which the time spent in A&amp;E is known. Any attendances for which the time spent in A&amp;E is unknown are excluded from the total attendances for the purpose of this calculation.<br>
