 Some of the issues identified by AWE plc as a result of its periodic review of safety required the procurement of specialist equipment where the acquisition time was such that the equipment could not be brought into service by the deadline of  27 September.

 The safety case issues in question were identified not by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), but by AWE plc in its own periodic review of safety.

 Under Government Finance Accounting Regulations (Managing Public Money), there are no special arrangements for the treatment of charities, whether service or other. The fact that a charity is to be the main beneficiary of a good or service is not in itself sufficient justification to introduce a special charging regime or to set charges aside. There is the opportunity for abatement of full costs and this decision is on a case-by-case basic taking account of any special circumstances that may apply.</p>

 Estimates of aggregate MOD cash expenditure in UK industry and commerce, by standard industrial classification (SIC), are published in the annual United Kingdom Defence Statistics, copies of which are available in the Library of the House. This analysis, however, is not fully compatible with the Treasury RfR framework, as it measures only cash expenditure and excludes non-cash costs such as depreciation; it includes both capital and resource expenditure; and it does not cover expenditure overseas incurred by the Department. It is likely also to include expenditure which may be claimed under RfR2 (Conflict Prevention).

Our Waste Strategy for England, published in May 2007, makes clear that initiatives to boost waste prevention and recycling should be supported by fly-tipping strategies aimed at tackling the illegal dumping of waste.</p>

 3,167 gratis visas were issued to Chernobyl-affected children prior to 31 August 2007, while 111 visas have been issued in the subsequent period to 13 December 2007. The autumn is, historically, a slow period for such applications, 292 such visas being issued in the final four months of 2006. The Chernobyl charities advise that the Christmas holiday period is a busy period and UKVisas anticipated an upsurge in applications at this time. Application rates during this period may have been further affected by the collection of biometric data in Minsk. Furthermore, one charity was, temporarily, asked not to submit applications while investigations concerning one of its former hosts were ongoing. This charity has now been advised that it may resume submission of such applications.</p>

 We have held no recent discussions with the Belarus ambassador to London in respect of Chernobyl children. It was intended that a seasonal biometrics collection facility in Gomel Oblast specifically for children wishing to come to the UK for respite care would be offered. This would have been in addition to the service offered in our embassy in Minsk. However, the Government of Belarus would not allow the delivery of this visa service, including the collection of biometrics, through our commercial partnerships in the country and the embassy was compelled to adjust its plans. Correspondence with the Belarus embassy in London is ongoing. Given the lack of agreement with the Belarus authorities in respect to our commercial partnerships in Belarus, it has now been agreed that a seasonal mobile biometrics data collection service will operate on a pilot basis outside Minsk in the summer of 2008 for children in need of recuperative holidays. The pilot will involve the use of mobile biometric collection equipment in one or more regional locations between April and July. UKvisas are prepared to receive applications in Kiev, in Ukraine, where that proves to be more convenient.</p>

 The Deputy Head of Mission, Entry Clearance Officer and Regional Deputy Director of Visa Services at our embassy in Minsk held a meeting in June 2007 with the Deputy Head of the Consular Department and other officials of the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). The embassy asked whether they could open Visa Application Centres (VACs) operated by their commercial partner in Belarus.

 We expect that the next report from the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Dr. Mohammed El Baradei, on Iran's co-operation with the agency under the Work Plan, will be released before the IAEA board in  March 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="80107w0018.htm_para7"><a name="0801087000082">If Iran implements the Work Plan in full, it will be a step towards restoring trust in Iran's nuclear intentions. But addressing the outstanding issues is only one of the steps the international community requires Iran to take in order to restore confidence in its intentions. Iran needs to suspend enrichment, enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, as requested by the IAEA Board of Governors and required by UN Security Council Resolutions 1696, 1737, and 1747. Iran also needs to implement fully the additional protocol and additional measures that the IAEA has requested. Until Iran meets these obligations we will continue to follow the dual track strategy agreed with our partners in the &#147;E3+3&#148; (China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States), and to discuss further measures aimed at persuading Iran to fulfil all its international obligations.</p>

 We are concerned about the proliferation risk that would be posed if Iran completes construction of a heavy water reactor. This type of reactor is particularly well suited for producing plutonium, which could be reprocessed and used in a nuclear weapon. This is reflected by the demands in UN Security Council resolutions 1737 and 1747, which require that Iran suspends work on heavy water-related projects, including the construction of a research reactor moderated by heavy water. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly reported that construction of the reactor has nevertheless been continuing. The February 2006 IAEA Director-General&#146;s report noted the Iranians saying that the commissioning date for the reactor was likely to be postponed until 2011.</p>

Since then, representatives of the DPKO and the Government of Sudan have discussed these issues in Lisbon on 8 December, followed by further talks in Khartoum. We are awaiting further reports on progress that has come about as a result of those discussions.</p>

 Turkey closed its border with Armenia in 1992 as a consequence of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno Karabakh. The closure of the border has inevitably inhibited the economic development of Armenia by limiting trade prospects. An open border between Turkey and Armenia is desirable and would bring benefits for both countries. We hope that the political situation in the region develops in such a way as to allow this. We encourage the Governments of Armenia and Turkey to look to the future and build a better relationship between their countries.

In this case, it relates to deaths from cancer at ages under 75. It is calculated by subtracting from the number of deaths that occurred in the first year of the period, the number of deaths registered in each subsequent year, and then totalling the differences.</p>

From the baseline in 1995-96-97 to the most recent period, 2004-05-06, the cancer mortality rate in people aged under 75 in England has fallen by over 17 per cent.</p>

 BTs provision of an interim child health system pending delivery of a long-term solution reduced the risks arising from the 10 primary care trusts (PCTs) concerned being left with no system following the decision by the previous commercial child health system supplier to withdraw its product from the market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="80107w0020.htm_para4"><a name="08010822000124">To mitigate any risks arising from this drop, an immunisation uptake audit was undertaken across the 10 PCTs who were using CHIA in London. The initial findings from the audit show that a significant number of children who appeared in the system as unimmunised had actually received their immunisations. There were also a number of children who had not been immunised, but the audit revealed a number of reasons, unconnected with the computer system changes, why this was the case.</p>

1. Median waiting times are calculated from aggregate data, rather than patient level data, and therefore are only estimates of the position on average waits. In particular, specialties with low numbers waiting are prone to fluctuations in the median. This should be taken into account when interpreting the data.<br>
2. Medians are provided for out-patients not seen with total of less than 50 because this population is too small for a statistically meaningful median to be calculated so a n/a shown in that case.<br>

1. Psychiatric nurses includes community psychiatric nurses.<br>
2. More accurate validation processes in 2006 have resulted in the identification and removal of 9,858 duplicate non-medical staff records out of the total workforce figure of 1.3 million in 2006. Earlier years' figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years' figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents). This should be taken into consideration when analysing trends over time.<br>

 Representation at inquests is outside of the usual scope of the legal aid scheme as set out in the Access to Justice Act 1999 and other documents laid before Parliament. However, it can be made available in exceptional circumstances. There are published criteria that help determine whether a case is exceptional. Applications for exceptional funding must first be made to the Legal Services Commission (LSC). The Ministry understands that applications, in relation to the inquests into the deaths of personnel on the Hercules XV179 shot down in Iraq in January 2005, are currently being considered by the LSC.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the average number of days from arrest to sentence in cases involving persistent young offenders was at the most recent date for which figures are available for each police force area. [176039]</p>

 In 1996, the average time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders was 142 days. The Government pledged to halve the time to 71 days by March 2002 (changed to May 2002 by the 2001 manifesto). The pledge is a target that applies jointly to all Criminal Justice Agencies.</p>

The monthly performance for September 2007 was 60 days. Therefore the performance is better than the Government&#146;s pledge.</p>

Peter White noted that among the groups eligible for free help, 43 per cent. had responded, which indicated that people had had sufficient time to respond if they wished, and that low response was more likely to be attributable to the deterrent effect of the &#163;40 charge or take-up of satellite.

It is common practice for developers to enter into agreements pursuant to section 106 of the Town and Country Planning  Act 1990 to ensure funds are available for such decommissioning work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_537"><a name="80107w0039.htm_para11"><a name="08010824000069">The National Foundation for Educational Research ("Admissions: who goes where? Messages from the statistics", published July 2006) found that academies tended to be situated in areas where the community populations included higher proportions of children eligible for free school meals (FSM); with special educational needs (SEN); of black or ethnic minority origin; and of lower key stage 2 (KS2) ability; and that academies admit higher proportions of pupils eligible for FSM and with SEN than the proportion living in the local postcode districts. Furthermore, they admit a lower proportion of pupils of higher KS2 ability compared to the proportion living within the local postcode districts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_538"><a name="80107w0039.htm_para12"><a name="08010824000070">There is a large body of evidence from independent reports and examination results that the academies programme is succeeding in raising aspirations and attainment in the communities they serve. The National Audit Office concluded that pupils' achievements in 2005 and 2006 indicated a strong trend in raising attainment, and that if this trend continues, the academies programme will meet its objective of raising attainment in deprived areas ("The Academies Programme", National Audit Office, February 2007, page 8). The Government agree with this assessment, which is why the Secretary of State in his statement to the House of 10 July 2007, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 1319-23, announced a series of measures to accelerate the academies programme, and the Department plans to open 50 new academies in each of the next three years on its way to opening at least 400 academies.</p>

 The Department announced its policy on sprinkler systems for schools in March 2007. The policy is that a risk assessment should be undertaken for new and refurbishment projects in all categories of state-funded schools including all BSF schools. To help local authorities and school designers to decide when sprinklers are needed, DCSF has produced a risk assessment tool and a cost benefit analysis tool.

<p><a name="stpa_540"><a name="80107w0040.htm_para1"><a name="08010824000079">Our presumption is that new schools and some refurbished schools will have fire sprinklers installed, however this is not a compulsory measure. There may be cases where local authorities or other promoters of schools consider that sprinklers are not needed. If so, they will need to be able to demonstrate that such schools are very low risk and that sprinklers would not represent good value for money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_541"><a name="80107w0040.htm_para2"><a name="08010824000080">To date, seven schools have been built under the Building Schools for the Future programme, in Bristol, Solihull, Haringey, Sheffield, South Tyneside, Stoke and Sunderland; these include six &#145;early win&#146; projects. We believe that the Bristol Brunei Academy is the only one fitted with a sprinkler system. This was a large new build project and the most suitable for a sprinkler installation. Five of the other six schools were refurbishment projects where it may not have been technically feasible to install sprinkler systems. It is also more expensive to install sprinklers in a refurbishment which means they do not always provide good value for money. These projects were all in the late design or construction stage when the new sprinkler policy was announced which would have made it more expensive and technically difficult to install sprinkler systems unless they were part of the original design.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_542"><a name="80107w0040.htm_para3"><a name="08010824000081">We expect approximately 80 schools to be under construction in the current financial year in the following local authorities: Bradford, Bristol, Lewisham, Sheffield, Knowsley, Lancashire, Leeds, Leicester, Manchester, Newcastle, Solihull, Stoke, Sunderland, Waltham Forest, Lambeth, Durham and Kent.</p>

The most recent data available are for 31 March 2006, and show that 649 children and 4,170 carers were receiving these payments in England.

The formula takes account of the resident children population aged 0 to 17, deprivation top-up, foster and area cost adjustments. However, there is no specific element of the formula which takes into account the use of direct payments. This is because direct payments are designed to be cost-neutral, providing equivalent cash payments made in lieu of social service provisions to individuals or families.</p>

The revised key stage 3 curriculum will be more relevant and engaging for young people and should continue this improvement in standards.

<i> [holding answer 17 December 2007]: </i>The Department does not collect data on the number of pupils withdrawn from Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE). However, Ofsted's survey on SRE published in 2002 found that only 0.04 per cent. of pupils were withdrawn from the non-statutory aspects of SRE normally delivered through PSHE.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_581"><a name="80107w0046.htm_para6"><a name="08010824001790">Similarly, the Department does not collect data or the number of schools who include SRE within PSHE, but departmental guidance on SRE (DfES, 2000) makes clear that schools should embed SRE within their programmes for PSHE.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_582"><a name="80107w0046.htm_para7"><a name="08010824001791">In 2006 there were 1,129 school nurses with a school nurse qualification (an increase of 31.9 per cent. since 2004). Their involvement in the delivery of SRE is a decision for primary care trusts and individual schools. The Department recognises the unique contribution that school nurses make to SRE and encourages all those involved in classroom delivery to undertake the National PSHE: Continuing Professional Development Programme. This accredited programme supports standards in the delivery of PSHE teaching including sex and relationships education.</p>

In the main, this will be achieved using existing initiatives such as Train to Gain, as we help employers in meeting their skill needs to design, build and deliver the Games, and encourage individuals to develop their skills so that they can compete for opportunities and progress within the labour market beyond 2012. To do this, we have initiated a programme of activities which are nation or UK-wide, rather than related to specific cities or regions. On the employer side, two cluster groups of sector skills councils are leading two areas: one to look specifically at the issues relating to the built environment and environmental improvements for the Games; and the other is looking at the staging and legacy aspects of the Games. Other specific employer-led initiatives include a programme of media training placements being developed by Skillset; the national skills strategy for hospitality, leisure, travel and tourism in England developed by People 1st; and the National Skills Academy for Construction centre on the Olympic site which the Prime Minister announced on 29 November. For individuals, initiatives include new advanced apprenticeships in sporting excellence; customer service and hospitality apprenticeships; and the LDA-led Personal Best Programme which is currently being piloted in London but will be offered nationally and is targeted at individuals furthest away from the labour market to improve skills and promote employability.</p>

Community involvement has been seen as key to Trident&#146;s success from the outset, with the Trident Independent Advisory Group set up to harness public support and keep officers informed of community views.

 The Home Department uses a range of different terms and conditions for purchasing goods and services depending on their complexity and value. Generally these do not contain an express provision prohibiting the assignment of debts by the contractor. This reflects the position that, as the purchaser, it is the Home Department making payments rather than the contractor.

However, the Home Office will continue to provide funding to support the national 101 telephony infrastructure. This continued funding together with the lessons learned for improving local services from the initial areas, will enable and inform local police and councils who wish to develop their own locally funded 101 service.</p>

 The future prediction of passport demand is updated periodically by the Identity and Passport Service to reflect actual numbers of applicants. The November 2007 Cost Report included the most recent prediction of future passport volumes. This prediction had recently been updated to reflect lower than anticipated passport renewals. There could be a number of reasons for passport renewals being increasingly delayed by customers:</p>
<a name="80107w0059.htm_brev44"><a name="08010864002891"><ul><p class="tabletext">Other identity documents have been improved.

To a certain extent, the travel industry encourages &#145;last minute&#146; behaviour and it is reasonable to believe that customers also apply this behaviour to how they apply for passports. This behaviour has also been enabled by IPS Fast Track services which have improved to meet this demand since these were first introduced in 1996;</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the average age of retirement was for police officers in England retiring in the last 12 months; and what average pension is being paid to those officers. [174719]</p>

 An average retirement age cannot be separately identified from the available data. The available data are the age on leaving the service within the following time bands only: 25 and under, 26 to 40, 41 to 55 and over 55. Information about the average pension being paid to officers retiring in a particular year is not held centrally. The size of an officer&#146;s annual pension depends largely on his or her pensionable pay, and length of pensionable service. Under the Police Pension Scheme 1987, a lump sum is not paid out automatically but only where the officer chooses to convert (commute) part of his or her pension into a lump sum. The size of a lump sum therefore depends on the officer&#146;s annual pension, the proportion of pension that the officer chooses to commute, and the commutation factor to be applied to the surrendered portion of pension in order to convert it into a lump sum. A typical officer, retiring after 30 years&#146; service on a final pensionable pay of &#163;34,080 (the 2006-07 pensionable maximum for an officer of constable rank outside London), would be entitled to a pension of &#163;17,040 per annum and a lump sum of &#163;85,200, based on the officer commuting the maximum possible proportion of his or her pension, and using the most substantial factor. Based on the available data, the indications are that the average pre-commutation pension would be in the region of &#163;21,500.</p>

 A police officer who is a member of the Police Pension Scheme 1987 is entitled to retire with an ordinary pension after 25 years' service, payable from the age of 50. An officer who is a member of the 1987 scheme can also retire with a full and immediate pension at any age once he or she has accrued 30 years' service. The earliest age from which this would normally be possible is 481/2, given the minimum entry age of 181/2 for the police service. Unless an officer becomes permanently disabled for police duty, and is required to retire on ill health grounds, there is no specific early retirement scheme. In order to qualify for an ordinary pension, officers must in all cases, however, provide the police authority with one month's notice of their intention to retire, or three months in the case of chief officer ranks, although it is at the discretion of the police authority to accept a shorter notice period. As it is a matter for local discretion, there are no centrally held data on its frequency of use.</p>

Some offences are defined by the age of the victim but for other offences the age of the victim is immaterial. The data in the annual reports includes all registered sexual offenders.</p>

 Under the provisions of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 certain traffic law enforcement devices require type approval by the Secretary of State before evidence from them is admissible in court. Type approval is granted only to devices that comply with the specification laid down by the HO Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB) and successfully complete both field and scientific testing. The type approval process provides a public reassurance that a device is accurate, consistent and reliable. Three variants of the LTI 20.20 system were type approved in the 1990s. We are satisfied that the device merits its type approval and have seen no reason to conduct further assessments.</p>

<i> [holding answer 6 December 2007]:</i> The draft Climate Change Bill, which has just been introduced into Parliament, proposes to set out a requirement for the Government to produce the first UK risk assessment on climate change within three years. Following this, it is proposed that the Government will update the risk report and programme on a five-yearly basis, with one informing the other.</p>

 The number of people on the key out of work benefits in Darlington has fallen by 21.5 per cent. since 1997, and the employment rate has risen by 3.8 per cent. over the same period. At a national level, the Government now spend &#163;5 billion a year less on unemployment benefits than in 1996-97. The success of the new deal has contributed to this saving, and the National Audit Office estimates that national income has grown by between &#163;216 million and &#163;360 million as a result of the new deal.</p>

 The price of heating oil, petrol and diesel are influenced by a range of factors, including international crude oil prices, exchange rates, seasonal factors, level of stocks, refinery capacity, distribution costs and the degree of retail competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_749"><a name="80107w0069.htm_para2"><a name="08010896002089">International oil prices have been high and volatile in recent years, more than doubling between 2004 and 2007, and this has been reflected in the retail prices of all fuels. The rise in prices has been due to a range of factors, notably strong and resilient global oil demand growth, tight refining and production capacity and geopolitical uncertainty in several key oil-producing countries. In 2007 Q4, additional factors including oil supply shortages have also contributed to increased crude oil prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_750"><a name="80107w0069.htm_para3"><a name="08010896002090">Oil price is only one of these factors and there is typically a lag to changes in retail pump prices as retailers absorb temporary changes in oil prices in their profit margins.</p>

<p><a name="qn_713"><a name="80107w0069.htm_wqn6"><a name="08010896002091"><a name="08010896002903"><b>Mr. Dodds:</b>
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what percentage of the retail price of <i> (a) </i>heating oil, <i> (b)</i> petrol and <i> (c)</i> diesel is accounted for by tax. [174913]</p>

 Liability to pay fuel duty only applies to fuel refiners or producers. This is because the point at which the duty is paid is when the finished product leaves the refinery or production plant. Fuel duty is set at a fixed monetary value per litre rather than as a percentage of the retail price.</p>

Budget 2007 changes to Vehicle Excise Duty built on 2006 reforms, further sharpening the environmental signals to motorists to purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles and supporting development of the low-carbon market.
