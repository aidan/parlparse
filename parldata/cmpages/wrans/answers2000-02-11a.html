To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress has been made in reducing rough sleeping in London since he last published an estimate of numbers.  [110298]<P>

<P>
<a name="00211w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The most recent evidence on the number of people sleeping rough in London comes from single night street counts carried out in 11 boroughs on the night of 20 January 2000 (27 January in Lambeth).
<P>

<a name="00211w01.html_para0">We have previously estimated that as at June 1999 there were 635 people sleeping rough in Greater London. Using the January 2000 counts to update that figure where possible, our best estimate is that there were 420 people sleeping rough in Greater London as at January 2000.

<BR>
The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your parliamentary question regarding the number of full-time adults who received a wage increase in April 1999 as a consequence of the introduction of the national minimum wage. I am replying in Dr. Holt's absence.
<BR>
Estimates on the number of adults who received a wage increase as a consequence of the national minimum wage are not available since the ONS does not capture information on why or when pay increases are awarded.

<P>
<a name="00211w03.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Norman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what measures his Department has taken to enforce the conditions of telecommunications licences that operators provide details of the expected locations of all telecommunications apparatus before giving notice of the installation of any apparatus in a particular planning authority area; what penalties are applicable when this condition is breached; and if he will list the instances in which this condition has been broken in each of the last five years, by each operator.  [108501]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00211w03.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Enforcement in relation to these conditions is a matter for local planning authorities. Failure to pre- notify expected locations of apparatus to the local planning authority would deprive the operator of permitted development rights under Part 24 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 and would subject him to normal planning law. The local planning authority would then be responsible for taking action under normal planning enforcement procedures. Remedies could include a requirement to remove the apparatus concerned. As this is a matter for planning authorities, DTI does not receive details of breaches.

<a name="00211w03.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Norman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry who is responsible for monitoring the level of power densities produced by telecommunications masts; what proportion of masts were checked in 1999; and if he will list by operator the masts found to produce power densities in excess of the limits set by the NRPB in each of the last three years.  [108496]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00211w03.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The responsibility for monitoring the level of power densities produced by telecommunications masts rests with the operators of the masts in accordance with their duties under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. The Health and Safety Executive requires operators to prevent access by members of the public to areas, usually within a couple of metres of the antennae, where power densities may exceed NRPB guidelines.
<P>

<a name="00211w03.html_para1">The Radiocommunications Agency will investigate complaints about emissions from telecommunications masts, though the cost of any report on a particular site must be borne by the complainant. To my knowledge, no mast has been found where members of the public are exposed above NRPB guideline limits. No information is held on the proportion of masts checked in 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if all regulatory proposals relating to the introduction of stakeholder pension schemes will be scrutinised by the Chief Executive of the Small Business Service to ensure that they are <i>(a)</i> easy to understand, <i>(b)</i> easy to comply with and <i>(c)</i> difficult to evade.  [107921]<P>

<P>
<a name="00211w04.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government's approach is to regulate only where it is necessary to achieve the desired effect. An important aim is to minimise the burden that would be placed on small firms. Therefore, the Chief Executive of the Small Business Service will be consulted by Government Departments on all regulatory proposals that affect small firms. The process of making regulations easy to understand, easy to comply with and difficult to avoid will, of course, include the proposals relating to the introduction of stakeholder pension schemes.

<P>
<a name="00211w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I am today announcing targets for the recruitment, retention and career progression of women in the fire service. By 2009, the Government expect 15 per cent. of the operational fire service (whole-time and retained firefighters and their officers) in England and Wales to be women and for them to remain in the service and be promoted at the same rate as their male colleagues.
<P>

<a name="00211w04.html_para4">At present, the number of women in the whole-time operational fire service is only 1 per cent. A recent report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Fire Services has conformed that there is no possible justification for such low numbers. The target is deliberately challenging and will require brigades to take steps to encourage a more open inclusive culture and to revise procedures and practices which the Chief Inspector's thematic review found to be potentially discriminatory.

 The Home Office assumed responsibility for the budget for supporting asylum seekers in April 1999. This includes reimbursing costs, within unit cost and overall cash limits, incurred by local authorities for supporting asylum seekers under the National Assistance Act 1948 and the Children Acts. Responsibility for reimbursing local authorities by grant in respect of supporting asylum seekers previously rested with the Department of Health.
<P>

<a name="00211w05.html_para4">Information on the total cost of supporting asylum seekers through local authorities for the period in question is currently not available. But the Department of Health made grant payments to London boroughs of &#163;66 million in 1997-98 and &#163;161 million in 1998-99 in respect of costs incurred in supporting asylum seekers.

<BR>
I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the Child Support Agency.
<BR>
You ask about the target time for the serving of papers on a non-resident parent following an application for child maintenance. The serving of papers has been taken to mean either the initial contact with a non-resident parent or the taking of enforcement action. In view of this I have covered both of these aspects in my reply.
<BR>
When a parent with care makes an application for child support, a maintenance enquiry form is issued to the non-resident parent named on the application form. This is to establish the non-resident parent's financial and domestic circumstances. There is no target time for this procedure as much depends on the information provided by the parent with care and whether tracing the non-resident parent is necessary.
<BR>
Although there is no target for the issue of a maintenance enquiry form the Secretary of State has set the Agency a target time for clearing 65% of maintenance applications within 20 weeks. This is a challenging target to which the Agency only achieved 50% (December 1999), however this can be viewed against a 25% increase of applications made during the last three months of 1999.




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>11 Feb 2000 : Column: 324W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
We continually strive to meet all targets set by the Secretary of State.
<BR>
Once an assessment is made and payment is received it is passed to the parent with care within 10 working days of receipt in 98.6% of cases.
<BR>
The Agency's policy is that, if necessary, it should use the powers given by Parliament to enforce payment of child maintenance. Where normal collection arrangements fail and arrears accrue, the Agency will take firm and prompt enforcement action if the non-resident parent does not make an acceptable offer to pay. There is no target time for this action to be taken as each case is considered on its merits and the Agency will take account of the likely effect of enforcement action on the welfare of any children involved. The benefit to the child of payment being made may also be a deciding factor.
<BR>
Under provision of the Child Support Act 1995 the Agency has been able to arrange for liability orders granted by magistrates' courts to be entered in the County Court Register of Judgements. This register is used extensively by credit reference agencies when establishing an individual's creditworthiness. Entries in the register may result in credit being refused, a particular deterrent for self employed Non-Resident Parents. In the last reporting year, April 1998 to March 1999, the Agency applied for 3,968 liability orders.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

This scheme was introduced nationally in October 1995. Post Office staff can be paid a reward of &#163;10.00 (&#163;25.00 in exceptional cases).

<a name="00211w07.html_para2">All NHS trusts should have an infection control team which has primary responsibility for, and reports to the chief executive on, all aspects of surveillance, prevention and control of infection, including pseudomonas. A range of initiatives are underway to strengthen hospital infection control arrangements, including issue of comprehensive new standards to the NHS on 22 November 1999 as part of the National Controls Assurance launch. Acute NHS trusts must assess themselves against these standards by March 2000. Compliance will be monitored by the Commission for Health Improvement and the Audit Commission.

 Roll-out of the meningococcal Group immunisation programme is dependent on satisfactory vaccine supply. Those children at highest risk of meningococcal disease are being offered immunisation first. The "catch-up" programme to immunise all children under the age of two years began this month and is planned to be completed by the end of March.

Immunisation of other children under five years will commence as quickly as vaccine supplies become available. Parents will be told when their children are to be called for immunisation. All children and young people under 18 should have been offered vaccine by the end of 2000.

 Diphtheria, tetanus (DT) vaccine rather than diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccine is used as a booster in the United Kingdom immunisation programme. DT has been in short supply due to the inability of Medeva, one of the two UK licensed sources, to supply contracted vaccine. A third manufacturer, Behring, has now obtained a product licence for its DT vaccine to be used in the UK and the first batches are due for release at the end of February 2000. This should give the UK enough stock to allow GPs and clinics to catch up on any deferred appointments for immunisation.

"Approximately 75-90 per cent. of the fluoride ingested each day is absorbed from the alimentary tract.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
"there is sufficient evidence from the available data to conclude that the consumption of fluoridated water would not constitute a mutagenic hazard to man through the induction of heritable abnormalities in the germ cells."
This implies that there is no biological basis for suspecting any relationship between fluoridation and the incidence of Down's syndrome. Epidemiological studies by Rapaport in the 1950s claimed to have shown an association, but were flawed and not supported by later epidemiological studies by others. An evaluation of the epidemiological studies will form part of the expert scientific review of fluoride and health in progress at the National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York.

A report from the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment, published in January 1999, stated that mass screening for prostate cancer does not fulfil the ethical requirements and principles to avoid harm and do good. We have asked the Programme Director for the National Screening Committee, the National Cancer Director and the Director of Research and Development to keep this under active review.

About 80 per cent. of people who acquire MRSA similarly carry it harmlessly on the skin and do not suffer from any infection. Neither the number of hospitals recording MRSA outbreaks nor the total number of patients in National Health Service hospitals who have MRSA are recorded centrally. The Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) compiles aggregate data on numbers of incidents of MRSA which are voluntarily reported by NHS trusts. The available data on the incidents of MRSA are given in the table. We are working with PHLS on improving surveillance systems so as to provide more complete data on MRSA.

<BR>
As the Employment Service is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply direct to your question about what plans he has to review the procedures undertaken when a jobseeker fails to attend the fortnightly review of their job search at their local Jobcentre. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.
<BR>
Jobseekers are required to attend their local Jobcentre each fortnight in order to show that they are continuing to satisfy the conditions for receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance. If a jobseeker fails to attend an interview they have five days to show what is termed "good cause" for not attending. If they fail to show good cause within the five day limit their claim is terminated. If a jobseeker fails to attend their interview but subsequently attends within five days, they are asked to provide their reasons for the failure to attend in writing. Their reasons are then sent to an Employment Services Decision Maker who, after obtaining any further information they may require, makes a decision as to whether the jobseeker had good cause for their failure to attend the interview.
<BR>
These procedures were amended slightly in October 1999 to give staff in our Jobcentres the facility to treat some circumstances as straightforward and not to have to refer the case to a Decision Maker. This new procedure will be evaluated later in the year, but there are no other plans in place to review the overall procedures.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

 [holding answer 18 January 2000]: We define sustained jobs as those where the employee does not return to claim jobseeker's allowance (JSA) within 13 weeks. If they do return to JSA we drop them from the sustained jobs figure. Using this definition, under the New Deal for long term unemployed people aged 25 or over, 25,240 have found sustained employment. We are not at present able to measure how many, if any, will have left these jobs within 13 weeks and chosen not to claim JSA.

I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence in which you asked how many Tornado GR1s have been successfully upgraded to GR4; how many are in upgrade servicing; how many are awaiting upgrade; and what is the estimated completion date of the upgrade. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.
<BR>
Fifty Tornado GR1s have been successfully upgraded to GR4 standard, twenty-one are currently in upgrade servicing and a further seventy-one aircraft are awaiting upgrade. The Tornado MLU programme is due to be completed in February 2003.
<BR>
Incremental acquisition is a key component of the Tornado MLU programme. For instance, the first 24 aircraft delivered to the RAF were equipped to an initial standard, but have also been fitted to receive further planned upgrades. From aircraft 25 Identification Friend or Foe Mark 12 system and electronically protected radios are being fitted and from aircraft number 61 the full clearance for the Paveway III Laser Guided Bomb, a new Laser Initial Navigation System, Global Positioning System and a Ground Proximity Warning system are added.

I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence in which you asked what the total estimated cost per unit of the Tornado GR1 midlife upgrade programme is, including development and production. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.
<BR>
The estimated unit cost of the Tornado GR1 midlife update programme, including development and production, at current prices, is &#163;6.8m.

I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence in which you asked for details of the total estimated cost and unit cost of the TIALD system included in the Tornado MLU programme specifying in each case the proportion of cost incurred by development and production. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.
<BR>
Integration of the TIALD system onto Tornado GR4 is but one element of the MLU93 firm price contract placed with PANAVIA (industrial consortium comprising BAE, DASA and Alenia) via the Tornado tri-national project office in 1994. Within the total contract value we are not able to identify the costs specifically associated with TIALD integration, a task which is essentially software integration and involving minimal production cost.
<BR>
The TIALD pods used on Tornado are common to a number of different aircraft types including Harrier GR7, Harrier T10, Tornado GR1 and Tornado GR4; and were procured as part of a separate equipment programme. A total of 23 pods have been procured at a total development cost of &#163;23m and a production cost per pod of &#163;1.7m (both at 1999 prices).

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many people from industry are currently (a) leading and (b) are members of integrated project teams; and if he will make a statement.  [109694]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00211w13.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The principle of involving industry within Integrated Project Teams has become a reality. Two candidates from industry successfully competed for and are now leading Integrated Project Teams. Industry membership of IPTs takes a variety of forms depending on individual project circumstances and the stage of each project in the acquisition cycle. Industrial membership is growing as new IPTs are progressively established, and industry is already represented as an integral part of many high profile IPTs. A key feature of the standard IPT transition process is the 'industry day', used to initiate closer participation with industry. The level of industry representation in IPTs will be assessed following completion of the current transition phase.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00211w13.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many integrated project teams cover single projects; and if he will make a statement.  [109695]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00211w13.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Of the 135 Integrated Project Teams, 41 are regarded as managing single projects.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00211w13.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many integrated teams have been created to date; how many it is intended to create; and if he will make a statement.  [109698]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00211w13.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 On 14 February 2000, the final 18 Integrated Project Teams will commence their roll out, bringing the total number of IPTs to 135. This constitutes the final phase of the Smart Procurement programme to move to an IPT-based structure. In the future, I anticipate new IPTs will be formed as a result of further restructuring in the Defence Logistics Organisation and through the normal process of project conception.

<P>
<a name="00211w13.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The intent is that all Defence equipment projects, covering platforms, systems and sub-systems will be managed throughout their lives by Integrated Project Teams. 135 such teams are currently identified to manage a population of over 1,000 individual projects, from those currently in the initial procurement phase, as well as those already in-service.

<a name="00211w13.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is the target for cost reduction on the year-by-year defence equipment procurement budget to be achieved as a result of the Smart Procurement Initiative; and if he will make a statement.  [109699]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00211w13.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We are on track to deliver the &#163;2 billion of reductions in spending on defence equipment procurement that we aimed to achieve on the merit of the Smart Procurement Initiative. These savings are not set out as a target for year by year reduction, as expenditure profiles may vary on individual projects, but are assessed as the sum of reductions made in successive planning rounds, for the 10 years from 1998-99 to 2007-08.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00211w13.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimate he has made of the time needed for the Smart Procurement initiative to be understood, and implemented within his Department; and if he will make a statement.  [109692]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00211w13.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The implementation phase of the Smart Procurement Initiative concludes on 1 April 2000, when the main structural changes will be complete. A recent survey across much of the Department and defence industry has shown that the case for Smart Procurement has been made, and that it is understood and accepted. There can be no reversion to the old ways of doing business. We will continue to reinforce the message to sustain the momentum of the initiative as the tangible benefits come to fruition.

<P>
<a name="00211w13.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what arrangements are in place to ensure that the proprietary information and expertise of competitors in defence procurement projects are protected under the Smart Procurement initiative; and if he will make a statement.  [109691]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00211w13.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 In order that the maximum value can be obtained from Smart Procurement, we are looking to industry to be full participants in open discussion with the Department. The maintenance of confidentiality in respect of commercially sensitive and proprietary information has always been fundamental to the defence procurement relationship. The introduction of Smart Procurement has not changed this principle, and we continue to restrict the disclosure of such information, except where a contractor has specifically approved release.
<P>

<a name="00211w13.html_para0">Practical working arrangements are necessary to allow contractors to conduct dialogue within the acquisition teams in a framework which encourages the generation of ideas without disclosing commercially sensitive or proprietary information to competitors. The measures taken to protect such information vary according to circumstances, but can include formal Confidentiality Agreements or limiting the number of individuals having access to sensitive information, drawing from existing codes of practice as appropriate.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00211w13.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how co-operation with industry after contract signature under Smart Procurement differs from post-signature supplier co-operation under the previous procurement system; and if he will make a statement.  [109693]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00211w13.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Prior to the Smart Procurement Initiative our relationships with suppliers did not always maximise opportunities for joint approaches to problem solving, and arms-length interaction could hamper fully effective communications. One of the key elements of Smart Procurement is an improved relationship with industry, under which we seek to derive maximum benefit from better working practices and shared objectives. We are promoting a culture of greater openness and trust: a "no surprise" culture where co-operation, consultation and the sharing of data will facilitate success. Following contract signature therefore, and in the context of this more open approach, the MOD and industry will remain jointly focused on the delivery of the defence equipment capability to agreed performance parameters, within cost and on time.
<P>

<a name="00211w13.html_para1">There is no conflict between robust contracting and mutually beneficial team working.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what recent representations he has received from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food regarding the sourcing from within the United Kingdom of meat for the armed forces. [R] [109813]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00211w13.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Over the past two years, officials in my Department have had regular discussions with their counterparts at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in order to ensure that all opportunities to source British meat for the Armed Forces at competitive prices are explored. One outcome of these discussions has been that MOD secured access to stocks of British intervention beef, with the result that 100 per cent. of beef for the Armed Forces in the UK is currently of British origin.
