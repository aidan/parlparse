<a name="11205w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Barron: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport which recommendations of the tobacco taskforce have been implemented to date; and which are planned to be implemented in the future.  [20156]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2001]:</i> The tobacco taskforce was established in 1998 to provide practical assistance to the sports affected by the Government's decision to ban tobacco sponsorship of sport. The taskforce's role is mainly advisory: to assist sports currently in receipt of tobacco sponsorship to find replacement sponsors by assessing the needs of each sport offering advice on best practice in establishing commercial relationships with sponsors; and assisting the sports in making links with potential new sponsors. In all, seven sports have sought assistance to make the transition from tobacco sponsorship&#151;rugby league, clay pigeon shooting, billiards and snooker, pool, darts, ice-hockey and angling.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Barron: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what the value of tobacco sponsorship for each sport sponsored in the UK, was in the last 12 months for which figures are available.  [20167]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2001]:</i> Records are not kept of the amount of tobacco sponsorship received by each sport. As part of the 1995 voluntary agreement on sponsorship of sport, the Tobacco Manufacturers Association is required to make a return detailing the expenditure incurred in that year by tobacco sponsorship in the United Kingdom. The total value of tobacco sponsorship of sport in the United Kingdom for 1999&#150;2000 was &#163;8,815,000.

<a name="11205w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Hepburn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans she has further to develop grassroots sports in the north-east.  [20358]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government are committed to the development of sport and increasing opportunities for participation throughout the country. The strategy for sport&#151;A Sporting Future for All&#151;and the Government's plan for sport set out an action plan on how we intend to achieve those objectives. Responsibility for developing grassroots sport at the regional level rests with a number of organisations including Sport England, local authorities, local education authorities, schools, sports governing bodies, sports clubs, volunteers, and in order to ensure the best use of resources it is essential that all these interests work in partnership.

<P>

<a name="11205w01.html_para0">In the north-east region all of the programmes for providing better sports facilities and improving sports provision are being implemented. These include lottery funding, where almost &#163;80 million has been committed to the region, the school sport co-ordinators programme and specialist sports colleges, while &#163;20.6 million under the spaces for sport and arts, &#163;37.9 million under NOF Round three and &#163;2.8 million under the NOF Green Spaces programmes will be invested into facilities which will be available to schools and the wider community.
<P>

<a name="11205w01.html_para1">The North East Sports Board has also published its Sports Strategy&#151;2001&#150;2006 as a result of which eight action plan implementation groups have been set up to take forward a range of issues including investment in sport, health, education, social inclusion and links to economic and cultural strategies.
<P>

<a name="11205w01.html_para2">For the future I have made it clear that I want to see a strengthened regional structure for the delivery of sport in the regions which involves local decision making and strong partnerships with all the key local interests. I will be discussing these issues with the Sport England Council and its new chief executive when he is in post.

<P>
<a name="11205w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Letwin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if it is her policy to reduce grants to English Heritage proportionately to reductions on VAT liabilities following the Finance Act 2001.  [20180]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2001]:</i> In the last Budget the Chancellor announced a new grant scheme to assist repairs and maintenance to listed places of worship. Initial estimates are that the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme could be worth up to &#163;30 million per year. There is no cap on the scheme; all listed places of worship that meet the criteria will receive a grant. This Department has been asked to make a small contribution to its administration costs. We have asked English Heritage to meet this commitment, which they have chosen to do through the redirection of &#163;2 million in grant-in-aid from the Joint Places of Worship (JPOW) Scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will list the schemes administered by <i>(a)</i> her Department and <i>(b)</i> its agencies where funds are allocated by a competitive bidding process; and what was the amount of money allocated to each scheme.  [19789]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2001]:</i> My Department administers two schemes through Re:source, the Council for Museums, Archives and Libraries, where awards are allocated on a competitive bidding process. These are the DCMS/Wolfson challenge fund for public library projects to which we allocate &#163;2 million a year; and the designated museums challenge fund for which &#163;15 million was allocated for the three year period from 1999&#150;2000 to 2001&#150;02 to support projects to improve presentation at museums with designated collections.

of the effectiveness of the National Foundation for Youth Music in providing more opportunity for young people to participate in musical activity; and if she will make a statement.  [19613]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 November 2001]:</i> The National Foundation for Youth Music operates independently of Government. It has made over 500 awards nationally totalling nearly &#163;16.5 million, and reaching over 150,000 participants. 84 per cent. of these are enjoying their first musical experience.

<a name="11205w01.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Kumar: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what action she is taking to ensure that all areas of the UK proceed at the same rate with the shift from analogue to broadband broadcasting.  [19976]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government are committed to ensuring that everyone who currently receives free-to-air broadcast channels on analogue will continue to do so digitally after the switchover to digital television, whether by terrestrial, cable or satellite means. We recognise that there are some synergies between the ranges of services which digital television and broadband access can deliver and we aim to ensure that these synergies are developed. But it is for the competitive market to determine which services are valued by consumers and which technology is best able to deliver them.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment she has made of <i>(a)</i> the future of and <i>(b)</i> the costs of improved access to the Grand Prix circuit at Silverstone.  [17327]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Silverstone is one of the most popular Grand Prix circuits in the world. The Government are in discussion with the owners and operators of Silverstone about its future and their proposals for its redevelopment.
<P>

<a name="11205w01.html_para3">The operator of Silverstone is concerned that the problems encountered by spectators arriving at recent British Grand Prix threaten the retention of the event. The operator has been consulting with the Highways Agency and the local authorities about an improved access from the A43 trunk road. Planning applications have recently been submitted to the planning authorities. I have made no estimate of the costs of these proposals.

<P>
<a name="11205w01.html_wqn8"><B> Nick Harvey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans the Government have to submit bids for future major international sporting events; and if she will make a statement.  [18166]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Responsibility for submitting bids for major sports events lies with the relevant governing body. The Government encourage all sports to work closely with the UK sports major event's steering group in the preparation of bids for major events to ensure that bids are properly co-ordinated. Where a bid cannot proceed without significant public funding, the Government will need to review all aspects of a bid thoroughly before giving any support. The Government have asked the 



<P>

<P>
<a name="11205w01.html_wqn9"><B> Nick Harvey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what work her Department is undertaking to ensure that Sheffield is a viable alternative to London as a bidder for the 2005 World Championships; and if she will make a statement.  [17944]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) decided at its council meeting on 26 November to reject the offer of Sheffield's Don Valley Stadium as an alternative to Picketts Lock and to reopen the bidding for the 2005 World Athletics Championships. The IAAF's decision is disappointing; Sheffield would have provided an outstanding venue for the 2005 World Championships.
<P>

<a name="11205w01.html_para4">At a meeting between UK Athletics, Sheffield city council, the Government, UK Sport, Sport England and the British Olympic Association on 27 November, it was agreed unanimously that UK Athletics should not enter a Sheffield bid.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what percentage of publicly owned school sports fields have been sold <i>(a)</i> since 1997 and <i>(b)</i> in 2001&#150;02.  [17176]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w02.html_spnew0"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="11205w02.html_para0">In October 1998, this Government introduced new legislation to protect school playing fields from unjustified disposal. Precise information on the number of sales that have taken place since that time was included in the answer given by my hon. Friend the Minister of State for School Standards on 18 October 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1292W.
<P>

<a name="11205w02.html_para1">Before October 1998, local authorities were able to sell school playing fields without the permission of the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, and information on the individual sales that took place was not collected centrally. Information on the total number of school sports fields was also not available centrally.
<P>

<a name="11205w02.html_para2">We are currently validating the Asset Management Plan information we have received from authorities, including that relating to school sports fields, and hope to be in a position to publish further analysis in the spring.

 <i>[holding answer 20 November 2001]:</i> Historical information in respect of the financial years 1997&#150;98; 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 for the Post Office Users' Councils in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland can be found in the annual reports for those years in question. The annual reports were placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Information in respect of the Post Office Users' National Council was contained in the answer on 4 December 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 149W.
<P>

<a name="11205w02.html_para3">The Consumer Council for Postal Services (known as Postwatch) was established to fulfil an important role in the new postal regulatory framework. It has wider statutory obligations and powers than POUNC and a more extensive regional structure. When considering Postwatch's budget we wish to ensure that Postwatch has sufficient funds to fulfil its role effectively.
<P>

<a name="11205w02.html_para4">We have agreed a total budget of &#163;7.8 million for Postwatch for the financial year 2001&#150;02. The sum initially agreed for Postwatch for this financial year (&#163;6.9 million) has recently been increased by &#163;0.9 million in light of special circumstances associated with establishing a new organisation within a new regulatory framework.
<P>

<a name="11205w02.html_para5">The figures on planned expenditure on Postwatch for the two financial years 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 are provisional and may be subject to adjustment with ministerial approval. This Department has not yet received from Postwatch a detailed bid for the financial year 2002&#150;03 but we will consider the bid on its merits.

 The Manufacturing Advisory Service is in the process of being established. No firms have been assisted as the regional centres of delivery have not been announced.

 The DTI, Small Business Service and DEFRA have not made estimates of the numbers of jobs lost; the number of businesses that will be lost in the next 12 months; or the numbers of businesses that have ceased trading in the small business sector as a result of foot and mouth disease. It would be difficult to arrive at such figures, given that in many cases there will be a number of factors influencing a decision to reduce the size of a business or to cease trading, for example prospects for an individual business prior to the foot and mouth outbreak.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="11205w03.html_para0">The Global Compact is the UN Secretary General's initiative on global corporate social responsibility involving a number of leading international companies and NGOs. It encourages companies to take nine core human rights, labour and environment principles into consideration in their business in the developing world. We fully support the UN Global Compact and were one of the first Governments to do so. The Global Compact is a voluntary instrument aimed at developing best practice that goes beyond compliance frameworks and encourages creative responsibility on the part of companies. We encourage firms operating in developing countries like Sudan to consider how they can best implement the principles behind the compact. The compact offers the potential to make a tangible improvement to the quality of life of people affected by UK company operations around the globe, but particularly in the developing world.

 International criminal courts are not a substitute for national jurisdictions.

Setting up a new international court or tribunal to try terrorism would cause great delay, not least since there is no internationally agreed definition of terrorism.

 Public service broadcasting is important at a time of international tension when millions of people around the world rely on the BBC's objective reporting.

I welcome these enhancements. A survey carried out among Pashto and Persian-speaking male heads of household in Afghanistan before the crisis indicated that 71 per cent. of Pashto speakers and 62 per cent. of Persian speakers listened to the World Service weekly.

However, in the interest of furthering the process of putting all arms beyond use, the Commission declined to provide further details.

 We have published a draft Justice (Northern Ireland) Bill and an implementation plan to take forward the recommendations of the review of the criminal justice system. We are consulting on our response to the review and expect to introduce the legislation in this Session. Our response to the review marks another key step in implementing the Belfast Agreement.
<P>

<a name="11205w06.html_para5">This was the most important review of its kind to have been undertaken in Northern Ireland in the last 30 years. The criminal justice system has served the people of Northern Ireland well over many years, often in very difficult circumstances. The review is radical and progressive, maintaining the best of the old system while integrating applicable international concepts and practices.

 The Government utterly condemn all paramilitary violence and intimidation and remain resolute in the fight against the illegal activities of paramilitary organisations. We will continue to ensure that the Chief Constable and the GOC have the resources at their disposal to meet the threat. With regard to organised crime, the Government are tackling this on a number of fronts. The organised crime problem is sophisticated and our response is too.
<P>

<a name="11205w07.html_para0">The organised crime taskforce has been in operation for just over a year and has overseen structural improvements in the way organised crime is tackled. Links between the various agencies are developing. This is leading to operational success such as the 42.5 million cigarettes seized in Warrenpoint Harbour during a search of a vessel which had just arrived from Latvia: the largest ever such seizure in the United Kingdom.

 The Secretary of State continues to monitor the ceasefires of all paramilitary groups. He receives regular briefings from the Chief Constable and his senior security advisers. The decision by the IRA to decommission its weapons has led the Chief Constable to conclude there to be a reduction in the threat to enable further normalisation measures to proceed. However, we are not complacent. There remains a significant threat from dissident republican groups as evidenced by the recent bomb found in Armagh.

<P>
<a name="11205w08.html_spnew10"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Government do not intend to extend the scope of the proposed Regulation on cross-border payments in euro to sterling denominated payments. The approach taken in the Regulation is inconsistent with the competition-based approach that we believe is the better way of tackling the problem of market failure in cross-border payments. Such an approach would be consistent with our commitment to introduce a new regime for regulating competition in domestic payment systems&#151;as recommended by the Cruickshank report. Not including sterling denominated payments would also avoid the potentially counter-productive effects arising from the proposed Regulation that could be damaging to consumers.

 The European Commission is responsible for publishing statistics on fraud and irregularities against the EC budget. Its latest report including figures for detected irregularities was published in May 2001, entitled "Protecting the Community's financial interests and the Fight against Fraud", and is available on the internet. Details of the developments described in the Commission's report are also set out in the Government's July 2001 "Statement on the 2001 EC Budget and Measures to Counter Fraud and Financial Mismanagement", Cm 5173.
<P>

<a name="11205w09.html_para7">Care should be taken in interpreting the statistics because the Commission's report does not distinguish between cases of fraud and irregularities. Errors arise when, for example, payments are made outside prescribed time limits or using the wrong exchange rates. Moreover, increases in the level of detected errors may be attributed to improved detection and notification of cases by member states.

 The Government's replacement insurance scheme for UK airlines and service providers was due to expire at midnight on 23 November. Assessment of the aviation insurance market demonstrated that commercial capacity for underwriting third-party war and terrorism liabilities above $50 million has not yet returned. It is unlikely that there will be any significant return of commercial insurance until reinsurance contracts are renegotiated at the beginning of January, which will shape the whole of the aviation industry, including aviation, for the next 12 months. Therefore the Treasury announced on 22 November that it had decided to extend the airline insurance scheme until midnight on 22 January 2002.

 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2001]:</i> The current Service Delivery Agreement target relating to the removal of failed asylum seekers from the United Kingdom is to remove 3,000 in 2001&#150;02; 33,000 in 2002&#150;03; and 37,000 in 2003&#150;04. The totals include dependants.
<P>

<a name="11205w10.html_para4">The 30,000 target for this year has always been extremely ambitious and high risk. No European country has achieved levels of this kind and the Home Secretary announced in the House as early as 27 June that the target would not be met. We aim to remove at the rate of 2,500 per month from early next year.

 I understand from the Chief Constable that on 31 August the force had 3,203 police officers. This is six more officers than the force had in March 2001 and is a record number of officers. South Yorkshire Police has set a budgeted workforce total for 31 March 2002 of 3,200 officers. On 31 March 2001 the force had 1,312 civilian support staff, 21 more than in March 1997.

 Public Bodies 2000 sets out information on non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs), certain public corporations (including nationalised industries) and NHS bodies. There are four types of NDPB: executive NDPBs; advisory NDPBs; tribunal NDPBs; and boards of visitors to penal establishments. The next edition will be published around the end of the year. Information about taskforces, and ad hoc advisory groups is set out in an annual report, published by the Cabinet Office. Copies of Public Bodies 2000 are in the Library and this publication may be accessed via the Cabinet Office's website http:// www.official-documents.co.uk/document/caboff/pb00/ pb00.htm.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he routinely takes to monitor immigration through south coast ports; and how that has increased since 11 September.  [18393]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w11.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Passengers arriving at south coast ports are routinely examined by an immigration officer in order to establish their nationality and identity and whether they require leave to enter. The personal details of all such passengers are checked against the Immigration Service Warnings Index, a computer system, which provides information to immigration staff for the purpose of immigration control, national security and the prevention of crime. All Immigration Service staff at points of entry on the south coast have access to this system.
<P>

<a name="11205w11.html_para3">The Immigration Service also routinely conducts vehicle searches in order to detect people attempting to enter the United Kingdom clandestinely. Advanced scanning equipment including x-ray machines and carbon dioxide detectors have been introduced in order to assist in the detection of such people.
<P>

<a name="11205w11.html_para4">The Immigration Service is developing closer liaison with the French authorities and carriers in order to control the flow of passengers arriving in the United Kingdom without any identifying documentation. A United Kingdom liaison officer from the Immigration Service now operates alongside French colleagues in Paris and juxtaposed immigration controls were established at Waterloo and Paris this year, which enables passengers to be cleared before they pass through the channel tunnel. It has also had significant success in taking forward, in conjunction with the police, the prosecution of people suspected of having attempted to facilitate the illegal entry of inadequately documented foreign nationals.
<P>

<a name="11205w11.html_para5">Since 11 September all ports throughout the country have been put on a heightened state of alert. The Immigration Service has issued instructions to all operational officers advising them of the procedures to be followed, including closer liaison with the Security Services in the event of known or suspected terrorists being encountered.

 Immigration Officers routinely attend ports which are normally unstaffed, in order to examine passengers arriving on services originating from outside the European Economic Area. Other services are closely monitored and carriers are required to fax passenger manifests to a designated local immigration office. The personal details of the passengers are checked against the Immigration Service Warnings Index. The Warnings Index computer system is the primary tool for providing information to staff operating the immigration entry control; it also provides information on matters of national security and the prevention of crime. All Immigration Service staff at points of entry have access to this system. If the passenger is a national of a country from outside the European Economic Area, and the immigration officer is

satisfied that he qualifies for entry under the Immigration Rules, he will grant him leave to enter, normally following a telephone interview.
<P>

<a name="11205w11.html_para6">In order to preserve the integrity of the control immigration officers also make regular unannounced visits to unstaffed ports in order to ensure that the correct procedures are being followed. The Immigration Service maintains close links with Customs and Excise and the police, sharing intelligence where appropriate in relation to arriving passengers.
<P>

<a name="11205w11.html_para7">All ports around the country have been put on a heightened state of alert since 11 September and the Immigration Service has issued instructions to all officers advising them of the procedures to be followed, including close liaison with the security services, in the event of known or suspected terrorists being encountered.

 Immigration staff are deployed on a permanent 24 hour basis at all designated points of entry on the south coast. As of 26 November, provisional figures indicate that 367 immigration officers and 106 assistant immigration officers are currently based at Dover, covering a range of functions including interviewing arriving passengers, searching freight vehicles and working at Coquelles, the point of entry for the Channel Tunnel in France. As of 26 November 2001, the staffing figures for the other south coast ports are given in the table.

There is however an on-going national recruitment campaign for the Immigration Service. Between April 2000 and October 2001 staffing levels at Poole, Plymouth, Portsmouth and Southampton increased by 113 per cent., 47 per cent., 43 per cent. and 45 per cent. respectively.

DU used for other purposes has been present in a number of the aircraft listed in the earlier answer that are the property of MOD, at RAF Stafford, at the research establishment at Fort Halstead, at sites involved in the naval propulsion programme, and at the Royal hospital, Haslar.

 The immunisation programme for armed forces personnel in the Gulf conflict involved a number of vaccinations. These can be divided into three categories: those which were part of the anti-biological warfare (BW) immunisation programme; routine service health immunisations and third, travel and specific immunisations against the risks associated with individuals' particular employment.
<P>

<a name="11205w13.html_para5">Details of the anti-BW immunisation programme, including datasheets on the vaccines used, were published in the Ministry of Defence paper: "Background to the Use of Medical Countermeasures to Protect British Forces during the Gulf War (Operation GRANBY)" in October 1997. A further paper entitled: "Implementation of the Immunisation Programme against Biological Warfare Agents for UK Forces during the Gulf Conflict 1990&#150;91" dated January 2000 provides details on how the anti-BW immunisation programme was implemented, including estimates of the numbers immunised. Detailed information on the numbers of routine service, travel and employment specific immunisations administered is not available. Copies of both documents are available in the Library of the House and on the MOD's website at: www.gulfwar.mod.uk.
<P>

<a name="11205w13.html_para6">As the January 2000 paper makes clear, some individuals would have received a typhoid and tetanus vaccination which is routinely given as one combined immunisation referred to as TABT (typhoid, paratyphoid strains A and B plus tetanus). All of the other immunisations were administered singly. No tests were carried out in advance of the effects of combining a number of drugs into a vaccine because no such combination was intended. Details of such tests as were carried out in advance are set out in the October 1997 paper; some of these are being replicated in MOD's vaccines interactions research programme which is studying whether the vaccines used to protect UK personnel during the Gulf conflict can give rise to adverse health effects. This work is due to complete in 2003. The findings will be published in scientific literature.

 The Royal Marines continue to be challenged by overall undermanning of about 6 per cent., although recruiting is meeting current targets, retention rates need to be improved and a range of measures are in hand to achieve this. We are confident that the Royal Marine forces deployed on operations will be manned to the appropriate level for any likely task arising.

(2) what delays have taken place when providing air transport to evacuate service casualties from Kosovo in the last month;  [20450]

<P>
<a name="11205w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Eight service personnel were aeromedically evacuated from Kosovo to the UK in November. The return of three patients to the UN on 6 November took around four hours longer than originally scheduled, due to the distance some members of the Critical Care Team had to travel to reach RAF Lyneham, the subsequent requirement to undertake a crew change in Italy, and the failure of airfield lights there. We would normally expect aeromedical evacuation from Kosovo to take around 24 hours. On this occasion it took around 26 hours.
<P>

<a name="11205w15.html_para1">Seven of the eight patients went to the Centre for Defence Medicine. Six were admitted to the University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust and one was admitted to City Hospital, Birmingham. None of these were transferred from one Birmingham hospital to another. However, one of them was subsequently transferred to a hospital in Scotland for rehabilitative care closer to his family.

 Information on significant asset disposals in Financial Years 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 is contained in the Ministry of Defence section (Section 7) of the National Asset Register (NAR) published by the Treasury in July 2001. The NAR provides information by Top Level Budget Holder and Agency Chief Executive, and a copy has been placed in the Library of the House.

 I assume the hon. Member is referring to civilian employees of the Department whether working in direct support of the armed forces or elsewhere in the Ministry of Defence. As explained in the Strategic Defence Review White Paper (Cm 3999), changes in civilian personnel numbers result from the drive for greater effectiveness and better value for money. Para 30 section 2.1 of the UK Defence Statistics 2001 contains details of the changes and copies have been placed in the Library of the House.

 In respect of Eurofighter, the order for the first tranche of aircraft, including 55 for the United Kingdom, was placed in 1998. The contracts for the second and final tranches are expected to be placed during 2003 and 2007, respectively.

<a name="11205w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Our assessment of renewing or refitting the Army Lynx helicopters has shown that it could not provide the capability required. The Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter project is intended to replace the capability provided by the Lynx Marks 7 and 9. It is planned to enter service from the middle of this decade. Plans announced in the Strategic Defence Review to convert 10 Naval Lynx Mk3 helicopters to Mk8 standard have been put on hold pending the outcome of studies into a potential alternative, a Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft capability.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his estimate is of the <i>(a)</i> purchase cost and <i>(b)</i> running cost of the two aircraft carriers which he plans to secure for the Royal Navy.  [18826]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w16.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The purchase of the two new aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy is expected to cost up to &#163;2.9 billion. It is too early in the programme to provide definitive figures on the anticipated running costs of the carriers, since much will depend on the eventual design that is selected. Reliable forecasts for the carriers' running costs are being developed to inform the main investment decision on their build, which is currently scheduled for the end of 2003. As the ships are being designed to reduce support costs from the outset and will not undergo long refit periods while in-service, it is our intention that the overall running costs for the enhanced capability that CVF will offer should be less than that for the current class of ships.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Since work began on a PPP solution for the future of DERA following the Strategic Defence Review in 1998, external advice has been received on most aspects of the PPP process. This includes advice in support of the detailed options study and the subsequent further work on selected options, legal and financial aspects of the split of DERA and on the eventual transaction. &#163;6.4 million has been spent so far. These costs are subject to continuous scrutiny to ensure that the services of advisers offer value for money. The costs of QinetiQ's advisers are being met by the company.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w16.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I have placed in the Library of the House a list of the historic and heritage properties and scheduled monuments, which are in the Ministry of Defence's care. I regard these properties as very valuable in both national and departmental terms, and we seek to maintain them to the highest appropriate standards.
<P>

<a name="11205w16.html_para0">Valuation of such properties is, however, difficult whether in terms of the contribution they make to our business, or in open market terms. For MOD accounting purposes we record only the replacement value of operational assets (for instance, an historic building used for administrative purposes would be valued as an office with certain capacity). The National Asset Register records historic/heritage properties as having nil value. Given the number of properties in the keeping of the MOD, as well as their often unique history and location, the information required is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost, which would in any case be of questionable practical use.

<P>

<a name="11205w16.html_para2">Those figures imply that a further 0.1 per cent. of GDP would be required in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 to maintain UK defence spending at a constant percentage of UK GDP, though the figure for 2001&#150;02 includes estimated conflict prevention funding (which cannot be forecast for subsequent years).

<a name="11205w16.html_para5">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) is committed to the pursuit of efficiency and value for money. The MOD's Public Service Agreement was published in December 1998, and set key targets for the period 1999&#150;2000 to 2001&#150;02, reflecting the outcome of the Strategic Defence Review. The PSA set many challenging value for money targets, and the Department has made good progress against these. MOD's Departmental Performance Report (DPR) was recently published and set out in detail progress against each target. A copy of the DPR has been placed in the Library of the House.

 This Government are undertaking the largest programme of new warship building for many years. Since May 1997 the Ministry of Defence has placed:
<P>

<a name="11205w16.html_para6">(a) contracts for four Alternative Landing Ships Logistic (ALSLs) at an overall value of about &#163;300 million, expected in-service between late 2004 and late 2005. The ALSL class is now expected to be in service earlier than previously envisaged, due to good co-operation between the two shipbuilders (Swan Hunter Tyneside and BAE Systems Marine) concerned;
<P>

<a name="11205w16.html_para7">(b) a prime contract, valued at about &#163;1.3 billion, for three new Type 45 Destroyers, the first of which is expected to enter service in 2007. We announced earlier this year our intention, subject to commercial negotiations, to amend this contract to increase our commitment to a total of six ships.
<P>

<a name="11205w16.html_para8">(c) a lease contract for three new offshore patrol vessels, expected to enter service between autumn 2002 and autumn 2003. The total cost of the lease package is approximately &#163;60 million.




<P>
<P><I>5 Dec 2001 : Column: 355W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11205w16.html_para9">(d) a contract for two Survey Vessels, at an approximate cost of &#163;130 million for the vessels and 25 years of support, expected in-service in winter 2002 and summer 2003.
<P>

<a name="11205w16.html_para10">As to our future plans, we expect to purchase two new Future Aircraft Carriers, for which an order is planned in 2004, costing up to &#163;2.9 billion at outturn prices. We currently plan that the first ship will enter service in 2012. Other orders over the next few years will include further ASTUTE class submarines and Type 45 Destroyers.
<P>

<a name="11205w16.html_para11">Our longer-term plans include the future surface combatant programme to replace the current Type 22 and Type 23 Frigates and a variety of other vessels. We are also investigating options to replace the capabilities currently filled by those ships in the Royal Fleet Auxiliary fleet which are scheduled to leave service towards the end of the decade. It is not possible to provide accurate details of the cost or individual in-service dates of these vessels at this stage.
<P>

<a name="11205w16.html_para12">It remains our policy that all new warships will be built in the UK.

 The defence budget share of gross domestic product for financial year 2000&#150;01 was 2.5 per cent. From data supplied by nations, we estimate the NATO average to be around 2.2 per cent. for a comparable period. Although there are no equivalent EU data, we believe the average was around 1.8 per cent.

 We are not currently planning to order a new tank for the Army. Deliveries of the Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank (CR2) have only recently been completed. The CR2 provides an excellent capability, ensuring that British forces will continue to be properly equipped to conduct high intensity warfare for many years to come. However, as one would expect, research and evaluation into its potential successor is taking place now. It is too early to properly identity the type of vehicle that will eventually replace the CR2.

The 'other' category refers to equipment not specific to a particular environment. This division (air, land, sea and other) does not necessarily match the particular end destination of the equipment (ie RAF, Army and Navy). For example, not all aerospace equipment is used by the RAF.
<P>

<a name="11205w17.html_para1">From 1999&#150;2000, the division of equipment expenditure into air, land, sea and other is not available due to changes in the Departments accounting procedures and a move to Tri-Service based procurement.

The first stage premium is payable so long as there is clear evidence that the trust is attempting to achieve the targets. The second, small premium, is payable on a specialty by specialty basis, separately as regards the targets for out-patient attendance and in-patient admissions, and is dependant on the full achievement of the target.

<a name="11205w19.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The National Health Service Counter Fraud Service has carried out two patient prescription charge evasion exercises, measuring (to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.6 per cent.) the levels of fraud by patients from samples taken in November 1998 and July 1999. The amount of money lost to the NHS is estimated at &#163;117 million in 1998&#150;99 and &#163;69 million in 1999&#150;2000, demonstrating a reduction in losses from evasion of &#163;48 million (41 per cent.). The NHS CFS will continue to measure prescription fraud on a regular basis.

<P>
<a name="11205w19.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Between the establishment of the Prescription Pricing Authority Compliance Unit on 1 April 1996 and June 2000 there was one criminal prosecution of a patient for fraudulently claiming prescription exemption. This case was handled by the police and occurred in 1999.
<P>

<a name="11205w19.html_para4">The unit was not involved in the prosecution of any contractors.
<P>

<a name="11205w19.html_para5">In June 2000 a new pharmaceutical fraud team was formed from the existing PPA Fraud Investigation Unit and integrated into the National Health Service Counter Fraud Service.
<P>

<a name="11205w19.html_para6">This has so far brought four successful prosecution cases against contractors to the NHS for prescription fraud. Two of these were completed in 2000 and two in 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w19.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 A number of features were introduced in 1998. Among these are an ultra violet light sensitive mark in the forms, as an anti-counterfeiting device and serial numbering, primarily to aid tracking of prescription forms. There are a number of other security features which, for obvious reasons, must remain confidential.

 Since NHS Direct east midlands was launched in February 1999 it has handled over 695,000 calls. This year alone it has handled over 340,000 calls. Where NHS Direct has acted as the first point of contact for patients seeking medical help out-of-hours, up to 50 per cent. of calls are handled without the need for onward referral to an out-of hours-doctor. By 2004 NHS Direct will be a one-stop gateway to out-of-hours health care passing on calls where necessary, to the appropriate general practitioner co-operative, including those in Leicestershire
<P>

<a name="11205w20.html_para4">NHS Direct is improving access to health care by advising callers which part of the national health service to contact. NHS Direct nurses routinely advise two out of three callers to use a more appropriate setting of care than the caller said they would otherwise have used.

 There are no recorded instances of patients dying on trolleys in the Leicestershire health authority area while awaiting admission in accident and emergency, with the exception of Brenda Jones, who died in Leicester Royal infirmary on 20 November.
<P>

<a name="11205w21.html_para1">After being assessed and waiting on a trolley for several hours, Mrs. Jones was being seen by a doctor in Leicester Royal infirmary accident and emergency department when she collapsed. She was taken to a resuscitation room, where sadly she died. A post mortem has revealed that she died of a pulmonary embolus. The trust's initial investigations suggest this could not have been foreseen from her presenting condition. Nevertheless, a full investigation is being carried out and University Hospitals of Leicester NHS trust has already revisited and strengthened its procedures and has apologised to Mrs. Jones' husband.

 The University Hospitals of Leicester national health service trust is carrying out an urgent investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mrs. Jones' death in the accident and emergency department at Leicester Royal infirmary (LRI) after a considerable time spent waiting on a trolley. Initial investigations indicate that Mrs. Jones' treatment in accident and emergency was appropriate to her presenting condition. A post mortem revealed that she died of a pulmonary embolus and it is believed that this could not have been foreseen. Nevertheless, procedures have been revisited and strengthened and the trust has apologised to her husband.
<P>

<a name="11205w21.html_para2">Following visits to Leicester Royal infirmary by the National Patients Access Team and the Winter and Emergency Services Team (WEST), a remedial action plan has been put in place, to address the problems of long waiting in accident and emergency at the LRI. The regional office continues to work closely with the trust and WEST to help Leicester to meet the new national target, which states that by the end of March 2002 no one should have to wait more than four hours in accident and emergency before admission.
<P>

<a name="11205w21.html_para3">We are determined to tackle the problem of long trolley waits in some parts of the country. The University Hospitals of Leicester NHS trust has received &#163;3.7 million to modernise its accident and emergency department, as part of our &#163;115 million accident and emergency modernisation programme. A further &#163;366,011 was announced last week for extra emergency care nurses at the trust between now and 2003.

<a name="11205w22.html_para2">Where inquiries under Section 47 of the Children Act 1989 give rise to concern that an unborn child may be at future risk of significant harm, the social services department may need to convene an initial child protection conference prior to the child's birth. Such a conference will have the same status, and should proceed in the same way, as other initial child protection conferences, including decisions about registration on the child protection register. The involvement of midwifery services is vital in such cases.

<a name="11205w22.html_para3">An unborn child will be registered on the child protection register if a decision is taken at the initial child protection conference that the unborn child is at continuing risk of significant harm.

<a name="11205w22.html_para4">An unborn child will be de-registered from the child protection register if the child dies or it is judged that the child is no longer at continuing risk of significant harm requiring safeguarding by means of a child protection plan. De-registration will also take place if the child's family have moved permanently to another local authority area. In this case, the receiving local authority should convene a child protection conference within 15 working days of being notified of the move, only after which event may de-registration take place in respect of the original local authority's child protection register.

 This is an operational matter for London Underground (LU), but they advise that the measures requested do not form part of their regular monitoring and management reporting process. I understand that the most recent available survey on passenger numbers at peak times was completed by London Underground during 2000 and the resulting information on this and on measures of capacity was given by the then Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Keith Hill), in answer to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) on 22 March 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 283W. Regrettably, some of the information given in answer to that earlier PQ was inaccurate and the table provides corrected information.
<P>

<a name="11205w23.html_para1">For each line, the table provides a snapshot of the busiest quarter-hour period on the busiest section. The table shows in columns D and E the figures which London Underground record as the "theoretical design capacity" of trains, as determined by the manufacturer and set out in an earlier answer of 2 February 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 315W; and in columns F and G the actual numbers of people they recorded as using those lines at the busiest period. I regret that the earlier figures were misleading: the corrected figures show that the Underground is not as crowded as the previous answer appeared to show.
<P>

<a name="11205w23.html_para2">However, it should be noted that in practice some trains may have a higher and some a lower crowding. This could be caused by either any unevenness in the time between consecutive trains or in the uneven distribution of customers along platforms.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government's modernisation plans for the London Underground follow the principle that risk should be allocated to whoever is best able to manage it. The aim is not to transfer risk for its own sake, as this would lead to a decline in value for money, but rather to optimise the transfer of risk. The private sector infrastructure companies will be liable for all cost overruns that result from their acting in an uneconomic or inefficient manner. However, the financial risks associated with 'force majeure' events are retained by London Underground, as long as they are not caused by and are beyond the control of the infrastructure companies.

<a name="11205w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 London Underground's costs have primarily increased because of work to maintain and improve performance and reliability against a background of increased demand and past underinvestment.
<P>

<a name="11205w23.html_para3">The increase in London Underground's operating costs also, however, reflects its adoption in 1999 of the mandatory Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 15, which set out revised principles of accounting for tangible fixed assets. The impact of the adoption of FRS15 on London Underground's accounts for 1999&#150;2000 was set out in the reply given by the then Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Keith Hill), to my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Coleman) on 23 January 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 525W.

[15737]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w24.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My Department assessed the urban regeneration implications of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link in 1998 to inform the appraisal of the value for money of the restructured financing deal with London and Continental Railways announced in June 1998. The assessment considered the impact of the link on commercial property development, house building and job creation in the main areas affected by the link, that is, around St. Pancras, Stratford, and Ebbsfleet stations and the Royal Docks. Impacts in the rest of the United Kingdom were not assessed. The assessment of the gross direct regeneration implications associated with the link is shown. The cost of creating a similar number of additional jobs through other regeneration programmes was estimated to be &#163;1,000 million (at 1998 prices).

 The Government attach the greatest importance to the safety of all bus passengers, including children, and try to ensure that the highest possible safety standards are maintained. There are various controls on bus operators aimed at ensuring that all their operations are safe. The powers to terminate a contract if a service is found to be unsafe will be determined by the terms and conditions contained in the contract with the bus operator.

<P>
<a name="11205w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Local transport authorities have a statutory duty to produce a local transport plan (LTP). They are required to set out five-year integrated transport plans which cover all forms of transport and include a set of locally devised aims and objectives, a long-term strategy to meet them, a costed implementation programme and a set of targets and performance indicators to measure progress. They also provide annual progress reports. The first full LTPs were produced in July 2000 and cover the period from April 2001 to March 2006. Capital resources for local transport improvements are provided through the annual local transport capital settlement; we will announce shortly the allocations for 2002&#150;03 which will include provision for road safety improvements.
<P>

<a name="11205w24.html_para1">Road safety is an important component of the local transport plan (LTP) process and we will expect to see all transport authorities to be making progress in this area.

<a name="11205w24.html_para2">Somerset's first LTP annual progress report reports progress in several inter-related strategies, eg. a 14 per cent. reduction in killed and serious injury (KSI) accidents on the county's roads in 2000 over 1999 and a 50 per cent. reduction (50) in child KSI accidents over the same period. The county has introduced 90 local safety schemes on its roads in the last five years, such as speed management and improving facilities for pedestrians and cyclists, and in 2000&#150;01 nine primary, six middle/secondary schools and one FE college have committed to the Safe Routes to School initiative.

 There is nothing to prevent buyers and sellers agreeing to building contracts when offers are accepted, but we do not believe it would be right to require this by law. Our 1998 consultation exercise showed widespread support for this stance.
<P>

<a name="11205w25.html_para0">As set out in our manifesto, we are committed to making it easier for people buying and selling homes through a new seller's pack. The seller's pack will provide, at the very start of the process, most of the documents and information needed to enable the transaction to proceed speedily and successfully. It will provide prospective buyers with most of the information they need to make an informed offer. The disclosure of this information at the outset will greatly improve transparency and reduce the risk of the transaction failing or the parties having to renegotiate terms due to problems being revealed later on. The necessary legislation will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w25.html_wqn8"><B> Dr. Murrison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what measures he has in place for determining the impact of the Statutory Off Road Notification Scheme.  [20597]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w25.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) scheme was one of a number of measures introduced to enhance the accuracy of the vehicle register maintained by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). It is designed to keep DVLA's unlicensed vehicle keeper records up to date. Since introduction over 2.5 million SORN declarations have been made recovering revenue of &#163;6 million. The number of SORN declarations received is constantly monitored and DVLA is carrying out an in depth review of the accuracy of the vehicle register.
<P>

<a name="11205w25.html_para2">SORN prevents unlicensed vehicles from "dropping off" the vehicle register and measuring vehicle excise duty (VED) evasion is a useful way to assess impact. At the last full survey in 1999, evasion rates showed a fall from 4.1 per cent. to 3.9 per cent., a saving of &#163;17 million a year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w25.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The cost of enforcing the Statutory Off Road Notification scheme is approximately &#163;1 million a year. Since enforcement commenced in April 2000, enforcement action has raised over &#163;6 million in fines and penalties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w25.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 In common with other local authority services, the fire service is funded primarily through the revenue support grant system. Local authorities secure most of their funding from Government grants, supplemented by council tax. Levies on the insurance industry contribute to the central Government funds from which revenue support grant is paid.
<P>

<a name="11205w25.html_para3">The Government raised the general question of charging policies for discretionary services provided by local authorities in the Green Paper "Modernising Local Government Finance" which was published in September 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what estimate he has made of the reduction in anticipated carbon savings in 2010 resulting from the delay in implementation for a further five months of the requirements set out in part L of the Building Regulations for improvements to domestic central heating boilers.  [18243]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Deferring implementation of the replacement boiler efficiency standards by five months will cause a slight reduction in the savings expected to accrue. My Department estimates that the cumulative effect of this reduction will be no more than 0.03 Mtonnes per year in 2010, and could be less. The outturn will be dependent on how market factors influence the take-up of the better heating control requirements that were introduced with the deferral to compensate for the lower boiler performances.

 There are 1027.4 full-time equivalent inspectors working in the field carrying out inspections. This number does not include 125.3 full-time equivalent specialist inspectors who in the main carry out investigations rather than planned inspections.

<i>Note:</i><P>

From 2001&#150;02, the Government have changed the way they budget and account for public expenditure. Under the new resource accounting and budgeting arrangements Departments and bodies such as HSE have to budget for non-cash costs such as depreciation on fixed assets and a 6 per cent. capital charge on net assets. This budget is reviewed on an annual basis. HSC/E's budget for non-cash costs in 2001&#150;02 is &#163;12 million. (The figures do not include this.) <P>

 In the light of the events of 11 September, we have established with the fire service stakeholders a group, chaired by HM Chief Inspector of Fire Services. The group is evaluating, among other things, the existing response capabilities of, and the need for specialist appliances and equipment for, local authority fire and rescue services. The group will be reporting shortly and we shall consider the implications of its report, including the resource requirements, as a matter of urgency.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions whether local authorities operating electoral pilots for the May 2002 local elections involving all-postal ballots will be required to <i>(a)</i> ensure that ballot papers are fully accessible to visually impaired voters through the use of (i) standard ballot papers which conform to clear print guidelines, (ii) tactile templates, and (iii) notices in alternative formats and <i>(b)</i> offer visually impaired and other print disabled people an alternative means of casting a secret ballot independently.  [19846]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w27.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The criteria for assessing applications to conduct electoral pilot schemes at the May 2002 local elections include the criterion that no elector, including anyone who is visually impaired, should be disadvantaged in casting their vote in any proposed pilot compared with the standard procedure for conducting elections. We will consider any alternative means for visually impaired electors to vote in secret provided the basic principles for secrecy of the ballot are maintained.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what steps his Department is taking to ensure that electoral administrators comply with the duty to display at least one large print notice and have available a voting template for the benefit of visually impaired voters at every polling station in the May 2002 local elections; and what assessment he has made of the availability of these devices at the 2001 General Election.  [19847]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w27.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 Returning officers are under a legal duty to display a large print ballot paper and to provide a voting device for the visually impaired in each polling station. Any returning officer failing to comply may, therefore, be subject to prosecution. The Home Office ensured that sufficient voting templates were available to every returning officer free of charge to supply each polling station at the 2001 General Election.

<P>
<P><I>5 Dec 2001 : Column: 395W</I><P>
column 850W, on veterinary medicines, for what reasons the minutes of the Advisory Group on Veterinary Medicines are considered confidential.  [20701]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w28.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> The Advisory Group on Veterinary Residues (AGVR) was set up in 1995 under different arrangements from those that are currently in place for its successor, the Veterinary Residues Committee. Members of the AGVR included a number of independent experts from several fields, including a consumer representative. They were aware that a summary of their deliberations would be published each year in the Annual Report on Surveillance for Veterinary Residues. However, at no stage were they advised that their comments in meetings, which were minuted, would be made public. There are also elements in the minutes which may be commercially sensitive.
<P>

<a name="11205w28.html_para0">As indicated in the answer of 27 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 850W, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) is considering how the minutes might be released. However, before they can be released the VMD will need to seek the agreement of all of the former members of the AGVR to the release of information since they had supplied the information in confidence. This is in accordance with Part II, Paragraph 14 (a) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, Second Edition (1997).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps the Government are taking to eradicate fuel poverty in the UK.  [7753]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The UK fuel poverty strategy was published on 21 November. This set out the Government's goal to seek an end to the problem of fuel poverty, with the first target to ensure that by 2010, no vulnerable household&#151;older people, families, disabled and long- term sick&#151;need risk ill health due to a cold home or spend more than 10 per cent. of income to keep warm.
<P>

<a name="11205w28.html_para1">The strategy is based on a range of programmes and measures to tackle the root causes of fuel poverty: programmes to improve the energy efficiency of fuel poor households. These include the individual home energy efficiency schemes within each country as well as programmes to improve the standard of social housing. As part of their reports under the Home Energy Conservation Act 1996, we have asked energy conservation authorities to report on their efforts to tackle fuel poverty; continuing action to maintain the downward pressure on fuel bills, ensuring fair treatment for the less well off; continuing action to tackle poverty and social exclusion.
<P>

<a name="11205w28.html_para2">We will also be working with interested groups to further improve these programmes, and also to develop programmes that can identify and assist those healthy adult households at risk from longer-term fuel poverty.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"On 9 July you tabled a parliamentary question which I was unable to reply to before the House rose for summer recess. You asked what contingency plans there were to stop the spread of foot and mouth disease in (a) Vale of York, (b) North Yorkshire and (c) Yorkshire and the Humber region.
<P>
<BR>
I am sorry that I was unable to reply, but had I had done so, I would have told you that a contingency plan has been drawn up that will enable the Department and field staff to respond rapidly to an outbreak occurring in any of the three areas. The current plan emphasises the continued adherence to and rigorous enforcement of the existing control strategies, including tight bio-security. It is a working document that will be refined in the light of any developments including up to date advice. In addition, DEFRA has now announced that in an area surrounding Thirsk, additional, stronger biosecurity measures will be introduced. A Press Release (59/01) was issued on 23 July."
<P>

<P>

<a name="11205w28.html_para4">Since the date of that letter, the plan has been further developed to ensure that strict biosecurity measures, along the lines of those applied in the Thirsk area, can be rapidly implemented should a new case occur in any part of the region. These measures coupled with the ongoing message on biosecurity continue to be successful in preventing the spread of the disease.
<P>

<a name="11205w28.html_para5">In addition, we maintain the capability, both in terms of infrastructure and resources, to respond to any recurrence of disease expeditiously.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2001]:</i> As of 27 November 2001, the total number of infected premises (IPs) in Great Britain was 2,026. In 299 confirmed cases samples were not taken, for example where clear clinical signs of FMD were observed and where disease had already been confirmed in the locality. Of the 1,727 cases where samples were taken, 1,326 (74 per cent.) were recorded as having a positive laboratory result. However, a negative laboratory result does not necessarily mean the disease was not present and does not change the status of an IP confirmed on clinical grounds.

<P>
<a name="11205w28.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department has drawn on all of the available scientific research conducted worldwide, as well as relevant epidemiological findings from natural outbreaks of disease, on vaccination against foot and mouth disease in examining potential control policies involving vaccination. A comprehensive review of the use of emergency vaccines against foot and mouth disease will be published shortly in the scientific journal <i>Vaccine</i>.
<P>

<a name="11205w28.html_para7">The current scientific evidence is that ruminants can, but not invariably, become infected following vaccination and this depends on the strain of the virus and the length of time between vaccination and exposure to the virus. Such animals therefore present a potential risk and the international guidelines on the movement of vaccinated animals take this risk into account. More research of the long-term carrier state is needed in countries with the disease, and where vaccination has been used, as long-term studies of sufficient size are not possible in the laboratory.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w28.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2001]:</i> Livestock movement restrictions are imposed throughout Great Britain using powers contained in the Foot and Mouth Disease Order 1983 (as amended). A total ban on movements applied only for one week (23 February to 2 March). Since then, movements have been permitted under licence to abattoirs and from farm to farm subject to conditions. Movement restrictions reflect the disease status of the county, which is based on veterinary advice. FMD free status is awarded on the basis of extensive blood testing of sheep. Devon was classified as an FMD free county on 27 November.

 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2001]:</i> The decision to reopen livestock markets in England and Wales will depend on scientific and veterinary advice, taking account of the inherent risks of farmers and animals mixing and potentially spreading the disease mechanically or biologically. An initial veterinary risk assessment is currently being considered and will be published shortly. Depending on progress towards eradicating the foot and mouth disease, it is hoped that it may be possible to reopen cattle markets in the early part of next year.

<a name="11205w29.html_para0">I am aware that the site was affected by the serious flooding across the country that occurred on 7 November 2000. The Environment Agency is working with the licence holder to ensure that human health and the environment are protected. As a result of the odour problems, a notice was served on the site operator on 19 November 2001 under section 42(5) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 requiring the operator to provide the agency with a plan for controlling leachate from the site. The operator complied with notice by the deadline set by the agency, who are in the process of reviewing the proposed plan.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent assessment she has made of the need for <i>(a)</i> consolidation and <i>(b)</i> updating of the legislation and regulations under which Sea Fisheries Committees operate.  [19276]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w29.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The primary legislation was consolidated in the Sea Fisheries Regulation Act 1966. Subsequently, section 102 of the Environment Act 1995 has added to the 1966 Act provisions to allow each Committee to act for marine environmental purposes. In addition the Sea Fisheries (Wildlife Conservation) Act 1992 requires appropriate Ministers and relevant bodies (including the Sea Fisheries Committees) to have regard to the conservation of flora and fauna in the discharge of their functions under the sea fisheries Acts.
<P>

<a name="11205w29.html_para1">It would be sensible to wait for consolidation and/or updating of the legislation and regulations under which Sea Fisheries Committees operate until the EU review of the Common Fisheries Policy has been completed at the end of 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to ensure that all timber imports into the UK come from sustainable sources.  [19605]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w29.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government are working with the timber trade, environmental pressure groups and other stakeholders to encourage a greater demand for sustainable timber across all sectors of the economy. The Government are also working with many stakeholders in different producer countries to promote sustainable forest management as well as tackling illegal logging. The Forest Law Enforcement Conference held in Bali in September, which the Under-Secretary of State for International Development attended on behalf of the Government, has added a new dynamism to efforts to curb illegal logging through effective measures at a national, bilateral and international level.
<P>

<a name="11205w29.html_para2">For their own operational activities the Government are committed to actively seek to purchase the timber and timber products they need from legal and sustainable sources. To this end Government buyers have been instructed to implement this policy and to report annually on their purchases. An interdepartmental working group is monitoring progress and will provide further guidance and advice to buyers. The Government's approach should help to transform the market into supplying more timber and timber products from sustainably managed sources. More information is given in the Third Annual Report on Greening Government, published on 27 November 2001 and available on the internet (http://www.sustainable- development.gov.uk).
<P>

<a name="11205w29.html_para3">These steps are a tangible measure of the Government's commitment to implement the G8 Action on Forests agreed at its 1998 Birmingham summit.

 Waste disposal authorities have a statutory duty to provide reasonably accessible sites where householders can dispose of their waste free of charge but they may restrict the availability of particular sites to specified descriptions of waste. Waste collection authorities have a statutory duty to arrange for the collection of household waste.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what impact she anticipates <i>(a)</i> flood clean-up expenditure and <i>(b)</i> flood prevention expenditure will have on the level of council tax in English local authorities in the next financial year; and if she will make a statement.  [19750]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w29.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Through the Bellwin arrangements, Government expect to contribute some &#163;26 million to the costs incurred by local authorities affected by flooding in 2000. Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs) for flood defence for English local authorities were announced on 4 December. Government provide grant which covers some three quarters of SSA with the remainder assumed to be raised from the standard level of council tax.




<P>
<P><I>5 Dec 2001 : Column: 401W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11205w29.html_para4">The Government's expenditure under Bellwin, coupled with their meeting a major proportion of the SSA, will substantially mitigate the effect on council tax bills arising from flooding, though the actual effect will depend on each local authority's spending decisions across all its functions.

[19540]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w29.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 This Department provides grants for flood and coastal defence capital works, and associated studies, which meet essential technical, economic and environmental criteria and achieve an appropriate priority score. Further to increases in spending plans in the last two spending reviews, additional funding of &#163;51 million over the four years from 2000&#150;01 was announced in November 2000 following the severe flooding last year. An increased priority was given to urban flood defence and the grant rates for all river flood defences was increased by 20 per cent.
<P>

<a name="11205w29.html_para5">Operational responsibility for flood management measures rests with the local operating authorities, normally the Environment Agency, internal drainage boards and local councils, who decide which projects to promote and their timing. The operational authorities are invited to submit applications for DEFRA funding, and we do not differentiate between "old" and "new" money. The information given relates to flood defence improvement works to be undertaken by the Environment Agency (information on the same basis, from internal drainage boards and local councils, is not readily available).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what policies she has for maximising the use of inland waterways for <i>(a)</i> carriage of freight, <i>(b)</i> leisure and <i>(c)</i> tourism.  [19532]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w31.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government's policies for the inland waterways are set out in the publication "Waterways for Tomorrow", published in June 2000, copies of which are available in the Library. The Government want to promote a modern, integrated and sustainable approach to the use of inland waterways. This includes greater carriage of freight, when this is practical, economic and environmentally desirable, and to encourage people to make more use of the waterways for leisure and tourism.

<P>
<a name="11205w31.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The elimination of scrapie from the national flock is the objective of the national scrapie plan for Great Britain which I launched in July. Modelling work undertaken early last year suggested that it would be possible to have a significant increase in the resistance of the national flock within 10 years. We are currently updating the model to reflect current information, including the level of actual uptake under the plan. We will then be taking the views of stakeholders on what would be an appropriate target date, or dates, to work towards for the achievement of a scrapie-resistant sheep flock. The Animal Health Bill currently before Parliament would give the Government the ability to underpin a target date by using compulsory genotyping powers.

 <i>[holding answer 30 November 2001]:</i> The Department's maximum age of retirement for staff of all grades is 65. Exceptionally staff may be retained beyond that age, for a short period, where it is essential to meet business needs. Two such staff are currently employed.

 The figures for farm incomes presented in the answer of 21 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 319&#150;20W, included all the subsidies to farming. In addition to that answer, the figures show the total incomes from farming and the average off-farm income per farm in England, Scotland and Wales. These figures will be revised next year to be consistent with the latest UK figures. The total off-farm income is not available at country level.

All Departments reviewed their legislation and procedures in the light of the new provisions. In addition, measures were put in place for necessary co-ordination and monitoring across Whitehall. A &#163;1.2 million blitz advertising campaign was mounted last autumn with advertisements in the national, local and ethnic press. A competition for young people, centred on the Act, attracted over 280 entries involving over 1,000 young people. Research showed that awareness among the public of the Act and the fundamental rights it protects nearly doubled during the period of the campaign.
<P>

<a name="11205w31.html_para9">The Human Rights Unit has continued after commencement of the Act, and maintains a dedicated helpdesk and an extensive website. It remains a focal point of knowledge and good practice on human rights. Its activities include presentations at a range of seminars, conferences and training events, as well as providing 'roadshow' training events outside London. The Unit has contributed to the work of the Department for Education and Skills to introduce the subject of citizenship in schools, which will be a part of the national curriculum for secondary schools from September 2002, and is working with other organisations on an ambitious new youth awards scheme directed at all UK schools and youth organisations based on the values of the Human Rights Act. The Unit is currently revising guidance for Whitehall Departments about the Act and, with the Bar Council, the popular Study Guide to the Act. These will be re-issued early in the New Year.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (1) what means of communication there are between a <i>(a)</i> victim and <i>(b)</i> victim's family and the prosecuting counsel during court sittings; and if measures are under review;  [20327]

<P>
<a name="11205w32.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Communications between the prosecuting advocate and witnesses prior to a trial are governed by the Bar's Written Standards for the Conduct of Professional Work. The standards provide that a barrister may have contact with a witness with a view

<P><I>5 Dec 2001 : Column: 410W</I><P>
to introducing himself or herself, explaining the court's procedure and answering any questions about it which the witness may have. They also place upon the barrister a responsibility to ensure that witnesses are put as much at ease as possible. Victims, or the members of a victim's family, should be treated in the same way. Crown Prosecutors who are solicitors should also adhere to the same standards.
<P>

<a name="11205w32.html_para2">In the Crown court the prosecuting barrister will be supported by a CPS caseworker. If the victim or members of the victim's family wish to contact the prosecution barrister during the hearing itself, the first point of contact will be the caseworker. In many cases, the caseworker will be able to deal with the query without reference to the prosecuting barrister. In some cases the caseworker will need to refer the victim's comments to the prosecuting barrister. If the caseworker is engaged on another case in a different court, the usual means of communication between the victim or the victim's family and the prosecuting barrister will be via the usher or a police officer.
<P>

<a name="11205w32.html_para3">In the magistrates court the prosecutor will not have the support of a caseworker and is, as a result, reliant in practice on the usher or a police officer to communicate to him or her any comments that the victim or the victim's family may have during the hearing.

<a name="11205w32.html_para4">The Crown Prosecution Service believes that more could be done to encourage victims or the families of victims to make the prosecutor aware of things said in court that are material and are factually incorrect.

 The right hon. Lord Williams of Mostyn QC, published guidelines 12 months ago outlining the approach that should be adopted by a prosecution advocate when considering the acceptability of a defendant's plea.

 My Department's "Guidance Notes for Teacher Employment Businesses and Agencies" describes the requirements for checks which the Department considers must be made by agencies providing supply teachers to schools in order to comply with the law. These include checks to establish that supply teachers have the necessary qualifications and checks of identity, health and fitness to teach, as well as against criminal records and the register of barred teachers. Regulation of agencies and employment businesses is provided under the Employment Agency Act 1973 and Conduct Regulations, which are the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. The Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate enforces this legislation.
<P>

<a name="11205w33.html_para1">Circular 7/96, issued to schools in parallel with the "Guidance Notes for Agencies" mentioned, provides guidance to head teachers taking on temporary teachers. It emphasises that schools should be clear about the checks that have been carried out, even where by an agency; that it is a school's responsibility to ensure that all checks have been made; and that schools should ask for written assurance that any agency used has carried out these checks.
<P>

<a name="11205w33.html_para2">My Department also issued further guidance to local education authorities (LEAs), schools and agencies in 1998 reminding them about the checks that should be made on teachers, and others seeking to work with children.

 Information on the average cost of full-time nursery education places is not collected by my Department.
<P>

<a name="11205w33.html_para7">All funding for full and part-time nursery education places for 4-year-olds, along with the majority of funding for 3-year-olds, in the local authority maintained sector, is determined locally.
<P>

<a name="11205w33.html_para8">In 2001&#150;02, the Government are funding new, free, part-time early education places for 3-year-olds at the rate of &#163;1,188 per child. This funding can purchase five two and a half hour sessions per week, for 11 weeks per term, for 33 weeks per year. Government funding of nursery education for 4-year-olds is channelled through the standard spending assessment. This Government have increased spending on nursery education from &#163;1 billion in 1996&#150;97 to &#163;1.8 billion in 2001&#150;02. Expenditure is planned to rise to &#163;2 billion by 2002&#150;03.

 Information about class sizes has been collected from maintained primary and secondary schools as part of the Annual Schools Census in January for over 20 years. In order to provide a true representation of the sizes of classes experienced by children, each school is randomly allocated a specific time on the census day at which class sizes should be reported. The current collection asks for the number of pupils, teachers and teaching assistants in the class at the appropriate time and also for its Key Stage and National Curriculum Year Group. The activity in which the class is engaged is also requested.
<P>

<a name="11205w34.html_para0">The September Class Size Count is a separate collection started in 1998, introduced to monitor class sizes at Key Stage one. The statistical method used is the same as in the January Census, but, in order to lessen the burden on schools, information is collected only from primary schools and about classes where the majority of children will reach the appropriate age during the school

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans she has to assess the parameters of the Research Assessment Exercise.  [19460]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w34.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The operation of the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise will be reviewed by the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the other UK funding bodies after the exercise has been completed. The current review of higher education announced by the Secretary of State on 22 October is considering research more generally.

<P>
<a name="11205w34.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Rosindell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many UK students are studying at <i>(a)</i> the European Union Institute, Florence and <i>(b)</i> at Community colleges of a similar nature; what subjects they are studying; and if she will make a statement.  [19599]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w34.html_spnew6"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 In the 2001&#150;02 academic year, my Department is supporting 16 English and Welsh students (six of whom are in their second year of study) at the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence. In addition the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly support two students. EUI students undertake study and research in one of four departments; Economics, Law, History and Civilisation or Political and Social Sciences. Most of these students are undertaking a three year doctorate, but there are some students who undertake a one year Masters in Law.
<P>

<a name="11205w34.html_para4">There are two other European institutions where students are supported by my Department. Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate arrangements. Fifteen students are supported at the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium and Natolin, Poland. Students follow a one year course and enrol in one of four departments; Economics, Human Resource Development, Political Sciences or Administrative Sciences. All follow a compulsory programme of European General and Interdisciplinary Studies.
<P>

<a name="11205w34.html_para5">In addition two students are supported at the Bologna Center, part of John Hopkins University, in Bologna, Italy. Students study an interdisciplinary course, including a modern language, International Economics, International Relations and European Studies.
<P>

<a name="11205w34.html_para6">The Government are keen to see greater collaborative links between Higher Education Institutions across Europe, both by encouraging EU students to study in the UK and by funding students at the three institutions to which this question refers.

<P>
<a name="11205w35.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Edwards: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many individuals are repaying student loans through the Student Loans Company.  [19812]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w35.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 At the end of the 2000&#150;01 financial year, there were 1,170,000 borrowers repaying loans of which 652,000 had accounts retained in the ownership of the Government and repayable to the Student Loans Company (SLC). The remaining borrowers had accounts which were sold to the two private sector owners, but where the administration remains with the SLC. The number of borrowers with accounts classified as being in repayment status includes some 543,000 borrowers whose repayments were deferred because their income level was below the repayment threshold.
<P>

<a name="11205w35.html_para0">The accounts in the retained portfolio include mortgage style loans where repayments are made directly to the SLC, and income contingent loans where accounts are administered by the SLC but repayments, for those within the UK taxation system, are collected by Inland Revenue and refunded to the Department. Repayments from borrowers outside the taxation system, and from those with small loans, are made to the Company.

 <i>[holding answer 30 November 2001]:</i> The following table shows the funding allocation for Sure Start programmes in 2000&#150;01 and the amount claimed by each programme. The allocated revenue and capital columns show the funding agreed at the start of the year, it does not include any changes to allocation made during the year.

 In the 2000&#150;01 financial year, there were 1,600 borrowers with accounts paid off in full before liability for repayment had arisen. This figure does not include borrowers who have made accelerated repayments nor borrowers who have made repayments even though their obligation to repay has been deferred because their income has fallen below the repayment threshold.

 The Student Loans Company Ltd. (SLC) operates under the terms of a remit letter, which I send to it annually. This requires the company to administer the student loans schemes in line with the legislative framework.
<P>

<a name="11205w36.html_para0">Provisions for the early repayment of mortgage style loans are covered under schedule 2 of the Education (Student Loans) Regulations 1998, which state that the borrower can make early repayments at any time, and that he should ask the SLC for a written statement giving the exact amount owed. A borrower can repay all or any part of their income contingent student loans at any time under Education (Student Loans) Regulations 2000, regulation 11 (1). The Student Loans Company Ltd. makes arrangements directly with the borrower for the method of repayment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if an appeal panel hearing an appeal against a primary school's decision not to admit a child to their school is entitled to alter that school's approved admissions criteria; and if she will make a statement.  [20502]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w36.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 No&#151;an appeal panel cannot alter a school's general admission arrangements, including admissions criteria. Their role is to decide in individual cases whether the school should admit a child, having regard to the case presented by both the admission authority and the parents. The panel decides first whether one of the statutory grounds for refusing admission applies. But even if the panel decides that it was proper to refuse to admit the child, they proceed (except in the case of infant classes, to which special rules apply) to a second, discretionary stage of consideration. At this stage, they balance the effect on the school of admitting another child against the parents' reasons for wanting the child to be admitted.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will list the grounds on which an appeal panel hearing an appeal against a primary school's decision not to admit a child to their school can overrule the school's decision, if the school has followed its approved admissions criteria; and if she will make a statement.  [20503]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w36.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 There are no grounds on which an appeal panel can overrule a primary school's decision not to admit a child to an infant class size because that would take the class size above 30, if the school has followed its published admission arrangements. The panel can uphold that infant class appeal only if the decision was not one which a reasonable admission authority would make in the circumstances of the case or the child would have been offered a place if the admission arrangements had been properly implemented.
<P>

<a name="11205w36.html_para3">For appeals other than for infant class size, the panel must weigh up the cases of the school and the parents. The effect on the school of admitting another child is balanced against the parents' reasons for wanting the child to be admitted. If the panel decides that the parents' case is the stronger, the school must admit the child.

 We have put in place a range of measures to boost the recruitment and retention of teachers including: &#163;6,000 training bursaries for graduates starting postgraduate teacher training and &#163;4,000 "Golden Hellos" for those who train in and go on to teach shortage subjects; above-inflation pay increases for the third year running; measures to encourage returners back into teaching such as "refresher" courses with training grants of up to &#163;150 a week and child care for those taking part; and &#163;33 million extra funding distributed direct to those schools in the areas with the highest vacancies to put in place local initiatives. These are starting to pay off with 12,500 more teachers than in 1998 and an increase in the number entering teachers training for the second year running. We are also working on a scheme that will pay off, over a set period of time, the student loans of new teachers who enter and remain in state education and we are determined to tackle issues about teacher workload. It is all part of our strategy of recruitment, retention and reward that will deliver 10,000 extra teachers and 20,000 more support staff over the Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w37.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 In the White Paper "Schools Achieving Success", we have stated our commitment to actively promote modern language teaching in primary schools so that more older primary children learn a second language. We are already doing a great deal to support language teaching in primary schools, although we do not have a statutory curriculum for languages at primary age. The National Curriculum contains guidance for teaching 7 to 11-year-olds, and we have published a scheme of work for primary French, and further materials for primary German and Spanish. We are supporting the Early Language Learning initiative, through which we are piloting approaches to extend language teaching in primary schools, and developing a curriculum guide to good practice and classroom materials. A national advisory centre on early language learning has been set up with an accompanying website.
<P>

<a name="11205w37.html_para2">We will be building on existing links between primary schools and specialist language colleges.

 Despite the importance of English as a world language, we recognise the valuable contribution that foreign language learning makes to our social and economic success. The Department has not studied the impact on language learning in the UK of the emergence of English as a world language, but we are doing a great deal to support and enhance foreign language teaching and learning. All pupils in England have a statutory entitlement to learn at least one foreign language from the age of 11. The growing number of specialist language colleges, with their role as "hubs" of excellence, means that more schools are able to benefit from access to languages expertise.
<P>

<a name="11205w37.html_para3">Commercially and vocationally, languages have a great deal to offer. We have committed over &#163;900,000 over three years to support regional language networks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will estimate the changes to cost and coverage of the proposed pension credit if the maximum savings credit were revised to <i>(a)</i> &#163;14.80 single/ &#163;18.60 couple, <i>(b)</i> &#163;15.80 single/&#163;19.60 couple and <i>(c)</i> continuing for each &#163;1 up to a maximum of &#163;18.80 for single people and &#163;23.60 for couples.  [20297]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w37.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Pension credit will ensure that no pensioner need live on an income below a guaranteed minimum level and will provide a reward through the savings credit for those who have made their own provision for their retirement. The formula for the savings credit is set out in "The Pension Credit: the Government's proposals" published on 28 November, copies of which are in the Library. The cost and coverage of the savings credit depends on a number of factors including the range of income rewarded and the percentage of this specified as the savings credit.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w37.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will estimate the size of a pension fund which would generate an annuity capable of establishing eligibility to an element of pension credit on its introduction in 2003 on a <i>(a)</i> single life flat and <i>(b)</i> single life indexed basis for (i) men and (ii) women, assuming no change in current rates.  [20298]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w37.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The introduction of pension credit will mean that no pensioner need live on less than &#163;100 a week, or &#163;154 for couples. For the first time we will reward, not penalise, savings to ensure those who have worked hard to save modest amounts will gain from having done so. Even small private pension funds will attract the savings credit.
<P>

<a name="11205w37.html_para10">The information in the table shows the estimated funds required to generate an annuity sufficient to raise people above the point they are eligible for the savings reward element of pension credit.

 Bereavement benefits were introduced on 9 April 2001 and are available to both men and women for the first time. They concentrate the help available where and when it is needed most, on immediate needs and on families with children.
<P>

<a name="11205w38.html_para0">We recognise that people need breathing space to come to terms with the emotional and practical upheaval caused by the loss of their spouse. Bereavement allowance is therefore payable for 12 months. As with all benefits this will be kept under review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what action his Department has taken to tackle discrimination against older people.  [14956]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11205w38.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Since 1997, this Government have consistently shown their commitment to tackling age discrimination against older people through a wide- ranging programme of research, consultation and development initiatives.
<P>

<a name="11205w38.html_para3">We have overseen a range of co-ordinated strategies through consultation with older people and representative groups, that identify and address their needs including overcoming age discrimination. These include the Better Government for Older People Programme, the 10-year Transport Plan, Quality and Choice for Older People's Housing: A Strategic Framework, the National Service Framework for Older People and the Performance and Innovation Unit report "Winning the Generation Game".
<P>

<a name="11205w38.html_para4">Our jobcentre network, including the new employer direct call centres, are working to eliminate age discrimination through a range of options. They have a policy of not accepting job vacancies with an upper age limit unless the employer can show genuine reason for the restriction. They deliver a wide range of programmes which are available to older people including new deal 25+, new deal for disabled people, work based learning for adults, work trials and programme centres.
<P>

<a name="11205w38.html_para5">In April 2000, the new deal 50 plus was launched and up to September this year had helped over 51,000 over 50s back to work. The programme is currently developing third age apprenticeships, which are new work based training opportunities designed to help older people retrain, particularly in sectors which have been reluctant to recruit older people.
<P>

<a name="11205w38.html_para6">The Government are committed to implementing age legislation in employment by 2006 and in the lead up to legislation, our AgePositive campaign will be intensified; vigorously promoting the business benefits of employing young and older people in the workplace.
<P>

<a name="11205w38.html_para7">The campaign includes three national and regional annual awards for employers who demonstrate their commitment to employing an age diverse work force, promotion of the Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment, a wide ranging research programme and a range of media advertising.
<P>

<a name="11205w38.html_para8">On 3 December the campaign launched a new AgePositive website www.agepositive.gov.uk and new research studies including the Evaluation of the Impact of the Code of Practice and Good Practice in the Recruitment and Retention of Older Workers.

 <i>[holding answer 27 November 2001]:</i> Winter fuel payments are not made to people who are permanently resident in a residential care or nursing home, and receiving higher rates of income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance. This is because they already receive public assistance with their living costs. Details of how many of these people receive full funding is not available.

 The Department secured &#163;1.9 million from the Treasury Invest to Save fund to run a two year iDTV for the pensions project starting in April 2001. The original intention was to deliver a local pilot, partnering Knowsley local authority. However, we decided on a national pilot and have partnered with Inland Revenue to deliver information and services through satellite and cable iDTV providers to approximately 7 million users across Great Britain. The pilot service, which will be evaluated, is due to be launched in the spring of 2002 and will run for an initial one year period. Further developments beyond the pilot period will be dependent on the pilot evaluation findings.

<P>
<a name="11205w39.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The staffing and workload levels of the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman have remained constant throughout this period. The increase in administrative costs largely reflects the year on year increases for pay and prices. The administrative costs for 1998&#150;99 and 2000&#150;01 reflect a reduction in the level of expenditure on non staff costs in those years.
