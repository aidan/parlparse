 The summer Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign ran over eight weekends in July and August 2004. The campaign saw concerted activity by police and partners to tackle alcohol-related violence and disorder and target those who encourage underage and binge drinking. It formed part of the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy, which was published on 15 July 2004.

<p>
<a name="41221w05.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_22">In the 92 Basic Command Units that took part in the summer campaign, there was a slight increase in the number of lower level harassment and violent incidents recorded due to more proactive policing through enhanced enforcement activities. However, there was a 9 per cent. fall in more serious violent crime in the participating areas when compared with a one per cent. increase in the areas that did not take part. Data to demonstrate the impact on Ambulance Trusts was not captured centrally.

<p>
<a name="41221w05.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_23">The effectiveness of the campaign was also measured by feedback from participating Basic Command Units and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partners. This has been captured in a &quot;Lessons Learned&quot; document that has been circulated to all BCUs and CDRPs. These lessons will be employed as part of the forthcoming Christmas campaign that will run from 17 December 2004 to 3 January 2005.

<p><a name="st_45"><a name="41221w05.html_spnew7"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 There are a number of intervention and enforcement tools available for tackling antisocial behaviour. The action taken should reflect the nature of the antisocial behaviour and the impact it has had on the community. The use of Acceptable Behaviour Contracts and other early interventions are crucial as they show communities, and potential perpetrators of antisocial behaviour, that action will be taken against those who behave in an antisocial manner.

<a name="stpa_26">ABCs were first pioneered by the London borough of Islington with the Metropolitan police. Their successful model was then promoted by the Home Office and adopted across the rest of the country. They are voluntary agreements between a person who has been involved in antisocial behaviour and one or more local agencies. They are not statutory orders and we currently have no plans to place ABCs on a statutory basis.

 The Government takes business crime very seriously and recognises the costs and disruption that crime causes&#151;as well as the knock on effects for communities and consumers. According to the 2002 Commercial Victimisation Survey (CVS), published on 26 November, crimes against retail premises is seven percentage points lower than almost ten years ago and crime against manufacturers 12 per cent. lower. This demonstrates the success of the action we have taken in a number of areas to combat crimes against businesses.

<a name="41221w06.html_para1">
For example, over the last three years we have invested &#163;15 million to help small retailers in the most deprived areas and over 12,500 shops have benefited from this scheme, which has had a positive impact in reducing crime. We are providing almost &#163;1 million to the Action Against Business Crime Group to create a national network of crime reduction partnerships. We launched a new &quot;top tips&quot; postcards containing step by step advice on protecting businesses on 23 September this year and will be publishing a more detailed booklet on surveying business premises early next year. We have also appointed a Business Crime Reduction Adviser in each of the Government Offices in the regions to help a wide range of businesses, as well as established a dedicated business crime team in the Home Office.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will include crime against property on business premises as a police key performance indicator; and if he will make a statement.  [205416]</p>









<p><a name="st_60"><a name="41221w06.html_spnew6"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 As part of the drive to reduce bureaucracy, the Home Office is reducing the number of Statutory Performance Indicators (SPIs) for the police and we have no plans to introduce an additional national performance indicator on business crime. However, Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships are currently undertaking an audit of the crime and disorder and misuse of drugs problems in their area and are required to put in place effective strategies to tackle these. Where business crime has been identified as a specific problem locally, these should appear as a local priority within the strategy for that area. The 10 regional Business Crime Reduction Advisers, appointed by the Home Office, are working locally to help ensure that businesses are consulted as part of this process and that their concerns are reflected in strategies.

<a name="41221w06.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_61">In addition, local priorities identified in crime, disorder and misuse of drugs strategies in the areas of burglary, vehicle crime, street crime and antisocial behaviour will also benefit businesses, as they are often the victim of these types of crime in and around town centres.

 The Home Office currently publishes annual total crime statistics recorded by the police in England and Wales for the following offences specifically relating to business crime; robbery of business property, theft by an employee, theft from shops and theft of an automatic machine or meter. The most recent figures are available in Statistical Bulletin 10/04 &quot;Crime in England and Wales 2003&#150;04&quot; at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/crimeew0304.html. However, we recognise that these figures provide a limited picture of the true nature of crimes experienced by the business sector. We are also aware that businesses do not report every incidence of crime for a variety of reasons.

 The Home Office has not agreed specific targets for detecting crime with individual police forces, however police forces will have locally agreed targets which are published in local policing plans. The National Policing Plan for 2005&#150;08, published in November 2004, acknowledges however that there is a strong link between the Public Service Agreement to bring 1.25 million offences to justice by 2007&#150;08 and the necessity to improve sanction detection performance. In order to achieve the PSA target it is estimated that it will be necessary to achieve a sanction detection rate of at least 25 per cent.

 The applied safety lever on the chain gun, which is mounted in the turret of the Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank, is redundant by design and incapable of operation by the crew. It has never formed part of the crew safety drills, which are designed to compensate for this. Following an undemanded firing incident in Iraq in April 2003, a review of the chain gun firing drills on Challenger 2 was carried out and a change made to further reduce the possibility of the vehicle commander inadvertently firing the gun.

<p><a name="st_125"><a name="41221w13.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 A single case of undemanded firing of the chain gun on Challenger 2 occurred in Iraq in April 2003. There were no injuries as a result of the incident and investigations revealed that it resulted from a short circuit in the firing system. A modification has subsequently been designed and manufactured, which has now completed trials by the Design Authority, BAE Land Systems (formerly Alvis Vickers Ltd.). The modification is due to be considered for acceptance before Christmas and, subject to acceptance, will proceed to implementation.

 There is no standing European Rapid Reaction Force. What has sometimes been referred to as a &quot;European Rapid Reaction Force&quot; is in fact a catalogue of forces which member states could make available to the EU should they choose to participate in any particular EU-led operation. The United Kingdom currently declares to this catalogue up to 12,500 troops, 18 warships and 72 combat aircraft.

</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_136">The UK has committed one national Battlegroup and one multinational (with the Netherlands based on long-standing cooperation in the UK/Dutch Amphibious Force). We expect to hold one of these Battlegroups on standby for six months in any two-year period. The national Battlegroup will be on standby during the first six-month rotation (Jan-Jun 2005). The multinational Battlegroup will be available after 2007. To meet these commitments, UK troops will be drawn from the Joint Rapid Reaction Force as appropriate at the time.

<a name="stpa_137">Any decision to commit UK troops and assets to any EU-led operation (including any EU Battlegroup operation) rests entirely with the Government and is made on a voluntary, case-by-case basis, as for NATO and UN operations.

 During the competitive stages of the Assessment Phase (November 1999 to December 2002) separately both BAE Systems and Thales UK produced shipbuild strategies in consultation with United Kingdom shipyards as part of their proposals. Since January 2003, and the announcement of the Alliance approach to delivering the Future Aircraft Carriers (CVF), the companies have issued formal requests for information to UK shipyards in mid-2003 and early-2004. These have been supported by regular interactions between the companies and the shipyards. No restrictions have been placed on the commercial partners in these discussions provided the carriers are acquired in accordance with the defence industrial policy for Royal Navy warships to be built in UK shipyards.

The gifting of this equipment is a key element in achieving this, which in turn will reduce the burden on our own troops and eventually facilitate our withdrawal from Iraq.

 The Inland Revenue has a contract with the carrier, Lynx, who subcontract to Royal Mail, to carry international mail overseas. The value of this contract is approximately &#163;900,000 per annum. It is currently being re-tendered and a new contract is due to be awarded in February 2005.

It is then despatched by Royal Mail from its Heathrow sorting centre. When the mail arrives in the country of destination it is handled by the relevant national postal authority. From 1 October 2004, under the terms of the current contract, the Revenue has allowed Lynx to monitor the postal market and select the mail issuing authority offering the most economically advantageous delivery route and competitive pricing. This means that during October, for example, 104,217 items of IR international mail were despatched directly by Sweden Post, bearing their indicia, but were still delivered by the relevant national postal authority. Similarly, 24,117 items were sent by Royal Mail. The savings secured by use of Sweden Post are around &#163;5,700. During the same period, 8,731,425 items of IR post (both domestic and international) were sent by Royal Mail. The percentage despatched by Sweden Post is therefore 1.2 per cent.

 Since the end of conflict in 2001, the Government of Afghanistan has achieved important progress on economic and structural reforms. It has made a concerted effort in strengthening strategic planning and policy implementation around the national budget process, which is currently on its third cycle. It has embarked on a programme to rebuild fiscal functions of the state, including strengthening of domestic revenue policy and administration. A new currency (the Afghani) was introduced soon after the end of conflict, which the Government have managed well both in terms of the logistical challenges of replacing banknotes and economic challenges of. maintaining financial stability.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41221w20.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_173">The Government have also taken steps to promote private sector development. A draft private investment law is expected to be promulgated shortly, a legal framework for extractive industries is being established and state owned enterprises are being restructured and/or privatised. In addition commercial banking legislation has been adopted and the regulatory framework for the financial sector strengthened.

<a name="41221w20.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_174">These are all important achievements in establishing an enabling environment and strengthening economic management for growth and poverty reduction, but there are important challenges ahead, not least the maintenance of security and political stability across the country to enable a strengthened relationship between central and provincial government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41221w20.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_175">In addition there are challenges in terms of strengthening human and institutional capacity to implement economic and structural reforms. The UK Government are playing a significant role in this area through provision of technical assistance with three year-projects to rehabilitate the Customs, Revenue and Budget departments within the Ministry of Finance. These include support for departmental restructuring and transfer of skills and capacity building in human resources, training, ethics and policymaking. DFID complements this with financial support to the Afghanistan Budget managed by the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund in order to encourage a gradual move away from dependence on external aid as the economy picks up and capacity increases for raising domestic revenue.

 DFID seeks to understand and address issues of institutional and individual discrimination against Dalits that result in processes of social exclusion and disadvantage.

In particular, DFID seeks to disaggregate data by the government&#039;s definition of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, to highlight the differences in health, education and other indicators between these Scheduled categories and others. For example, DFID support for the nationwide Sarva Shikshya Abhyan (Education-for-AII) and the Reproductive and Child Health programmes utilises such disaggregated data to identify those with the poorest outcomes and ensure that State and District Plans in education and health address the disparities.

 We are in regular touch with the Governments of both Nepal and India about the Maoist insurgency, both at ministerial and senior official levels. I visited Nepal in November and held discussions with both the King and Prime Minister about the current situation. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has also raised the issue with his Indian counterpart, most recently on 4 December, and the UK Special representative to Nepal, Sir Jeffrey James, has been visiting Nepal and India regularly for talks with ministers and officials.

<a name="41221w28.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_226">We have considered the actual and potential impact of the insurgency on stability in the wider region with the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development (DFID). Large numbers of refugees from the conflict have already moved to India. We remain concerned about possible links between Nepalese Maoists and far-left groups in north eastern India, which threaten stability there.

<p>
<a name="41221w28.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_227">To help to minimise the risks these threats pose, the UK has been working closely with international partners. Our efforts are intended to help Nepal to move on from the current conflict as a democratic, stable country, with multi-party democracy, a constitutional monarchy, sustainable economic and social reform, good governance and a high level of respect for human rights.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41221w28.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_228">For several years we have been giving considerable assistance to Nepal through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) to help the state counter the insurgency in a manner in accordance with internationally accepted norms and also to assist Nepal to tackle the root causes of the conflict. DFID has committed &#163;35 million this year to an extensive programme aimed at reducing poverty and social inequality, and accelerating economic growth and improving quality of life and good governance. In all of our efforts we work closely with our international partners to ensure a unified approach. We welcome the close cooperation we enjoy with India in our efforts to help Nepal resolve the problems it faces.

Central Department<br>

<sup>(33)</sup> In both 2003 and 2004 the DfT Board decided against having an official departmental card for the central Department. The information given is for procurement of the ministerial Christmas card and the number of cards that is given reflects the number that were ordered. It is not possible to separate out postage costs from regular mail, although the policy is to mainly use second class. The number of staff hours is based on drafting a submission to the Secretary of State, consulting the Board, procuring the card and clearing the proofs with private office.<br>

Agencies<br>

<sup>(34)</sup> The Highways Agency and the Vehicle Certification Agency did not have a card in 2004.<br>

<sup>(35)</sup> The information for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency for 2004 includes a Christmas card sent out as part of a fishing safety campaign.<br>

<sup>(36)</sup> The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency does not have information for 2003. <br>

Notes:<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

Time waited<br>

Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

Finished in year admissions<br>

A finished in year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

This will enable NHS bodies to capture the express consent or dissent of patients where this is required, and will provide patients with a great deal of control over who can see what clinical information. The confidentiality code of practice, published in November 2003, was endorsed by the Information Commissioner and the General Medical Council. It sets out the interpretation of the requirement for consent to the use and disclosure of confidential health data that has been agreed with these bodies and with the Department&#039;s legal advisors. Where health data is used or disclosed solely for care or care related purposes, provided that patients have been informed of these purposes and of their right to object, it is reasonable to imply consent where there is no express dissent. The NPfIT in the NHS is developing a sophisticated anonymisation service, the secondary uses service, to ensure that other, for example, public health, research and managerial, requirements for data can be satisfied without breaching patient confidentiality.

 In common with other public service bodies, national health service organisations are not currently required to formally register under BS7799&#150;2:2002 but are required to undertake local assessments of their BS7799 compliance. No estimates are therefore available. Contractors to the national programme for information technology in the NHS are required to maintain a BS7799&#150;2:2002 compliant Information Security Management System for all services provided to the NHS. A review of contractor BS7799 compliance is currently under way.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

2. Time waited statistics from Hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and 



how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

 Data on bullying is not collected centrally and there is no reliable basis for an estimate on the scale of the problem. However any level of bullying is too high and we are determined to help schools tackle the problem. Our guidance &quot;Bullying: Don&#039;t Suffer in Silence&quot;, the anti-bullying Charter and the anti-bullying website www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying. In November 2003 the Department launched the anti-bullying Charter for schools, which almost 4,000 schools have already signed. It is accompanied by a summary of effective practice to help schools review and enhance their anti-bullying policies.

 It is the view of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the body overseeing the running of PISA, that the data for the United Kingdom from the 2003 study cannot be reliably compared with other countries&#039; scores or with UK PISA results from 2000. It would therefore not be appropriate to try to construct rankings for the UK against the advice of the OECD, still less to draw conclusions from doing so.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what research he has carried out, and what conclusions he has reached, on the effect of in-year pupil mobility on educational achievement; and what rates of pupil mobility were experienced in 2003&#150;04 in each local education authority-supported school in Newcastle upon Tyne.

<p>
<a name="41221w50.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_415">However, some general research has been conducted into the nature and causes of pupil mobility in schools. A report published by the Department in 1999 concludes that high pupil mobility in schools is strongly associated with factors of social deprivation, family break-up, temporary accommodation and other rented housing occupied by poorer families moving around.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41221w50.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_416">In terms of the link between pupil mobility and achievement, analysis of provisional 2004 GCSE data shows that pupils who joined their current secondary school at any time other than the start of a school year (in-year mobility), on average, achieved 27 GCSE points fewer at age 15 than other pupils with similar characteristics, including similar attainment at age 11. This approximately equates to achieving one grade lower in 4 or 5 subjects at GCSE.

<a name="stpa_417">With regard to the pupil mobility rates, the Department collects mobility indicators for primary schools.

<sup>(48)</sup> 10&#150;20 per cent. of part-time teachers may not be included in the data.<br>

<sup>(49)</sup> Full-time turnover is defined as all teachers in full-time service in the English maintained schools sector on 31 March 2001 who were not in full-time service in the same establishment on 31 March 2002.

2. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

3. &#151; zero or less than 5.<br>

4. 10&#150;20 per cent. of teachers may not be included in the data.<br>

5. Teachers are counted for each subject of teacher training and therefore may appear more than once where they have more than one subject of qualification. Teachers appear only once in the overall totals however and therefore these figures are lower than the sum of the individual subjects.<br>

6. There was a change in the categorisation of Art and Technology between the two years and the figures for these subjects are therefore not comparable.<br>

7. Teachers who have left service may be out of service temporarily or in service outside of the English maintained secondary sector.<br>

The physical surroundings of several of the businesses within DWP are being changed, including Jobcentre Plus, The Pensions Service and Debt Management Services.

Additionally, our private sector partners Land Securities Trillium are responsible for providing an ongoing maintenance programme for all buildings on the estate.

 In June 2001 the Department for Work and Pensions was formed from the Department of Social Security (DSS) and parts of the former Department for Education and Employment (DfEE). The department inherited seven different legacy appraisal systems. This was unsustainable given our desire for consistency and fairness throughout DWP. Staff continued to use their legacy appraisal system while a new DWP Performance and Development System (PDS) was developed. The new system was developed taking into account best practise within government and the private sector and the central rules regarding appraisals as set out in Chapter 6 of the Civil Service Management Code.

<p><a name="st_532"><a name="41221w55.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 It is the Department for Work and Pension&#039;s policy to implement the proposals of the Cross Cutting Review on the role of the Voluntary and Community Sector in Service Delivery that relate to departmental contracting with the voluntary sector. Action to implement the wider recommendations of the Review is lead by the Active Communities Unit in the Home Office.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41221w55.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_458">The department follows the cross-Government Compact framework for guiding relationships with the Voluntary and Community Sector set up in 1998. The Cross Cutting Review identified a widespread failure to implement the Compact and its Codes, and recommended that all departments take action to ensure that it is mainstreamed into normal business. The department has appointed a senior Compact Champion and established a Compact Working Group that is actively developing a Compact Implementation Strategy, working closely with the Active Communities Unit.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41221w55.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_459">The department will continue to respond constructively to all the proposals in the Cross Cutting Review, taking account of the department&#039;s wider obligations under the Chancellor&#039;s Efficiency Review.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41221w55.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_460">As an example of its constructive response, the department volunteered to take forward recommendation 18 of the Cross Cutting Review, on behalf of other Government Departments. The aim is to reduce the level of bureaucracy involved in contracting between the Voluntary and Community Sector and Government Departments. A Lead Funder project has worked with three voluntary organisations&#151;The Prince&#039;s Trust, NACRO and Project Full Employ&#151;and sought to reduce bureaucracy through a method of &quot;passporting&quot; pre-contractual information and streamlining the monitoring of contracts post contract award. The pilots have had some success and identified opportunities for departments to become more aligned and consistent in the way they contract with this sector. The project will report back to the Home Office with a range of recommendations in March 2005. The project has established a dedicated website www.dwp.gov.uk/leadfunder where common information for each of the voluntary sector organisations is accessible to public sector funding bodies.

Notes:<br>

1 The figures are taken from the annual analysis of sick absence undertaken by AON Limited on behalf of the Cabinet Office.<br>

2. The information in table 1 covers the calendar years 1999 to 2003 relating to the former employment service and jobcentre plus, (created in 2002).<br>





3. The AON reports do not distinguish between sick absence levels within employment service and jobcentre plus frontline offices and support functions including head office, and therefore represent figures for the Business as a whole.<br>

4. The calculation used to derive these figures uses a staff-year adjustment, which provides a more reliable basis for average sick absence figures than a count of staff employed.<br>
