To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what the criteria are for paying fuel duty rebate to bus operators providing scheduled services; and in what circumstances it can be withheld.  [20021]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11206w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 To be eligible for the receipt of this rebate a bus service must be registered with the Traffic Commissioner as a local service. It must also meet a number of other strict criteria to ensure that it is a service available to the general public and that it stops at registered stopping places.
<P>

<a name="11206w01.html_para2">The payment of rebate can be withheld if there is doubt that these conditions have been met or about the amount of entitlement. Examples of the latter are where an operator's estimates of FDR eligible mileage or fuel consumption appear unreasonably high in view of the operator's performance in recent years, where an operator consistently over estimates, where an operator fails to submit a certified claim form within the time allowed and if an operator fails to maintain adequate daily records of mileage run and fuel consumption.

[20510]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11206w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The assessment of the need for local facilities is a matter for the local planning authority and the service providers. The Government's policies in Planning Policy Guidance note 3: Housing seek to create a more sustainable pattern of housing development and deliver accessibility to transport, health, education and other facilities. It is for the county and district councils to consider these issues and work with service providers when drawing up the development plan. The availability of services should also be taken into account when considering individual proposals for housing schemes.

<P>
<a name="11206w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The management of litter and graffiti and the conduct of the mystery shopper survey are operational matters for London Underground (LU). I understand from LU, that they have contracted NOP, an independent market research agency to conduct the mystery shopper survey on their behalf for the next couple of years. The results of the survey are collected and reported every three months. Under LU's tube modernisation plans, one of the factors which will determine the level of payments to the infrastructure companies will be their performance in keeping stations and trains clean.

<a name="11206w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 This is a matter for London Underground. I understand that QATAS j and QATAS k represent scores for different aspects of the passenger environment on the underground. The attributes included in QATAS j are measured by Mystery Shopper Surveys. The attributes included in QATAS k include public address audibility, ride quality, in-car noise, train lighting and in-car heating and ventilation. London Underground intends that these should be measured by physical tests, using the appropriate equipment for measuring these attributes. Initially, however, they too will be tested using mystery shopping techniques.

measured by physical tests, the attributes are given a score between 0 and 100. The weights applied to these attributes are calculated by London Underground according to the importance given by passengers to the attribute and the station or train on which the attribute is being measured. A higher weight is given to busier stations and trains on more heavily used lines.

 The Department does not maintain a central record of those local authorities that have sold assets at less than the best consideration reasonably obtainable. Local authorities do, however, have discretionary powers under Part VII of the Local Government Act 1972 to dispose of land at an undervalue with the Secretary of State's consent. The Secretary of State has issued general consents for particular classes of disposals of land, for less than the best consideration that can reasonably be obtained, without needing specific ministerial consent.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport announced on 30 November 2001 <i>Official Report</i>, column 1150W, that Community Amateur Sports Clubs may now apply for charitable status. The Charity Commission has said that they will now recognise the following activities as charitable purposes: the promotion of community participation in healthy recreation by the provision of facilities for the playing of a particular sport; and the advancement of the physical education of young people not undergoing formal education. Those community sports clubs which meet the criteria for charitable status can benefit from mandatory rate relief of 80 per cent., which is already available for all premises used wholly or mainly for charitable purposes and is fully funded by central Government. Local authorities have discretion to increase the amount of rate relief to 100 per cent. in these cases, with central Government meeting 25 per cent. of the cost of this element of rate relief.

<a name="11206w03.html_para7">Local authorities also have discretion to give rate relief of up to 100 per cent. to other non-profit making bodies, including community amateur sports clubs whose activities are not regarded as charitable. Central Government contribute 75 per cent. of the cost of rate relief in these cases. To qualify, the organisation must be philanthropic, religious, or concerned with education, social welfare, science, literature or the fine arts, or the property must be occupied by a non-profit making body and wholly or mainly used for the purpose of recreation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (1) how many available fire appliances are <i>(a)</i> less than one, <i>(b)</i> between one and three, <i>(c)</i> between three and five and <i>(d)</i> over five years old; and if he will make a statement;  [20615]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many fire appliances have been in road accidents while on operational duty in <i>(a)</i> 1994, <i>(b)</i> 1995, <i>(c)</i> 1996, <i>(d)</i> 1997, <i>(e)</i> 1998, <i>(f)</i> 1999 and <i>(g)</i> 2000; and if he will make a statement;  [20616]
<P>
(3) how many fire appliances are available in each <i>(a)</i> county and <i>(b)</i> London borough;  [20612]
<P>
(4) how many of the total number of fire appliances are in active service.  [20613]<P></UL>

 The number of fire appliances available in fire brigades in England and Wales at 31 March 2001 are shown in the following table. The pumps provide fire cover as required by the Fire Services Act 1947. Special appliances include hydraulic platforms, turntable ladders, foam tenders, emergency tenders, control units, hose laying lorries, chemical incident units and fire boats.
<P>

<a name="11206w04.html_para3">The cost of determining the age of each appliance would be disproportionate but a brigade would expect to replace appliances over 12 to 15 years.

<P>

<a name="11206w04.html_para4">In 2000 there were 1,534 accidents involving appliances. It is not known how many of these were due to road accidents while on operational duty. Again the cost of determining this for 2000 and for earlier years would be disproportionate.

<a name="11206w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The role of the Schools Adjudicator is to decide on LEA school organisation plans, and individual school proposals and admission arrangements, where it has not been possible to reach agreement locally and there has been a statutory objection. Adjudicators must consider each case on its merits, taking into account all the information available to them and the views expressed by all interested parties. Hon. Members do not have statutory objection rights but are free to make representations to the Office of the Schools Adjudicator on cases under consideration, in the same way as any member of the public with a local interest. Decisions of the Schools Adjudicator are binding on the parties concerned.

 <i>[holding answer 5 December 2001]:</i> The Department for Education and Skills provides assistance for schools to establish links with schools in the EU, Commonwealth and worldwide through its funding of organisations such as the British Council. Programmes include practical help with finding a school as well as a range of assistance to help with the cost of visiting the partner school.
<P>

<a name="11206w05.html_para0">Increasingly, school links are being made by utilising information and communication technology. For instance, schools seeking partner schools anywhere in the world can consult the Windows on the World website on the 



<P>
<P><I>6 Dec 2001 : Column: 454W</I><P>
internet at http://www.wotw.org.uk or the Montage Plus website at http://www.montageplus.co.uk which supports joint curriculum projects between schools in this country and abroad.
<P>

<a name="11206w05.html_para1">EU funding is also available through the Socrates Programme, the European Action Programme in the field of education that focuses specifically on schools in the EU through the Comenius action. The programme is open to the member states of the EU as well as all the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe, Cyprus and Malta. Contact seminars for schools wishing to find partners are held regularly across Europe. The British Council publicises the action, and holds UK regional briefing meetings on the Socrates Programme to advertise the opportunities. The Partbase database (partbase.eupro.se) provides schools with an on-line search facility for finding Comenius partners.

<a name="11206w06.html_para0">The Army remains committed to achieving full manning by around 2005. We have always said that returning the Army to full manning would be a long haul and recognise that this represents a significant challenge. It requires a three pronged approach; maximising recruitment while reducing wastage during training and improving the return of service of trained personnel. The package of measures we have introduced has already delivered some benefits with improvements in retention and we are pursuing a number of recruitment initiatives at regional and national level.

<P>
<a name="11206w06.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 It is important that young people&#151;the voters and taxpayers of tomorrow&#151;should have an understanding of defence. In addition, defence has much to offer the curriculum. The Ministry of Defence produces a wide range of publications which are available to assist school students in their research, or to inform members of the public who wish to find out more about defence. These include a series of leaflets on various aspects of defence activity, a new series of leaflets describing the impact of defence activity in each region of the country, and a series of booklets including one&#151;Defence Matters&#151;that is tailored specifically for students and has been sent to schools across the country. All our publications are available on demand and can also be found on the MOD website together with a wide range of other material about defence.
<P>

<a name="11206w06.html_para1">In addition, each of the services has a student presentation team or teams, which visit schools and colleges across the country, and we are currently in the process of appointing a schools adviser who will develop a range of defence related material that can be used to help deliver the curriculum.

 The establishment and actual strengths and level of undermanning in percentage terms for each of the Scottish regiments listed is shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="11206w06.html_para2">We recognise the need to maximise recruiting levels across the Army as whole. The Army launched a major recruiting campaign in autumn 2000 aimed at targeting a more diverse and well-qualified audience as well as encouraging those who have already expressed an interest in the Army as a career to make the commitment. We are also aiming at reducing the number of recruits withdrawing during training by combining Phase I and Phase II Infantry Training.
<P>

<a name="11206w06.html_para3">As part of the overall recruiting campaign, the Army appointed a Glasgow recruiting company, Search, to manage all the Army's recruitment in the Glasgow area for an initial one-year trial period from the beginning of April 2001. Search will undertake promotional and marketing activity to highlight the many different career opportunities available in the Army with the aim of boosting the numbers of young people choosing the Army as a career.
<P>

<a name="11206w06.html_para4">Retention levels among soldiers have held steady over the last 12 months or so. However, we are not relaxing our efforts in this area and have introduced several Operational welfare initiatives including: Guaranteed Post Operational tour leave, electronic blueys and 20 minutes free telephone call per week for personnel on Operations. We also recognise the importance of providing soldiers and their families a decent standard of accommodation and have several projects in hand to effect improvements to current housing stock.

 As of 3 December, the RAF had accrued over 2,600 flying hours during Operation Veritas. Approximately 1,100 of these flying hours related to reconnaissance missions and almost 1,500 to air to air refuelling flights. Hours accrued during other RAF missions, primarily resupply flights from the UK, are not included in this figure.

 Our lease contract for the RAF's four C-17s does not restrict flying hours. However, the contracted support package is based on an assumed annual fleet usage rate of 3,000 hours. Additional flying hours will give rise to an additional charge for the associated support.

 Officials in both the Ministry of Defence and Foreign and Commonwealth Office are actively working on ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, and we aim to ratify as soon as possible. We hope this will be in early 2002. The UK made a statement on signature of the Optional Protocol in September 2000 clarifying its understanding of the obligation on states (Article 1) to take all feasible measures to prevent the direct participation in hostilities of personnel under 18 years of age. The current work is aimed at finalising the detailed administrative guidelines for the armed forces which will give form to that

<P><I>6 Dec 2001 : Column: 459W</I><P>
commitment. Meanwhile, we take great care of the types of duty on which personnel under the age of 18 may be employed and ensure that none are deployed unless fully trained.
<P>

<a name="11206w07.html_para0">No service personnel under the age of 17 are deployed on operations. No personnel under the age of 18 carry out operational patrols in Northern Ireland, although 17-year-olds can be based in the Province. Also, under-18s are not deployed as aircrew or in submarines and, in line with UN policy, we do not deploy personnel under the age of 18 on UN peacekeeping operations.
<P>

<a name="11206w07.html_para1">The UK believes that, if it is widely ratified and its provisions properly implemented, the Protocol will represent a major step towards preventing the exposure of children, sometimes as young as seven or eight, to appalling danger and brutality, often by forceable recruitment into non-government forces.

 The security and defence of key points within the UK is a matter for the police. Should the threat warrant additional security, beyond that which a particular constabulary are able to provide, they can call on assistance from other police forces across the country and, ultimately, from the armed forces. Under current arrangements, regular service personnel would be used to augment the police. Arrangements for mutual aid between police forces and for military support to the police are the same throughout the UK.

 The vast majority of the UK military equipment deployed to Oman for Exercise Saif Sareea required no modification in order to operate in the climatic conditions encountered during the exercise. Although individual units may, at modest cost, have taken measures to prepare equipment for the exercise, a decision was taken not to fully desertise all major items of equipment. An example of individual unit measures was the fitting of sand filters and protective blade strips to RN helicopters, the costs of which could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 <i>[holding answer 5 December 2001]:</i> Negotiations continue to finalise a 25-year private finance initiative contract for the Department's strategic sealift with AWSR as the preferred bidder. This will cover the operation, support, maintenance, and crewing of up to six roll on/roll off ferries to be available for the Ministry of Defence (MOD) to use at varying periods of notice. It is estimated that routinely the MOD will require only four of the six vessels and when not being used by the Department they will be available to the owners, AWSR, for commercial purposes. The total value of the contract is estimated to be worth around &#163;950 million with some 85 per cent. being spent within the UK. The cost of the ship-build element will be contained within the overall strategic sealift service contract. We hope to be in a position to complete negotiations shortly.

 We welcome steps taken by the Nigerian Government and the National Assembly towards ratification of the Convention against Torture, the drafting of a National Action Plan on Human Rights, strengthening of the National Human Rights Commission and the removal of existing laws that contravene international human rights obligations. There remain areas of concern including the handling of tensions between ethnic groups, the use of capital and corporal punishment, prison conditions and the high numbers of Nigerians that live in extreme poverty.

 Through the Africa Trade and Poverty Programme (TPP) we are making available funding of &#163;7.5 million to work in up to 12 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in regional organisations, to build capacity for trade reforms which serve poverty reduction objectives.
<P>

<a name="11206w09.html_para4">Trade and Poverty Programme projects are expected to start in 2002 in Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi and Botswana (as well as with the East Africa Community). The main criteria for selection of these countries have been strong demand for TPP within the country, and consistency of the TPP approach with DFID's other work on poverty reduction. Exploratory visits have been made to nine other countries. This may lead to further country projects being developed during 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what monitoring systems are in place to guarantee that UK manufactured and licensed equipment, components and spares are not used against civilians in Israel's Occupied Territories; and if he will make a statement.  [19563R]<P>

<P>
<a name="11206w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We assess all export licensed applications on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria in light of circumstances prevailing at the time. We are keeping the situation under close review. We have no evidence that equipment manufactured in the UK and licensed for export by this Government has been used by Israeli forces against civilians in the Occupied Territories during the recent and continuing violence. We would be concerned if such evidence came to light.
<P>

<a name="11206w11.html_para0">We use information supplied by a number of sources to check that British equipment is not being used against Palestinians in the Occupied Territories, including information gathered by our embassy and non-governmental organisations among others.
<P>

<a name="11206w11.html_para1">However, the surest way of preventing UK defence exports from being misused is to refuse an export licence if it is assessed that an unacceptable risk of misuse or diversion exists, among other reasons. To this end, the Government have also taken steps to strengthen the process of risk assessment when considering export licence applications for any destination. For example, we have improved our procedures for gathering information on end-users of potential concern from UK overseas posts. We also take into account reliable information received about end-users of concern from a variety of external sources, including international reporting bodies and non-governmental organisations.

<P>
<a name="11206w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We condemn the suicide bomb attacks in Israel over the weekend, and regret the cycle of violence now taking place in the region. It is clear that Israel and the Palestinians must return to dialogue as the only means of securing a just and lasting peace in the middle east. It remains our view that third-party monitoring, accepted by both parties, would serve their interests in implementing the Mitchell recommendations. 



<P>

In common with the US and our EU partners, we stand ready to contribute to monitoring if both parties agree to their presence.

 The Bonn conference concluded successfully on 5 December with an agreement on a power- sharing transitional government. We congratulate the Afghan participants and the United Nations, particularly the Secretary General's Special Representative, Mr. Brahimi, on this significant achievement which will, we believe be the first step towards a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. We have played an important role behind the scenes in encouraging the interested parties to strike a deal. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has had a number of conversations with key figures to this end, the British Office in Kabul has engaged directly with United Front leaders, and a senior diplomat, Robert Cooper, attended the Bonn conference.

The Act not only protects women from stalking, but all those subjected to repetitive and alarming or distressing behaviour, among others: children from bullies, victims of domestic violence and witnesses from intimidation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many civilian staff were employed by each police authority in England in each year since 1979 <i>(a)</i> in total and <i>(b)</i> per head of population.  [15239]<P>

<P>
<a name="11206w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The information requested is readily available only since 1989. A table has been placed in the Library which shows the answer in the form of population per officer.

<a name="11206w12.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Michael Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many <i>(a)</i> police officers and <i>(b)</i> operational police officers per head of population there are in each police authority in England.  [15238]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11206w12.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The information requested is set out in the table in the form of population per police officer. Operational officers are defined by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary as any member of staff, including covert staff, whose primary role (ie over 50 per cent. of their time) is directly to deliver the overarching aims of the police service. To 'directly deliver', the role must involve routine and immediate interface (either face to face or by telephone) with the public, including covert operations; staff in such roles can be considered as front line service providers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11206w13.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Analysis of the currently available financial information indicates that the Probation Service achieved an estimated efficiency saving of 0.6 per cent. in 2000&#150;01, against the target of 4 per cent. This followed estimated savings of 17 per cent. during the three year period from 1995&#150;96 to 1998&#150;99, significantly above the target requirement. The reduction in the level of estimated savings between 1995&#150;96 to 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 to 2000&#150;01 recognised the substantial additional investment provided to the Probation Service from 1998 to secure and improve effective service delivery.
<P>

<a name="11206w13.html_para0">The public service agreement target for the National Probation Service in 2001&#150;02 is 3 per cent. The National Probation Service has issued efficiency savings targets to each of the 42 local probation boards for 2001&#150;02. Boards are required to include a statement of their proposed

efficiency savings in their annual plan. Boards are also being required to report on their achievement of efficiency savings targets for 2001&#150;02.
<P>

<a name="11206w13.html_para1">The National Probation Service recognises that the achievement of efficiency savings is critically important and it is also vital to have proper arrangements for measuring efficiency savings. The National Probation Service is therefore committed to developing a new comprehensive model to measure efficiency savings that takes into account the very considerable changes that are being made to the arrangements for dealing with offenders, such as the introduction of accredited programmes.

 The Public Service Agreement target for completions of accredited offender behaviour programmes in prison was published in 'Public Services for the Future: Modernisation, Reform, Accountability'. The target was to increase the number of completions of accredited offender behaviour programmes run by the Prison Service from 3,000 to 6,000 a year by 2001&#150;02, including an increase from 680 to 1,100 in those completing sex offender programmes.

<a name="11206w13.html_para4">Between 1999 and 2000 the British Crime Survey shows that the number of violent crimes has decreased significantly, by 19 per cent. The survey shows a 34 per cent. decrease in the incidents of domestic violence over that period.
<P>

<a name="11206w13.html_para5">We have taken a number of steps to address domestic violence including issuing a new Home Office circular to the police, issuing multi-agency guidance for addressing domestic violence, and providing over &#163;10 million funding under the Crime Reduction Programme to the Violence Against Women initiative. Further consideration is currently being given across government as to what further strategic measures are needed to ensure there is adequate provision for domestic violence survivors, the Criminal Justice System response to domestic violence is robust and effective, and to reduce incidents of domestic violence and repeat victimisation.
<P>

<a name="11206w13.html_para6">We have also taken steps to strengthen the protection of children as part of our major reform of the law on sex offences, and to target hate crime with new racially aggravated offences and legislation to ensure that the courts treat evidence of racial hostility as a factor in sentencing.

 In 2001&#150;02, the cost of developing and implementing accredited offending behaviour programmes in the community is projected to be &#163;44 million. &#163;15.3 million of this came from the 2000 Spending Review settlement, with the remaining &#163;28.7 million coming from efficiency savings as a result of replacing old programmes with the new, accredited ones.

The target for this financial year is not to exceed 18 per cent. of the average population. The provisional April 2001 to October 2001 performance is better than target and stands at 16.9 per cent.

<P>

 The terms of reference set by the Home Secretary for the review does not prescribe specific areas for consideration; it sets the coverage as all shootings by the police since 1998 that resulted in death or injury. However, the terms of reference do include the planning, control and conduct of these operations.

<a name="11206w14.html_para1">There is guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers that firearms officers should take account of when called to deal with a situation involving a person with a mental disorder. If any of the cases under review did involve such a person then the Police Complaints Authority will consider the appropriateness of this guidance to the situation, how well it was followed and its affect on the planning, control and conduct of the operation and will make recommendations.

 The basic training received by all recruits to the police service includes an element designed to raise awareness of mental illness and to highlight the importance of communicating effectively and sensitively with people suffering from a mental disorder. Individual forces also provide further training for their officers on these issues. Details are not held centrally of such local provision.

 No Home Office guidance is given to credit card issuers on reporting credit card fraud. However, I understand that the Association of Chief Police Officers' National Working Party on Cheque and Card Fraud has agreed guidelines on reporting cheque and payment card fraud to the police to encourage best practice in combating credit card fraud.

 <i>[holding answer 5 December 2001]:</i> In future primary care trusts will commission pathology services alongside other services. Pathology services are currently provided by national health service trusts. Through the Pathology Modernisation Programme, the Department is currently working with the NHS to develop a planning guide for pathology modernisation. As part of this process, we are considering the appropriate model for pathology services in the light of "Shifting the Balance of Power" and the proposed changes to NHS structures under the NHS Reform and Health Care Professions Bill. We aim to issue these proposals for wide consultation in spring 2002.

Susceptible livestock on farms adjoining an Infected Premises (Contiguous Premises) should be culled within 48 hours although local vets have some discretion not to slaughter cattle or rare breeds of sheep or pigs if it is considered that the level 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>6 Dec 2001 : Column: 491W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of biosecurity on the contiguous premises means that the risk of the animals having been exposed to foot and mouth infection is very low.
<P>
<BR>
Animals which have been in contact with infected stock in some way, either directly, indirectly or which are on premises which have been exposed to infection are traced and slaughtered as dangerous contacts.
<P>
<BR>
Susceptible livestock are also slaughtered where animals show signs which suggest foot and mouth disease is present but which are not sufficiently consistent with the signs of FMD to confirm the diagnosis on clinical grounds. In such cases, samples are submitted to the laboratory and animals on contiguous premises are not culled unless a positive laboratory test is obtained.
<P>
<BR>
The following procedures should be applied to fields and pastures used by susceptible animals on an infected premises.
<P>
<BR>
Items likely to attract vermin or scavenging animals must be removed from the land and either destroyed or soaked in disinfectant.
<P>
<BR>
The land should be cleared of all equipment and structures (e.g. troughs, arks, temporary fencing etc.) and left for 42 days to enable maximum exposure of any surface contamination to the environment.
<P>
<BR>
Land that had been grazed by susceptible stock, where possible, be harrowed to break down and disperse waste material e.g. dung.
<P>
<BR>
The cleansing and disinfection of the paddock(s) or land can then be considered complete. However, re-contamination of pastures by vehicles, personnel etc. is feasible unless they follow the biosecurity measures when they leave the other parts of the premises that have not been cleansed and disinfected.
<P>
<BR>
Detailed guidance in respect of individual premises is available to farmers through the local animal health office. In addition, general guidance on biosecurity is available on the DEFRA website."

This is for cases where the clinical picture on the farm suggests that disease is not present (i.e. there are insufficient grounds for slaughtering on suspicion the entire herd/flock) but where we want to be sure we have not missed something.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will update and publish the information given in the letter of 8 August from the Under-Secretary of State to the hon. Member for Vale of York in response to questions concerning biosecurity measures in areas where culling takes place, closure of local roads and the impact of Thirsk Auction Mart (refs 4050, 4047, 4044, 4045, 4048, 4046).  [12069]<P>

<P>
<a name="11206w15.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 My letter of 8 August provided the following information:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"On 11 July you tabled 6 parliamentary questions which I was unable to reply to before the House rose for summer recess. You asked what representations had been received that those involved in the culls were not observing the strict biosecurity measures; what representations had been received on actions by officials on an infected site covered by biosecurity provisions, what criteria are used to decide on road closures in an infected zone; what measures will be taken to ensure that local roads are closed when culling is taking place; what assessment has been made of the 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>6 Dec 2001 : Column: 492W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>impact on Thirsk Auction Mart of its closure as a collection centre; and what representations have been received on the three kilometre restriction zone from an infected area.
<P>
<BR>
The Government's key priority is to eradicate foot and mouth disease as quickly as possible and vigilance and high standards of biosecurity are crucial. It is therefore imperative that DEFRA staff are seen to be applying good biosecurity measures at all times and at every available opportunity officials are reminded of this. Any breaches will be treated with the utmost seriousness.
<P>
<BR>
A number of allegations have been made that recommended biosecurity measures have been breached by DEFRA officials. All such allegations are investigated. So far most cases have been found either to be groundless or to be lacking in sufficient detail to enable a thorough investigation.
<P>
<BR>
One case was proven where animal parts were left on a holding. The site was subsequently fully cleared and the staff reminded of the vital importance of maintaining full biosecurity and thoroughness in performing culling operations. The Foot and Mouth Disease Order 1983 allows a Ministry or local authority inspector to prohibit the entry of any person onto any land or into any agricultural building that lies within an "infected" area. This power could be used to close roads. However, veterinary judgment has been that, except in very rare cases, to do so would be disproportionate to the risk involved. Such recommendations are normally based, for example on epidemiological assessment where a road passes through the middle of an infected premise that has not yet been disinfected or where it is not possible to screen a cull from the public's view.
<P>
<BR>
Nonetheless, to ensure that inspectors have sufficient powers to control the current outbreak, additional powers have been inserted in the Foot and Mouth Disease Order 1983 by the Foot and Mouth (Amendment) (England) (No 4) Order 2001 which would allow an inspector of the Ministry or a local authority (with prior written authority of the Minister) to close roads within a controlled area. It is a veterinary judgment as to whether a recommendation should be made to the local authority for a particular road to be closed pending a cull. This would happen if a road passed through or, particularly close to, an infected premise where culling was to occur and where there was no means of ensuring that the cull and all related activity could be screened from the public's view.
<P>
<BR>
No assessment has been made on the impact of closing the Thirsk Auction Mart as a collection centre. Responsibility for authorising collection centres rests with the local authority which in this case, is North Yorkshire county council. However to be licensed as a collection centre strict guidelines laid down by the State Veterinary Service must be met. The Thirsk Centre was no longer able to meet the required criteria owing to the outbreak of the disease in that area. The situation will be kept under review but Thirsk is now subject to tight biosecurity emergency procedures announced by my noble Friend Lord Whitty on 23 July.
<P>
<BR>
The three-kilometre zone (the Protection Zone) is required by EU legislation, and is based on scientific and veterinary advice and experience in dealing with this disease."

<a name="11206w15.html_para9">Biosecurity remains an extremely important issue and there will need to be a continuing discussion with all interested parties on the lessons that need to be learned on disease prevention measures to be followed by those responsible for livestock. As regards the biosecurity observed by DEFRA staff during the outbreak, no further examples of breaches have been proven by our investigation.
<P>

<a name="11206w15.html_para10">The disease situation is now much improved in Thirsk.

Thus the figures for later years are more accurate than earlier estimates and do not necessarily show that actual deterioration has taken place.

I strongly agree with the Commission's conclusions in their Green Paper on the operation of the CFP that it is not meeting its objectives. It is failing to provide an adequate living for many fishermen and is failing to conserve fish stocks. The forthcoming review of the CFP will give the opportunity not only to put right what has gone wrong but also to consider how the CFP should develop over the coming years.

 The Excellence in Cities scheme, which has been promoted by the Department for Education and Skills (DFES), is already being extended outside major cities, through the Excellence Clusters. These will tackle smaller areas of disadvantage, including some rural areas. By September 2002 there will be 24 clusters, including some serving areas in West Cumbria, County Durham and Lancashire. More clusters will be announced in subsequent years. Ministers and officials at DEFRA will strongly support the lead given by colleagues at DFES in spreading this excellent initiative to rural areas rather than establishing a new initiative in competition. We welcome the success of the Excellence in Cities initiative, which is designed to address disadvantage through a programme of support including learning mentors, learning support units and a programme for gifted and talented pupils, and the way the initiative focuses on the needs and aspirations of pupils and their parents. It currently involves 58 authorities and by 2003&#150;04 some &#163;300 million will be spent in EiC schools. The extension of the programme to Excellence Clusters started in September 2001. Excellence Clusters are smaller groups of schools outside major cities which work together to implement the EiC programme.

<P><I>6 Dec 2001 : Column: 498W</I><P>
of both human and veterinary medicines in the EU. This particular proposal concerns veterinary medicines for use in food-producing animals. In its present form it could result in farmers in England, Wales and Scotland, having to pay more by incurring veterinary surgeons' fees when obtaining those medicines that are currently available without veterinary intervention. Furthermore, it could restrict the number and types of veterinary medicines that may be supplied by registered agricultural merchants and saddlers, to a limited range of products for dogs and cats. This could have significant adverse effects on those businesses.
<P>

<a name="11206w17.html_para2">In considering the proposal the Government have taken account of its likely impact on the supply of veterinary medicines and have agreed that, during negotiations, UK officials should seek to modify the proposal to enable a flexible approach to the distribution of veterinary medicinal products that takes advantage of existing national practices, so long as consumer protection and animal welfare can be demonstrably assured.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11206w19.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Under the terms of the Wellington Museum Act 1947, the Secretary of State has a duty to maintain the forecourt of Apsley House, the fabric of its exterior and the parts of the building used as a museum. The Duke of Wellington is not required to make any contribution in respect of the duties of the Secretary of State, but he does have a duty to keep the portions of Apsley House which he is entitled to occupy in good repair and to maintain the garden of the House. In addition the Wellesley family are responsible for making their own arrangements for the supply of utilities to their apartments.

<P>
<a name="11206w19.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Duke of Wellington and his family have the right of occupation, under the Wellington Museum Act 1947, to live at Apsley House in private apartments which comprise just over half the house and to occupy and maintain the garden. These rights of occupation are rent free (subject to the duties of repair and maintenance) in perpetuity.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) what percentage of pools industry money went to the <i>(a)</i> Foundation for Sport and Arts and <i>(b)</i> Football Foundation in (i) 2000&#150;01 and (ii) 2001&#150;02; and what the percentage will be for 2002&#150;03;  [20988]

<P>
<P>
<a name="11206w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Under the terms of the Government's agreement with the Littlewoods and Vernons Pools each company has made donations equivalent to 3 per cent. of stake money to each of the Foundations for Sport and the Arts and the Football Foundation in 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02. The agreement was due to end on 31 March 2002. As announced by my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his pre-Budget Report, following discussions between officials and industry representatives, the two pools companies have agreed to continue their funding for the two Foundations for a further two years at a rate equivalent to 2 per cent. of gross profits.




<P>
<P><I>6 Dec 2001 : Column: 505W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11206w19.html_para1">The Football Foundation retains only an element of the donations made to it as the pools donations are for UK-wide purposes while the Foundation is an England only body. The Foundation currently retains 72.8 per cent. of the funds donated to it by the pools companies for its own purposes less &#163;250,000 directly allocated to Supporters Direct by the Government. The rest is passed to bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland specified by the devolved Administrations.
<P>

<a name="11206w19.html_para2">My Department's provisional estimates are that pools donations to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts and Football Foundation will be in the region of &#163;1.25 million. In the case of the Football Foundation this will mean in the region of &#163;1 million for its own purposes in 2002&#150;03. Of course, the final figures are tied to the success of both companies over the year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11206w21.html_spnew0"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The number of disability living allowance (DLA) recipients with deafness as their principal disabling condition has increased by around 200 per cent. (8,700 to 26,500) since 1993, twice the increase in the overall caseload over the same period. More generally the number of people getting DLA is increasing by some 3 to 5 per cent. each year. Estimates of and research into the take up of DLA are not routinely undertaken, but the take-up of the benefit is kept under general review.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11206w21.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what steps he is taking to ensure that disability living allowance medical reports based on assessments in which <i>(a)</i> a deaf examinee was not

provided with communication support or <i>(b)</i> the examiner was not experienced in the problems of deaf people are set aside.  [20793]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11206w21.html_spnew1"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Arrangements exist for the rescheduling of a medical assessment if a claimant has not previously indicated the need for an interpreter, but it later transpires that the assessment cannot proceed without one. The same would apply should there be a need for communication support for a deaf claimant.
<P>

<a name="11206w21.html_para0">Current training for examining doctors already includes instructions to assess comprehension of speech and reaction to noise. It also includes instructions to take into account the effects of background noise when assessing hearing. A trainer-led module on sensory problems has been prepared, with help from RNID and other voluntary organisations to deliver to examining doctors.
<P>

<a name="11206w21.html_para1">It is therefore unlikely that there would be a need for medical assessments to be set aside.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will amend the Decision Making and Appeals Regulations so that appeals from deaf claimants which are heard without the requisite communication support can be set aside by a tribunal chair.  [20794]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11206w21.html_spnew2"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Regulation 57 of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 only allows set aside in limited circumstances. These are where a document relating to the proceedings was not sent or received or a party to the proceedings was not present at an oral hearing. A chairman may also set aside where there have been procedural irregularities or mishaps. In addition, under section 13(2) of the Social Security Act 1998, if a person applies for leave to appeal to a Commissioner, the tribunal chairman (or another legally qualified panel member) can set aside the tribunal's decision and remit the matter for redetermination provided he considers that the original decision was wrong in law. That would include where he considered that there had been a breach of natural justice, for example, where the evidence showed that the appellant was not able to hear or understand what was being said at an oral hearing.
<P>

<a name="11206w21.html_para2">We have no plans to expand the set aside provisions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11206w21.html_spnew3"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Last year the Appeals Service commissioned the Royal National Institute for the Deaf (RNID) to undertake a disability audit of service provision. To improve customer service a strategic plan has been implemented to tackle the issues identified. We are seeking to ensure diversity issues are taken into account and successfully managed in each area of the agency, as part of normal business.
<P>

<a name="11206w21.html_para3">For those with hearing difficulties, "typetalk" and induction loops are available. Induction loops are now in most permanent venues, and plans are in place to ensure that all permanent venues have this equipment by 31 March 2002. For deaf appellants who require communication support, a British Sign Language interpreter is made available where appropriate.

<a name="11206w22.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The UK is working with governments throughout the world, both in donor and developing countries, to ensure that co-ordinated action is taken. To this end we co-ordinate our efforts through the G7/8 process, through institutions such as the IMF, World bank, WTO, and UN system, and directly with developing countries themselves. The Chancellor has recently spoken in New York and at Yale university on the need to ensure that globalisation brings prosperity to all, and contributes to poverty reduction.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11206w22.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government are committed to creating and maintaining the right climate for business to flourish, invest and grow. Since 1997, the Government's central economic objective has been to achieve high and stable levels of growth and employment. This means pursuing macro-economic and enterprise policies which promote business activity, and which improve the productivity of firms in the UK. Because of the choices we have made we are now enjoying the longest period of sustained low inflation since the 1960s, we have the lowest long term interest rates for nearly 40 years, and the lowest unemployment since the 1970s. The fiscal policy framework which we have put in place has restored the public finances to a healthy and sustainable position.
<P>

<a name="11206w22.html_para2">Of course, no country can insulate itself from global economic events. But the UK is now much better placed than in the past to weather the global downturn. The Government will continue to steer a course of economic stability, with low inflation and sound public finances, coupled with microeconomic reforms to create the right conditions for investment and growth in the future.

 The minimum income guarantee benefits around 1.8 million of the poorest households.

We are committed to raising the MIG in line with earnings throughout this Parliament to ensure that pensioners can share in rising prosperity.
<P>

<a name="11206w23.html_para0">To provide greater support not only for the very poorest but also for those on low and modest incomes, we have decided to proceed with the introduction of the Pension Credit from 2003 at a cost of &#163;2 billion in the first full year. The Pension Credit will tackle the unfairness and complexities of the current system. It will bring pensioners up to a guaranteed minimum income and it will reward those who have saved for retirement to ensure that it pays to have saved even quite modest amounts.

 Following Parliament's approval, the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (SI 2001&#150;3755) have replaced the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 1995. Continuing the approach under the 1995 Regulations, the Treasury has delegated to the Financial Services Authority its powers under part 2 of the Regulations, except&#151;as required&#151;those functions conferred on the Treasury by regulation 11 and regulation 12. This re-confirms the FSA role as supervisor of CREST as operator. The FSA is also supervisor of CREST as a recognised clearing house.

 Public-private partnership (including private finance initiative) projects are used where they offer better value for money than alternative procurement approaches.
