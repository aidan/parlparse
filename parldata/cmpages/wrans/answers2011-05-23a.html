 There has been a slight increase in the absolute levels of problem gambling to 0.9% of the population—and while it is not possible to say whether this represents an upward trend or a temporary fluctuation, we cannot be complacent. But we must use caution when looking at problem gambling rates for individual activities; problem gamblers tend to gamble using many activities and the Prevalence Survey does not provide evidence or proof about which activities cause or exacerbate problem gambling. We will be watching closely the outcome of the current machines research which will address these questions, among other things.</p>

 The Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, the right hon. Member for South West Surrey (Mr Hunt), has considered the application of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE) to Tote staff. Whether TUPE. applies depends on the legal employer of the employee in question. For these purposes, Tote Group employees fall into two groups: (i) employees of the Horserace Totalisator Board; and (ii) employees of the Horserace Totalisator Board's subsidiaries.</p>

               <a name="11052327000133"> For employees employed by the Horserace Totalisator Board, TUPE will apply, together with the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004, to transfer them to the successor company.</p>

               <a name="11052327000134"> For employees employed by subsidiaries of the Horserace Totalisator Board, such as Tote Credit Ltd and Tote Bookmakers Ltd, TUPE will not be needed. The reason for this is that their legal employer won't change at all—it will move from the Horserace Totalisator Board to the successor company along with the staff—so their existing employment contracts will be unaffected.</p>

 Given that we are in the very early stages in the development of the white space technology market I am not able to provide an accurate estimate of how many devices we expect to be used in the white spaces. A lot will depend on how the market develops and whether innovative or attractive services are developed for the technology. However experience of other technologies used for similar applications within unlicensed spectrum may provide an example. The nearest analogy to unlicensed white space devices would be Wi-Fi where there are over 4 million hot spots in the UK and many more customer devices that connect to them.</p>

 The European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) was created following agreement by a qualified majority of member states at the ECOFIN meeting on 9 May 2010. The meeting took place before the formation of the coalition Government and was attended by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling), who consulted opposition parties. The Chancellor of the Exchequer cautioned against committing the UK to proposals that have a lasting effect on the UK's public finances. However, he made it clear that given the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling) was still Chancellor of the Exchequer at that point, it was for him to reach decisions. All contact between the Treasury and the Opposition parties followed the agreed Cabinet Office guidelines for the 2010 general election.</p>

 I can confirm that Coastguard Agency staff are able to attend the series of meetings being held across the United Kingdom by the Transport Select Committee, the most recent of which was in Stornoway on 19 May 2011. Ministers have encouraged Coastguard Agency staff across the UK to share their views on proposals for modernising Her Majesty's Coastguard with the Transport Select Committee. The Committee has received written views and a number of submissions setting out alternative proposals from serving staff. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has facilitated opportunities for the Committee to meet operational coastguards at the Coastguard Centres at Falmouth, Clyde and Stornoway, and coastguards from other centres were encouraged to attend those sessions. Ministers have also proposed that members of the PCS Union can give formal evidence to the Committee in their capacity as union representatives. The Scotland Office has offered assistance to the Committee with arranging visits in Scotland, should this be required.</p>

 No specific guidance is issued to police on the welfare considerations of seized animals. However, at the time the Animal Welfare Act 2006 was introduced, police forces were provided with explanatory notes. These notes set out the responsibilities of owners and keepers of animals, whether on a permanent or temporary basis.</p>

 The UK Apiculture Programme for the period 2010-13 was submitted to the European Commission for approval in April 2010. This programme provides partial reimbursement of up to 50% of member states' own expenditure. Beekeeping stakeholders, including the Bee Farmers' Association which represents commercial beekeepers, were consulted on the 2010-13 programme before submission to the Commission.</p>

The programme in England is implemented by the National Bee Unit, part of the Food and Environment Research Agency, where the expenditure on this was £252,000 in 2008, £254,000 in 2009 and £268,000 in 2010 from the UK allocations.

 We have seen no conclusive evidence that speculation is leading to increased food price volatility, which is why we do not support calls for further controls on speculation. Furthermore, farmers need liquid markets so they can hedge their price risk. We prefer to tackle food price volatility at its roots through measures to improve the flow of information to the markets, restrict export bans and invest in productivity.</p>

 The Government are committed to honesty in food labelling and we have facilitated the development of industry owned principles<sup>(1)</sup> which provide consumers with clearer information on the origin of their food.

It is incorrect to assume that animal welfare is directly linked to farm size, or system of production. The most important influence on the welfare of farm animals is the knowledge, skills and experience of the farmers who care for them. However, where there are no legal requirements, businesses are able to provide information on production systems on a voluntary basis if they choose.</p>

 No such assessment has been made. However, all farm animals, in whatever system they are kept, are protected by comprehensive animal welfare legislation which requires some of the highest standards of animal welfare in the world. In England, the Animal Welfare Act 2006 makes it an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to any animal. The Act also contains a duty of care to animals; this means that anyone responsible for an animal must take reasonable steps to make sure the animal's needs are met. These general requirements are supplemented by more detailed ones for pigs in the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007, which lay down requirements in respect of general welfare, inspection, housing and feeding for all farmed animals.</p>

 The Department of Energy and Climate Change publishes a range of scenarios for oil, gas and coal price assumptions for the period up to 2030, which are used in the Department’s analytical work. The analysis to produce these scenarios has considered the impact of global economic growth. The range of fuel prices produced illustrates the high level of uncertainty around future price drivers such as global economic growth rates. The higher fuel price scenarios capture the impact of strong growth in emerging economies.</p>

 High Level Waste is a by-product from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and arises in the UK initially as a radioactive liquid. Sellafield Ltd continues to use vitrification technology to condition liquid HLW into a form that can be passively stored for many decades until transported to a Geological Disposal Facility. The total radioactive content for all HLW in stock is about 80,000,000 TBq which is about 95% of the total radioactive content of all wastes in the UK Radioactive Waste Inventory. Approximately 50% of the total HLW inventory in stock has been conditioned.</p>

 The safety of our helicopters is continuously reviewed. Threats to safety are identified through regular safety inspections, a joint air safety assurance audit was carried out on the task force joint aviation group in February, and discussions between the front-line helicopter users, the Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff for Capability's Staff, and Defence Equipment and Support. These threats are assessed and where possible mitigation is then put in place through new equipment, training, tactics or procedures to ensure that the risk to life cannot practically be reduced further. The Department's aviation safety management systems are subject to formal audit by the Military Aviation Authority.</p>

 Though UK armed forces personnel do not receive specific training on the implementation of UN Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 1325 prior to the deployment in Afghanistan, all personnel deployed to any operational theatre will undertake, as part of their pre-deployment preparation, law of armed conflict training. This covers issues relevant to UNSCR 1325, such as the status of protected persons including women and children, and the humane treatment of captured persons.

               <a name="11052420000085"> Registers of town or village greens are held by local authorities, and data on registration activity are not reported to Government. Surveys of registration activity were carried out in late 2007 and late 2009, and the following data are estimated by scaling up for non-responding authorities. Values relate to the number of applications received or determined (as the case may be) in the specified year, and do not indicate the outcome relating to applications received in a particular year. Data collected in 2007 on the time taken to process similar applications under the Commons Registration Act 1965 showed an average period of 16 months among those authorities providing an answer.</p>

 The Department of Energy and Climate Change publishes a range of scenarios for oil, gas and coal price assumptions for the period up to 2030, which are used in the Department’s analytical work. The analysis to produce these scenarios has considered the impact of global economic growth. The range of fuel prices produced illustrates the high level of uncertainty around future price drivers such as global economic growth rates.

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) do not record data in the requested form. However, NOMS do record and publish statistics on assaults on staff which include assaults on prison officers. The statistics show the number of incidents in which staff have been involved, but do not include the number of individual injuries received by staff or the treatment they received. They do include figures for assaults by type of injury received. Figures for staff and prisoner injuries have been collated in the published statistics.</p>

 Prison establishments employ staff with specialist responsibilities around equality and diversity issues with a variety of job titles, such as race equality officer and disability liaison officer, as well as diversity officer. In the period 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2011 such staff spent an average of 77 hours each week per establishment working on equality and diversity issues. 124 prisons reported that an average of 35 or more hours per week was spent on these issues.

            <p>Most elements of this new process were rolled out nationally on 1 March 2011. All families with children that remain unlawfully in the UK could potentially go through this new returns process. The number of families who go through the different stages of the new process will depend on the decisions they take about their departure so is difficult to predict accurately, but we hope that most will take the chance to leave at the earlier assisted or required return stages. This new approach will not apply to children who are unaccompanied.</p>

 The available figures for Northumbria police force show the rate of employee attrition for civilian staff and warranted officers from 2005-06 to 2009-10.

The second table shows the number of civilian and warranted officers employed in Northumbria police force from 2002-03 to 2009-10.</p>

 It is for chief officers to decide what ammunition and weapons are appropriate to use in order to meet operational requirements, subject to the general law that the use of force by the police must be reasonable in the circumstances. A review of 9mm ammunition by the Home Office Scientific Development Branch (now the Centre for Applied Science and Technology) found that hollow point ammunition performed better than the current standard 9mm round. That review was passed on to the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p>

 Initial assessments of the estimated costs, which remain commercial in confidence, were made in October 2009. The recommendations of the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs are dependant upon the outcome of the prion filtered red blood cells in surgery patients (PRISM) study, the assessment of the results of which is not expected until 2012.

               <a name="11052422000212"> However, like other screening tests, it is not perfect, and we know that some cancers, such as invasive lobular carcinoma, may be more difficult to detect with a mammogram than other types of breast cancer. This is why we encourage all women to be breast aware, check for any changes and report any changes to their general practitioner as quickly as possible.</p>

Mammography is the only screening modality that has proven to reduce the mortality from breast cancer. Digital mammography has been shown to be more effective for younger women and women with dense breasts, and we are in the process of digitising the national health service breast screening programme (NHS BSP) in England. By the end of May 2011, 83% of local programmes will have at least one digital machine and 35% will be fully digital.</p>

 The NHS Information Centre for health and social care does not hold the information in the form requested. However, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Yellow Card Scheme provides for voluntary reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by healthcare professionals and members of the public. The scheme is run by the MHRA and Commission for Human Medicines and collects ADR reports from across the whole United Kingdom for all medicines, including herbal products. There is also a legal obligation for pharmaceutical companies to report all serious ADRs for their products that they are aware of.</p>

Data collected through the Yellow Card Scheme does not represent all patients who have suffered an adverse reaction to a medicine. Therefore it is not possible to provide the number of people who were admitted and treated in hospital as a result of a taking a natural remedy or licensed drug.</p>

 The Department commissioned a detailed review in 2009 to identify where age discrimination was most likely to occur within health and social care services. The review report, ‘Achieving Age Equality in Health and Social Care’, made recommendations on how the health and social care sector could end age discrimination and promote age equality in the light of the provisions in the Equality Act 2010. These have formed the basis of the Governments plans to implement the ban on age discrimination in health and social care from April 2012 as set out in ‘Equality Act 2010: banning age discrimination in services, public functions and associations, a consultation on proposed exceptions to the ban’ which was published by the Government Equalities Office on 3 March 2011. This consultation, which reflects the Government's intention of introducing no exceptions to the ban in health and social care services, ends on 25 May 2011. Having no exceptions to the ban means that from April 2012 any use of age in decision-making in health and social care services will need to be objectively justified.</p>

<i>Notes:</i>
1. The new headcount methodology for 2010 data is not fully comparable with previous years data due to improvements that make it a more stringent count of absolute staff numbers. Further information on the headcount methodology is available in the Census publication. Headcount totals are unlikely to equal the sum of components.
2. Data as at 30 September 2010.
<i>Data Quality:</i>
The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses.

 ‘Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer’ sets out our commitment to expand radiotherapy capacity by investing over £150 million in additional funding over the next four years.

 The Burmese Government announced on 16 May that it had reduced the sentences of all prisoners by one year and commuted all death sentences to life imprisonment. Reports indicate that over 14,000 prisoners have been released but we think that only 47 were political prisoners, who were anyway nearing the end of their sentences. We also understand that over 300 death sentences were commuted and note that no death sentences have been carried out in Burma for over 20 years. The UK made clear in a closed session of the UN Security Council on 19 May that the amnesty falls far short of the demands and expectations of the international community, which has repeatedly called for the release of all of Burma's over 2,000 political prisoners. Burmese law criminalises basic civil and political rights and the Burmese authorities have frequently denied the existence of prisoners of conscience claiming that all have been guilty of criminal offences.</p>

This will report towards the end of 2011 and copies will be placed in the Library. Our initial view, supported by an Ofsted report published in December, is that the programme had been helpful in raising school standards.

 The Department has not made a formal assessment of the effects of reductions in funding for student support services in further education colleges, sixth-form colleges and schools. The Government have increased by £150 million the amount available for disadvantaged funding, additional learner support and Foundation Learning, to ensure that funding is targeted where it is most needed. The 16 to 19 Bursary Fund will, in addition, allow schools, colleges and training providers to award bursaries to students in ways that best fit local needs and circumstances. Further education colleges, sixth-form colleges and schools will have the flexibility to determine the most appropriate use of funding in order to meet the needs of their students.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 19 May 2011]:</i> Subject to the result of the consultation on new financial support arrangements, we expect that schools, colleges and training organisations will make receipt of a 16-19 bursary—including bursaries guarantees to young people from vulnerable groups—conditional on a student meeting expected standards, for example, of attendance, behaviour or standard of work. Similar systems are already in place for education maintenance allowance, and schools and colleges have told us that the ability to set conditions is important for promoting a positive attitude to education.</p>

In maintained schools and academies in the Crewe and Nantwich constituency in January 2010 there were 2,135 pupils known to be eligible, which would give rise to a pupil premium of £918,050. In addition to this there were eight pupils known to be eligible for the Service child premium, paid at a lower rate of £200 per pupil, which would give rise to a further £1,600.

 In general employers say they are happy with the quality of UK graduates (National Employers Skill Survey 2009, UKCES 2010). However, they believe that graduates could be better provided with generic employability skills such as team working, leadership, etc. Higher education institutions are increasingly offering such programmes, including practical work experience placements, as part of their provision. We would like to see more of this approach and will, in our forthcoming White Paper, be highlighting to students, the higher education sector and employers the benefits of such activity.</p>
