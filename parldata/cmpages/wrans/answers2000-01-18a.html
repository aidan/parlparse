<a name="00118w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 In the last five years, the Civil Aviation Authority has received 62 reports of objects landing in the London area, which are presumed to have fallen from aircraft using Heathrow airport. Forty of these reports involved ice, 21 involved aircraft parts or related objects such as tools and one involved the body of a stowaway.

<a name="00118w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 21 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 539W, on National Air Traffic Services, when he expects to be able to offer a detailed list of all property <i>(a)</i> leased and <i>(b)</i> owned by NATS, with a valuation and a list of sites.  [104668]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 A list of properties which are leased or owned by National Air Traffic Services (NATS) is being put together as part of the due diligence exercise for the NATS public-private partnership. A valuation will be produced for the key sites which are owned by NATS. This work is currently scheduled for completion in late Spring 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals are being considered to oblige owners of sub-standard underground storage tanks to replace them, line them or retrofit cathodic protection.  [104635]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Existing health and safety legislation requires all employers to assess the risks from their work activities. Where the result of the assessment indicates that storage tanks may be sub-standard, the employer should select the most suitable remedial measure to reduce the risk of a leak. Suitable measures for underground petrol storage tanks include replacement, taking the tank out of use, lining the tank, or fitting cathodic protection.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals he has to require underground storage tank owners to measure the risk of corrosion failure.  [104637]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Employers are required to assess the risks to people's heath and safety in the event of a leak from an underground storage tank, and the likelihood of a tank corroding is one of the factors that should be taken into account in the assessment.
<P>

<a name="00118w01.html_para1">The Health and Safety Executive has issued guidance on the need to provide corrosion protection where appropriate and it is included in recently published industry guidance as one of the methods to manage the risk of a leak. Measuring the actual degree of corrosion is technically difficult and can be hazardous to the workers involved. For these reasons HSE would advocate leak protection and detection methods.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Tightness testing is one of a number of options available to employers to check the integrity of a new underground storage tank or to confirm a suspected leak in an existing tank. No recent representations have been received on the reliability of tightness testing.

Particular consideration is being given to safety controls at petrol stations and the continuing need for a permissioning regime. Discussions to date have included the Petrol Retailers' Association, the United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association, the Association of United Kingdom Oil Independents and the TUC. The Health and Safety Commission plans to consult on proposals for new legislation to implement the Directive in the autumn.

<P>
<a name="00118w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Biggin Hill Airport Ltd. presented a development strategy for Biggin Hill airfield to Bromley Borough Council in November 1999. No planning application has been received by the Council.
<P>

<a name="00118w01.html_para3">Depending on the circumstances and size of a proposed development, some or all of the following may be required in order to provide aircraft services: planning permission following the completion of an environmental impact assessment, the granting of a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) operators safety licence, and permission by the CAA to levy airport charges.
<P>

<a name="00118w01.html_para4">In most cases planning permission for proposed developments would be decided by the relevant local planning authority. However, the Secretary of State has the reserve power to call in a planning application if issues of more than local importance are involved.

 My right hon. and noble Friend the Minister for Transport wrote to the French Transport Minister on Tuesday 11 January to express our concern that yet again British hauliers were being prevented from going about their lawful business by a domestic dispute in France. My right hon. and noble Friend also sought assurances that the French Government would ensure the safety and well being of any British lorry drivers caught up in the dispute, and would act quickly to restore the free movement of goods. The letter was copied to the European Commission.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Regrettably, a number of companies and individuals will have incurred financial loss and suffered delay and general inconvenience as a result of the dispute in France. The Government have received no estimates of these overall costs and have no means of assessing what they might be.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 It is a cause for concern that, yet again, British hauliers have suffered financially as a result of a domestic dispute in France. However, as the French Government gave notice of this dispute on Friday 7 January, any hauliers who subsequently chose to travel to France and were then blockaded there are unlikely to be eligible for compensation under the relevant French law. Similarly, vehicles that were delayed outside French territory would not be eligible for compensation under French legislation.

<a name="00118w02.html_para0">Sections 1 and 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 and the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 require any load carried by a vehicle to be secured at all times and if necessary by physical restraints. To support this my Department issues a Code of Practice on the Safety of Loads on Goods Vehicles, which advises on the best practices for securing loads. This Code is widely used throughout the road haulage industry.

 Funding for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) has already been increased this year by allocating an additional &#163;2.5 million to the Countryside Agency to be spent on the management and conservation of designated AONBs. This is more than double the amount previously available. This increased funding will be carried through into the next year, to be supplemented by a further &#163;1 million, bringing the countryside Agency's budget for AONBs in 2000-01 to &#163;5.7 million.

 No complete and consistent set of estimates has, to my knowledge, been compiled. A number of estimates have been made of the value road users place on the extra journey times caused by congestion, for different years and using different methods. They agree that this runs to billions of pounds every year, and has been rising. These estimates do not, though, take into account the very considerable costs of providing congestion-free conditions. We will be examining the economic implications as part of the follow-up to our report, "Tackling Congestion and Pollution", published today.

Registered social landlords (RSLs) are now the main providers of new social housing as they can, through the use of private finance, deliver higher levels of outputs. RSL new build is supported through the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme (ADP) as well as by grants from local authorities. Details of central Government allocations to support English local authorities housing capital programmes, a substantial proportion of which goes on renovation of council housing, and the ADP over the past 10 years (in &#163; million) are as set out.

<a name="00118w02.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 There are a number of different types of Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs). The main information on the numbers of HMOs for England are the English House Condition Survey (which is carried out every five years, the last two surveys being conducted in 1991 and 1996) and the Census (1991). There are no reliable sources of information for the intervening years.
<P>

<a name="00118w02.html_para4">The table provides best estimates for different types of HMOs. This shows a small decline in the number of HMOs from 1991 to 1996. For traditional and purpose built HMOs and converted flats, the building contains more than one accommodation unit and can therefore be fully or partially occupied. This is reflected in the difference between the number of accommodation units provided and the number of households in occupation for these categories of HMO.

1. Figures exclude hostels, guest houses, boarding houses and bed and breakfast accommodation. Information for this type of HMO is available only from the 1991 Census which reported 45,000 buildings providing 274,000 units of accommodation under this category.<P>

2. There are slight variations between the statistics quoted above and the figures published in the 1996 English House Condition Survey report. This is because of minor modifications made to improve the EHCS database since publication. The modifications do not affect any of the patterns, findings or conclusions contained in the report.<P>

3. There is a margin of error involved in the estimates arising from the sample nature of the English House Condition Survey and from the complexities of classifying some types of HMO from information obtained through the Census.<P>

 We have today laid before the House "Tackling Congestion and Pollution", our first report under this Act.
<P>

<a name="00118w03.html_para2">We agree with the Commission for Integrated Transport that we should not set a national road traffic reduction target. The national volume of road traffic is not a good measure of our success in improving the outcomes that matter, particularly congestion and pollution. Targets for air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, health and road safety are already in place or are shortly to be published. The report invites views on our proposal to develop new benchmarks and targets for congestion for different area or road types.

<a name="00118w03.html_para3">With widespread support from local authorities, businesses and the general public for the policies in the Integrated Transport White Paper and Transport Bill, we can also tackle congestion.

<a name="00118w03.html_para4">The report shows that we can expect to see a reduction of more than half in the effect of traffic pollution on air quality over the next decade, mainly through better designed cars and fuels.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In reaching my decision about Mr. Tyson's application for entry to take part in a sporting contest in Manchester on 29 January I had regard not merely to the financial loss which might ensue for a number of companies and individuals should Mr. Tyson be refused entry, but also to the potentially ruinous consequences of such losses to smaller concerns in particular, all of whom had acted in good faith in the expectation that the contest would take place. Together with the general effect on business in the Manchester area and the inconvenience and disappointment of the many thousands who had bought tickets for the promotion this was a significant consideration in reaching my decision.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w03.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received, and from whom, about the case of Mr. Mike Tyson.  [105716]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Following a letter from the United Kingdom Immigration Service dated 11 January, Mr. Frank Warren, promoter of the sporting event, made representations about the entry of Mr. Tyson. These representations enclosed others from various companies and individuals with a direct or indirect interest in the promotion. In addition, representations and comments from a number of sources have been received at the Home Office. These are being registered and will receive a reply in due course.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w03.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what were the grounds which influenced his decision in the case of Mr. Mike Tyson.  [105713]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In the special circumstances of Mr. Tyson's case I considered that it would have been invidious for an individual immigration officer to have to weigh the competing considerations involved. I therefore decided, having carefully examined the representations submitted by Mr. Frank Warren, promoter of the sporting event, to issue an instruction to the Immigration Service that Mr. Tyson should be granted leave to enter until 30 January 2000 for the purpose of taking part in the scheduled contest.
<P>

<a name="00118w03.html_para6">I considered that there were exceptional circumstances which justified my decision. In particular I was mindful of the evidence of the likely effects on the small providers of ancillary services, some of which might have faced bankruptcy, had the promotion been cancelled as a consequence of Mr. Tyson being refused entry. I also had regard to the effect of cancellation on business in the Manchester area and to the great inconvenience and disappointment which many thousands of boxing fans who had purchased tickets would experience.
<P>

<a name="00118w03.html_para7">I weighed these factors against the nature and seriousness of Mr. Tyson's convictions, and I decided on balance that the exceptional circumstances of this case were such that Mr. Tyson should be granted leave to enter for the purpose of the match. This decision was entirely consistent with the Immigration Rules.
<P>

<a name="00118w03.html_para8">In reaching my decision I also took into account the fact that in practice the Immigration Rule relating to refusal of entry on the ground of criminal convictions had not been applied consistently in the past. This Rule and the way in which it is applied will now be reviewed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w03.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what advice he gave to the Immigration Service about the case of Mr. Mike Tyson.  [105717]

<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w03.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Generally the decision as to whether a person is or is not given leave to enter the United Kingdom is one for the immigration officer to take, considering any relevant representations and advice. The Secretary of State for the Home Department has the power under paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 2 to give instructions to immigration officers. Once the content and sweep of the representations about Mr. Tyson's entry were known I decided that it would be invidious for the decision to be made by an individual immigration officer and that it was appropriate to give instructions on this particular case given its high profile and complexity. After careful consideration I instructed the Immigration Service to admit Mr. Tyson for the purpose of taking part in the sporting contest at Manchester on 29 January.

 The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 does not specify the person or organisation which is to provide the central register referred to in section 39. It is being developed as part of the PHOENIX database of the Police National Computer, which is maintained by the Police Information Technology Organisation. As a next step a detailed impact assessment is to be carried out of the work which needs to be done to link the Police National Computer to existing firearms systems in forces. This is expected to be completed in April.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how much was spent from public funds on measures to combat burglary in each of the last 10 years; and what plans he has for such spending in each of the next three years.  [105706]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Details of individual police force expenditure in England and Wales on measures to combat burglary are not held centrally. However, burglary is one of the key strategic objectives of most of the local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships. Centrally, of the &#163;250 million budget for the Crime Reduction Programme, which runs from 1999-2000 to 2001-02, &#163;62 million has been allocated to the Reducing Burglary Initiative. This Initiative supports projects undertaken by the Partnerships

which apply a range of anti-burglary measures. These projects are to be evaluated to identify what works and where, most cost-effectively.
<P>

<a name="00118w05.html_para0">So far, &#163;4 million has been committed under the Initiative on the first 63 projects now under way. The balance will be allocated over the remaining two years of the Initiative with up to 200 round two projects beginning in March.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if it is his policy to encourage police authorities to increase the civilian staff of police forces in order to release more police officers for operational duties; and if he will make a statement.  [105422]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Staffing levels in a police force, whether police officers or civilians, are a matter for the police authority and chief officer to determine. It is my policy to encourage authorities and chief officers to make efficient and effective use of staff resources.
<P>

<a name="00118w05.html_para1">Police authorities have been required to plan and deliver efficiency gains of 2 per cent. year on year between 1999-2002. Efficiency gains totalling &#163;440 million will be redeployed to support front-line policing. Civilianisation of non-operational posts can play a key role in releasing resources for operational work.

 Senator Pinochet consented to the medical examination on the express basis that none of its contents were disclosed to anyone other than his legal representatives, to me and my advisers, and to the Law Officers and Director of Public Prosecutions.

 On 14 October 1999, representations were submitted by the Chilean Embassy to me, through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, attaching recent medical reports on Senator Pinochet. They suggested that there had been a recent and significant deterioration in his medical condition.
<P>

<a name="00118w05.html_para2">I have a clear legal duty to operate the Extradition Act 1989 properly. In the light of the information from the Chilean Embassy, that duty included informing myself of the true facts about Senator Pinochet's health. I therefore asked him to undergo a thorough and extensive medical examination, to be undertaken by an independent team of clinicians.

<a name="00118w05.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 I do not collect figures from local authorities on the detailed composition of their work forces. In some cases, other UK Ministers may seek information direct from Scottish local authorities in areas reserved to the UK Parliament, although this information is unlikely to cover detailed composition of their work forces either. Any collection of information about local authorities' work in areas of devolved competence would be a matter for the Scottish Executive. It is, of course, for local authorities themselves, as independent corporate bodies, to ensure that they comply with employment law, including equal opportunity requirements.

<i>(g)</i> As at 31 March 1999 the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) considered the net book value of its assets to be &#163;4.7 million. This was made up of IT hardware and software (&#163;2.3 million), furniture and fittings (&#163;0.1 million) and assets under construction (&#163;2.3 million). All of the OFT's IT hardware assets have either been replaced or upgraded over the last five years. All redundant hardware was disposed of at nil value, having been depreciated out. There has been no significant disposal of furniture over the period. The OFT had no holdings of land or buildings over the period.

<BR>
<i>(a) Debt Sales:</i> Since 1992 the Paris Club has been encouraging creditors to sell or convert a portion of their rescheduled debt. By the end of 1995-96 ECGD had successfully converted approximately &#163;70 million of debts owed to it by Egypt, Mozambique, Nigeria and Tanzania and in 1996-97 seven sales involving Nigerian and Tanzanian debt, to the value of &#163;20 million, were concluded. No sales were made in 1997-98 and 1998-99. (Source: Annual Report and Trading Accounts 1995-96 to 1998-99)

<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Figures for the United Kingdom's civil plutonium holdings are published by my Department each year and are placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The most recent were published on 21 June 1999 covering holdings at 31 December 1998.
<P>

<a name="00118w06.html_para0">The publication of these figures is in the format agreed by an informal group of nine countries, as part of the international guidelines on the management of national holdings of civil plutonium. This is a format which facilitates international comparisons on a consistent basis.
<P>

<a name="00118w06.html_para1">Information relating to exports and imports of plutonium is no longer published, but the figures for separated plutonium show both the holdings in the United Kingdom belonging to foreign bodies and the quantity of plutonium belonging to the United Kingdom which is held in locations in other countries as of 31 December each year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what consideration has been given in the WTO to extending the market access of Canadian chrysotile asbestos; and what is the United Kingdom's policy on this issue.  [104661]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 January 2000]:</i> Canada has brought dispute settlement action in the WTO to challenge the French ban on imports and use of chrysotile asbestos. A final report by the WTO Dispute Settlement Panel is expected in May. Since the French ban was introduced, the UK and the EU have conducted further scientific analysis and have also taken action to ban the import of chrysotile asbestos on health grounds. The UK action came into affect on 24 November 1999. The EU requires all member states to have similar action by 1 January 2005. A number of specialised safety-critical uses are temporarily permitted until safe substitutes have been developed.

<a name="00118w07.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Alasdair Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment he has made of the economic benefits which will accrue to each nation of the UK as a result of the England World Cup 2006 bid being successful; what account was taken of such an assessment in granting Government assistance to the England World Cup 2006 bid; and if he will make a statement.  [103752]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w07.html_spnew0"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 As the bid for the 2006 World Cup has been made by the English Football Association, and as all matches will be played in England if the bid is successful, no separate assessments of the economic benefits of holding the tournament in the Home Nations have been carried out. However, studies of the effects of major sports events held in the UK in the past strongly suggest that a successful bid will bring benefits to all parts of the UK. Sport England took account of these studies, together with analyses of the economic effects of previous World Cup tournaments, in considering its grant to the FA in support of the bid.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w07.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Alasdair Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what was the cost of Government expenditure and support since 1997, other than in grants and loans, for the England World Cup 2006 bid.  [103755]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w07.html_spnew1"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The Government are fully committed to supporting the Football Association's bid for the 2006 World Cup, and Sport England has earmarked &#163;3 million in grant-in-aid to the bid. Direct costs to the Government have arisen in respect of the previous Minister of Sport's visits to a number of countries in support of the bid. The cost of these visits was &#163;102,780, although some other Government business was also conducted. Mr. Banks's duties as Special Envoy to the bid have involved further overseas visits, the costs of which are principally being met by the FA and by sponsorship, although the Government are making a contribution to these costs.

 <i>[holding answer 10 January 2000]:</i> Sport England made an award of &#163;3 million in 1998 in respect of the Football Association's bid for the 2006 World Cup. In accordance with the Accounts Direction for Sport England's National Lottery Distribution Accounts, that award was reflected within the overall totals for grant commitments in the annual accounts for 1998-99. To date, Sport England has paid &#163;1,328,404 to the Football Association in respect of the bid. This and future payments in respect of the bid will be included in the overall totals of commitments met in Sport England's accounts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w07.html_spnew3"><B> Kate Hoey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 January 2000]:</i> While Sport England were satisfied that Wembley National Stadium Limited (WNSL) and the Football Association had complied with the technical requirements of the Lottery Funding Agreement, the solution for athletics was not ideal. The DLA Ellerbe Beckett report raised serious concerns about the proposed solution for athletics in terms of the practicality and cost. Further discussions between my Department and all interested parties concluded that athletics should be removed from Wembley.
<P>

<a name="00118w07.html_para0">Sport England, the Football Association and WNSL are currently considering whether amendments are necessary to the existing Lottery Funding Agreement to reflect Wembley's new role as the centrepiece for football and rugby league in England. In the light of the prospective agreement, the Football Association has proposed that &#163;20 million be returned to Sport England.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w07.html_spnew5"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 This Department has made no direct assessment of customer awareness of the London Pass or its uptake. However, we understand that there has been widespread national and international media coverage about the London Pass since its launch on 10 November last year. Information about the pass is also available through British Tourist Authority and London Tourist Board publicity. The pass is purchased from a private company and currently allows free entry to 43 attractions in the capital.
<P>

<a name="00118w07.html_para1">The producers of the pass predict first year sales figures of 100,000 and they say that advance sales are looking healthy. We hope that the pass will widen access to a range of attractions and leave visitors to London more satisfied and ready to return again.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Chris Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 January 2000]:</i> The Royal Opera House has cancelled nine performances of opera since the opening season was announced in January 1999. I understand the overall loss to the Royal Opera House of the nine cancelled performances is estimated at &#163;243,115 when the value of lost revenue is offset by savings in expenditure. The Royal Opera House's contingency budget will accommodate this loss.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w07.html_spnew7"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The majority of Government money specifically allocated to sport and active recreation is channelled through Sport England, an independent body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport which, within an overall policy framework set by the Department, dispenses these funds according to its own detailed policies and priorities.
<P>

<a name="00118w07.html_para2">Sport England is also responsible for overseeing the Sports Lottery Fund. Last year, it published its Lottery Strategy document which sets out the broad strategic framework within which it will distribute Lottery money to sport over the next ten years.

Sport England is taking forward further work to establish the viability of possible alternative venues although the final decision on timing and location of bids for the 2005 World Athletics Championship and a UK Olympic bid, rests with UK Athletics and the BOA respectively, Although a final decision has yet to be made and no options have been ruled out, both UK Athletics and the BOA consider that the strongest option for a successful bid would be to base it in London.

<a name="00118w08.html_para0">Relevant and reliable statistics will also form a useful base for the Cultural Strategies my Department is encouraging local authorities to produces.

 We envisage that a range of opportunities, including but not confined to adventure activities, will be made available to those 16-year-olds wishing to take part during the summer after their GCSEs, to help their transition between school and advanced study or work or training. The Department is working with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and with others, on how to take this initiative forward, including the matters mentioned by the hon. Member. We expect to make further announcements in due course.

 No assessment of the minimum number of sixth form students necessary for an 11 to 18 school effectively to implement the forthcoming reforms to post-16 qualifications has been made by my Department. A range of circumstances, of which student numbers is only one, will affect the ways in which schools and colleges implement the reforms. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has published detailed curriculum guidance on the reforms covering a range of relevant factors, including the size of the institution.

<P>
<a name="00118w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 We are creating a new service with a new vision to ensure that all young people have access to the support and guidance services they need, when and where they need it, co-ordinating the services currently provided by an array of different agencies concerned with different aspects of young people's lives. We expect that the best careers service companies, together with a range of other local partners, will play a major role in the new arrangements. At this stage no decision has been made regarding any assessment criteria. We shall be announcing shortly the key functions that we expect the new support service to perform and how we will involve major partners in developing and implementing the new service.

<P>
<a name="00118w08.html_wqn9"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will set out the rescheduled increase in employers' contributions for teachers' pensions in the next and future financial years, the actuarial basis of the calculation and the impact on the budget of each local education authority.  [105100]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 January 2000]:</i> The employer contribution rate for members of the teachers' pension scheme is currently 7.2 per cent. The rate from 1 April 2000 will be 7.4 per cent; from 1 April 2002 the rate will be 8.35 per cent.
<P>

<a name="00118w08.html_para1">The increase from 1 April 2000 is to fund improvements to scheme benefits which will be introduced from that date. The increase from 1 April 2002 is to eliminate the balance of liabilities identified by the Government Actuary's valuation of the scheme as at 31 March 1996. I shall shortly be laying before the House the Government Actuary's report on the valuation of the scheme.
<P>

<a name="00118w08.html_para2">Rescheduling the planned increase will reduce pressures on Local Education Authority budgets by &#163;90 million in 2000-01 and 2001-02. The reduced pressure for each Local Education Authority is as follows:

Delays have been caused partly by the need to change the requirement and Temporary Field Accommodation (TFA) camp build sequence to reflect the circumstances actually encountered on entry into Kosovo and partly by supply, communications, transport and technical problems experienced by the contractor. Improved tented camps have been made available which provide a good enhancement to accommodation standards. Under the TFA contract we are withholding a significant element of the payment for each camp pending completion and will seek liquidated damages where delay can be shown to be the fault of the contractor.

<a name="00118w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The SDR conducted a rigorous re-examination of our deterrence requirements. The Government have made it clear that we shall maintain the minimum credible nuclear deterrent while working towards the global elimination of nuclear weapons. The longer-term goals of arms control, non-proliferation and multilateral disarmament were advanced considerably by a range of SDR measures. In addition to announcing Trident as the UK's only nuclear weapon system, these included: a reduction in the number of warheads

deployed in each submarine; a significant reduction in the size of the UK's total nuclear weapon stockpile; the de-targeting of Trident missiles; having only one submarine on deterrent patrol, and the placing of the submarine on deterrent patrol at several days' notice to fire. These measures have all been introduced.
<P>

<a name="00118w10.html_para0">Following a trial period of moving towards single crewing of SSBNs, we have however decided to retain double crews. This decision reflects our determination, as part of our policy for people, to minimise the pressure on our service personnel and give them greater stability and time with their families.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w11.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Ruane: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what recent measures he has taken to stop bullying in the armed forces;  [105223]
<P>
<UL>(2) what percentage of armed forces personnel who have gone absent without leave gave bullying as the main reason for absconding in each of the last three years;  [105217]
<P>
(3) what is the recorded incidence of bullying in each branch of the armed forces for each of the past 10 years;  [105218]
<P>
(4) if he will publish a breakdown by regiment of incidents of bullying in each of the past 10 years;  [105219]
<P>
(5) if he will make it his policy to collate information on incidents of <i>(a)</i> racial, <i>(b)</i> sexual, <i>(c)</i> verbal and <i>(d)</i> physical bullying;  [105220]
<P>
(6) what help is offered to victims of bullying in the armed services;  [105221]
<P>
(7) how many armed forces personnel have been disciplined for bullying in each branch of the armed services for each of the last 10 years.  [105222]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 There is not a specific military offence of bullying in the Services.
<P>

<a name="00118w11.html_para0">Any information provided on reported incidents or complaints of bullying, or what is perceived as bullying by the victim, leading to personnel being subsequently charged with a disciplinary offence, is complicated by the number of different specific charge which could be more generally interpreted as bullying. Furthermore, not all disciplinary cases are processed through the Court-Martial system; some cases of a less serious nature might well be dealt with by a Commanding Officer summarily, and are only recorded on local personnel files. Each individual file would therefore need to be searched manually to provide appropriate data. This could be completed only at a disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="00118w11.html_para1">Similar difficulties apply in determining whether Service personnel go Absent Without Leave (AWOL) because of bullying. The only way to determine a cause for AWOL would be to examine every Service interview record following the return of an absentee. This could be completed only at a disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="00118w11.html_para2">The Services policy, which is promulgated to all personnel, is that bullying, or sexual and racial harassment, will not be tolerated. Furthermore, before enlistment procedures are carried out, recruits are made aware of the Services' policies on bullying and harassment. It is the responsibility of officers and senior ranks/rates to preserve good order and discipline at all times, and this is reinforced on the appropriate training 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jan 2000 : Column: 401W</I><P>
courses. All allegations of bullying or ill-treatment are investigated, and depending on the strength of the evidence, appropriate disciplinary action is taken against the perpetrators. The policy of zero tolerance towards bullying was re-emphasised when the new code of social conduct was issued to all personnel on 12 January 2000. All these measures are kept under review and re-focused as necessary.
<P>

<a name="00118w11.html_para3">Additionally, the Services have produced Equal Opportunities Directives and pamphlets, which emphasise that bullying, and racial or sexual harassment are unacceptable, and give guidance on making complaints.
<P>

<a name="00118w11.html_para4">Within the last 18 months, the Services have also set up confidential telephone helplines. The contact numbers are well publicised throughout the Services and are accessible to all personnel. While there is some difference in the methods of operation, the Services hope that personnel will use the helplines should they be subjected to harassment or bullying, or would welcome advice if they wish to discuss issues in complete confidence. All those in positions of authority have a responsibility for personnel under their command. Individuals can make

<P><I>18 Jan 2000 : Column: 402W</I><P>
their case known through the chain of command, direct, to their commanding officer, medical officer or padre if they do not feel that the initial support offered is adequate.
<P>

<a name="00118w11.html_para5">All three Services have been required, since December 1997, to record and submit quarterly returns to the Ministry of Defence detailing all formal complaints to the chain of command of sexual and racial discrimination and bullying. The details of each complaint record whether the specific complaint is physical or verbal in nature. There are some differences between the Services in the way that information is recorded, and some of the information requested is not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The information that is available is being collated. I will write to my hon. Friend and a copy of my letter will be placed in the House.

<P>

<a name="00118w12.html_para3">Through our bilateral contribution to UNRWA and our share of EU funding, we are the largest EU contributor to UNRWA, and the second largest contributor globally (second only to the US), so we make a very significant contribution to alleviating the condition of Palestinian refugees.

<a name="00118w12.html_para4">The status of Palestinian refugees is also of great importance, and among the main issues to be resolved in negotiations between the countries of the region.

<a name="00118w15.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how much his Department, its agencies and associated public bodies spent in total on extra bonuses above usual payments for staff working over the New Year period; what were the <i>(a)</i> maximum and <i>(b)</i> minimum bonuses paid; how many people received the (i) maximum and (ii) minimum payments; and if he will make a statement.  [104480]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No extra bonuses were paid to core-MAFF, Pesticides Safety Directorate, Veterinary Medicines Directorate, Farming and Rural Conservation Agency, Central Science Laboratory, Meat Hygiene Service, Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science and Intervention Board Executive Agency staff working over the New Year period. Staff working, or on-call, during this period received enhanced rates of overtime, travel time and on-call allowances. Claims are still being received and it is therefore not possible at this stage to say how many staff in total benefited from these arrangements.
<P>

<a name="00118w15.html_para3">The Veterinary Laboratory Agency also adopted the same arrangements but, in addition, paid a &#163;100 bonus to staff working between 11.00 pm on 31 December 1999 to 4.00 am on 1 January 2000. Again, claims are still being received and it is not possible at this stage to say how many staff in total benefited from the bonus payment.

 <i>[holding answer 13 January 2000]:</i> The possibility of interactions with other pesticides is considered before approval is given to a particular pesticide. Possible synergistic effects of the joint toxicity of pesticide active ingredients are addressed by requesting data on the toxicity of new pesticide products that contain more than one active ingredient.
<P>

<a name="00118w15.html_para4">The pesticide regulatory authorities have also examined more broadly the possibility of synergistic effects of pesticides several times. The Advisory Committee on Pesticides considered the matter in the early 1990s and advised that possible interactions of pesticides were at worst additive rather than synergistic. In 1994 MAFF commissioned a literature review of the possible synergistic effects of mixes of active ingredients. The results of this review supported the Advisory Committee's earlier conclusion.
<P>

<a name="00118w15.html_para5">More recently, the interaction between the effects of chemicals was also considered by the Department of Health's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment as part of their review of organophosphates. The Committee advised that interactions resulting from altered metabolism are, in general, only important at relatively high exposure levels, since at low levels there is usually sufficient metabolic capacity to cope with the multiple exposures with efficient detoxification and elimination of all compounds.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what recent assessment he has made of the safety of the additive beta carotene, with particular reference to the concentrations available in soft drink products.  [104529]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w15.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 January 2000]:</i> Beta carotene is naturally present in a wide variety of foods. It is also added to foods as a means of providing additional Vitamin A to consumers (it is converted to Vitamin A in the body). In addition, it may be used as a food colour.
<P>

<a name="00118w15.html_para6">There is no evidence that the amounts consumed by adults and children from food are harmful. However, the UK Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals will be reviewing the safety of this substance later this year as part of a wide ranging study of the safety of vitamins and minerals generally. In addition, the EU Scientific Committee for Food is currently considering the safety aspects of its use as a colour. Intakes from this latter source are however low compared to its use as a source of Vitamin A and its natural occurrence.

 The Meat Hygiene and Inspection Regulations provide for licences to be revoked for a number of different reasons. These include where premises either fail to comply with hygiene requirements or cease operating for commercial reasons; and where the nature of the business has changed. In Great Britain, 39 abattoirs and 58 cutting premises producing fresh meat or poultry meat had their licences revoked between 1 November 1998 and 30 October 1999. Details of licence revocations are published in the Meat Hygiene Enforcement Report, a copy of which is placed in the Library of the House each month.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, (1) pursuant to the answer of 8 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 541W, on GM crops, if he will identify the evidence with which he has been provided concerning the quantities of GM pollen found in honey, indicating that on which he bases his assessment that such quantities are very small;  [102841]

[102832]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w16.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 All GM crops intended for deliberate release in this country, and indeed in the rest of the European Community, are thoroughly assessed for human and environmental safety in accordance with the requirements of EC Directive 90/220 before they are allowed to be planted. This assessment, which is carried out in the UK by ACRE, includes the safety implications of any exposure to pollen through ingestion or inhalation.
<P>

<a name="00118w16.html_para0">The ACNFP considered the issue of GM pollen in honey at a workshop held in 1991 and concluded that the safeguards provided by ACRE and other Government advisory committees were adequate. The Committee also concluded that the ingestion of protein from pollen in honey was likely to be very small, typically around 0.00007 g to 0.003 g per day, and did not give rise to any health concerns. A copy of the 1991 and 1992 ACNFP Annual Reports which contain the conclusions of this workshop are available in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="00118w16.html_para1">Since then, the Laboratory of the Government Chemist has undertaken research on the pollen content of honey, at MAFF's request, and has confirmed that levels of GM protein are likely to be several orders of magnitude lower than previously thought. It estimated that consumers would ingest at most no more than 30 picogrammes (0.00000000003 g) to 5 nanogrammes (0.000000005 g) of transgenic protein in every 500 g of honey. The report of this research has been available in the MAFF Library since its completion but I am now arranging for it to be deposited in the Library of the House. In addition to this work, the British Honey Importers and Packers Association report on their website that they have found no traces of GM material in any of the honey they have tested to date. As a result of all these findings we see no reason to undertake an economic analysis of the impact of United Kingdom honey containing GM pollen on the British beekeeping and honey industry.
<P>

<a name="00118w16.html_para2">My noble Friend the Minister of State (Baroness Hayman) has not held consultations with consumers or beekeepers on the acceptability of traces of GM pollen in honey, however, officials hold regular meetings with representatives from the beekeeping industry and honey producers and importers to discuss issues of mutual concern including the development of GM crops. The last such meeting took place on 10 November.
<P>

<a name="00118w16.html_para3">The ACNFP has an independent member, representing consumer interests, who would be consulted on any changes to the Committee's view on the acceptability of traces of GM pollen in honey. Consumers' organisations, along with other interested parties, were consulted on the recent EC proposals to introduce a threshold of 1 per cent. for the adventitious contamination of non GM soya and maize, in respect of the labelling of food and food ingredients.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans are in place to cope with a possible increase in respiratory-associated illnesses in elderly people this winter.  [104165]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Local Winter Planning Groups (LWPG) were established in April 1999 to co-ordinate the planning and provision of health and social care services over the winter and the millennium. Each LWPG includes health authorities, social services, National Health Service trusts, primary care groups, out-of-hours and deputising services, NHS Direct, police and fire services, the voluntary and private sector, community health councils and other local authority departments.
<P>

<a name="00118w16.html_para4">As part of the planning process LWPG's were required to submit robust plans at the end of September 1999 setting out how services would respond to increased winter demand including that linked to respiratory- associated illnesses. The plans, which were assessed by the NHS regional offices, together with visits to a number of health authorities, showed a high state of readiness for the winter.
<P>

<a name="00118w16.html_para5">Many viruses contribute to respiratory-associated illness in older people in the winter and influenza is the only one we have an effective vaccine against. In 1998, we extended the annual immunisation programme for influenza to offer free flu vaccine to everyone aged 75 and over. Flu immunisation was well publicised. The Chief Medical Officer launched "Flu Awareness Week" at a press conference in October which resulted in widespread media coverage and provided a useful opportunity to get 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jan 2000 : Column: 420W</I><P>
key messages across. Many health authorities also took an active role in promoting flu immunisation locally last year.
<P>

<a name="00118w16.html_para6">Also, as part of planning for this winter, NHS Trust have arrangements in place to provide more intensive care and high dependency beds than ever before.
<P>

<a name="00118w16.html_para7">Informing the public of the range of healthcare options available and encouraging them to use the appropriate service has also been a key component of planning for the winter. General campaigns of particular relevance to older people have been: "Keep Warm, Keep Well" which provides advice to older and other vulnerable people on how to keep themselves and their homes warm in winter and "Choose the Right Remedy this Winter" which encourages the public to consider all the options open to them when they are unwell such as self care, pharmacy, and NHS Direct.
<P>

<a name="00118w16.html_para8">The NHS and local authorities have planned well for this winter and the current peaks in demand are being managed.

<P>
<a name="00118w17.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 No specific guidance has been issued. However, an analysis of the research into the relationship between bed occupancy and the management of elective and emergency pressures was set out in the first report of the Emergency Services Action Team in 1997, and referred to in subsequent ESAT reports. The report was published under cover of an Executive Letter (MISC 97/62), which followed the guidance on Access to Secondary Care Services set out in Executive Letter (EL97/42). Copies of the reports and both ELs are in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) if paragraph 30 of the Local Government Ombudsman's report 98/B/0341 setting out the Department's view in March 1997 on section 117 of the Mental Health Act 1983 still represents the Department's view;  [104988]

(3) from what date he determined that local authorities should not charge for residential services under section 117 of the Mental Health Act 1983.  [104987]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 There are no provisions in the Mental Health Act 1983 to charge for after-care services provided under section 117. The Act does not specify which services should be provided for a patient who qualifies for after-care under section 117. In the absence of case law on this subject before the High Court's ruling on 28 July 1999, there has been variation in practice between local authorities on the issue of whether residential care provided for patients who qualify for after-care under section 117 was considered to be provided under section 117 or under other statutes.
<P>

<a name="00118w17.html_para1">The Department has not issued formal guidance on this issue but advice in response to questions on this point has consistently been that, where residential care is provided as part of a package of services under section 117, then it should not be charged for. This is in line with paragraph 30 of the Local Ombudsman's report 98/B/0341 in so far as it deals with not charging for section 117 after-care services. The Department does not have information about which local authorities currently charge for such services.

 The Medicine Control Agency investigates cases referred to it of alleged breaches of medicines legislation arising from the internet. It works closely with the European Union and international regulatory and enforcement bodies and will continue to do so. The European Commission has established a group to consider the impact of e-commerce in pharmaceuticals on the existing safeguards to patients. The United Kingdom will be playing an active role in its deliberations.

<a name="00118w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Guidance issued by the Department to health authorities in 1995 set out a national framework against which health authorities, in consultation with local authorities, were required to review their existing arrangements for continuing health care and to draw up local policies and eligibility criteria for individual case decisions about the need for National Health Service funded care. This includes the range, location and level of services which will be arranged and funded by the NHS to meet continuing health care needs in their area.

<a name="00118w17.html_para6">Local authority social services have always had a very important role in supporting people, either in their own homes or in residential care. Where a person is provided with nursing home or residential care accommodation by a local authority under Part III of the National Assistance Act 1948, section 22 of that Act provides for them to be charged for the accommodation.

2. Numbers for 2003-04 and 2008-09 have been rounded to the nearest 0.1 million. Numbers for later years are rounded to the nearest 0.5 million.<P>

3. Figures include people who would receive State Second Pension payments as well as those receiving contracted-out pensions where they have benefited from higher contracted-out rebates than would have applied under SERPS.<P>

4. The figures exclude those higher earning individuals who are contracted-out and whose rebates would be the same under State Second Pension as under SERPS, since such individuals would not benefit from awards of State Second Pension, nor would they gain from any increase in contracted-out rebates.<P>

 The administration costs for making winter fuel payments this winter (1999-2000) were in the region of &#163;14 million.
<P>

<a name="00118w19.html_para1">To ensure that pensioners were not worried about turning up their heating this winter it was necessary to inform them of the increase in the amount of the payments and to remind them that they were on their way. This required a major publicity campaign--the costs of which were in the region of &#163;620,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) if he will place in the Library a copy of the legal advice he received that clause 49 of the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights under the Human Rights Act 1998;  [104991]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will set out the basis for his statement that clause 49 of the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights under the Human Rights Act 1998.  [104990]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00118w19.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The proposals in clause 49 are compatible with UK obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. In arriving at this conclusion we have considered a number of issues, which are discussed below.
<P>

<a name="00118w19.html_para2">The obligations under Article 6 of the Convention (the right to a fair trial) are complied with as those affected by this measure will have a right of appeal to an independent tribunal in respect of the decision to withdraw or reduce benefits and the magistrates or Crown Court will establish the facts of the alleged breach, as now.
<P>

<a name="00118w19.html_para3">Article 7 (no punishment without law) does not arise as the measure (even if it was regarded as criminal in nature) will only apply to those given community sentences after this Bill has become law and been commenced. There will be no retrospection.




<P>
<P><I>18 Jan 2000 : Column: 429W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00118w19.html_para4">Although the exchange of information between the Probation Service and the Benefits Agency may raise issues under Article 8, on privacy, the exchange proposed is the minimum necessary to achieve the legitimate aims of matching benefit rights to responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="00118w19.html_para5">In considering any question in relation to Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination) these proposals are to be seen as part of the reform of the welfare state on the basis of a contract between the citizen and the state, whereby rights to benefits and responsibilities to society are more closely linked. Our concern is not only to achieve better compliance with community sentences, but to reflect the view that it is not fair that offenders who breach community sentences should have the same rights to benefits as those who comply. People who do comply would not lose financially, nor would those who claim no rights to benefits. Benefits are conditional on the fulfilment of responsibilities to society. It therefore does not breach Article 14 by any unjustified different treatment of those on benefits compared with others. Any different treatment as may arise is justified as it has an objective aim that is in the public interest, as set out above.
<P>

<a name="00118w19.html_para6">Article 1 of the First Protocol (protection of property) does not apply to all Social Security benefits, although contributory Jobseeker's Allowance may be regarded as a "possession" for the purposes of this Article. This proposal to withdraw benefit in these limited and specified circumstances is justifiable as it is in the public interest, striking a fair balance between the interests of the community and those of the individual, and will be provided for by law.
<P>

<a name="00118w19.html_para7">The advice tendered by our legal advisers is internal policy advice and is not normally disclosed under Exemption 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what recent discussions he has had with the Chancellor of the Exchequer regarding the continued rise in petrol prices in rural Wales.  [105569]<P>

<a name="00118w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 I met my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss a range of issues. As part of his pre-Budget Report late last year, he announced that the fuel duty escalator would be scrapped, which means that in future there will no longer be automatic rises in fuel prices but the appropriate level of fuel duties will be set on a Budget by Budget basis. Revenues from any increases in fuel duties over and above inflation will go straight to a ring-fenced fund for improving public transport and improving the road network.
