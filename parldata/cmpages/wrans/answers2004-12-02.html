<p><a name="41202w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent discussions he has had with European Union counterparts about the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;allocation and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;delivery of EU aid to third world countries; and if he will make a statement. [200719]</p>




<p><a name="41202w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 On 23&nbsp;November, the Secretary of State attended the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels, which discussed both the issues of aid allocation and its delivery.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41202w01.html_para0">
DFID continues to work for agreement that a much larger share of EC aid of higher quality should be allocated to low income countries where it will have the greatest impact on poverty reduction. Over the past two years, EC spending has been moving in the right direction, with 56&nbsp;per cent. of aid being spent in low-income countries in 2003. A further re-balancing of aid is required if the Millennium Development Goals are to be met and the UK has called for the EC to spend 70&nbsp;per cent. of its aid in low-income countries by 2008. This proportion would still recognise the needs of the poor in middle-income countries. It remains clear from the Council discussion that a number of other member states do not subscribe to this view. After a discussion, the Council Conclusions invited the Commission to find ways to increase focus on the poorest, with a specific focus on Africa.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41202w01.html_para1">
EC aid has gone through serious reforms since it launched its reform programme back in 2000. DFID welcomes this and recognises important progress in terms of speedier delivery, more local capacity in the field and improved portfolio performance overall. Current reforms have focused on qualitative improvements. DFID believes there is a case for continuing reforms also under the new Commission, but with a focus on quality and impact of EC aid. The 23&nbsp;November Council called upon the new Commission to undertake an assessment of EC External Assistance and to identify what follow up to the Reform Process is required focusing on quality, impact and results.

<p><a name="41202w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 DFID recognises that the reform of the EU sugar regime will have a significant impact on the sugar industry in Jamaica and the Caribbean, and hence on many communities already among the poorest in the region.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41202w01.html_para5">
The impact of EU reform will vary between countries, and will depend crucially on the policies that Caribbean countries adopt with regard to their sugar industries. The Government of Jamaica are bringing together representatives of the Government, the sugar industry, academia, trade unions, and other civil society organizations to identify possible future scenarios for Jamaica&#039;s agricultural sector. The exercise will develop a relevant and practical action plan for the future, which will be passed to the Government of Jamaica for consideration and action.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41202w01.html_para6">
The impact of EU reform will also depend on the transitional assistance available. On a parallel track, DFID is working to ensure that the EU offers the most effective possible package of transitional assistance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41202w01.html_para7">
In order to help inform the debate and ensure the impact on developing countries is taken sufficiently into consideration, DFID commissioned a study last year with LMC International and Oxford Policy Management, &#039;Addressing the Impact of Preference Erosion in Sugar on Developing Countries&#039;. The study is divided into two sections. The first part assesses the economic and social impact on the African, Caribbean and Pacific Countries (ACP) Sugar Protocol countries of the various reform scenarios suggested by the European Commission. The second part of the study assesses alternative options for addressing the impact of

preference erosion in sugar. The purpose of this analysis was to identify various options for debate by the ACP and the EU.

DFID has recently commissioned two further pieces of work on this issue: from LMC International, &#039;EU Sugar Reform: the Implications for the Development of Least Developed Countries (LDC)s&#039; and from the Overseas Development Institute: &#039;Forthcoming changes in EU sugar/banana markets: a menu of options for an effective EU transitional assistance package&#039;. This latter report should help those countries affected by reform determine their priorities for a transitional package. It also includes some analysis of alternative uses for sugar.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41202w01.html_para9">
DFID is now following up this work by commissioning a series of country profiles for those Caribbean countries that will be affected by the change in the EU trade regime. The principle objective of these profiles is to identify a specific menu of options for an effective competitive fund package, which addressees the impact of sugar reform at both the national and the household level.

<a name="41202w02.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Snow Cover (Everest/Nepal)</h3>


<p><a name="41202w02.html_wqn0"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Developmentwhat estimate he has made of the percentage of snow cover on Mount Everest in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;1953, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;1983 and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;2003; and what assessment he has made of the impact on Nepal of changes in the level of snow cover. [200691]</p>




<p><a name="41202w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 Quantifying the change in percentage snow-cover on Mount Everest from 1953 to 2003 is difficult because there have been few surveys of the mountain&#039;s snow-covered area over the period in question and none of these surveys has been continual. DFID has recently funded a research project on Snow and Glacier Aspects of Water Resources Management in the Himalayas, 2001&#150;2004 (SAGARMATHA) that undertook analysis of temperature data and developed a predictive model to assess impacts of changes. The analysis revealed a trend of increasing annual average temperature between 1961&#150;1996 of around +0.07o C/year across Nepal, while data from the 15 highest gauges for the period 1976&#150;96, at elevations of between 1800 and 4100 metres, showed an upward trend of +0.1o C/year. If maintained, such trends will cause the snow-covered area in the Nepal Himalaya to recede.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41202w02.html_para0">
Photographs taken of the mountain since the 1950s, and other anecdotal evidence, do suggest a general reduction both in the snow-covered area and the spatial extent of the mountain&#039;s glaciers, but with the snow-covered area varying within each year and from year to year; it is not possible to provide definitive figures from these for the percentage change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41202w02.html_para1">
The impacts of a reduced snow-covered area are many. There is a greater tendency for glaciers to retreat resulting in glacial lakes being formed behind unstable moraine dams. Consequently a build-up of melt-water and/or glacier surges behind these structures increases the threat of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), several of which have been reported in Nepal. The reduction in snow and ice cover also has potential impacts on water resources availability and use downstream: it is likely to lead to a temporary increase 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Dec 2004 : Column 187W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
followed, ultimately, by a reduction in river flows. Increased river flows, resulting from more glacial ice being exposed for melting, could increase the incidence of flooding and landslides; whereas reduced river flows, as the glacial ice disappears, could affect agricultural productivity, fisheries, hydropower generation, industry, domestic water supply, and transportation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41202w02.html_para2">
The SAGARMATHA project sought to quantify the timing and extent of these impacts across the Himalayan region. It concluded that, while glaciers were retreating throughout the Himalaya, the threat to future water availability was greatest in the west. In the eastern Himalaya changes in the melt-water from glaciers has a relatively small effect. The project&#039;s models forecast that flows in eastern Nepal would gradually increase for several decades but would eventually diminish. In the west, river flows were forecast to diminish rapidly over the next few decades, which will be a concern for both India and Pakistan.

<p><a name="41202w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas  </b> 
<i>[holding reply 29&nbsp;November 2004]</i>: The Department for International Development (DFID) works with its partners to support governments to achieve the Millennium development goals, including the water and sanitation goals. Where appropriate, DFID provides Poverty Reduction Budgetary Support, which helps countries implement their Poverty Reduction Strategies. Poverty Reduction Strategies are produced following a consultation process within the country concerned, and between governments and donors. Water and sanitation are a key part of these discussions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41202w02.html_para3">
Where DFID does not provide all or any of its assistance through Poverty Reduction Budgetary Support, DFID may work with others towards sector wide approaches in water and sanitation. This will depend on the specific situation in a country, including whether water and sanitation are agreed priorities for DFID support. DFID is also promoting improved donor co-ordination in the water and sanitation sector, under the European Union Water Initiative.

 Under the Licensing Act 2003 the maximum fine for selling alcohol to an individual aged under 18 will increase to a maximum of &#163;5,000 (level 5 on the standard scale). This is an increase on the maximum penalty available under the Licensing Act 1964, which is a fine of &#163;1,000 (level 3 on the standard scale). Furthermore, on convicting a personal licence holder for such an offence (or a range of offences set out in the 2003 Act), the court will have the power to order the forfeiture of the personal licence or its suspension for up to six months. Also, an application for a personal licence could be refused because the applicant has such a conviction. In addition, such a conviction could jeopardise an application for the renewal of a personal licence. By contrast, under current law, the holder of a justices&#039; licence may have his licence declared forfeit by the court only on conviction for a second offence under certain provisions of the 1964 Act. The 2003 Act is being brought into force in stages and it is planned that the sentencing provisions referred to above would be in force from November 2005.

Thus, although use of locking devices can prevent loss of wheel nuts the devices cannot counteract a loss of clamp force, and excessive wear as a consequence of this could result in loss of a wheel while nuts were still attached.

<p><a name="41202w06.html_wqn0"><b> Clive Efford: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what recent performance improvements have been achieved by South Eastern Trains; and if he will make a statement.  [201802]</p>




<p><a name="41202w06.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Since South Eastern Trains (SET) franchise began operating on 9&nbsp;November 2003 performance has been improving. At that time the yearly average number of SET services arriving on time was 79.4&nbsp;per cent. Performance figures change from month to month. The most recently published figures cover the year to June 2004, and show that SET performance has risen to 80.8&nbsp;per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41202w06.html_para0">
This improvement of 1.4&nbsp;per cent. points is marginally better than the improvement of 1.3&nbsp;per cent. points across the South East sector as a whole. Over the same period, sector performance improved from 79.3&nbsp;per cent. punctuality in November last year to 80.6&nbsp;per cent. in June 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41202w06.html_para1">
By way of comparison, performance on South West Trains (SWT) and Southern, the other two big south of London commuter operators, also improved over this period. SWT&#039;s yearly average was 73.7&nbsp;per cent. at 9&nbsp;November 2003 and rose to 74.5&nbsp;per cent. in the year to June 2004. Southern performance rose from 78.2&nbsp;per cent. to 79.5&nbsp;per cent. over the same time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41202w06.html_para2">
The overall increase in punctuality for SET is driven by two factors: a reduction in the delays caused by Network Rail&#039;s infrastructure operation and maintenance of around 2&nbsp;per cent.; and a comparable reduction in knock-on delays caused to SET services by other train operators.

These improvements have been delivered in particular through increased child benefit and the introduction of tax credits. In 2001, 11,280 families in Lewisham Deptford benefited from the increases in child benefit, 1,729 working families also benefited from working families tax credit or disabled person&#039;s tax credit and 3,700 non-working families benefited from the child allowances in income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance. In 2004, 10,915 families benefited from child benefit, of these 6,000 also benefited from more than the family element of child tax credit and 1,800 benefited from the family element of child tax credit.</p>

There is no provision to allow the splitting of payments.

The Government have an ambitious long-term goal to eradicate child poverty by 2020, and have a PSA target to halve it by 2010. To meet this challenging target it is necessary to focus financial support in a way which enables the parent with main responsibility for the child to provide for the child&#039;s needs. Child poverty groups support this approach. Splitting tax credits and benefits could have far reaching risks and consequences.

 The Department is aware of the current capacity difficulties in paediatric pathology in the south-west of England, and is reassured that the local health community is taking steps to resolve them.

These include the international fellowships programme, the histopathology training schools scheme and the conversion fellowships scheme. The latter is an innovative initiative to enable existing consultant histopathologists to re-train as paediatric pathologists.
