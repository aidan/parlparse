 Members and their staff do have the rights necessary to install their own software on their parliamentary computers. Members are responsible for the licensing and maintenance of any software that they install and, as the conditions of supply provide, PICT reserves the right to remove any software that is found to interfere with the proper operation of the hardware concerned, or the parliamentary network. This applies to encryption software. However, extra caution is needed with this type of product since, by its nature, it can prevent access and therefore could severely limit PICT&#146;s ability to provide support after it has been installed.</p>

Therefore, this product is not recommended for users of that service. As part of the evaluation PICT has identified another product that can be deployed to Members&#146; loaned machines by PICT at no cost to Members. The software can also be acquired by Members at their own cost, if they wish to have it installed on machines that they have purchased through PICT.</p>

 Disposing of portable batteries and accumulators can have a detrimental impact on the environment and on public and animal health.

 The rural payments agency (RPA) publish comprehensive guidance about the scheme on their website, including information for prospective applicants. DEFRA, in conjunction with the devolved administrations and with the industry itself, has drawn up a national strategy in order to provide detailed advice that producer organisations (POs) can adopt with the aim of developing their businesses and gaining funding under the scheme. One of its aims is that this advice will encourage more growers to seek recognition under the scheme, either as new POs or as new members of existing ones. More generally, it is one of DEFRA&#146;s aims to encourage greater collaboration across the food chain.

 The Environment Agency&#146;s inspection regime for those scrap metal sites which require an environmental permit is determined by an Operator Pollution Risk Appraisal (OPRA), which assesses the environmental risks and hazards posed by and associated with an activity and how well they are being managed. Those scrap metal sites which qualify for an exemption from the need for an environmental permit are inspected on an annual basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="90302w0003.htm_para6"><a name="09030213000418">Between April and December 2008, 97 scrap metal and end of life vehicles sites were subject to intervention by the Environment Agency including enforcement. This included shutting 78 sites down and bringing 19 sites into compliance. Sites which represent the highest environmental risk are dealt with as a matter of priority. During 2008, the Environment Agency carried out 14 prosecutions against operators treating, keeping, or storing waste illegally or breaching permit conditions involving metals and end of life vehicles only.</p>

 Information about English local housing authorities&#146; actions under the homelessness legislation (part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected quarterly at local authority level. Data collected include the number of households accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty (to secure that suitable accommodation is available). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="90302w0004.htm_para5"><a name="09030213000470">Information on the number of dependent children (and expected children) in bed-and-breakfast style temporary accommodation (i.e. bed-and-breakfast hotels and other privately managed shared facility annexes) is reported quarterly by local authorities as at the last day of each quarter. This figure includes all children under 16 years old, and dependent children aged 16 to 18. On the 30 September 2008, there were an estimated 1,570 dependent children in bed-and-breakfast style temporary accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="90302w0004.htm_para6"><a name="09030213000471">We have taken action to tackle the worst aspects of temporary accommodation use&#151;families with children who were placed in cramped bed-and-breakfast accommodation for long periods of time. The effect of the Homelessness (Suitability of Accommodation) (England) Order 2003, which came into force on 1 April 2004, is that local authorities are no longer able to discharge their homelessness duty to secure suitable accommodation by placing households that include children or a pregnant woman in bed-and-breakfast accommodation except as a last resort and then for no longer than six weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="90302w0004.htm_para7"><a name="09030213000472">Furthermore, in 2005, we announced a target of reducing the number of households in temporary accommodation under the homelessness legislation. Following 12 consecutive quarters of decreases, the figure had fallen to 72,130 by the end of September 2008, and around 40 per cent. of local authorities have already met the target to halve the number of households in temporary accommodation by 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="90302w0004.htm_para8"><a name="09030213000473">We have provided over &#163;200 million of homelessness funding to local authorities and the voluntary sector, to help them carry out this work.</p>

 In common with the normal practice of the Department, we do not keep a record of time spent on specific policies and projects, so it is not possible to provide an estimate of official time spent on the eco-towns project since 23 July 2007.

 We continue to operate the Overseas Price Mechanism internally to maintain the purchasing power of our overseas posts&#146; local budgets. The decline in the value of the sterling created a potential funding pressure of &#163;60 million in the 2008-09 financial year (as of December 2008). At current exchange rates we expect an additional pressure of up to &#163;30 million to continue our activities at current levels in 2009-10. This does not include the pressure on international subscriptions and peacekeeping. The impact of this shortfall has been minimised through delayed activity, by making additional efficiency savings, and implementing a strategy of forward purchasing of foreign exchange.</p>

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has a Travel Advice line (0845 850 28290). The line offers an alternative method for accessing the same travel advice available on the FCO website. In the last six months, 2,642,989 people accessed FCO Travel Advice from the website, 52,251 used the Travel Advice phone line. Calls are charged at the standard rate from a British Telecom line (up to 5p/m) and the FCO receives no financial benefit from the arrangement. We are committed to providing the best possible service to British nationals seeking advice on living and travelling abroad and as part of this ongoing process the introduction of an 03 number will be considered as part of this year&#146;s Review of Consular Services.</p>

 It is my practice to write to the appropriate hon. Member when this service is made available in his or her constituency. Planning permission is not required and there is no formal period for representations. For the most part the houses used for this service are leased, not purchased, by the contractor. The houses are the private rented homes of those living in them and it is not appropriate to consult local residents or the wider public. People bailed by the courts or released from prison return to live in the community without hon. Members or the public having any input as to where they may reside. It would be inappropriate and inequitable to identify as defendants or offenders those living at an address rented through ClearSprings when others on bail and home detention curfew living at private addresses are not subject to such identification. The contractor does consult the police, local authority and probation about the location of properties and they are provided with the opportunity to provide comments.</p>

 Rehabilitation may be a long and complex process and it is not always possible to determine when it is complete.

 There are no such plans. The Government believe it is for political parties to decide how to conduct their fundraising activities within the legislative framework. One potential option to change the legislative framework would be to introduce a cap on the level of permissible donations, and an associated increase in the amount of public funding available to parties. This option was put to the major political parties following the review conducted by Sir Hayden Phillips in 2007. However, the inter-party talks that followed that review did not result in agreement to proceed with the wider package of reforms that Sir Hayden recommended to the party funding legislation.</p>

The Government believe that any arrangements for increased public funding and associated cap on donations would need to be considered carefully as part of a wider public debate. There would need to be clear support from both the public and political parties before such steps could be taken. It is not clear that such a broad consensus of support currently exists. However, the Government stands ready to continue that debate.</p>

 There has been no formal assessment of this overlap. However, research to estimate digital satellite coverage was carried out by Ofcom&#146;s predecessor, the Independent Television Commission, in 1999.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="90302w0012.htm_para12"><a name="09030237000449">This research arrived at the 98 per cent. coverage figure which found that the main contributory factor which resulted in 2 per cent. of households being unable to receive any satellite signals was man-made obstructions in built-up areas. For terrestrial transmission, the opposite situation to satellite applies, with transmitters located so as to serve population centres. The locations not covered by these transmitters are largely in remote, sparsely populated areas. This means that the overlap between the 2 per cent. for satellite and 1.5 per cent. for terrestrial digital TV should be very small.</p>

Those in receipt of pension credit and disability living allowance are not included in these estimates as the Christmas bonus hierarchy makes payments to recipients of these benefits first.<br>

2. Changes to Jobcentre Plus vacancy handling procedures have led to a major discontinuity in the vacancy statistics pre- and post- May 2006. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br>
3. These are not whole economy figures. Coverage relates just to vacancies notified to Jobcentre Plus and as such represent a market share of vacancies throughout the whole economy. This proportion varies over time, according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer, and by local area. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>

<i> [holding answer 23 February 2009]:</i><i> </i>A cadre of skilled and capable personal advisers will be absolutely essential to effectively implement the Progression to Work model. The Department made clear in its recent discussion document &#147;Realising Potential: developing personalised conditionality and support&#148; that it will be necessary to think through the implications for the adviser role and implement a workforce development strategy within Jobcentre Plus. This is an issue we will discuss in detail with stakeholders. As such no final decisions have yet been made on the grading or number of personal advisers necessary to deliver the Progression to Work pathfinders. However all Jobcentre Plus personal advisers are currently band C grade staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="90302w0023.htm_para0"><a name="09030250000471">The cost of the new Progression to Work pathfinders will depend on precisely what the personalised conditionality and work-related activity looks like. At this stage therefore, costs are uncertain. The impact assessment associated with the White Paper &#147;Raising Expectations and Increasing Support&#151;reforming welfare for the future&#148; estimated that the increase in work-focused interviews and provision to support work and skills-related activity could cost up to an extra &#163;20 million a year for parents with younger children. For employment and support allowance customers we are still working through the detailed design of the policy and assessing the appropriate balance between Jobcentre Plus and providers. Additional costs will be met from within the current agreed Department spending plans.</p>

 The new secondary curriculum has a range of opportunities for schools to teach about animal welfare. Citizenship helps young people to consider a wide range of political, social, ethical and moral issues. Pupils should also be taught about the way in which the environment and living things need protection. In personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE education), pupils learn that people and other living things have needs, and that they have responsibilities to meet them. Teachers have the freedom and flexibility to decide how to teach the curriculum and what activities best suits the needs of their learners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="90302w0025.htm_para0"><a name="09030250000752">To support and inspire all schools to harness the full potential of the living world as a cross-curricular teaching and learning resource, both within and beyond the school grounds the Department funds the Growing Schools programme. It focuses on farming, as well as food and environmental issues, and on ensuring pupils are given first hand, practical experience in the outdoor classroom. Through Growing Schools the Department supports the school farms network which offers support and assistance to school farms through materials and CPD.</p>

For &#145;end user&#146; the emissions are reallocated from the production and distribution of energy to the users of that energy. The main difference between source and end user emissions comes from the treatment of emissions from combustion of fossil fuels, the largest source of carbon dioxide in most countries. To derive emissions by end user, emissions from power stations and other fuel processing industries have been re-allocated to end users on an approximate basis according to their use of the fuel. Emissions by end user are subject to more uncertainty than emissions by source and should only be used to give a broad indication of emissions by sector.</p>

 The Department do not have a target to provide free loft insulation to pensioners over 70. However, the Government do have an ambition to help all households meet their energy efficiency potential by 2020, where practical. As a key contribution, we have set the major energy suppliers ambitious household carbon saving targets, which they meet through promoting subsidised energy efficiency measures. 40 per cent. of their targets have to be met in a priority group of vulnerable households on qualifying benefits and aged 70 and over. Currently, all six obligated suppliers offer priority group households free loft insulation and cavity wall insulation, where none exists, subject to a survey of the property. Under the supplier obligation, around 1.5 million priority group households have received loft insulation since the scheme first began in April 2002.</p>

Clearly, we will need to explore whether these companies and other employers, both large and small, across the public, private and third sectors can do more to help us provide extra places. Our national advertising campaign which started this week and the new National Apprenticeship Service will promote the value of apprenticeships to employers to ensure we deliver jobs and training for young people and adults.

 Career development loans (CDLs) are a successful GB wide programme administered by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to help individuals invest in their future by financing vocational learning of their choice.

Expanded and rebranded professional and career development loans (PCDLs), which will be available for courses starting in September 2009, will offer reduced headline interest rates and allow for loans up to &#163;10,000. PCDLs will help more people seeking professional and technical qualifications get on the right track in their career, and help those who have been made redundant retrain.</p>

 The Department, through the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), has provided significant funding to higher education institutions (HEIs) to support staff and student volunteering&#151;&#163;52 million up to 2008-09 under the HE Active Community Fund (HEACF) and the Teaching Quality Enhancement Fund. The funding has now been mainstreamed and the intention is that institutions will decide how they continue to support student/staff volunteering through their block grants.</p>

HEFCE provided HEIs with guidance in support of this funding stream.</p>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV - for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>

Additional measures to reduce the burden on personnel include: reducing the level on non-operational tasking and ensuring all deployments are essential; regularly reviewing the scale and mix of personnel deployed; increasing recruitment and training; and providing financial and non-financial incentives including retention bonuses for certain trades or specialisations that are experiencing shortfalls and continuance of Service beyond the end of engagements.

 The 2008-09 MOD Spring Supplementary Estimates requested &#163;170 million of net additional resources for non-cash Annually Managed Expenditure (AME). This covers a &#163;200 million impairment charge due to the downward revaluation of land and buildings (reflecting current UK property market conditions); and also the downward revaluation of land and buildings planned for disposal by Defence Estates. The Defence Estates total holding of land and buildings is currently valued at &#163;20 billion.

 Since 2000 the following incidents involving submerged royal navy submarines have taken place: HMS Superb in May 2008, HMS Tireless in 2003, HMS Trafalgar in 2002 and HMS Triumph in November 2000. HMS Tireless hit an iceberg while on Arctic patrol. The remainder were all grounding incidents. All the vessels, apart from HMS Superb, which was decommissioned in October 2008, were repaired and returned to service.</p>

 No. While the duration of the Mutual Defence Agreement (MDA) was extended by another 10 years (to 2014) in 2004, no extension to its scope was made then or since. In my reply to an earlier question by the hon. Member on 4 November 2008, <i> Official Report</i>, column 308W, I confirmed that following the exchange of letters between the then Prime Minister and the then US President in December 2006, enhanced collaborations are taking place between the United Kingdom and the United States under the MDA in support of the UK&#146;s nuclear stockpile stewardship programme and which contribute to the ongoing review of warhead options announced in the 2006 White Paper&#151;&#147;The Future of the United Kingdom&#146;s Nuclear Deterrent (CMD 6994)&#148;.</p>

 There are a number of similarities in approach between the Atomic Weapons Establishment and their counterparts in the United States national laboratories. These include the management of research, the assessment of technology readiness, and the fundamentals of science-based stockpile stewardship in the absence of underground nuclear tests. However, our warheads are based on a wholly UK design and differ from US warheads in a number of areas.</p>

It does not incorporate the results of subsequent investigations and therefore does not differentiate between what might later prove to have been a problem caused by operator error or damage sustained as a result of operations. Nor does this data record the severity of a failure which might have no discernible impact on operational capability or safety.</p>
