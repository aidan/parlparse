 Compulsory set-aside (the obligation for farmers to take a percentage of agricultural land out of production) was abolished in 2008. The Campaign for the Farmed Environment was launched in 2009 as an alternative to regulation, allowing farmers to voluntarily implement changes in farming practice that will recapture the environmental benefits formerly provided by set-aside land. It is due to run until July 2012.</p>

I want the Campaign to be a success and do not believe that Government should need to regulate and impose more red tape; if the farming community can achieve the same results through its own actions. But if the farming community cannot step up and achieve these results voluntarily, the. Government will have to consider a compulsory approach to deliver the same level of environmental benefits.</p>

                        <i>[holding answer 7 March 2011]:</i>I have made clear that tackling discards must be a priority for common fisheries policy (CFP) reform, and I am delighted that at the high level meeting on discards the EU Commission, and other members states, were able to agree on this too. At the event, the UK, Germany, France and Denmark also took the step of signing a declaration calling for serious reform of the CFP, making the reduction of discards a high priority, while securing improved management of fish stocks and the prosperity of our fishing industry.</p>

We have already made excellent progress with initiatives such as project 50%, which saw discards in the south west sole fishery reduced by 52%. In 2011, we are expanding our catch quota scheme to more vessels and species, as well as working to encourage consumption of underutilized species that are presently discarded.</p>

 The information requested was not recorded centrally by Arts Council England (ACE) prior to January 2010. Staff booked travel with many different suppliers and have no way of reporting the class of individual journeys taken. However, ACE now has a designated travel supplier, who centralises and records all their travel. During the period January 2010 to February 2011, ACE spent £5,493.30 on first-class travel.</p>

 We are currently considering how to deliver our commitment to cut red tape and encourage the performance of more live music, while ensuring that there is appropriate protection for local communities. A reduction in red tape associated with the licensing of regulated entertainment would clearly benefit pubs and other venues that put on live music events now.

Ofcom has recently concluded a consultation on its approach to implementing licence exempt whitespace access. A summary of responses and next steps will be published during spring 2011.</p>

 In line with the Code of Practice for official statistics, information about the accuracy and quality of crime statistics produced by the Home Office are published alongside the statistics. In their report on trust in crime statistics published in May 2010, the UK Statistics Authority assessed the technical quality of Home Office crime statistics to compare well with corresponding statistics for other countries. However, the Authority also indicated that much crime and antisocial behaviour is being missed by both the British Crime Survey and police recorded crime and the statistics give an incomplete and partial picture.</p>

 The Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 provides that any death not reported to a coroner is required to be registered within five days of its occurrence, or within 14 days if written notice of the death is given to the registrar. The Act also places a duty on those qualified to do so (e.g. a relative of the deceased, or any person present at the death) to give information to the registrar to enable the registration to take place, and makes it an offence to fail to do so if required. Additionally, if a death has not been registered within the above time limits, registrars are authorised under the Act to require an informant to attend at the register office for this purpose.</p>

 It is not possible to answer the question by giving details of average monthly cost in each detention facility since this information is commercially sensitive. Seven out of the 10 immigration removal centres are run by private contractors and the cost for running these centres are only agreed after an extensive tendering exercise. By giving the cost of running these centres we would jeopardise the process of ensuring that the taxpayer gets the optimum price. The average estimated direct monthly cost of holding a person in any of our immigration detention facility is £3,407.</p>

It will be run on a care model rather than a secure one and there will be provision for family members to leave the premises after suitable risk assessments.

<i> [holding answer 4 March 2011]:</i> The Interception Modernisation Programme was a programme set up under the last Government. As made clear in the Strategic Defence and Security Review, the Government will continue to build on an existing programme of work to preserve the ability of the law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies to obtain communications data and to intercept communications within the appropriate legal framework. We will legislate to ensure this is compatible with the Government's approach to civil liberties and use of communications capabilities. As set out in the Home Office's Structural Reform Plan, details of this legislation will be announced in Parliament in due course.</p>

The same set of sustainability criteria will be applied to the use of UK and imported solid biomass, and to both new and existing plants. The sustainability criteria will not apply to solid biomass that is waste or wholly derived from waste.</p>

 We are introducing mandatory reporting on performance against the sustainability criteria under the renewables obligation (RO) from April this year for operators using wood and other solid biomass, above 50 kilowatts capacity. The first reports would be due to be supplied to Ofgem by 31 May 2012, to cover the biomass used by a plant operator between 1 April 2011 and 31 March 2012. These reports would include performance against the land criteria, an assessment of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions saving relative to fossil fuel and information on the biomass used including mass or volume, country of origin, type arid form.</p>

 Local carbon budgets have been raised on a number of occasions as the Energy Bill passed through the House of Lords. As my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Lord Marland) noted in the Energy Bill debate in the House of Lords, 2 March 2011, <i> Official Report</i>, <i> House of Lords</i>, columns 1067-1119, we have given full consideration to these issues and we have determined that the best way forward is co-operation, not by imposing top down carbon budgets on local authorities.</p>

 Our view is that management is both an overhead on front-line services and a critical investment in ensuring that those services operate in an optimal manner, achieving better quality for patients and better value for the taxpayer. Administration costs have increased dramatically in recent years and cost controls will be essential in reducing the total cost of national health service administration from £5.1 billion in 2010-11 to £3.7 billion by 2014-15.</p>

We will not determine the exact amount until further work has been undertaken with pathfinders. This work will explore the optimal balance between ensuring sufficient investment in organisational sustainability with maximising resources for front-line services. Before this, during their development phase, the running costs will be locally agreed within the running cost envelope for each region.</p>

 National health service organisations are responsible for compiling their own menus and making decisions about the food served to patients. In April 2010, nutritional care was made one of the key registration requirements for all organisations providing health care.

Future funding of neuroscience research by BBSRC is dependent on the quality and strategic relevance of grant applications. Funding will be allocated over the next four years in relation to relevance to BBSRC's strategic priorities and BBSRC's four-year spending review settlement. As currently only a small part of neuroscience is within BBSRC's strategic priorities, it is likely that there will be a reduction in BBSRC funding over the next spending review period for neuroscience research that is outside our strategic priorities. An estimate, not an allocation, which is all that is possible at this stage until BBSRC has received applications for funding and dependent on their relevance and quality, is that this might amount to a reduction of £4 million/year, i.e. total neuroscience funding might run at approximately £36 million/year.</p>

<sup>(2)</sup> Since 2004 student loans are no longer written-off due to bankruptcy. From that time the number of students notifying the SLC of their bankruptcy has declined.<br>

 The European Commission investigation into alleged dumping of imports of vinyl acetate from the US is at an early stage having been initiated on 4 December 2010. We are satisfied that there was a prima facie case of alleged dumping requiring the European Commission to initiate the investigation. The Government judges each anti-dumping case on its own merits based on an economic analysis of the results of the Commission's investigation and representations received from relevant interests (e.g. producers, users and others). To date one meeting has been held with INEOS Oxide Ltd, a UK producer and the complainant in this case. As in all anti-dumping cases we will discuss this case with the Commission and other member states as appropriate. The Commission will in any event consult all member states through the Anti-Dumping Committee before any measures are taken.</p>

<i> [holding answer 14 September 2010]:</i> Good quality early education helps tackle disadvantage and improve children's life chances. We announced in the spending review that funding has been protected so that all three and four-year-olds will continue to receive 15 hours per week of free nursery education, delivered more flexibly, and that this will be extended to every disadvantaged two-year-old from 2013.</p>

Local authorities have a statutory duty-under section 7 of the Childcare Act-to secure nursery places free of charge, effectively prohibiting top-up fees. This ensures that there are no barriers to accessing the benefits of nursery education for all children, but particularly the most disadvantaged. Parents are free to purchase additional hours and services outside of the hours for which providers receive funding from local authorities.</p>

The Government are listening to the views of early years providers and their representative bodies concerning funding issues. The Government are seeking to improve the efficiency with which funding is distributed to providers, through the Early Years Single Funding Formula (EYSFF) reforms, as well as reducing bureaucratic burdens on providers who deliver free nursery education. Many providers will also be benefiting from other support that local authorities provide for early learning and care. Providers will want to take into account this whole package of support before deciding whether delivering free places fits with their business model.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 December 2010]:</i> The Department for Education does not collect this data. Decisions on staffing in Sure Start Children's Centres are a matter for local discretion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_500"><a name="110308w0004.htm_para11"><a name="110308102000757">We have removed the overly prescriptive requirement for all Sure Start Children's Centres in the most disadvantaged areas to provide full day care. We have also removed the associated requirement that this provision be delivered by both a Qualified Teacher (QT) and an Early Years Professional (EYP), so that children's centres may chose to employ just one of a QT or an EYP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_501"><a name="110308w0004.htm_para12"><a name="110308102000758">In the past, children's centres in the most disadvantaged areas were required to provide full day care, i.e. 10 hours a day, five days a week, for 48 weeks a year. However, the National Audit Office Memorandum for the Children, Schools and Families Committee, December 2009, suggested that in some areas, when demand for full day care is low, money intended for other Sure Start services-like family support and outreach to vulnerable families-is subsidising the provision of early education and care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_502"><a name="110308w0004.htm_para13"><a name="110308102000759">We expect children's centres to continue to play a critical role in early education and care, including providing and encouraging take-up of free nursery education for two, three, and four-year-olds and additional hours where there is demand. Furthermore, we know the quality of early education is a key driver of good outcomes, particularly for disadvantaged children. So, where children's centres offer early education, it is crucial that this is of high quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_503"><a name="110308w0004.htm_para14"><a name="110308102000760">The Government remain committed to investing in the quality of the early education and child care workforce, and will develop proposals to support this later this year. The recent local authority and school funding settlement provides for the ongoing support and development of the workforce. Continued national investment in the early years workforce includes the funding of places on the Early Years Professional Status programme and the New Leaders in Early Years programme which began in November.</p>

 Religious education RE is a statutory part of the basic curriculum of maintained schools in England, but not a part of the national curriculum. This means that there are no statutory national programmes of study, attainment targets or assessment arrangements. However, the locally agreed syllabus, which is designed by standing advisory councils on religious education (SACRE) and adopted by the local authority, is statutory, and that means that local authorities must provide such a syllabus and that maintained schools must follow it. Schools with a religious character can either follow the locally agreed syllabus, or use a syllabus which has been agreed by their governing body. It is the responsibility of the head teacher, governors and local authorities (LAs) to make the necessary provisions for RE in all maintained schools.</p>

We have asked the qualifications regulator Ofqual to look at the impact of recent changes to A-levels and whether further action is needed to ensure that re-sitting does not become widespread and undermine confidence in the exams. We have also asked the regulator to advise on how to bring an end to modular GCSEs and return to a system where students are examined on everything they have learnt at the end of their course.</p>

 Teachers wishing to take their class out of school on an educational visit are subject to the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999. There are no further national regulations specific to such visits, though employers (local authorities for community, voluntary-controlled and community special schools; governing bodies or trusts for other schools) can have local rules and guidance, which their schools must adhere to. In accordance with the recommendations in the Government's report, "Common Sense Common Safety" (October 2010), the Department for Education is working with the Health and Safety Executive to help schools comply with their duty of care in a sensible and proportionate way. This includes developing succinct guidance on all aspects of health and safety in schools including for educational visits. We are also supporting the Health and Safety Executive to develop a code of practice for off-site adventure activities (to take the place of validation by the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority).</p>

 The commitment in the Schools White Paper, "The Importance of Teaching", currently applies only to teachers in schools. This is because teachers are particularly vulnerable to the damage that maliciously intended or false allegations can have on their careers and personal lives. School teachers are responsible for the discipline of pupils in their classrooms and as such may on occasion need to use reasonable force to prevent pupils committing a criminal offence, injuring themselves or others, damaging property or to maintain good order and discipline. There is a perception that some children feel they can make allegations without any thought to the consequences for the teacher concerned, because they know it is unlikely they will be punished for making a false allegation. Where allegations are found to have been made maliciously the clearing of the teacher's name may be scant consolation for the trauma suffered through the social stigma attached to having been suspected of abusing or hurting a child. There may be arguments that the wider children's workforce, including those working in sixth form or further education colleges, can also be vulnerable to such allegations and I intend to keep under consideration the possibility of widening the scope of the anonymity protection.</p>

The Early intervention Grant is intended to fund universal programmes and activities available to all children, young people and families, as well as specialist services where intensive support is needed. However, it is up to local authorities in consultation with their local communities to prioritise the type and distribution of services subject to their statutory duties.</p>

The Early Intervention Grant may be used to fulfil statutory duties such as Sure Start and Short Break services but local authorities can meet the requirements of their statutory duties through a combination of all their funding, subject to local priorities. As the Early Intervention Grant is un-ringfenced, it provides the freedom and flexibility local authorities need to make savings while protecting the services that are most important to their residents.</p>
