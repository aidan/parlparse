To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will list the projects to be funded by the sums pledged by <i>(a)</i> the UK and <i>(b)</i> the EU as reconstruction aid to Iraq indicating the sum allocated to each project; what the expected UK contribution to (i) the World Bank loan and (ii) the IMF loan is; to what purposes these contributions are expected to be put; and if he will make a statement.  [141118]<P>

<P>
<a name="31203w01.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 It is too early to say how the money pledged at Madrid will be allocated by DFID and the EU as priorities are still being determined in coordination with the interim Iraqi Administration and other donors. Equally it is too soon to say what the UK contribution to the World Bank and IMF loans will be.
<P>

<a name="31203w01.html_para0">As soon as DFID approves its reconstruction projects for Iraq, details will be placed in the House Library and published in the weekly sitrep that can be obtained on the DFID website www.dfid.gov.uk

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how much of the projected aid budget for reconstruction in Iraq has been funded by changes in the aid budget for other countries in financial year 2003&#150;04.  [141256]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31203w01.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 None of the funding for reconstruction in Iraq this financial year has been found from planned expenditure for other countries. Of the &#163;312 million budget for 2003&#150;04 &#163;180 million is additional resources for reconstruction from Treasury reserves and a further &#163;75 million has been sourced from the DFID contingency reserve. The rest has been found from existing allocation for Iraq, MOD funds, the Global Conflict Prevention Pool and our share of EC funding for Iraq.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how many <i>(a)</i> children and <i>(b)</i> pregnant mothers died of malaria in developing countries in each of the last five years, using figures from his Department's research.  [141193]

<P>
<a name="31203w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 Children and pregnant women are at the greatest risk of dying from malaria. The WHO'S most recent official estimates of children under-5 dying of malaria for year 2000 are close to 1 million deaths globally. There are no official WHO estimates of malaria related mortality for pregnant women. WHO and Roll Back Malaria (RBM) recognise the importance of having more accurate estimates, which are important to measure progress and ensure that global targets are met.
<P>

<a name="31203w01.html_para1">DFID has contributed &#163;48 million over four years (1999 to 2003) to RBM, a global partnership which includes national governments, UN agencies, pharmaceutical companies and NGOs, with the objective of working to half the world's malaria burden by 2010. This will be done through expanding coverage for preventative interventions (e.g. insecticide-treated mosquito nets), expanding effective treatment for the disease and strengthening national capacity for surveillance, monitoring and planning.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31203w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31203w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 The Secretary of State outlined intended changes to programmes for middle-income countries in his statement to the House of 6 November 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 42WS. More detailed plans are now being made, in consultation with partner countries and other donors. They will be embodied in the annual revision of DFID's Aid Framework, which is expected to be completed over the next two months.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what response he will make to the drought relief appeal in Namibia.  [141370]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31203w01.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Government of Namibia launched an appeal to donors at a meeting in Windhoek on 20 November. We and other agencies are currently considering this appeal and the wider issues it raises for emergency planning and response in Namibia.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what action the Government are taking to address the humanitarian crisis <i>(a)</i> in Northern Uganda and <i>(b)</i> in the Anglican Diocese of Soroti.  [141514]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31203w01.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The situation in Northern and Eastern Uganda has resulted in the UK disbursing an additional &#163;4.4 million over the last 12 months specifically targeted at the humanitarian situation. This assistance has been channelled through the World Food Programme, UNICEF, and the Uganda Red Cross Society to support those affected by the conflict. We are currently considering how best to programme a further &#163;4.1 million for urgent humanitarian needs. This will include additional support to the Red Cross specifically for helping those suffering in Eastern Uganda, including Soroti.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31203w01.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The UK supports UNICEF's Medium Term Strategic Plan 2002&#150;05 which provides support to orphans and vulnerable children through its five priority areas of: child protection; girls' education; immunisation; early childhood development; and tackling HIV/AIDS. The UK supports UNICEF's Plan by providing &#163;17 million a year to UNICEF's regular resources. In 2002, the UK provided a further &#163;34 million in extra-budgetary support.

 "Powering Future Vehicles&#151;The Government Strategy", published in July 2002, describes the action which the Government are taking to promote the shift to clean, low carbon fuels and vehicles, including low duty rates for liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas, hydrogen and biofuels, the introduction of CO2-based graduated VED (Vehicle Excise Duty) and company car tax, and grants towards the purchase or conversion of cleaner fuelled vehicles, including electric and hybrid vehicles. The First Annual Report on implementation of the Strategy was published in October. Copies of both documents have been placed in the House Library. In this financial year the Energy Saving Trust estimate that they will provide grants for around 4000 vehicles under the PowerShift programme, compared to some 2000 vehicles last year. My Department is currently discussing with the Trust how they can support the Government's environmental objectives in future years. Estimates are not yet available for the number of PowerShift grants in future years. In the current financial year, take-up of PowerShift grants has been strong, and the year's resources have been fully allocated. However, if existing offers are not fully taken up, the resources will be allocated to organisations or individuals whose grant applications have been placed on the PowerShift waiting list. The financial outturn for PowerShift are detailed in the following table.

 In April 2000, the Government introduced a number of measures to encourage charitable giving through Payroll Giving schemes. The maximum amounts that could be given each year under Payroll Giving was abolished; we announced a three-year publicity campaign to promote the scheme to employers and their employees and introduced a ten per cent supplement on all Payroll Giving donations until April 2003. The cost of the supplement is met from public expenditure. The supplement was extended for a further year until April 2004, to allow charity fundraisers to make the most of the boost to this method of giving.

No planning application for extraction of sand and gravel in the vicinity of Thornborough Henges has been received, to date, by North Yorkshire County Council.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31203w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 I met Air Chief Marshal Sir Roger Palin and Major General James Gordon from the Forces Pension Society (FPS) on 19 November 2003. During our discussions, I recognised the strength of feeling among those ex-Service personnel affected by pension troughs and the Society's concern that a remedy should be found for this. However, after careful consideration of the matter, I informed the Society that I did not intend to revisit this issue.

<P>

<a name="31203w06.html_para2">The cost of uplifting only future payments of those affected by the mid-1970s trough would be very substantial and it would be impossible to avoid extending any change to those, whether in the armed forces or more widely, affected by other pensions troughs. It has been the policy of successive Governments that it would not be appropriate to make retrospective change to pension entitlements.
<P>

<a name="31203w06.html_para3">For the future, and reflecting the Society's concerns, Service personnel who become members of the new Armed Forces Pension Scheme will be less exposed to the effects of any periods of pay restraint and high inflation because their pensions will be based on their best earnings in the last three years of Service, with earlier years' earnings up-rated for inflation.

 We plan to fit Typhoon with technology which will make it capable of integrating with a network-centric warfare environment.

This will enable Typhoon to access threat and targeting data supplied by other aircraft as well as by maritime and land based units.

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 2003]:</i> The Home Office New Car Security Guidance published in 1998 encouraged manufacturers to make further improvements in car security. This included more widespread fitting of laminated glazing on side and rear windows which could resist attack by methods commonly used by criminals for a minimum of 30 seconds; and locks that could resist criminal attack for a minimum of two minutes.
<P>

<a name="31203w07.html_para5">We aim to raise motorists awareness of the value of better perimeter security through Home Office publicity material, particularly the booklet "Steer Clear of Car Crime" and our website www.secureyourmotor.gov.uk. We have also worked with the AA Motoring Trust, the Department for Transport (DfT) and the insurance industry to translate the insurers' security assessments used for insurance group ratings into a five star rating system (available on www.ncsr.co.uk). This allows car buyers to compare the ability of different makes and models of cars to resist theft, both of the car and of its contents. The insurance industry now also provides similar information in relation to vans and trucks. We help raise motorists' awareness of all this information through links from Home Office and Department for Transport websites.

 Thanks to major additional investment and the hard work of those working in the national health service, we are making real progress in implementing the NHS Cancer Plan and patients are benefiting from improvements across all aspects of cancer care.
<P>

<a name="31203w08.html_para1">For example, there are an extra 941 cancer consultants compared with 1997; nearly 99 per cent. of people with suspected cancer are now seen by a specialist within two weeks of being referred by their general practitioner; we have improved the quality of breast screening by the introduction of two view mammography and are extending the breast screening service to include women aged 65 to 70. This has resulted in nearly 200,000 extra women being invited for breast screening since April 2001.

 The Department is aware of the recent Royal College of Radiologists publication on radiotherapy capacity, which included a selective comparison with three European countries.

 Under the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000, councils have discretion to establish short break voucher schemes for carers. The intention is that flexible schemes should be developed in consultation with stakeholders according to local need. Voucher schemes will be attractive to some carers, but it is not the intention that all breaks services should be delivered through vouchers. Vouchers were introduced to widen the choice available to carers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what programmes are in place for training doctors in treatment of myalgic encephalomyelitis.  [141190]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31203w09.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Responsibility for the content, standards, management and delivery of medical education is shared between regulatory bodies, for example, the General Medical Council and the Specialist Training Authority, professional bodies, notably the medical Royal Colleges, universities, the Department and the national health service. We expect that these bodies will take account of the latest developments in medicine when developing their syllabuses.
<P>

<a name="31203w09.html_para4">General practitioners are expected to keep their professional skills up-to-date, and learning will always continue even if formal training has ceased.
<P>

<a name="31203w09.html_para5">We are however taking steps to improve services for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). On 12 May 2003, my right hon. Friend the Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith), announced pump priming funding of &#163;8.5 million to develop services for people with CFS/ME.
<P>

<a name="31203w09.html_para6">The Medical Research Council published a research strategy for CFS/ME on 1 May 2003. The strategy will enable researchers and funders to develop research proposals on all aspects of this illness. It was developed by an independent research advisory group in response to a request from the Chief Medical Officer, and was informed by contributions from patients, carers, charities, researchers and clinicians via a consultation exercise in summer 2002.

<i>[holding answer 2 December 2003]:</i> We do not hold appropriate data to provide such a breakdown. It is estimated that at the end of October 2003, about 7,000 patients were being treated with a disease modifying treatment for their multiple sclerosis.

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 2003]</i>: The national service framework (NSF) for long term conditions will focus on improving the standard of neurology services across England. It will also address some of the generic issues that are important to people with non-neurological disabilities, such as access to rehabilitation services; provision of good quality information; support for carers; and, access to community equipment, assistive technology and wheelchairs.
<P>

<a name="31203w09.html_para7">We appointed the external reference group last November and have since set up several working groups which have been making recommendations and considering areas and issues for proposed standards. We are making good progress and currently plan to publish the NSF at the end of next year for implementation from 2005.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. In November 2002, the Jobcentre Plus district of Grampian, Moray, Orkney and Shetland was formed by combining Grampian and Shetland Social Fund district with part of Highlands and Islands Social Fund district. For the months before the boundary change as a whole data are given for the old district, for the month of the boundary change data is given for the area covered by the new district, and for the months after the boundary change as a whole data is given for the new district. Data are not available for part months.<P>

2. Data are not available by parliamentary constituency or local authority.<P>

3. Prior to April 1999, it was possible to make a dual application for a Community Care Grant (CCG) and for a Budgeting Loan (BL). One dual application is counted as one application for a CCG and one for a BL.<P>

4. The number of applications is rounded to the nearest 10.<P>

5. When an application is refused, no award is made. Figures refer to initial decisions only.<P>

6. The data requested on CCG priority are not available.<P>

<a name="31203w10.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Under Pension Credit pensioners are subject to a new form of assessment, which is much less intrusive and burdensome. Pension Credit has removed the old weekly means test. Instead, most pensioners aged 65 and over have their award fixed for five years and have to tell us only about major changes in their circumstances.
<P>

<a name="31203w10.html_para1">Around half of all pensioner households are eligible for Pension Credit and other income related benefits, and stand to gain, on average, &#163;400 a year. Our priority is to target help on the poorest pensioners and there are already over 1.2 million pensioner households (around 1.4 million individuals) getting more money than they did before.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what steps he is taking to increase the number of magistrates from working class constituencies.  [140616]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31203w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 On 7 October 2003 the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor published his National Strategy for the Recruitment of Lay Magistrates. One of the key aims of this strategy is to recruit magistrates from under-represented groups, including those from working class communities, and by doing so to improve the diversity of local benches. A more accurate way of determining the socio-economic balance of the bench, and of applicants, has been put in place. Various recruitment initiatives are being tried, including targeting community and social groups, local employers and trade union organisations. A regional bus advertising campaign began on 3 November highlighting the need for magistrates from all walks of life. The local Advisory Committees on Justices of the Peace actively attempt to recruit from under-represented sectors by approaching relevant special interest groups and advertising in community and trade media.

 The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) allocates research funding selectively to universities according to the quality and volume of their research activity as measured in periodic Research Assessment Exercises (RAEs). Institutions receive this funding as block grant and are free to determine their own research focus. The volume of research achieving top quality ratings sharply increased in the 2001 RAE. HEFCE has modified its funding formula to refocus available resources on this highest quality work to ensure our research remains globally competitive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31203w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The funding for each school will depend on a number of factors covering both central and local government responsibility. Central Government uses the Education Formula Spending Share formula to allocate education funding for each local education authority. This formula comprises a basic entitlement for each pupil plus top-ups for deprivation and where it costs more to recruit and retain teachers, using data from the New Earnings Survey. The deprivation measures used are (i) children in families in receipt of Income Support; (ii) children in families in receipt of Working Families Tax Credit; (iii) proportion of primary children with English as an additional language and (iv) proportion of secondary children in low-achieving ethnic groups. The primary sub-block and LEA central functions sub-block also include a sparsity factor.
<P>

<a name="31203w12.html_para1">Local education authorities, in consultation with their schools and in accordance with regulations, then decide how much funding to put into the Schools Budget and what factors to use in the local fair funding formula, which allocates funding to individual schools.

Excluding the adjustment for capital, the provisional settlement gives the authority an increase in Formula Grant of 5.0 per cent. compared to the 3.5 per cent. floor increase it would otherwise have received. Any impact on social services, highways maintenance and council tax would therefore be beneficial.

<a name="31203w13.html_para4">The basis on which we have given every authority at least as large an increase in Formula Grant as its Schools FSS increase is to calculate the increase in Formula Grant for each authority under the previous floors and ceilings system and compare it to their increase in Schools FSS.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) what the Government's policy is on <i>(a)</i> calling in planning applications and <i>(b)</i> reviewing local authority planning decisions where they affect (i) greenfield sites and (ii) semi-natural green belt sites; and if he will make a statement;  [140965]

<P>
<P>
<a name="31203w14.html_spnew2"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister's general approach is not to interfere with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities unless it is necessary to do so. Standard policy is to be very selective about calling in planning applications. In general, this step is only taken if planning issues of more than local importance are involved and if those issues need to be decided by my right hon. Friend rather than at a local level. Such cases may include those which: may conflict with national policies on important matters; could have 



<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 2003 : Column 98W</I><P>
significant effects beyond their immediate locality; give rise to substantial regional or national controversy; raise significant architectural and urban design issues; or may involve the interests of national security of foreign Governments. Each case is, however, considered on its own merits
<P>

<a name="31203w14.html_para1">The Government's general policy and practice is not to review decisions taken by local authorities on individual planning applications. When a planning application comes before my right hon. Friend, on appeal for example, he will determine it in accordance with the development plan for the area and relevant national planning policies, including Planning Policy Guidance notes (PPG). PPG2 (Green Belts), PPG3 (Housing) and PPG7 (The Countryside) would be particularly relevant in relation to greenfield sites. Where relevant, regard will also be had to the requirements of the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment)(England and Wales) Regualtions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31203w14.html_spnew3"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 One the of the reasons for using remote voting such as all-postal voting is to assist those people who find it inconvenient or difficult to go to polling stations to vote. In its evaluation of the 2003 pilots, the Electoral Commission recommended that staffed delivery points should be provided at both mobile and fixed locations as part of all-postal elections. These offer voter the opportunity to vote in conditions similar to polling stations for those who find it easier or more convenient to do so.
<P>

<a name="31203w14.html_para2">The Government intend that staffed delivery points will be features of future pilots. Following the successful piloting of innovative processes in the local elections in 2000, 2002 and 2003, the Government plan to ran pilots in the 2004 European parliamentary elections and in any local elections combined with them.
<P>

<a name="31203w14.html_para3">The Government accept the broad thrust of Electoral Commission's recommendation to roll out of all-postal voting to all local elections and will be consulting on the detailed arrangements shortly. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will also be consulting on the arrangements for the local and regional referendums which we intend to be by all-postal ballot.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31203w14.html_spnew4"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 A number of letters received from members of the public have mentioned concerns about the security and secrecy of all-postal voting. The same concerns were raised by some respondents to the recent consultation on our proposals for holding all-postal pilots at the European parliamentary and any combined local elections in June 2006.

<P>
<a name="31203w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Where an elected regional assembly is established, existing two tier local government will be restructured as unitary authorities.

 Our White Paper "Your Region, Your Choice" made clear that a simple majority yes vote will be needed in a referendum before an elected assembly is established in any region. The Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act 2003 allows my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister to call a referendum once: he has considered the level of interest in the region in holding such a referendum; and the Boundary Committee for England have made recommendations about the structure of local government in that region.

 In general, as the working time regulations benefit both men and women, studies of the impact of the regulation covers all those who are affected.

Full-time employment for women grew by 5.7 per cent. from July&#150;September 1998 to July&#150;September 2003 while the average actual hours of full-time women in employment fell by 0.4 hours per week over the same period (from 34.4 hours per week in July&#150;September 1998 to 34.0 hours per week in July&#150; September 2003).

 The UK's voluntary offer safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Euratom applies to all nuclear material in UK facilities, subject to exclusions for national security reasons only. This means that the IAEA can designate any UK civil nuclear facility, or any part thereof, for safeguards inspection visits but has no right of access to nuclear material required for national security and sites such as Aldermaston. The IAEA therefore has the right to inspect the plutonium stored at Sellafield that was transferred from Aldermaston and brought into safeguards following the conclusion of the 1998 Strategic Defence Review. The IAEA currently chooses to limit its inspections to the plutonium in the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP) plutonium product store and the Magnox Special Nuclear Material Store 9.

 While membership of the Electronic Innovation and Growth Team (EIGT) Steering Board and Working Groups is by personal invitation, I am assured SMEs are well represented. Both the Steering Board and Working Groups have participants who are employed in or who are key participates in SME networks.

<a name="31203w16.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the impact the energy provision of the draft European Union Constitution would have on the oil and gas industries operating on the United Kingdom's continental shelf; and what changes would have to be made to the present regime for these industries.  [140611]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31203w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 It is not yet clear what the precise effect of the energy chapter would be for the UK oil and gas industries. Although the draft Constitutional Treaty creates a legal base for energy, it does not, for example, bring forward a new regulatory regime. Article 111&#150;157 of the draft Constitutional Treaty sets out EU competence in energy matters, including natural resources, with voting by qualified majority. The UK has proposed amendments which would make it clear that Member States retain control of their natural resources.

 None. What matters for the Post Office is attracting more customers, not whether they have a Post Office card account. Customers can now access a wide range of bank accounts at the post office and I hope that they choose to do so. The Department for Work and Pensions provides its customers with all the information that they need to choose the account into which they would like to have their benefits paid in future, including those accounts which provide post office access. The final choice of account is a matter of personal choice for each individual concerned. I understand that that as of 7 November 2003 more than 1 million Post Office card accounts had been opened.

 New regulatory controls on unsolicited direct marketing e-mails will come into force on 11 December this year. The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 introduce prior consent requirements for unsolicited direct marketing e-mails sent to individuals and a requirement for all direct marketing e-mails not to disguise or conceal the identity of the person on whose behalf they are sent, and not to be sent without a valid address for opt-out purposes. The new rules will be enforced by the Information Commissioner's Office, who will have powers to issue enforcement notices in cases of breaches of the rules. Breach of an enforcement notice is a criminal offence subject to a fine of up to &#163;5,000 in a magistrate's court or an unlimited fine if the trial is before a jury. In addition, individuals or organisations who have suffered a loss or damage as a result of a failure to comply with the regulations will be entitled to seek compensation from the person responsible for the breach.
<P>

<a name="31203w17.html_para5">Junk e-mail is a global phenomenon, however, and the great majority of spam received by UK internet users comes from outside the European Union. The UK is active in international discussions on how to tackle the problem of cross-border spam both multilaterally (for example, in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), and bilaterally with the USA and other national governments.
