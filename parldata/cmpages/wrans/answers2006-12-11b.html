 Comprehensive statistics on woodland prices are not available. Unlike agricultural land price statistics, the value of woodland incorporates the changing value of the timber growing stock, as well as the underlying land value and specific factors that attract buyers. Since 1993 the Forestry Commission's annual reports and accounts have shown a total value for the Public Forest Estate, which has been independently valued every five years since then. This is best indication we have of the changing cost of woodland over time. The open market values and the area of forest are shown in the following table.</p>

many African countries will achieve some of the MDGs by 2015, or will have made substantial progress towards the goal, even though if current trends prevail, none is likely to achieve all MDGs by 2015.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="61211w0006.htm_para1"><a name="06121141000061">For example, in Uganda, the education MDG ison track, with primary enrolment (MDG2) having increased from 62 per cent. to 86 per cent. in the decade to 2002. In Rwanda, the proportion of women in Parliamentary seats (MDGS) increased from one in six in 1990 to almost 1 in 2 in 2005. And although the child mortality remains high in that country, it is estimated to have reduced from 200 deaths per thousand children aged under five in the 1990s to about 150 per thousand in 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="61211w0006.htm_para2"><a name="06121141000062">It is important to note that while the Millennium Declaration was signed by member states and while countries have undertaken to monitor the MDG indicators, interpretation at country level may vary. Indeed, some MDGs targets are not applicable to all countries (e.g. some countries have no forest), while others may be too ambitious (e.g. a large number of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have already achieved the goal of reducing extreme poverty by half with respect to 1990). On the contrary, some may not be ambitious enough. Countries make their own assessment of progress in national MDG reports, following their own customisation of the MDG framework. In total, about 40 countries in Africa have produced national MDG reports, which can be found at http://www.undp.org/mdg/tracking_countryreports2.shtml.</p>

 The UK Government&#146;s July 2006 White Paper puts governance at the centre of development and commits us to adopt a new quality of governance assessment to monitor standards of governance, and to intensify our efforts to help improve governance and combat corruption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="61211w0006.htm_para3"><a name="06121141000065">The quality of governance clearly matters for development. One study found that the efficiency of governance (among other issues) was associated with better rates of investment and growth and corruption with worse rates. The World Development Report of 1997 highlighted the importance of property rights, judicial reliability and control of corruption for investment and growth. Econometric studies have shown that the benefits of public health spending on child and infant mortality rates are greater in countries with better governance and that as countries improve governance, public spending on primary education becomes more effective in increasing primary attainment. Researchers have estimated that a country which improves its governance from a relatively low level to an average level could almost triple the per capita income of its population in the long term and similarly reduce infant mortality and illiteracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="61211w0006.htm_para7"><a name="06121141000069">Focusing exclusively on countries with better governance and less corruption could be a way of reducing the risks of aid being wasted or misused, but would not produce the best overall impact. Since the mid-1990s, greater donor emphasis on rewarding countries with relatively effective governments and stable macro-economic policies has led to some neglect of fragile states, which have poor governance. Many of the poorest people live in these states and meeting the Millennium Development Goals will require progress there. Therefore, despite the risks and the challenges, DFID is committed to working not only in countries which are performing well, but also in fragile states and to finding ways of working more effectively in these states.</p>

 Once direct conflict has ended, cluster munitions, if they have been used in large numbers, are likely to affect humanitarian relief and reconstruction efforts. Certain types of cluster munitions have unacceptably high failure rates, which vary in relation to the prevailing conditions in which they are used. If they are used in large numbers, unexploded bomblets can be left scattered densely and indiscriminately over a wide area. When these are set off, the explosion can kill anyone within 50m. They represent a threat to aid workers, peace-keepers, medical services, internally displaced persons and anyone else entering an area immediately after the cessation of hostilities.

<p><a name="st_93"><a name="06121141000089"><a name="61211w0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="06121141000367"><b>Hilary Benn:</b>
 The very high levels of debt owed by some of the poorest countries has raised widespread concern. It has prevented countries from investing in basic services and building the infrastructure neededto reach the millennium development goals. It has constrained economic growth, and undermines the compact between a government and its people, with large shares of the government's resources being needed to service its debt. Tackling this problem has been a top priority for the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="61211w0007.htm_para4"><a name="06121141000090">The right conditionality is essential to ensure thatwe can have confidence that debt relief will benefit poor people. In my view, the approach taken underthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative is appropriate. It specifies that there should be a track record on macroeconomic management and an established commitment to reduce poverty. Macroeconomic management is important for ensuring that government resources are used effectively, and provides the basis for sustainable economic growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="61211w0007.htm_para5"><a name="06121141000091">The commitment to poverty reduction has been specified in terms of a government developing and implementing a national poverty reduction strategy, and through the implementation of a number of agreed actions. These actions include measures to improve public financial management, and they may include actions on education, health, or economic growth. In my view, the choice of conditions has not always been wholly appropriate. In some cases, the number of conditions has been too high, making it hard for countries to complete the process. In others, there were conditions for which there was too little government ownership and commitment. The UK has argued for the World Bank and the IMF to take a flexible approach in assessing whether countries should qualify for the irrevocable debt relief that is granted at the end of the process, and several countries have already benefited from this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="61211w0007.htm_para6"><a name="06121141000092">Given the demands of the HIPC Initiative, the Government took the view that no additional conditionally should be attached to the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. We were successful in achieving this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="61211w0007.htm_para7"><a name="06121141000093">Both the HIPC Initiative and MDRI provide irrevocable debt cancellation. This is important to ensure that debt burden is removed and so that governments have a predictable stream of resources that they can invest. Of course, there are no guarantees that countries will remain committed to reducing poverty, but a balance needs to be struck between having confidence that debt cancellation will benefit the poor and not setting the standards unreasonably high. Debt relief remains a small proportion of overall aid provided by donors, and donors can change the form of other aid if there are setbacks, for example withdrawing budget support and providing other assistance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="61211w0007.htm_para8"><a name="06121141000094">At HIPC Decision Point, countries receive flow relief on their debt payments. This can be removed where there is evidence that a country is not committed to poverty reduction. A track record is therefore built up before qualifying for irrevocable debt relief at Completion Point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="61211w0007.htm_para9"><a name="06121141000095">Recent reports from the World Bank and IMFhave shown that countries that have qualified for debt relief have increased their spending on poverty from US$ 6 billion in 2000 to nearly US$ 15 billion in 2005. This is projected to increase further following the implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative in 2006, which is freeing up an additional US$ 38 billion. I have seen for myself the impact of some of this relief, such as schools in Ghana. Zambia is using savings (US$ 2.8 million) in 2006 to increase spending on agricultural projects on smallholder irrigation and livestock disease control, as well as eliminate user fees for healthcare in rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="61211w0007.htm_para10"><a name="06121141000096">Analysis also shows that the performance of HIPCs has improved, as measured by the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment. This looks at 16 different aspects of policy, within the categories of economic management, structural and social/poverty policies, and public sector management. And economic growth rates in sub-Saharan Africa are increasing. This cannot be attributed only to the HIPC process; however the top performers in 2005 amongst non-oil producing countries are HIPCs that have already benefited from debt relief.</p>

 The UK and US agreed at UN General Assembly High Level Meeting on AIDS in June 2006 that comprehensive HIV prevention is essential, including expanded access to male and female condoms. For the past 10 years DFID has been the fourth largest condom provider, providing over a billion condoms since 2001. USAID was the largest individual donor for contraceptives and condoms in 2004, contributing 35 per cent. of total donor support. But in Africa there are still only enough condoms to provide eight for each man each year. The UK will continue to play its part, and work closely with the US to ensure an appropriate and effective response to AIDS, including on the provision of condoms.</p>

 The Government of India&#146;s National AIDS Programme (NACP) began in 1992, and the second phase of the programme (NACP 2) will run until March 2007. Key achievements under NACP2 include the establishment of 1,033 focused prevention interventions among vulnerable groups, 875 voluntary counselling and testing centres and 679 sexually transmitted disease clinics at the district level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="61211w0008.htm_para1"><a name="06121141000125">Currently, only half of the populations at greatest risk of infection (sex workers, men having sex with men and injecting drugs users) are currently covered by prevention interventions. Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) was introduced by the programme in 2004 but the roll out has been slow and serious issues of access, adherence, and capacity remain. By May 2006, only 32,000 people were covered by the free treatment programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="61211w0008.htm_para2"><a name="06121141000126">Yet, there is emerging evidence that the strategy of concentrating on focused interventions among those at highest risk is having an impact in states in the south.A recent analysis of HIV data from 216 antenatal clinics and 132 sexually transmitted infection clinics for 2000-04 suggest that HIV prevalence among women aged 15-24 years in southern states declined from1.7 per cent. in 2000 to 1.1 per cent. in 2004. HIV infection levels also fell among men aged 20-29 years who attended sexually transmitted infection clinics in the south.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="61211w0008.htm_para3"><a name="06121141000127">In Thailand, Government policy is to provide Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) to all those in need as part of the national Health Insurance scheme. This has contributed to Thailand&#146;s successful high treatment coverage rates. There has been concern that Thailand has failed to maintain initial HIV prevention successes. There are now worrying increases in infection prevalence rates in young people, married women and men who have sex with men. The Government recently announced that they would increase investment in this area with the aim of reducing new infections by 50 per cent. by 2010, but has not yet presented plans for this. Continued high levels of stigma and discrimination remain a major barrier to an effective response.</p>

 It is not possible to disaggregate our country programme spend on immunisation. We can however provide information on specific funding to immunisation bodies. We have provided &#163;68 million to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation between 2000 and 2008 to increase access to vaccines for children under five through the introduction of new vaccines, lowering the prices of existing vaccines and improving the capacity of health systems to deliver vaccinations. We have also provided &#163;338 million to the Polio Eradication Initiative between 1988 to 2008, and &#163;39.8 million to the International Aids Vaccine Initiative between 2000 to 2008. We have committed a further &#163;1.38 billion to the International Finance Facility for Immunisation, which will raise $4 billion to support GAVI over the next 10 years. We also support the work of UNICEF which provides significant assistance to country vaccine programmes.</p>

The Basra Council is already putting this strategy into action by implementing over 220 projects to repair water and sewage infrastructure, and improve roads and electricity supplies.

 Latin America is facing the twin challenges of rapid globalisation and entrenched inequality. Poor people in the poorer and middle income countries are not always benefiting from globalisation. And the countries&#146; needs are changing, as many can access other sources of finance for development, including private capital.

The IDB&#146;s new initiative includes projects to help people secure and exercise their rights, for example helping poor people to establish their citizenship and get the documents they need to work in the formal economy. Other areas being looked at include housing, water and electricity for poor people. The objective is to support practical programmes which will make a difference to peoples&#146; lives such as creating jobs and. opportunities for poor people to start their own businesses.</p>

 The UK Government are extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in the occupied Palestinian territory.

The causes of the deteriorating humanitarian situation include the conflict with Israel and amongst Palestinians; an economic downturn due to movement and access restrictions; and the Palestinian Authority's (PA) fiscal crisis, which has meant it has been unable to pay salaries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="61211w0009.htm_para8"><a name="06121141000175">The PA's fiscal crisis is mainly the result of the withholding of clearance revenues by Israel and lower tax revenues. The suspension of budgetary support by donors has played a less significant role. This is more than compensated for by an increase in aid through the TIM and other channels. European Union assistance has increased by 27 per cent. this year to &#163;439 million. Aid for Palestinian basic needs through the TIM will reach &#163;131.1 million this year in comparison with&#163;65 million through budgetary aid to the PA in 2005.

 The joint DFID and WorldBank-hosted conference on remittances held on13-14 November in London focused on the links between remittances and financial inclusion and followed up the outcomes of the first DFID-World Bank International Conference on Remittances in October 2003.</p>

Feedback from the conference participants was extremely positive. 90 per cent. of participants rated the conference either &#145;very good&#146; or &#145;outstanding&#146; in terms of its agenda, quality of presentations and selection of speakers.</p>

 Tetanus spores enter the body via deep wounds. In addition to wounds caused by accidents, mothers are susceptible to tetanus infection immediately following childbirth. Similarly, new born babies are at risk of tetanus infection where a non-sterile instrument is used to cut the umbilical cord (for example an un-trained traditional birth attendant using a piece of bamboo) and where traditional practices involve placing unclean &#145;dressings&#146; over the exposed area (such as dried and powdered cow dung used to help dry the cord in parts of south Asia). Without urgent treatment tetanus is fatal, causing an estimated 200,000 newborn child deaths a year.</p>

In some of the world's poorest countries GAVI provides support to improve the health systems which deliver immunisation and this support has recently been linked to improvements in the rates of DPT immunisation coverage in these countries.

 The Health and Safety Commission and Executive are responsible for regulating the safety of the UK's nuclear power stations. These may only be built and operated following the granting of a Nuclear Site Licence by the Health and Safety Executive, to which it attaches standard conditions for the management of nuclear safety. The licensee is responsible for complying with these conditions and ensuring that risks to workers and the public from its operations are reduced so far as is reasonably practicable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="61211w0019.htm_para4"><a name="0612123000986">The licence conditions require the licensee to maintain safety significant plant in good condition and take appropriate action in response to any findings from maintenance or inspection of plant that indicate safe operation might be affected. This includes recording, investigating and reporting the findings. The more safety significant findings must be reported to the Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, which investigates them and carries out its own independent inspections and assessments of plant operation and condition. The Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations periodically reports upon nuclear safety issues to the Health and Safety Commission and its Nuclear Safety Advisory Committee (NuSAC).</p>

 The 2002 Statutory Paternity Pay Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) estimated the annual amount of statutory paternity pay reclaimable from the Exchequer at around &#163;57 million. This assumed 70 per cent. of the total number eligible to receive statutory paid paternity leave would take it up.</p>

Although the take-up has been higher than originally estimated, not all fathers take their full entitlement to two weeks paid paternity leave. Therefore we anticipate that the costs of statutory paternity pay are around the level presented in the RIA.</p>

 The Government have not made any assessment into using overseas-based concentrated solar power plants to help the UK meet its long-term energy requirements.

There would need to be a massive source of surplus electricity to make this worthwhile and considerable investment.</p>

 Digital switchover does not require disposal of any equipment, as an existing analogue television can normally be upgraded by adding a digital set-top box. However, as the Government's &#147;Regulatory and Environmental Impact Assessment on the timing of digital switchover&#148; (September 2005) acknowledges, there may be a temporary acceleration in the disposal of some secondary television sets that people choose not to adapt after switchover in each region. In light of this, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs jointly commissioned the Market Transformation Programme to establish and quantify any changes in patterns of disposal of consumer equipment, including televisions, due to digital switchover. The results from this research should be available in early 2007.</p>

 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2012. To fulfil this commitment we have developed an energy strategy supported by a detailed action plan. We are making full use of the refurbishment of our headquarters at Cockspur Street to reduce our carbon emissions. For example we are using light fittings that are 30-60 per cent. more efficient than the current fittings. The Department is supplied by 100 per cent. renewable energy supplied under the OGC Buying Solutions Energy Contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="61211w0021.htm_para5"><a name="0612123001228">The annual energy consumption of a television varies significantly with screen size and television type, and defining what constitutes a &#145;typical&#146; television is difficult. However, for a 32 in widescreen cathode-ray television, the estimates are that the annual consumption will be 292 kWh, and 310 kWh for a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen of the same size. A 42 in (a typical size for this technology) plasma TV will consume 746 kWh per year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="61211w0021.htm_para6"><a name="0612123001229">The total energy consumption of all UK televisions has risen in recent years. However this is not a result of the development of integrated digital tuners but a function of increased TV ownership, the trend towards larger screen sizes, and the migration away from cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions to other technologies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="61211w0021.htm_para7"><a name="0612123001230">In many cases the use of an integrated digital tuner will negate the need to purchase a separate set-top digital TV adapter at digital switchover. The average consumption of a typical terrestrial set-top adapter is 60 kWh per year. Public communications about digital television switchover reinforce this point by advising consumers to purchase digital, rather than analogue, if they are upgrading a television.</p>

identified that many portable DAB radios are supplied with external power supply units which are less efficient&#151;and therefore consume more energy&#151;than those sold with comparable analogue products. We will work with retailers and manufacturers to seek to address this issue. As these are relatively new products, there are likely to be efficiency gains as the products mature.</p>

<i> Guide to quality:</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality.<br>
The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV - for example, for an average of 200 with a CV of 5%, we would expect the population average to be within the range 180 to 220.<br>

x CV &gt; 20%<br>
The median replaces the mean as the headline statistic. The weighted mean is the sum of the weighted values divided by the sum of the weights. The median is the value below which 50 per cent of employees fall. It is preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less by extreme values and because of the skewed distribution of earnings data.<br>

 The Department does not hold average costs of schools. Schools are designed and procured locally. However, a 1,000 pupil secondary school on a site without particular problems, in an area of average building prices, would typically be in the range of &#163;18-22 million.

 The Food Standards Agency comments as follows: &#148;On 6 July 2006, the Food Standards Agency published the findings of a systematic review of research, which looked at the effect of nutrition and diet on performance and behaviour of children in schools. The review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to reach a firm conclusion on the effect of diet and the education or learning of the general population. The Food Standards Agency&#146;s recommendation, therefore, continues to be that we should eat at least two portions of fish a week, including one of oily fish, as part of a healthy balanced diet.&#148;</p>
