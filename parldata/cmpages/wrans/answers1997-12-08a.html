<P>
<a name="71208w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bob Russell: </B> 
To ask the Chairman of the Catering Committee if he will take steps to discourage sales of House of Commons branded cigarettes. [18613]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Dennis Turner: </B> 
 It would be very unusual if a Chairman of the Catering Committee sought to discourage the sale and consumption of items sold as gifts and souvenirs from the Refreshment Department outlets. However, I accept fully that the situation with cigarettes is unique. In the previous Parliament I understand that the view of the Committee was that for as long as the smoking of tobacco products was legal, it was acceptable for the Department's outlets to sell cigarettes. My Committee will consider this subject in due course, and no doubt hon. Members will make representations about it.

<a name="71208w01.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>Westminster Hall Cafeteria</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Gordon: </B> 
To ask the Chairman of the Catering Committee if he will allow participants of guided tours to use Westminster Hall Cafeteria; and if he make a statement. [18719]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Dennis Turner: </B> 
 On 12 July 1994, the House approved the First Report of Session 1992-93 from the previous Catering Committee, "Refreshment provision for line of route visitors". One recommendation was that the area currently occupied by the Westminster Hall Cafeteria should be converted to a visitor centre, which would provide light refreshments and toilet facilities for the public, but that this should take place only once a suitable alternative has been found for the present lunchtime users.
<P>

<a name="71208w01.html_para0">Initial discussions between Officials have been held regarding the proposed nature of a visitor centre, and their proposals will be put before my Committee by Easter 1998. However, I do have to advise my hon. Friend that in excess of 500 people, mainly staff, have lunch daily in the Westminster Hall Cafeteria; the other outlets currently available to staff would not be able to accommodate the extra customers if the Westminster Hall Cafeteria was closed before the opening of the new Cafeteria in Portcullis House, which I understand, will not be until 2001. Therefore, it will not be possible to open a visitor centre before then.

<a name="71208w01.html_sbhd2"><H4><center>Blood Donor Sessions</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Gordon: </B> 
To ask the Chairman of the Administration Committee if she will arrange for regular blood donor sessions to be held within the Palace of Westminster. [18720]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roe: </B> 
 The North London Blood Transfusion Service operates a two day clinic very near the House in HM Treasury or the Cabinet Office once every six 



<P>

months, when arrangements are made for hon. Members, their staff and staff of the House who wish to do so to give blood.
<P>

<a name="71208w01.html_para1">Both a lack of space and an insufficient donor base preclude holding a dedicated clinic on the Parliamentary Estate.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Chairman of the Administration Committee how many car parking spaces are provided for <i>(a)</i> ministers, <i>(b) </i>hon. Members, <i>(c)</i> employees and <i>(d)</i> visitors in the House of Commons car parks. [19458]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roe: </B> 
 Details of the number of car park spaces, and who is entitled to use them, are given in the Serjeant at Arms leaflet "Car Parking" dated Spring 1997. I have asked for a copy to be sent to the hon. Gentleman.

To ask the Chairman of the Administration Committee (1) what the procedures are by which a deaf member of the public can be provided with sign language interpretation of the proceedings of the House within the Strangers Gallery; [18955]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the procedures are by which a member may be provided with <i>(a)</i> a sign language interpreter and <i>(b) </i>a portable induction loop in order to facilitate communication with deaf or hard of hearing visitors to the Palace of Westminster and associated buildings. [18956]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roe: </B> 
 Portable induction loops can be provided on request to the Serjeant at Arms Office. Forty eight hours notice should be given whenever possible. The House does not provide sign language interpreters; however, arrangements are made for interpreters accompanying deaf members of the public to operate from a suitable place in the Gallery.
<P>

To ask the Chairman of the Accommodation and Works Committee if he will list those publicly accessible rooms within the Palace of Westminster and associated buildings which are fitted with an induction loop to assist persons who wear hearing aids. [18957]

 The Accommodation and Works Committee has responsibility only for those areas of the parliamentary estate administered by the House of Commons. There are no publicly accessible rooms in outbuildings administered by the House of Commons which are fitted with induction loops. Induction loops are installed in the following places within the Palace of Westminster administered by the House of Commons:

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 We are deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Tibet. We take every opportunity to raise the issue of human rights with the Chinese authorities, both nationally and with our European Union partners. Both my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and I did so most recently when we met the Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister in London between 3 November and 6 November.

<a name="71208w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Fatchett </B>

<P>

<a name="71208w02.html_para1">It remains the Government's view that Libya should comply with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions by surrendering the two accused for trial in Scotland or the United States, since any other solution will reflect quite wrongly on the quality and standards of justice in either jurisdiction.

To ask the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the terms of reference and work programme of the Social Exclusion Unit. [20004]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w02.html_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 I today launched the Social Exclusion Unit at Stockwell Park School Lambeth. Social exclusion is a shorthand label for what can happen when individuals or areas suffer from a combination of linked problems such as unemployment, poor skills, low incomes, poor housing, high crime environments, bad health and family breakdown. The Government have policies that are targeted at reducing all of these individually, but Government programmes have been less good at tackling the interaction between these problems or preventing them from arising in the first place.
<P>

<a name="71208w02.html_para2">The purpose of the unit is to help break this vicious circle and co-ordinate and improve Government action to reduce social exclusion by first improving understanding of the key characteristics of social exclusion, and the impact on it of Government policies; and, secondly, by promoting solutions, encouraging co-operation, disseminating best practice and, where necessary, making recommendations for changes in policies and machinery or delivery mechanisms. The unit will not cover issues 



<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1997 : Column: 409</I><P>
which are of interest to one Department only, or duplicate work done elsewhere. It will focus on areas where it can add value and address the long-term causes of exclusion.
<P>

<a name="71208w02.html_para3">I have asked the Unit to focus on the following priorities in its first phase to July 1998:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) Truancy and School Exclusion: to make a step change in the scale of truancy and exclusions from school, and to find better solutions for those who have to be excluded--with a report to Ministers by Easter.
<P>
<BR>
(b) Street living: reducing to as near zero as possible the numbers sleeping rough in towns and cities--with a report to Ministers by Easter.
<P>
<BR>
(c) Worst estates: developing integrated and sustainable approaches to the problems of the worst housing estates, including crime, drugs, unemployment, community breakdown, bad schools, etc.--with a report by June.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="71208w02.html_para4">I will chair one summit involving key interests on each of these topics, starting with one on school exclusion and truancy at Stockwell Park School this morning.
<P>

<a name="71208w02.html_para5">In addition, in its first phase, the unit will focus on improving mechanisms for integrating the work of departments, local authorities and other agencies at national level and on the ground, so money spent on excluded groups is used more effectively and has more chance of meeting its objectives. There will be a first report to Ministers by the end of June next year. Secondly, it will feed in to the Comprehensive Spending Reviews any recommendations for redirection of priorities arising from the unit's initial work. Finally, it will draw up key indicators of social exclusion, recommending how these can be tracked to monitor the effectiveness of Government policies in reducing social exclusion and will report to ministers by the end of June.
<P>

<a name="71208w02.html_para6">The unit should draw on its experience with these first tasks to make recommendations on possible targets for the second half of 1998. Particular areas could include identifying key preventive interventions with children and young people; probing aspects of exclusion which disproportionately affect particular ethnic minority groups; options for improving access to services, public and private, for low income areas or individuals; and ways to encourage and focus individual and business involvement in tackling social exclusion. The unit will discuss those and other areas with interested groups before making recommendations.
<P>

<a name="71208w02.html_para7">The unit is part of the Economic and Domestic Affairs Secretariat in the Cabinet Office. It will report to me and work closely with the No. 10 Policy unit. It will be staffed by civil servants from other Whitehall departments and secondees from local authorities, voluntary bodies and other main agencies. It is being set up for an initial period of two years and its future will then be reviewed. The Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will consider how best to tackle social exclusion, taking account of the particular needs and characteristics of their respective communities. The Social Exclusion Unit will work closely with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish offices and the unit's findings will be made available to these departments.
<P>

<a name="71208w02.html_para8">I will steer the work of the unit personally and chair regular meetings with relevant Ministers to review the initiative. Policy decisions will be cleared through the appropriate Cabinet Committee, and implemented by the departments. I will report to Parliament next summer on 



<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1997 : Column: 410</I><P>
the work of the unit and on the forward agenda. Any policy changes proposed will have clear targets and evaluation plans. To build on the unit's cross-departmental focus, I have nominated a network of Ministers in the Departments most affected, to draw together exclusion issues in their own departments, and to help present and guide the unit's work as follows; the Minister for Local Government and Housing, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Bradley), the Minister for School Standards, the Minister for Public Health, the Minister without Portfolio, the Minister of State, Home Office, the Paymaster General, the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry.
<P>

<a name="71208w02.html_para9">The unit will draw extensively on outside expertise and research, and lock into relevant external networks to hear views from local authorities, business, voluntary organisations and other organisations/individuals with experience of dealing with exclusion.

The Cleaner Vehicles Task Force aims to create a new partnership between Government and the private sector to promote environmentally friendly vehicles that people actually want to drive and buy. It will draw on a cross-section of industry, including the oil industry, and I welcome the participation of a wide range of interests. The members of the Task Force's steering group were nominated by the Minister for Transport, in close consultation with the Science, Energy and Industry Minister and officials from the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Department of Trade and Industry.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many prosecutions have taken place against employers for unsafe and dangerous working practices in the construction industry so far in 1997; and if he will make a statement. [18571]

<P>
<a name="71208w03.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 I regret that this question cannot be answered accurately in the form in which it has been asked. Between 1 January 1997 and 31 October 1997, there were 376 convictions obtained in proceedings instituted by HSE in the construction industry. These figures, which are only provisional, include all those prosecuted. Some offences may have been committed by the self-employed who by their actions put other workers, or members of the public, at risk. In addition, offences by those such as clients and designers, who may have had no direct control of working practices, but who may have failed to play their part in overall risk management and control, are included. To eliminate these cases from the figures and revise the reporting period would involve disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="71208w03.html_para1">The best guide to the pattern of recent prosecutions in the construction industry is provided by Table A1.26 of Health and Safety Statistics 1996-97, which was published recently. A copy of Page 170 of the publication is attached for information.
<P>

<a name="71208w03.html_para2">The protection of the health and safety of all those working in, or affected by, the construction industry is a high priority. The prosecution of those who breach health and safety law and the penalties the courts impose are important aspects of achieving this protection.

This followed the inclusion of "living together as a couple" for the first time as a recognised relationship in the 1991 Census. It is not possible, therefore, to make comparisons with previous projections about assumed levels of cohabitation.
<P>

<a name="71208w04.html_para3">The levels of co-habitation assumed for the latest households projections were the 1992-based projections of marital status made by the Government Actuary's Department. A detailed description of the methodology and statistical assumptions underlying the latest household projections is set out in the annexes of "Projections in

Households in England to 2016", published by the Stationery Office in March 1995. The treatment of the marital status projections and cohabitation is provided in Annexes D and G of this publication, a copy of which is in the Library of the House.

<a name="71208w04.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Tom King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many homes were built in each English county between 1991 and 1996; and what change in the number of households was previously projected over those years. [18598]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The information requested is provided below. The total number of new dwellings built, by county, covers the period from July 1991 to June 1996. The figures for successive sets of household projections are the differences between the published projected figures for mid-year 1996 and mid-year 1991. These are subject to rounding error as the published figures are only readily available to the nearest thousand.
<P>

<a name="71208w04.html_para4">It is not appropriate to make a direct comparison between the number of dwellings built between 1991 and 1996 and the projected number of households forming over that period, for two reasons. First, the household projections are not an estimate of the number of additional houses which have to be built in any period. Rather, they represent one of the factors to be taken into account by local planning authorities when arriving at figures for housing provision to be included in regional guidance and development plans. Secondly, the housebuilding figures do not include other sources of new dwellings such as conversions. Furthermore, the 1992-based household projections were not published until March 1995 and most county structure plans prepared since 1991 have used earlier household projections as the basis for planning housing provision.

 Of the counties that have adopted their structure plans after the publication of the Regional Planning Guidance for the region concerned, two have adopted housing figures lower than those in the RPG. In both cases the differences were marginal. The counties concerned were Buckinghamshire (64,000 compared to an RPG figure of 65,340) and Surrey (35,600 compared to an RPG figure of 36,000).

 The figures for shire counties and shire districts are shown in tables which I have placed in the Library. The 1997-98 figures for Revenue Support Grant and Standard Spending Assessments are not comparable with the provisional figures for 1998-99 because of changes in local authority functions (e.g. in relation to under-fives) and local government reorganisation (for 1998-99 this affects the county areas of Berkshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Devon, Essex, Hereford and Worcester/Worcestershire, Kent Lancashire, Nottinghamshire and Shropshire).

 HMS Daedalus was a former naval base and is where the Coastguard Agency leases accommodation for Search and Rescue (SAR) helicopter facilities from the Ministry of Defence. Following the announcement of HM Coastguard's five-year strategy, there will be no change to the Coastguard helicopter provision at Portland and Lee-on-Solent. New five-year contracts have been let recently to Bristows Helicopters Ltd. for the provision of Coastguard (SAR) helicopters at both locations thus ensuring their continuing presence until at least 2002. There are no plans to relocate these major SAR resources. The crewing of these helicopters is a matter for the contractor.

 [<i>holding answer 4 December 1997</i>]: The number of discharges which exceeded their consented limits in 1996 was 3,448. Inevitably, this headline figure disguises a considerable range of cases from marginal exceedances to substantial failures. The Agency brought 18 prosecutions under section 85(6) of the Water Resources Act 1991 for breaches of consent in 1996. All were successful and the fines imposed ranged from &#163;450 to &#163;10,000. However, the majority of prosecutions brought by the Agency are for the general offence of causing water pollution under section 85(1) of the 1991 Act. Some of these cases may also be attributable to a consented discharge. One of the reasons for the low number of prosecutions in relation to breaches of consent is that, on being notified of a failed sample, most dischargers take prompt action to remedy matters. In other cases, the Environment Agency may issue a formal caution.

 Any person having custody or control of slurry must store it in accordance with the requirements of the Control of Pollution (Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Fuel Oil) Regulations 1991. Slurry storage systems covered by the regulations include lagoons. The regulations require the base and walls of any effluent tank, channels and reception pit and the walls of any pipes to be impermeable. The regulations do not require a site investigation to be undertaken. However, no part of the storage tank, any effluent tank, channels, pipes or reception pit is to be situated within 10 metres of any inland freshwater which slurry could enter if it were to escape unless this has been agreed by the Environment Agency on the basis of suitable precautions to avoid any significant risk of pollution of controlled waters.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the Government's target for a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010 is contingent upon the carbon dioxide emission targets of other countries; and if he will make a statement. [19264]

 Our domestic aim is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. After Kyoto we will be launching a national debate on how we might move over time towards this level of reduction. However, this is not an offer to take on a legally binding target of 20 per cent. regardless of the commitments other countries are prepared to make. In Kyoto we are supporting the EU proposal that all developed countries should reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases to 15 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010.

 As a first stage, we will consult next year on a programme of measures which will largely focus on delivering our legally binding commitment from Kyoto. We will also launch a national debate on how we might move over time towards our 20 per cent. aim. Our programme must take account of decisions reached at Kyoto, including those on targets, policies and measures, and the scope for using instruments such as emissions trading and joint implementation. It must also reflect the outcome of a number of policy reviews in progress, such as on renewable energy and development of an integrated transport policy.

 The House Sales Scheme operated by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive broadly mirrors the Right to Buy scheme operated by housing authorities in England and Wales. Its operation is a matter for the Executive's Chief Executive and it would be improper for me to intervene. The Chief Executive informs me that the period of residency in Executive or other social housing determines the percentage discount that a tenant may qualify for, against the valuation price of the house. The basic rules for purchase are that, with certain exceptions, tenants may purchase the dwelling they are living in. The exceptions are sheltered dwellings and those dwellings considered suitable for the elderly, the rationale being that there is constant demand for these properties and it is likely to increase. In the case of dwellings considered suitable for the elderly, such dwellings are single storey properties and ground floor accommodation with no more than two bedrooms and which have been let to, or are for, someone over age 60. Where a dwelling was let to someone over 60 at the time

<P>

<P>
<a name="71208w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply. Under the New Deal for 18 to 24-year-olds, young people undertaking training as child carers through the Full Time Education and Training option will spend up to 12 months in full-time study towards approved qualifications at NVQ Level 2 or, exceptionally, NVQ Level 3. Those undertaking training through the Employment or Voluntary Sector options will study for a minimum of the equivalent of one day per week, for up to 6 months, towards approved qualifications at NVQ Level 2 or, if appropriate, Level 3.

<P>

<P>
<a name="71208w08.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The Government have pledged to reduce class sizes for all five, six or seven-year-olds to 30 or below. We will achieve this by the end of the Parliament. The School Standards and Framework Bill will impose a duty on LEAs and schools to comply with class size limits prescribed by the Secretary of State. Until such limits come into force, there may continue to be circumstances in which infant class sizes exceed 30. This may, very occasionally, follow a direction under section 431 of the Education Act 1996. In the case of St. Andrew's School in Weeley, the Secretary of State decided that the LEA's direction should stand.

 The Full-Time Education and Training Option in the New Deal for unemployed people aged 18 to 24 is primarily aimed at helping young people who do not hold qualifications at or above N/SVQ2 or equivalent. In circumstances where it will clearly enhance their employability, young people who already hold Level 2 qualifications will be able to work towards a higher level qualification.

 Job focus courses run at Gloucester prison and other prisons in England and Wales are funded by the Employment Service of the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE). A decision was made a year ago to cease funding for these courses and concentrate resources on people already in the labour market.

The governor of Gloucester prison will maintain the job focus club by continuing the involvement of the prison officer but does not have the resources available to replace the funding from DfEE for the tutor.

 The Home Office Central London Estate, which comprises six buildings, has a total of 155 car park spaces. Ministerial vehicles are parked in the outside courtyard of the Home Office. No other spaces are normally provided for Ministers. Eighteen are reserved for staff with medical or child care needs. The remainder are used for staff, visitors and contractors as appropriate to their needs. Figures for the rest of the Home Office estate could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

 The Government share a number of concerns about the anomalous and complex nature of the current arrangements for paying compensation to Service personnel who are killed, injured or suffer serious illness as a result of their service. Experience from the Gulf conflict and operations in Bosnia underline the need for arrangements which properly reflect the special nature of the commitment which Service men and women make to the defence of our country.
<P>

<a name="71208w11.html_para1">We have therefore decided there should be a comprehensive review of the arrangements for compensating Service personnel (or their dependants) and for the payment of death and invaliding pension benefits. Our aim is to devise a modern, fair and simplified scheme which could apply to all Service personnel injured or 



<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1997 : Column: 441</I><P>
killed on peacetime duties--in training or on operations--where death or injury was attributable to military service, to replace the current complex arrangements.
<P>

<a name="71208w11.html_para2">The main aim of the review will be to recommend new arrangements for the future, but it will also examine the extent to which personnel currently serving may be able to benefit from a simpler and more comprehensive approach. The War Pensions Scheme will continue to be available to existing ex-Service personnel.
<P>

<a name="71208w11.html_para3">The review will be conducted jointly with the Department of Social Security, the Department responsible for the War Pensions Scheme. We intend to publish the results of the review in a consultation document.
<P>

<a name="71208w11.html_para4">A review of compensation for Service personnel was recommended in the House of Commons Defence Committee Sixth Report on Gulf War illness, published earlier this year. I hope that the whole House will support the initiative we are now taking.

As the UKHO operates in an international commercial market, the attainment of Trading Fund status has provided the UKIIO with additional flexibility to respond to commercial activities. In the first year of operating as a Trading Fund the UKHO achieved a net profit of &#163;3.7M which clearly demonstrates that costs are more than fully recovered by sales activities.<P>

 The timetable of payments has been delayed by the need to comply with additional information requirements to support European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) payments made after the start of the new EAGGF financial year on 16 October 1997. Without the new supporting information any payments made will be subject to disallowance by the European Commission. The Welsh Office has been working to address these new requirements and this has involved substantial computer reprogramming. The position on Sheep Annual Premium is that some 85 per cent. of first advances in Wales had been paid by early October, and the payment of the second advance is now well under way.

 My statement of 29 October 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 901-05 set out the Government's view of the future structure of the magistrates courts service. I believe there should be fewer and larger MCC areas, more closely aligned to the areas served by other justice agencies. My first priority is to consider the position of metropolitan areas. I have recently written to the Chairman of the West Riding MCC on this subject and have indicated that, in the absence of any proposals from the committees themselves concerning the organisation of MCCs in West Yorkshire, it is likely that I will wish to consider, in the autumn of 1998, whether amalgamation is appropriate in the area.

 We encourage the public to take unused medicines to a community pharmacy for safe destruction. This reduces the risk of accidental ingestion, especially by children, and allows the medicines to be destroyed in line with environmental law. Prescription-only medicines have to be disposed of as clinical waste. Funding has been made available to the National Health Service since 1993 to run schemes through community pharmacies for the safe disposal of waste medicines. As at 31 March 1997 schemes were running in every health authority area in England and Wales, and 98 per cent. of community pharmacies in these areas were taking part in these schemes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps his Department has taken to combat recent outbreaks of meningitis. [19012]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w14.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Department takes meningococcal disease very seriously.
<P>

<a name="71208w14.html_para2">Guidance on the control of meningococcal infection is issued by the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS). The most recent guidelines were issued on 8 December 1995 and guidance on the management of clusters of meningococcal disease was issued in January 1997. Copies of this guidance are sent to all Directors of Public Health and local Consultants in Communicable Disease Control and it is published. The guidance is constantly under review and careful thought is given to whether any lessons can be learnt from any incident and to whether any revision of the guidance might be required. The guidance was last reviewed on 21 November 1997 drawing on recent experiences in Southampton and it was agreed that no change to the guidance was necessary.
<P>

<a name="71208w14.html_para3">PHLS experts are routinely involved in dealing with serious outbreaks of disease. Advice on the diagnosis of meningitis is contained in the Department's memorandum "Immunisation against infectious disease" which is provided free to all doctors. Additionally, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) writes annually to all doctors alerting them to the expected winter rise in cases of meningococcal infection and reminding them of the value of early antibiotic treatment and urgent referral to hospital. The Department contributes to the many information articles in newspapers and the medical press, and television and radio programmes that appear during the winter increase in cases.
<P>

<a name="71208w14.html_para4">The CMO also holds an annual press briefing for journalists to raise public, professional and media awareness of meningococcal disease. This year's briefing was held on 3 November and CMO was supported by representatives of the National Meningitis Trust and the Meningitis Research Foundation. The vital message at the briefing was that, in the absence of an effective meningococcal Group C vaccine suitable for routine use, and with no Group B vaccine at all, it remained essential that parents and, in places of further education, students, are aware of the signs and symptoms of meningitis and 



<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1997 : Column: 458</I><P>
septicaemia and remain alert to seek urgent treatment if illness is suspected. Information materials continue to stress this message as well. This year, the Department's information leaflet "Knowing about meningitis and septicaemia" has been rewritten; it is available to the public from general practitioners' surgeries. The Health Education Authority (HEA), funded by the Department, has also relaunched its leaflet, "Look out for your mate", which is targeted at students. This year about 1.2 million "Look out for your mate" fliers and posters were distributed to over 750 colleges in England and Wales; 4,000 leaflets and 40 posters were sent to Southampton University before the recent outbreaks there. Information on recognising the signs and symptoms of meningitis is provided to new parents in the HEA's booklet "A Guide to Childhood immunisations". The Department also provides funding under Section 64 of the Health and Personal Social Services Act to support the work of the two meningitis charities in raising awareness among health care professionals.
<P>

<a name="71208w14.html_para5">Studies to evaluate meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines in United Kingdom children, funded by the Department at a total cost of over &#163;1 million, are being carried out by the PHLS in collaboration with the National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls, the Centre of Applied Microbiology and Research and the Institute for Child Health. These studies have shown very encouraging results already for Group C vaccines and early indicators for Group B are encouraging. There are reasonable prospects that these vaccines will eventually be able to induce long-term immunity although more research is needed before their suitability for widespread use can be considered.

 Resources are not allocated to fund particular services or costs. It is for health authorities and general practitioners to use these resources to plan and arrange services for their residents, following an assessment of their needs, and to make decisions about the level of resources required for any particular service.

<a name="71208w16.html_para1">It is for a patent owner to give permission for someone else to use his invention by granting a licence. The terms of this licence is a matter for the patent owner and the potential licensee. As separate legal entities, trusts, individually or as members of consortia are in a position to negotiate their own patent licences. Genetic testing is usually provided through clinical genetic services purchased by health authorities for their local population.

<UL>Mr. Banks: My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, my hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health and I recently met governing bodies of sports in receipt of tobacco sponsorship. We discussed how to end tobacco advertising and sponsorship while minimising any damage to the sports concerned. Agreement has now been reached on the EU Directive and as a result, all sports have five years in which to find alternative sponsors. I am also setting up a task force of sports and business interests to help them do just that.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the number of parents without care (normally known as absent parents) that have maintenance outstanding in excess of &#163;15,000.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The number of maintenance assessments completed and recorded on the Child Support Computer System currently stands at approximately 679,000; at 19 November 1997, the total number of cases with more than &#163;15,000 of maintenance arrears outstanding was 18,890.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In 90% of these cases (16,912), the arrears recorded as outstanding are the result of a Category A interim maintenance assessment. This measure, which sets maintenance at a punitive rate for absent parents who fail to co-operate, is imposed until the Agency is provided with the information needed to complete a full maintenance assessment. The Agency issued many interim maintenance assessments in its first two years--73,303 in 93/94. The emphasis now is to encourage absent parents to co-operate early and therefore avoid building up excessive maintenance arrears; the number of interim maintenance assessments has now greatly reduced to 11,718 in 1996/97.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From April 1995 regulations were changed, so that the liability under an interim maintenance assessment reverts to the level of the full maintenance assessment once the absent parent co-operates; once sufficient information is provided to complete a full maintenance assessment in the interim maintenance cases the amount of arrears actually owed will be considerably reduced.

<a name="71208w21.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>Agenda 2000</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what is his assessment of the impact in the United Kingdom of Agenda 2000 on each of the agricultural sectors where proposals have been made. [19549]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 Formal legislative proposals to implement the ideas outlines in Agenda 2000 are not expected to be published by the European Commission until the first part of 1998.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food pursuant to the Sixth Report of the Select Committee on European Legislation's considerations of Agenda 2000 (HC 155-vi), if he will list the environmental and rural development measures referred to in paragraph 2.5; which Commission rural policy and targeted agri-environmental measures referred to in paragraph 2.6 he supports and for what reasons; if he will set out the basis for his calculation of the savings to consumers in paragraph 2.7; and which member states had the difficulties with the proposed level of the cuts in support prices for cereals and milk referred to in paragraph 2.8; and for what reasons. [19594]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 No. I will formulate my detailed response to the Commission's legislative proposals giving effect to Agenda 2000 when they are tabled next year.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what proportion of its EU budget he estimates would be spent on agriculture if the current Agenda 2000 proposals were adopted in full. [19545]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 The Commission estimate that the agricultural guideline would stand at 50 billion ecu in 2006 (at 1997 prices), out of total budgetary commitments of 114.5 billion ecu. The Commission envisages that actual spending on agriculture would be less than the guidelines, at 46 billion ecu (at 1997 prices). This estimate includes expenditure in new Member States and on pre-accession aid for countries which have yet to join the EU.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if the United Kingdom will press the Council to review the level of its agriculture guidelines as part of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. [19541]




<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1997 : Column: 487</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 Decisions on the level of the agricultural guideline are for ECOFIN, not the Agriculture Council. The Commission has proposed keeping the method of calculating the guideline unchanged and reviewing this in about 2005. The UK will be pressing for agricultural spending to be set well below the guideline, which should be a ceiling, not a target, as I made clear at the November Agriculture Council.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the way in which Agenda 2000 will affect the prospects for the production of bio-mass for energy usage. [19544]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 It is not yet clear what effect Agenda 2000 will have on the prospects for the production of biomass for energy usage. While the Commission's paper recognises that renewable energy crops represent a new opportunity for agriculture, forestry and rural job creation, it also proposes to suspend obligatory set-aside and reduce the aid for voluntary set-aside, measures which currently support these crops.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food which proposals in Agenda 2000 will help <i>(a)</i> improve the environment, <i>(b)</i> encourage reduced usage of agro-chemicals, <i>(c) </i>protect wildlife, <i>(d)</i> increase organic production, <i>(e)</i> prepare the community for enlargement, <i>(f)</i> assist the community to negotiate successfully in the next World Trade Organisation round, <i>(g)</i> enable the Community's expenditure on agriculture to stay within its guidelines, <i>(h)</i> allow efficient British farmers to prosper, <i>(i)</i> require environmental objectives to be achieved before CAP payments are made or received, <i>(j)</i> set environmental objectives for the CAP, <i>(k)</i> encourage the production of non-food crops, <i>(l) </i>affect forestry, <i>(m)</i> help the beef sector and <i>(n) </i>affect hill farmers. [19546]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 In the Government's view, the Agenda 2000 proposals are a step in the right direction towards a market-oriented CAP with less production-related support and more emphasis on agri-environmental and rural development objectives. A CAP which is radically reformed along these lines, as favoured by the Government, should be beneficial in most of the areas identified by the right hon. Member.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimate he has made of the required increase in productivity in each sector affected by the Agenda 2000 proposals to trigger a reduction in levels of direct payments; and what recommendations the United Kingdom Government will make on this matter to the Council. [19539]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 None. In the Government's view, direct payments should be time-limited and degressive, giving producers time to adjust their businesses to a market-oriented system which does not rely on production-related subsidies.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if Agenda 2000 is to be fully implemented before further Community enlargement takes place. [19540]




<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1997 : Column: 488</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is essential to enable the EU to meet its future challenges, including early successful enlargement. I will use our Presidency to launch negotiations in the Agriculture Council as soon as the Commission's legislative reform proposals appear.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for what reasons peas and beans will receive supplementary aid under the Commission's proposals for Agenda 2000. [19550]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 The Commission has explained the purpose of its proposal as being to maintain the competitiveness of protein crops with cereals and to encourage their production.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will publish the environmental impact studies of Agenda 2000 carried out by his Ministry or any of its specialised advisory groups. [19542]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 My Department is in the process of commissioning one project from the Centre for Agricultural Strategy at Reading to assess the implications of Agenda 2000 for land use in England and Wales, using the Land Use Allocation Model, and another desk top study to identify the likely consequences for the environment if the Agenda 2000 reforms are implemented. It is normal practice to allow researchers to publish the results of their work.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the impact of Agenda 2000 on the countryside stewardship scheme; and if he will make a statement. [19538]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 In the absence of detailed legislative proposals, the impact of Agenda 2000 on the Countryside Stewardship Scheme cannot be assessed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) if the removal of crop specific payments for oilseeds proposed under Agenda 2000 will end the requirements for a maximum area for these crops; [19547]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the compatibility of the Agenda 2000 proposals for non-specific payments in respect of oilseed crops with existing World Trade Organisation rules. [19548]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 The compatibility with WTO rules of any trade arrangement can only be definitively determined under WTO dispute settlement procedures. The Commission's preliminary view, which we share, is that the introduction of a non-crop specific aid for oilseeds would relieve the EU from the restrictions on the maximum area of oilseeds laid down in the 1992 Blair House Agreement between the EU and the USA.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the financial effects which Agenda 2000 will have on the United Kingdom beef sector; and if he will make a statement. [19543]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 The effects of the Commission's proposals for the reform of the beef regime will depend upon the extent to which the proposed cut in support prices is reflected in market prices.




<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1997 : Column: 489</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at what rate and over what time scale under the terms of Agenda 2000 the Government propose that direct payments should be decoupled from production and reduced. [19537]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w21.html_spnew14"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 The Commission has not yet tabled legislative proposals to implement the ideas set out in the Agenda 2000 series of papers. The Government will respond appropriately to those proposals when we receive them.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food pursuant to his answer of 27 November 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>640</i>, on food safety, what factors in respect of the management of risk his research programme is examining; what are the programme's findings to date on the public perceptions of food safety risk; which other relevant opinion surveys he has assessed; and what were their results. [19595]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w22.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 My Department's risk management research programme, which has been running for five years, covers all aspects of risk management including perceptions of risk, the way that risk messages are received by the public, risk communication and methods by which consumer views on food safety might be best taken into account in decision making. Other relevant opinion surveys are published by others, such as, for example, the Consumers Association, as a result of research into a variety of food-related issues.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w22.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 The proposed changes to the guidelines would have a significant impact on a number of bodies under my Department's sponsorship and, following representations from several of these, both my noble Friend the Parliamentary Secretary and I, have raised the matter with colleagues at the Department of Trade and Industry.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will list those elements of his hill farming policy which are compatible with Article 33 of the treaty establishing the European Community. [19536]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71208w22.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 Hill farmers receive specific financial help via the Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances scheme. This has been approved under the terms of the EC farm structures Regulation 950//97, and is therefore compatible with Article 33 (ex 39) of the Treaty.
