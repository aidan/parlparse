To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the statistical reliability of the calculation of average wage levels using the <i>(a)</i> New Earnings survey and <i>(b)</i> Labour Force survey.  [122518]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w01.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B>

<P>

<a name="30703w01.html_para1"><i>Letter from Len Cook to Mr. Michael Foster, dated 2 July 2003:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question on the statistical reliability of average earnings data from the New Earnings Survey and the Labour Force Survey. (122518)</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Earnings data from the New Earnings Survey (NES) and from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) are valuable in different circumstances. The NES data are available annually and are based on a larger sample than those from the LFS. The LFS data are available quarterly and for a wider range of population sub-groups than from the NES. An article describing the background and uses of ONS average earnings data was published in the February 2003 edition of "Labour Market Trends", a copy of which can be found in the Library.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Sampling errors have been calculated for both NES and LFS estimates and are available from the National Statistics website (www.statistics.gov.uk). Given the smaller sample size of the LFS, the sampling errors tend to be larger than the equivalent NES sampling errors.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Following an extensive quality review of the NES last year the survey is currently undergoing a significant redevelopment to further improve the quality of the estimates. The action plan for implementing the results of this review are also on the National Statistics website (www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=280). This will reduce known biases in the existing survey which arise principally from the fact that the sample only includes employees who are on Pay As You Earn tax schemes, but also because of differential response rates by size of business and region.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Edwards: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will review <i>(a)</i> the procedures for transferring entitlement to child benefit to a surviving patient on the death of the parent with care and <i>(b)</i> the case of Mr. Roger Grey, a constituent.  [121447]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Where a child benefit claimant dies and their partner wants to claim child benefit instead, he or she needs to make a new claim. They have up to three months to do this and not suffer a break in their right to payment. The Inland Revenue aims to do all it can, in such cases, to ensure claims are processed as quickly as possible and to maintain continuity of payment.
<P>

<a name="30703w01.html_para2">I cannot comment on the specific case you mention but I can assure you that the Inland Revenue is continuing to look at how to improve the service provided to customers in this situation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Tynan: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what provision has been made by the Inland Revenue to deal with <i>(a)</i> changes in payments and <i>(b)</i> written and telephone queries in respect of child tax credit for term-time workers during the summer months.  [122880]




<P>
<P><I>3 Jul 2003 : Column 369W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 A term-time worker who has responsibility for one or more children will be able to claim child tax credit, which is paid direct by the Inland Revenue. Child tax credit is not related to work status.
<P>

<a name="30703w01.html_para3">Tax credit awards for 2003&#150;04 are initially based on the family's current circumstances and their income for the 2001&#150;02 tax year. They may be adjusted during the year for changes in income or circumstances. Final entitlement for the year will be based on circumstances during the year and the income for 2003&#150;04, if that is lower than 2001&#150;02 income or more than &#163;,500 higher.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 30 June 2003]:</i> As stated in the Budget, entitlement to the child trust fund will be backdated to include children born from September 2002. We expect child trust fund accounts to be available by 2005.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 June 2003]</i>: Full proposals for the child trust fund will be published later in the summer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Kaufman: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he intends to reply to the letter to him dated 22 May 2003 from the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton with regard to Ms J. Knowles.  [122874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Inland Revenue replied on behalf of the Chancellor on 20 June 2003. The Tax Credit Office aims to reply to 80 per cent. of complaints within 15 working days and will measure their performance and report against that aim in due course.

<P>

<a name="30703w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Willetts: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many staff <i>(a)</i> have been and <i>(b)</i> will be transferred from the Department for Work and Pensions to the Treasury as a result of the introductions of the various tax credits.  [121219]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo:  </B> 
There have been no transfers of staff from the DWP to the Treasury (or Inland Revenue) as a direct result of the introduction of the child and working tax credits and none are planned. The Inland Revenue's Annual Report to 31 March 2000 (CM 5029) shows&#151;at page 33&#151;that the equivalent of around 3,700 full time staff were transferred from the Benefits Agency to the Inland Revenue when WFTC/DPTC were introduced in October 1999.
<P>

<a name="30703w01.html_para4">Responsibility for administering the child and working tax credits rests with Inland Revenue. The DWP will continue to deliver a one-stop system of support for working age customers, including transacting their tax credits business.

 The Government keep the tax regime under constant review to ensure that it continues to deliver its key objectives. The Government have recently consulted on radical proposals to simplify the taxation of pension savings. We are now considering responses to the consultation from around 380 organisations and individuals. There are no other current plans to alter the tax treatment of tax exempt savings products.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w03.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 For taxpayers reaching pension age who do not complete a tax return, the Inland Revenue will either have their date of birth in their records or find out from the Department of Work and Pensions that they are about to become entitled to their state pension. In these cases, they send the new pensioner a short form to obtain details of their income so that they can give them the full range of allowances to which they are entitled.
<P>

<a name="30703w03.html_para1">Once the Revenue has received details of the person's date of birth, they will use this information to give the higher allowance once the person reaches 75.
<P>

<a name="30703w03.html_para2">If for any reason the individual does not get the allowances they are entitled to, they should get in contact with their Revenue office.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w03.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Inland Revenue makes arrangements to pay tax credits via giro cheque when suitable banking facilities are not available. When such facilities become available, and if direct payments are still due to be made, the arrangements are changed to make the payments direct into the recipients' accounts. Such changes are being made continually, and it is not possible to establish for which recipients we are currently expecting to pay their next payment via girocheque, except at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w03.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Award notices cover child tax credit and working tax credit together, if appropriate. At the end of May 2003, when about 3.7 million claims were already in payment, about 4,600 written appeals against tax credit decisions had been received but not yet settled. These cover disagreements about award notices that have been reported in writing, but exclude those that are effectively reporting changes in circumstances. They include both specific disagreements about elements of the award and more general observations on the level of award or the calculation method.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w03.html_spnew8"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to Chart 5.1 in the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report (Budget 2003). It illustrates that a small number of families with children in the top 10 per cent. of the income scale will receive a smaller award of child tax credit than of the tax credits it has replaced. However, it also shows that even these families are on average around &#163;5 a week better off due to the extra support this Government have given to families with children since 1997.

 This year, the Inland Revenue will treat tax credits claims received before midnight on the first full working day after the deadline as qualifying for full backdating. This is to make sure that claims received by different routes are treated alike and recognises that the deadline falls at the weekend. So claims the Inland Revenue receive by midnight on Monday 7 July will be backdated to 6 April 2003, where appropriate.

<P>

<a name="30703w04.html_para4">These accruals adjustments are defined as the difference between taxes accruing for the year and actual cash receipts in that year. They can vary considerably from year to year and from tax to tax reflecting changes to the timing of cash payments, changes to the tax system, behavioural changes by taxpayers and the rate of growth of the tax base. A combination of these factors explains the increase between 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04. As explained in paragraph C85 of Budget 2003, this is partly because of the effect of the national insurance contributions measures announced in Budget 2002.

 The Department commissioned an independent review of the effectiveness of cycle helmets which was published in 2002. This report included an assessment of the evidence of the impact of bicycle helmet legislation on helmet wearing rates, injuries and levels of bicycling. The report concludes that bicycle helmet legislation has been associated with head injury reductions. A case study of Victoria in Australia found evidence that post legislation there was a marked decrease in casualty rates per head of population. Reductions in levels of cycling and other road safety activities were recorded which may account for some of the casualty reductions.

<P>
<a name="30703w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government supports the development and use of transport fuels which offer proven environmental benefits. We do this primarily by means of fuel duty incentives, and, as appropriate, grants to offset the additional cost of alternatively fuelled vehicles. Many alternatively fuelled vehicles also qualify for reduced rates of Vehicle Excise Duty and company car tax.
<P>

<a name="30703w05.html_para8">The Chancellor of the Exchequer takes decisions on fuel duty levels and other transport tax issues on a Budget by Budget basis.

<P>

In the light of this, decisions on future duty rates and other forms of support for LPG are due to be announced in the 2003 Pre-Budget Report.

 This information is not held centrally for the period since national roll-out of the order in October 2000. An evaluation of three pilot projects found that the average amount spent on drugs by offenders subject to Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs) fell from &#163;400 per week in the four weeks before arrest to &#163;25 per week in the first four to six weeks of the Order. These reductions were largely maintained over time, with 87 per cent. of those who had completed the Order by the end of the pilot phase reporting that, except for their use of cannabis, they were drug free.

 Reference to an area without internal borders is made in the existing Treaty establishing the European Community and the draft EU Constitutional Treaty. The existing Treaty is subject to the UK and Ireland's "frontiers' protocol" which gives the UK the right under the Treaties to exercise at its frontiers with other member states such controls on persons seeking to enter the United Kingdom as it considers necessary. The Protocols will remain an integral part of the new Treaty. The Government's position on this issue has not changed: we will maintain controls at the UK's frontiers.

 The performance of the Immigration and Nationality Enquiry Bureau (INEB) has improved significantly in recent months. It is now answering between 24,000 and 25,000 calls a week compared to 17,000 a week at the beginning of this year. Callers now regularly get through to the Bureau in one or two attempts and average time in a queue has reduced from six minutes to two minutes.

 The information requested is detailed in the table. The Prison Service's incident reporting system records the number of acts of concerted indiscipline rather than "riots". Similarly, acts of passive concerted indiscipline are recorded rather than the number of protests or sit down protests. In the course of the 12 months from June 2002 to May 2003, the number of assaults recorded was 11,462. The figures in the table are of those assaults which resulted in an injury to either staff or prisoners. The Prison Service does not have a category for "disturbances".

 Taking into account the composition of the waste stream, and in particular the low recycling rate and the toxicity of the waste product, we will be looking over the next 12 months at the scope for a voluntary producer responsibility agreement to increase the recycling of waste consumer batteries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 June 2003]:</i> The Environment Agency regulates gaseous emissions from landfill and hazardous waste sites to minimise the damage to the environment and risk to human health. In particular, the Agency requires that appropriate measures are taken to control the accumulation and migration of landfill gas. Typically this will involve the active collection, treatment and combustion of landfill gas to minimise the potential impacts.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what statutory framework regulates the discharge of untreated hazardous liquid waste directly to sewage treatment plants for disposal; and if she will list the permitted chemical and biological components of such waste.  [122756]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Sewerage undertakers have powers to control and reduce discharges of substances such as untreated hazardous liquid waste into sewers. If they consider the discharge constitutes trade effluent, their consent is required in accordance with the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991. The consent may set conditions and require the elimination or diminution of any specified constituent of the trade effluent before it enters the sewer. Such a discharge without the undertaker's agreement is a criminal offence.
<P>

<a name="30703w08.html_para9">Applications for any special category effluent have to be referred to the Environment Agency before consent can be given. Where the effluent is produced as part of a prescribed process, it will also require a permit from the Agency under the Environment Act 1995 and the Pollution, Prevention and Control Regulations 2000 (SI 2000/1973).
<P>

<a name="30703w08.html_para10">Where a sewerage undertaker agrees to accept liquid waste delivered to a sewage works by road tanker, the reception, storage, and pre-treatment of the waste is additionally controlled by waste management law (a waste management licence or Pollution Prevention Control Permit depending upon the activities and their scale). The final effluent produced by the works and released back into the environment must meet the conditions or standards required in a Discharge Consent issued by the Environment Agency under the Water Resources Act 1991.
<P>

<a name="30703w08.html_para11">No list of permitted chemical and biological components exists as such. Each case has to be assessed individually and will depend on the capabilities of the specific treatment works and the quality standards to be achieved in the receiving waters.

 Dilution is not generally considered to be the best practicable environmental option for disposal of hazardous waste, although technically it would be possible to operate such a process subject to the conditions of an environmental licence or authorisation (permit) to ensure the protection of the environment and human health.

 The Department has begun a review of animal welfare legislation relating to captive, domestic and sporting animals.

The new legislation would be pro-active and would allow action to be taken before an animal suffers if it is not being given appropriate care. Areas for consideration under the new Bill include licensing of livery yards and a statutory code of practice on tethering. My Department has been in consultation with a number or interested parties about the review and we aim to have a public consultation on a draft Bill early next year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We believe there may be environmental and commercial benefits in a deposit and return system for some bottles and other containers. A deposits system would involve the public directly in waste collection and this would help to change the culture of waste collection and recycling.
<P>

<a name="30703w09.html_para0">We are currently investigating the deposit systems used in other European countries. Some of these countries have reported very high administrative costs, which could make these schemes a more expensive way of recycling products than other collection methods. Some countries have reported benefits from such systems, particularly in terms of higher recycling rates, but sometimes these occur in the countries which have high packaging waste recycling targets and it is not clear that deposit systems on their own would deliver high recycling rates in a cost-effective way.
<P>

<a name="30703w09.html_para1">We would therefore need to consider both the costs and benefits of a possible deposit scheme in the United Kingdom.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what discussions her Department has had with her European counterparts since April 2002 on removing European Union obstacles to the ban on live exports and their replacement by meat exports; and if she will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="30703w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 July 2003]</i>: Judgments in the European Court of Justice have confirmed that a ban on the live export of animals would be illegal under the Treaty of Rome. Instead of seeking a ban, we have continued to press in the Agriculture Council for the European Commission to bring forward

improved controls for the welfare of animals during transport. Commissioner David Byrne has now said that he expects to produce these long overdue proposals in July 2003. Most of our exports are of meat. We are supporting action to improve competitiveness in the red meat food chain with a view to strengthening meat supply chains both at home and in export markets.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent estimate she has made of the quantity of methane which is being released annually by the northward retreat of permafrost and the consequent impact on climate change.  [122666]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 June 2003]:</i> Methane concentrations have increased by a factor of 2.5 since pre-industrial times and account for about 20 per cent. of the climate warming due to greenhouse gases. The increase in concentration is mostly due to increases in anthropogenic emissions (from sources such as landfills, energy production and biomass burning). We have no estimates for the current annual release rate from such areas but methane emissions from high-latitude permafrost areas are likely to have made a contribution to climate change due to greenhouse gases of less than 1 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 June 2003]:</i> The deal on CAP reform agreed by the Agriculture Council on 26 June 2003 represents a real shift in agricultural policy. It will provide a more sustainable basis for European agriculture and reflect the wider environmental and rural development objectives, which society seeks to achieve.
<P>

<a name="30703w10.html_para0">The first Euro5,000 of every recipient's subsidy is exempt from modulation. However, this means that the effective modulation rate is higher on farms in receipt of higher levels of subsidy. However, this should be viewed in the context of the whole package of reforms. An assessment of the economic impact of the Commission's January proposals on the long-term perspective for sustainable agriculture is available on the Defra website (http://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/reports/capreform.pdf), and an assessment of the impact of the outcome of the negotiations will be made available in future.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government do not give assistance specifically for this purpose, although there are many ways in which we support the work of charities in general and in which we promote the reuse and recycling of materials. We are always willing to receive representations and ideas about specific measures that would benefit either or both of these causes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government have no plans at present to prevent the export of recyclable materials for treatment. Our priority is to increase the amount of waste that is reused or recycled; to achieve these aims may necessitate the export of recyclate. The Government have taken action to increase recycling markets in the UK by setting up the Waste and Resources Action Programme, which was set up to lead on recycling market development in the United Kingdom.

<a name="30703w10.html_spnew6"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 In England and Wales it is estimated that there are 173,940 km of public rights of way that are footpaths. There are no figures held centrally to show how many miles of footpath are in use, and the information could be provided only at a disproportionate cost. However, the 1998 Day Visits Survey, which surveyed leisure day visits in both urban and rural areas, found that walking was a principal activity on approximately 930 million trips in England and Wales. The 2002 Leisure Day Visits Survey will be published in the autumn this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on her Department's assessment that the Waste Incineration Directive does not apply to on-farm drum incinerators and waste oil burners; whether her officials have discussed this interpretation with officials from the European Commission; and whether officials from the European Commission have expressed agreement in writing with this interpretation.  [122753]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In draft Guidance on Directive 2000/76/EC on the incineration of waste, published for consultation in February 2003, the Government expressed the view that the definition of "incineration plant" used in that Directive is not intended to encompass small units or appliances which would be incapable of complying with the requirements of the Directive under any circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30703w11.html_para2">The Directive includes provisions in relation to residence time, temperature control, monitoring, and compliance with emission limit values, which only plants of a reasonable size and technical sophistication would be capable of meeting. Small, basic units do not easily fit either the description "technical unit" which is used in the Directive definition or the scope of the incineration site which is evidently envisaged by this definition.
<P>

<a name="30703w11.html_para3">The Government consider that units which are not included within the scope of the Directive on this basis include on-farm drum incinerators and small space heaters or other waste oil burners (used for example on garage premises). However, operations of this type will continue to be controlled under the Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC as amended) which requires them to be subject to either a permit (Article 9) or the general rules of an exemption registered with the "competent authority" (Article 11). The objective of these controls is to ensure that waste is disposed of in ways which protect the environment and human health (Article 4).
<P>

<a name="30703w11.html_para4">This means that, on the proposed repeal of the exclusion for agricultural waste in section 75(7)(c) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the waste management controls of Part II of the 1990 Act and the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994 will apply to on-farm drum incinerators. Small space heaters and other waste oil burners are prescribed for local authority regulation under Part I of the 1990 Act and the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000.
<P>

<a name="30703w11.html_para5">The draft Guidance on Directive 2000/76/EC was issued for a consultation period which closed on 16 May. Officials are currently considering consultation responses with a view to finalising the Guidance later this year, still in plenty of time for the Directive's coming into force for existing installations from 28 December 2005. A copy of the finalised Guidance will be sent to the relevant officials in the European Commission, thus providing them with an opportunity to comment.

 <i>[holding answer 1 July 2003]:</i> The objective of the Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC as amended by 91/156/EEC) is to ensure that waste is disposed of without endangering human health or harming the environment (Article 4). The Directive's controls include the need for a permit (licence) for the disposal of waste and are supplemented by the requirements of the Hazardous Waste Directive (91/689/EEC) and the Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC). The Environment Agency is prescribed as a "competent authority" for the purposes of each Directive.
<P>

<a name="30703w11.html_para11">Paragraph 2 of Schedule 4 to the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994 imposes a duty on the Agency to discharge its functions relating to the disposal of waste with regard to the objectives of Article 4 of the Waste Framework Directive. These functions include the issuing of licences for landfill sites and the review of those licences. The purpose of licences and their conditions is to ensure that waste is disposed of without endangering human health or harming the environment.
<P>

<a name="30703w11.html_para12">Section 35(8) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 requires the Environment Agency to have regard to guidance issued to it by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, in the discharge of its licensing functions. The main guidance issued to the Agency under section 35(8) of the 1990 Act is set out in Waste Management Paper No.4 (ISBN 0&#150;11&#150;752727&#150;0) and deals with issues such as the operator's management systems and quality assurance (paragraphs 4.21- 4.25).
<P>

<a name="30703w11.html_para13">Subject to these considerations, it rests with the Environment Agency, in fulfilment of its functions as a "competent authority" and having regard to the facts of each case, to reach decisions on the effectiveness and quality of monitoring assessments undertaken by or on behalf of licence holders.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We will seek to apply voluntary producer responsibility agreements where they are the best option to deliver maximum environmental benefit. We believe the best approach is to assess which waste streams are particularly problematic and might therefore lend themselves most effectively to such agreements; to determine whether the development of such an agreement would be proportionate to the size of the problem; and what the financial and environmental costs and benefits of such agreements would be; and to establish whether the waste streams concerned are already the subject of other mechanisms, including regulations and the work of other organizations, such as WRAP.
<P>

<a name="30703w11.html_para14">At present, we have a voluntary producer responsibility agreement in place with the newspaper publishers. We hope shortly to reach agreement with the producers of direct mail and promotions and are talking to the magazine publishers about a possible agreement. Other waste materials which might be suitable for future voluntary agreements with industry are batteries and farm plastics.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The standards for small waste oil burners involve ensuring that the burners are designed to cater for waste oil and are maintained so that there is good combustion; that the content of the waste oil is within specified parameters; and that there is a chimney of a height sufficient to disperse and dilute the emissions. Given that these conditions are fulfilled, abatement equipment is not specified in the statutory guidance. The main other processes burning waste oil are in the minerals sector and power stations. We believe that the majority of the former achieve specified emission limits without the need for pollution abatement equipment. Power stations are fitted with abatement.

 The Government fully recognises the important role that sport can play in the regeneration of both urban and rural areas and in addressing a whole range of social issues such as better health, reduced crime and social inclusion. In particular the Policy Directions issued to Sport England in respect of the distribution of the Lottery Sports Fund require it, in deciding applications for funding, to have regard the scope for reducing economic and social deprivation, the need to promote access to sport for people from all sections of society and the need to further the objectives of sustainable development taking into account social and community progress and employment opportunities created by sports projects. Since 1995 Sport England has awarded over &#163;1.5 billion of Lottery funding. Sport England has also introduced a number of other specific initiatives aimed at the regeneration of deprived areas, such as Sport Action Zones.

<a name="30703w12.html_para0">In addition, our analysis of the costs and benefits of hosting the Olympic Games in London in 2012 has included an assessment of the regeneration benefits achieved by past host cities and also the significant regeneration benefits for Manchester as a result of staging the Commonwealth Games in 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps she is taking to encourage net metering arrangements, with particular reference to the removal of market distortions.  [122216]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 June 2003]:</i> The Government use the term "net metering" to describe commercial arrangements where a generator receives the same price for exported energy as he pays for imported energy. Offering net metering on this basis will result in a supplier incurring costs and, although at least one supplier has offered customers a limited net metering tariff, it is difficult to see how the economics of net metering could be sustained on a widespread basis.
<P>

<a name="30703w14.html_para4">The Government are, however, anxious to ensure that small, locally connected, generators receive full and fair value for the energy they produce. To this end, changes to electricity market arrangements will be implemented this September which will allow energy exported by small distributed generation to be traded via the electricity settlement system for the first time. In addition, the Distributed Generation Co-ordinating Group, jointly established by the DTI and Ofgem to address barriers associated with the connection and operation of small-distributed generation, has initiated work to identify metering and settlement arrangements which will ensure that small generators are fairly recompensed for exported energy.

 Advantage West Midlands is not directly responsible for Objective 2 investment in the sub-region.

Objective 2 offers made to AWM are worth &#163;86.84 million (ERDF and ESF combined). There are &#163;15.85 million worth of bids currently under appraisal. <i>(b)</i> It is impossible to tell what level of ERDF and ESF AWM might secure in 2003&#150;04 since this is dependent on the number of bidding rounds available and how many successful applications AWM achieve. Regarding spend in North Staffordshire, again this is impossible to say as the majority of the resources available to AWM are under an Action Plan which any of the sub regions can bid into.

<i>[holding answer 30 June 2003]:</i> The answer covers only mortgage style loans in public ownership because these are repayable to the Student Loans Company. Income contingent loans are collected through the tax system. At the end of financial year 2001&#150;02 the Student Loans Company had collected 85.5 per cent. of the amount recoverable since the scheme began. The amount recovered was &#163;707 million against a recoverable amount of &#163;827 million, leaving some &#163;120 million overdue.

At present, UUK and SCOP issue joint guidance covering the treatment of private contributions to fees when students withdraw from courses under the current system. Fees for such students are charged at the discretion of the institution concerned, taking account of the guidance, which states that these students should pay fees pro rata to their attendance.

Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) is currently paid to young people who reside in one of the pilot areas, irrespective of the location of the institution they attend. We only have estimated figures for the number of young people living in each local education authority (LEA) area who participate in further education. In some areas, particularly those where there has been rapid population movements, the estimates carry some degree of uncertainty; therefore there are some anomalies in the right hand column.<P>

 The proposals for variable deferred fees will not affect existing veterinary students&#151;we plan from 2006/07 to allow higher education institutions to charge variable fees to new students, between &#163;0 and &#163;3,000 per year per course. It will be for institutions themselves to decide at what level to set their fees. Institutions will be able to raise their fees only if they have an access agreement approved by the Office for Fair Access. All students, including veterinary students, will be able to defer payment of their fee until after their graduation, if they choose to do so. Graduates will repay the loan at a zero real rate of interest, with repayments linked to earnings, once they are earning above the &#163;15,000 repayment threshold.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on the progress made on the training pilots for vocational craft skills.  [122797]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w19.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Employer Training Pilots were launched in six Learning and Skills Council (LSC) areas in September 2002. The pilots test the effects of offering employers a package of financial incentives to encourage them to allow their employees time off to train towards basic skills and level 2 qualifications. The training is free and delivered in a way that best suits the employer's business. Initial results suggested that the pilots were successfully engaging firms and individuals with little prior involvement in training, and they have therefore been extended until August 2004 and expanded to cover an additional six LSC areas.
<P>

<a name="30703w19.html_para10">The new pilots, which will operate from summer 2003, will be located in Berkshire, East London, Kent, Leicester, Shropshire and South Yorkshire.
<P>

<a name="30703w19.html_para11">The impact of the pilots is being evaluated on an on-going basis and although the final evaluation will not be available until early 2005, early indications are positive. Employers like the free training provision, delivered flexibly in the workplace, and the services of the independent broker to help them identify and source the most suitable training.
<P>

<a name="30703w19.html_para12">Figures provided by the LSC show that as at 31 May 2003, 2,318 employers and 11,665 employees had signed up to the pilots. Over 90 per cent. of employers signing up to the pilots are SMEs and 72 per cent. have less than 50 employees. Learner drop-out rates are also extremely low.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The Defence Medical Services (DMS), comprise the Royal Naval Medical Service, the Army Medical Services and the Royal Air Force Medical Service. They are a vital component of the armed forces, providing essential medical support to Service personnel both on military operations and in peacetime. During 2002&#150;03, DMS personnel have deployed successfully on operations to Iraq, Kosovo, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30703w20.html_para0">We are committed to the modernisation of the DMS to meet the challenges we expect to face in the future. The provision of an effective deployable medical operational capability in support of deployed forces in Iraq demonstrated that our medical personnel are among the very best in the world. We do not underestimate the continuing challenges facing us to make good the acknowledged manning shortfalls and to equip our doctors, dentists, nurses and other medical personnel with modern medical equipment, but we are committed to doing so.

<P>
<a name="30703w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The International Visits Control Office is part of the Defence Procurement Agency, having transferred from the Directorate of Defence Security on 1 April 2003. It is currently based in London, but will transfer to Abbey Wood, Bristol by the end of 2003. It has no staff employed in Scotland. The office has a complement of nine staff, with annual personnel costs of approximately &#163;177,000 compared to &#163;189,000 for the previous year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 At 31 March 2003 Defence Estates employed 1,785 people, of which 112 were in Scotland. At 31 March 2002 it employed 1,539 people of which 107 were in Scotland. The Agency's expenditure on pay and allowances totalled &#163;51 million in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;46 million in 2001&#150;02.

 In 1999 the Directorate of Standardisation became the United Kingdom Defence Standardisation team and part of the Defence Procurement Agency's Procurement Development Group. The UK Defence Standardisation team has the equivalent of 38 people working full time of which 33 are employed in Scotland. The payroll costs for financial year 2003&#150;04 will be &#163;1.2 million. The figures for 2002&#150;03 were 38, 32 and &#163;1.1 million respectively.

<a name="30703w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 We have no means of ascertaining the numbers of military or civilian lives lost during decisive military operations in Iraq, and have therefore made no such estimates, although we made every effort to minimise civilian casualties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Under the direction of Mr Walter Slocombe, the Director for Security Affairs, the Coalition Provisional Authority intends to lead on the creation of a New Iraqi Army. Its plans for the training of this force were formally announced on 23 June. Initial plans are to form a core Brigade of Light Infantry, although the final shape and size of the armed forces will be developed in consultation with emerging Iraqi authorities, who will be fully engaged in the

development process. The early work will be conducted by the Coalition Military Advisory Training Team (CMATT) which has a UK military deputy. Training is due to commence on 15 July. It is anticipated that there will be a small United Kingdom element directly involved in the training and development processes of the New Iraqi armed forces. UK armed forces have significant experience in providing military assistance and advice to a number of countries around the world, including in the Middle East.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answer of 4 June 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 452W, what guidance had been issued to his Department in respect of TUPE liabilities at RAF Church Fenton before the decision was made to transfer flying currently undertaken by the Joint Elementary Flying Training School to university air squadrons.  [123092]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w20.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 No guidance was issued to the Department. The advice given by our own legal officers was that Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) (TUPE) would be unlikely to apply.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w20.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answer of 4 June 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 452W, how many additional staff have been recruited within university air squadrons in order to provide ground base flying training.  [123153]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w20.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 Ground branch training for University Air Squadron (UAS) students has, in the past, been provided by the flying instructional staff, with some help from visiting lecturers and branch mentors from nearby RAF stations undertaking such work as a secondary duty. Various studies into UAS training had pointed to the benefits of dedicated ground branch training instructors, in particular to increase the potential for attracting ground branch students. In 1997, such posts were established on each of the 15 UASs but funding was not available. As a result of a further review of the UASs, funding was agreed and the first ground branch training instructor arrived in April 2003; a total of seven are now in place. The overall establishment of ground branch training instructors has been reduced to 14, with a shared instructor for two co-located UASs. It is expected that all the posts will be filled by the end of 2004.

 Two meetings have been held with the PROSPECT Trade Union, at their request, to explain the new arrangements for Elementary Flying Training and consider whether Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) (TUPE) would apply to any current Babcock HCS staff when the new arrangements commence in July 2003.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w20.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answer of 4 June 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 452W, what budget was set for elementary flying training by university air squadrons in <i>(a)</i> 2001&#150;02, <i>(b)</i> 2002&#150;03 and <i>(c)</i> 2003&#150;04.  [123091]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w20.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The contract costs of providing Elementary Flying Training (EFT) to the University Air Squadrons (UASs) in 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, and the anticipated contract cost for 2003&#150;04, are approximately &#163;5.0 million, &#163;5.5 million and &#163;5.55 million respectively. This does not include fuel, manpower or the ownership of the sites where flying is undertaken. The UAS EFT share of the contract cost is approximately 49 per cent. of the total hours flown, as the contract also provides Air Experience Flying for Air Cadets and other non-EFT flying.

 A range of positive measures are in hand across all three services to address critical manning shortfalls. These include both remunerative and non-remunerative measures, some targeted to specific shortfall groups and others across all the services. Recent Manning and Retention reviews for Submarine specialisms, Aircrew and Medical staff have introduced improved career patterns and financial incentives on entry (Golden Helios) and in return for commitment to specific periods of service. These proposals were endorsed by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB).

It was withheld from release in 1996 partly to respect the confidentiality under which it was given in 1949 and partly because a number of those named were still alive.

<a name="30703w22.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 With our EU partners, we regularly engage the Pakistan authorities on Human Right issues. On 7 February 2003 the EU delivered a comprehensive demarche underlining its concerns on a wide range of human rights-related issues, including on specific individual cases. These concerns were reiterated on 23 June 2003. We have not had cause to raise the issue of domestic servants with the Pakistan authorities as no concrete evidence of human rights violations in this area has been presented to us.

 <i>[holding answer 30 June 2003]:</i> The Greek authorities intercepted a ship carrying explosives destined for Sudan on 22 June. The explosives were being imported by the Sudanese Integrated Chemicals and Development Company, a cement business with a legitimate use for explosives. On 24 June, the Tunisian Interior Minister stated that the Tunisian exporter was genuine and respectable and had produced industrial explosives for Tunisia and for export for over half a century. The ship is still being held in Greece. An investigation into the incident is being led by the Greek coastguard. Two Prosecutors have been appointed to the case.

 Allotments are protected under Section 8 of the Allotments Act 1925 which requires consent from my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister before a local authority can dispose of statutory allotments. Consent decisions for the disposal of statutory allotments are made against criteria aimed at ensuring that allotments that are needed are not disposed of. These criteria have been strengthened and clarified following public consultation in 2001.
<P>

<a name="30703w23.html_para3">The provision of allotments is determined locally by allotment authorities. The Small Holdings and Allotments Act (1908) places a duty on local authorities to provide sufficient allotments, according to local demand. In addition Planning Policy Guidance note 17: Open Space, Sport and Recreation, indicates that local authorities should assess the existing and future needs of their communities for all open spaces of public value, including allotments. Local authorities should then plan to meet those identified needs.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w23.html_spnew4"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 South Yorkshire's eligibility for European Objective 1 funding is based on the economic prosperity of the area and that in 1999 South Yorkshire's GDP was below 75 per cent. of the European average. There are no qualifying factors based on land classification or a proportion of land being either greenfield or brownfield. In policy terms the Objective 1 Programme supports sustainable development and grant offers may be made to projects that meet the relevant criteria, including evidence that all the appropriate planning permissions are in place.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30703w23.html_para5">Domestic buildings accounted for approximately 28 per cent. of total UK CO2 emissions in 2000. The Government therefore view the household sector as a key area for achieving emissions reductions.
<P>

<a name="30703w23.html_para6">In the Energy White Paper "Our Energy Future&#151;Creating a Low-Carbon Economy" published in February this year, the Government accepted the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's recommendation that the UK should put itself on the path to cut CO2 emissions by some 60 per cent. by about 2050. In the White Paper the Government said that they expected energy efficiency to deliver around half of the total carbon savings needed by 2010. The household sector was identified as having the potential to deliver 3.5 million tonnes of carbon (MtC) beyond the measures already identified in the UK Climate Change Programme. Looking beyond the first Kyoto Protocol Commitment Period, the Government believe that energy efficiency can deliver a similar proportion of the emission reductions needed during the following decade. Around half of these energy efficiency savings could be made in the household sector.

<P>

<a name="30703w24.html_para2">Tackling anti-social tenants is a housing management function, and local authority landlords, because of their long-term commitment to their tenants and improving communities, are usually amongst the first agencies to know of problems. They must be responsive to the issues that local communities face and to ensure that properties do not become hard to let, as a result of crime and disorder problems.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what percentage of fines were unpaid in <i>(a)</i> Salisbury magistrates court and <i>(b)</i> Salisbury crown court in 2002&#150;03; and if he will make a statement.  [122795]<P>

<P>
<a name="30703w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Magistrates' Courts Committees (MCCs) have a responsibility for the collection of a range of debts imposed by both the magistrates courts and the crown court. Debt collected includes not only fines but also fees, compensation, confiscation orders, legal aid contributions and some maintenance orders. It is not yet possible to separate out only fines from the total, so the figures provided here include all the elements above.
<P>

<a name="30703w25.html_para0">Data are collected centrally at MCC level, rather than at court level. In addition, the Wiltshire MCC accounting system is unable to identify the percentage of fines unpaid in the Salisbury magistrates court. The payment rate for the Wiltshire MCC in 2002&#150;03, calculated as the percentage of the total amount collected over the amount imposed, was 68 per cent. On that basis, the percentage of fines unpaid was 32 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30703w25.html_para1">Information from the Wiltshire MCC indicated that the payment rate in 2002&#150;03 for the South East Wiltshire Petty Session Area, which includes Salisbury and Devizes, was 48 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps the Government are taking to make non-departmental public bodies more representative of the community in Northern Ireland.  [122233]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w25.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Appointments to the NI Administration Boards of Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) are governed by the Code of Practice of the Commissioner for Public Appointments for Northern Ireland; Northern Ireland Office appointments are covered by the Commissioner's GB Code. The overriding principle is that selection must be based on merit, through the well informed choice of individuals who, through their abilities, experience and qualities match the needs of the body in question. The Commissioner's Code also requires Departments to ensure their processes for making appointments comply with the statutory duty under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act, to have due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity. The Commissioner's remit covers appointments to Executive NDPBs and HPSS bodies (and, in the case of the Northern Ireland Office, Advisory NDPBs), but all Departments routinely apply the principles of the Commissioner's Code to all appointments. The Central Appointments Unit in the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister recently developed a Public Appointments Best Practice guide to assist Departments in the application of the Commissioner's Code. A copy of the guidance has been placed in the Library. The Northern Ireland Office follows Cabinet Office Best Practice Guidance which was introduced in July 2001.

 It is the responsibility of the health and social services boards and trusts at operational level to negotiate and agree contracts for the provision of residential and domiciliary care by the independent sector. To assist in this process, the four Board Chief Executives have established a regional group to make recommendations on the appropriate fee levels for care in residential and nursing homes. Recommendations on residential and nursing home fees are based on the level of need across each of the programmes of care. In each of the last three years, the recommendations of the regional group have been endorsed by the Department and accepted as the agreed regional rates by the four boards. Rates for domiciliary care provision are currently negotiated at board and trust level with independent sector providers.

 We do not collect figures centrally covering lost working days for people with arthritis. We want to help people with arthritis to remain in, or return to, work wherever this is possible and appropriate for them. Physiotherapists and occupational therapists play a crucial part in the rehabilitation of people suffering from arthritis and related conditions and the focus will be to restore the person to their optimal function, including returning to work, where appropriate.

 Comprehensive information is not held centrally on the cost of back pain to the national health service or on referral times for patients diagnosed with back pain. At national level, the NHS research and development health technology assessment programme is currently supporting two research projects on the management of back pain covering, respectively, whether early imaging influences management and improves outcome in patients with low back pain, and the longer term clinical and economic benefits of offering acupuncture to patients with chronic low back pain. Treatment is available very widely. It is for primary care trusts to determine what level of resources to devote to the treatment of different conditions in their localities.

<a name="30703w27.html_para4">The Government are currently exploring a number of ways to improve access to occupational health services and vocational rehabilitation for all workers, including those suffering from back pain, through NHS Plus and the Welfare to Work reforms. NHS Plus, launched in November 2001, is currently providing access to local occupational health services to small and medium sized businesses through 107 providers (NHS trusts) across the United Kingdom; while, the NHS "Back in Work" campaign aims to reduce the causes of back pain and the incidents that lead to back pain in the NHS. In addition, the new Job Retention and Rehabilitation pilots, launched on 1 April 2003, and the Incapacity Benefit reforms, announced in the Government's Green Paper in November 2002, "Pathways to Work", are offering work-focused interventions for those with health problems, including back pain, to help people return to work.

 Additional funding was made available in the NHS Cancer Plan, rising to an extra &#163;570 million a year by 2003&#150;04. Some of this is being used to make substantial investment in staff, with a wide range of new appointments that are contributing to the delivery of cancer care.
<P>

<a name="30703w28.html_para3">The table shows good progress in increasing the number of doctors working in cancer services. This increase means the national health service is on track to hit the target set out in the Cancer Plan of nearly 1,000 extra cancer consultants by 2006. The table also shows that we are making good progress with increasing the number of radiographers working in the NHS. The overall increase of 50,000 nurses working in the NHS will also enable the recruitment of additional cancer-site specific nurse specialists, chemotherapy nurses, district nurses, palliative care nurse specialists and additional nurses on wards caring for cancer patients.

 A review by the University of York found that the evidence showed that fluoridating water helps to reduce tooth decay with no evidence of adverse effects on general health.

<a name="30703w29.html_para3">In its report, the MRC stated that available evidence does not suggest a link between water fluoridation and either cancer in general or any specific cancer type, including osteosarcoma or primary bone cancer, but recommended monitoring data collected on the incidence of cancer so that any aberrant trends in populations receiving fluoridated water could be investigated.

 All water supplies contain some fluoride and it was from observing different patterns of dental decay in areas of differing levels of naturally fluoridated water that the benefits of fluoride were first observed. The Government commissioned an up-to-date review of the evidence of the relationship between fluoride and health from the national health service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York. Its report, "A Systematic Review of Water Fluoridation", published in September 2000, concluded that water fluoridation increased the number of children with no tooth decay by 15 per cent. The University of York report did, however, identify the need for more good quality research and the Department commissioned the Medical Research Council (MRC) to advise on how the evidence base might be strengthened. The MRC published its report in September 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what reasons lettuce and spinach are excluded from the Contaminants in Food (England) Regulations 2003/1478.  [122841]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w29.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Lettuce and spinach are excluded from the English Regulations because of a derogation allowed by European Community law. This derogation allows United Kingdom farmers a transitional period during which to alter their farming practices to reduce the levels of nitrate in spinach and lettuce. The transitional period, which also applies in Ireland, Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands, is necessary due to the different climatic conditions that occur in Northern Europe. Cloudy weather during the growing period leads to lettuce and spinach having high nitrate concentrations and on occasion exceeding the maximum permitted levels set by legislation.




<P>
<P><I>3 Jul 2003 : Column 482W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30703w29.html_para5">The derogation is conditional on growers abiding by a code of practice and on levels of nitrate measured not representing a risk to public health. Codes of practice for farming of spinach and lettuce were published in 1999. These outline farming practices that, if followed, should reduce the concentrations of nitrate observed in lettuce and spinach. The Food Standards Agency undertakes statutory monitoring of nitrate levels in lettuce and spinach and submits the data to the EC on a yearly basis.

<P>
<a name="30703w29.html_spnew8"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Government are in favour of clear labelling of caffeine when it is used in foods. They therefore supported new European Union rules, which will require caffeine to be declared in ingredient lists when used as a flavouring: current legislation requires only the declaration "flavouring". The new rules will also require drinks containing caffeine in excess of 150 milligrams per litre to carry the declaration, "High caffeine content", together with the amount of caffeine expressed in milligrams per 100 millilitres. This will alert consumers to the presence of unexpectedly high levels of caffeine. The new rules will not apply to drinks based on tea or coffee.

<P>
<a name="30703w29.html_spnew9"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Food supplements, like other foods, are not subject to prior approval before marketing unless they are genetically modified or are "novel". Therefore, the Food Standards Agency does not hold detailed safety information about food supplement products on the UK market. These products are, however, required to comply with food law, including the Food Safety Act 1990.
<P>

<a name="30703w29.html_para6">According to information provided by industry, Annex I and Annex II of the Food Supplements Directive presently omit six minerals and many chemical sources of vitamins and minerals currently used in food supplements on the UK market. The provisions of The Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 come into force on 1 August 2005; however, the regulations take advantage of the derogation in Article 4 of the directive which enables member states to allow, subject to certain criteria being met, the continued sale of products containing vitamin and mineral sources not yet on the permitted lists up until 1 January 2010.

 We expect that the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (CHAI) will normally obtain any information or other material, such as medical equipment, it may need by agreement. The power to remove equipment may be necessary where inspectors suspect, for example, that tampering of either data or equipment has taken place or that patient safety is being put at risk. It is right in such circumstances that CHAI is able to remove such equipment for examination without having to negotiate first for its release.

The European Commission's proposal for a health insurance card is intended primarily for the benefit of citizens.

 Guidance on current best practice in clinical care is provided by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). NICE issued its guidance, which takes account of all existing research, on insulin pump therapy in February 2003. Insulin pump therapy is recommended as one option for people with type 1 diabetes, provided that multiple dose insulin therapy, including insulin glargine, has failed and those receiving the treatment are willing and able to use the therapy effectively. Once NICE guidance is published, health professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. As national health service staff are trained, by February 2004, new users&#151;where clinically indicated&#151;will receive insulin pumps from the NHS. Information on those health authorities that currently provide insulin pump therapy at no cost is not collected centrally.

 People aged 16 or 17 are entitled to consent to their own medical treatment and any ancillary procedures involved in that treatment, such as an anaesthetic. As for adults, consent will be valid only if it is given voluntarily by an appropriately informed patient capable of consenting to the particular intervention.
<P>

<a name="30703w32.html_para10">For children under 16, following the case of Gillick, the courts have held that children who have sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable them to understand fully what is involved in a proposed intervention will also have the capacity to consent to that intervention.
<P>

<a name="30703w32.html_para11">Detailed guidance on the law on consent in England was set out in the Department's "Reference Guide to Consent for Examination and Treatment", published in March 2001. The Department has also made available information leaflets for health professionals and for patients on consent in relation to children and young people. These and other related documents are available on the Departments' website at www.doh.gov.uk/consent.

 The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) receive reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) submitted by doctors, dentists, pharmacists and coroners via the Yellow Card Scheme by doctors and there is a legal requirement for companies to report suspected ADRs to their drugs.
<P>

<a name="30703w33.html_para1">The number of reports received via the Yellow Card Scheme does not directly equate to the number of people who suffer adverse reactions to drugs for a number of reasons including an unknown level of under reporting. It is important to note that the reporting of a reaction does not necessarily mean it was caused by the drug and may relate to other factors such as the patient's underlying illness or other medicines taken concurrently.
<P>

<a name="30703w33.html_para2">A total of 196 reports of 'suspected' ADRs have been received through this scheme in association with paroxetine in children aged 18 years or under, including three reports of deliberate self-harm, all occurring in 1999 and two reports of suicide (accomplished)&#151;one each occurring in 2002 and 2003.

Sports development and leisure services are contributing to the pilots through their local strategic partnerships. Two of the pilots are based in sport action zones and the majority of the PCTs are working closely with sports bodies to deliver health-related outcomes.

<a name="30703w33.html_para7">In the context of the national service framework for coronary heart disease, PCTs and individual general practitioner practices are working with sport and leisure services to implement local policies for promoting physical activity, for example, through the delivery of exercise referral schemes, free swimming initiatives and weight management programmes.

 The most common cause of physical disability in England is diseases of the musculoskeletal system, particularly arthritis and rheumatism. Such information is not available for South Sefton, Southport and Formby, but there is no evidence to suggest that they vary from England as a whole.

 1 July 2003 marked the launch of the Prison Health Development Network with an event in London attended by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Department (Mr. Goggins) and Sir Nigel Crisp, National Health Service Chief Executive and Department of Health Permanent Secretary.
<P>

<a name="30703w33.html_para8">The launch event follows the Home Office announcement on 25 September 2002 that funding responsibility for health care within the Prison Service would become part of the NHS. The front line commissioning responsibility for individual prisons will have transferred to their local primary care trust (PCT) by 1 April 2006.

<a name="30703w33.html_para9">The aim of the Prison Health Development Network is to support prisons and PCTs and develop their partnership roles. The network will provide invaluable lessons as the gradual transfer of responsibility takes place.

<a name="30703w33.html_para10">Work on the network has been divided into two separate phases:

The second phase, which will start in September, will focus on helping PCTs and prisons develop practical solutions to the issues identified and share the experience and good practice with others. It is expected that those prisons and PCTs in the network that have made sufficient progress and are ready will 'go live' from April 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what recent undertakings have been given to the Government of South Africa about the recruitment of health staff; how many South African health care companies have been asked to tender for private contracts for the provision of care to NHS patients; and what restrictions the British Government intend to impose on the South African staff working for such companies.  [121457]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30703w33.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 A code of practice for national health service employers recruiting from overseas was published in 2001 and sets out standards for international recruitment, including the need to protect the needs of developing countries such as South Africa and to only work with those countries which have formal agreements in place with the Department of Health to recruit healthcare professionals.
<P>

<a name="30703w33.html_para11">The Department's agreement with the South African Health Ministry on the recruitment of overseas clinical teams is on the basis that only private sector providers will be considered. The agreement is on the assumption that clinicians come to the United Kingdom for a maximum of six weeks per year on a rotational basis; this is designed to aid to the long-term retention of staff in the South African healthcare system.
<P>

<a name="30703w33.html_para12">A total of 14 South African companies have been asked to tender for contracts to provide overseas clinical teams in the UK. Contracts have been awarded to South African companies at Morecambe Bay Hospitals NHS Trust, North West London Hospitals NHS Trust and Southport and Ormskirk Hospitals NHS Trust.
<P>

<a name="30703w33.html_para13">In addition, two South African healthcare companies are included in the list of qualifying bidders preparing tenders for independent sector diagnosis and treatment centres contracts and we have assurances from both companies that, if selected, they will abide by the NHS code of practice for international recruitment.

<a name="30703w34.html_spnew1"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Department of Health commissions annual surveys on smoking among secondary school children. The 1998 White Paper, "Smoking Kills", set a target to reduce smoking among 11 to 15-year-olds from 13 per cent. in 1996 to 9 per cent. by 2010, with a fall to 11 per cent. by 2005. Progress towards this target is monitored by a series of surveys of schoolchildren carried out on behalf of the Department of Health, originally by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and since 2000 by the National Centre for Social Research and National Foundation for Educational Research.
<P>

<a name="30703w34.html_para1">Data on the prevalence of regular smoking from these reports are shown in the table. Smoking prevalence has remained unchanged since 2000 at ten per cent. and we are on course to meet our target for reducing smoking among this age group.

 In line with the principle of earned autonomy, for the first wave of national health service foundation trusts, only acute and specialist NHS trusts, which have attained three stars in the NHS Performance Ratings, were eligible to apply.
<P>

<a name="30703w34.html_para3">St. George's Healthcare NHS Trust has two stars which means that it is therefore not eligible to apply for NHS foundation trust status at present. However, with mechanisms, including the recently announced improvement programme, in place to raise the performance of all NHS trusts, it is expected that all NHS trusts will have the opportunity to apply for NHS Foundation trust status within the next five years.

 Working Times Directive (WTD) implementation is only part of the much wider issue of delivering better care for patients and improving the working lives of national health service staff. Its impact cannot be assessed in isolation from other factors. It will require both more staff and staff working differently.
<P>

<a name="30703w34.html_para4">Information about plans to implement the WTD across North Yorkshire is not collated. The resources needed to meet WTD targets are included in the local delivery plans agreed between NHS trusts and strategic health authorities.
<P>

<a name="30703w34.html_para5">In addition, &#163;46 million has been allocated to the NHS over the next three financial years to support compliance.
<P>

<a name="30703w34.html_para6">From September 1997 to March 2002, there has been an increase of over 5,000 junior doctors and career grade doctors working in the NHS. This increase in the number of doctors, together with changes to working practices, will help both meet the WTD targets and deliver targets set out in the NHS Plan.
