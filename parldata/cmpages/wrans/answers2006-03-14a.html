 We remain concerned about the infringement of human rights through the Hudood Ordinances, which enforce strict forms of punishments such as whipping, amputation of limbs and death for breaking the law. We are particularly concerned by the ordinance relating to the offence of Zina (Fornication/Adultery) which increases potential injustices against women. Victims of rape, or even gang rape, have been accused of Zina and thereby subjected to wrong and unjust prosecutions. This has often left victims ostracised by their families and communities.

<p><a name="st_19"><a name="60314w02.html_spnew5"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 As the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has documented in successive reports, Iran has long lacked transparency about its nuclear activities. The nature of Iran&#039;s nuclear activities, its record of concealment, its failure to co-operate fully with the IAEA, and its failure to take necessary confidence building steps have contributed to the deep concerns of the international community that Iran&#039;s intentions regarding its nuclear programme, may not be, as it claims, exclusively peaceful. It is precisely for this reason that we, with France and Germany, and with the

We urge the DPRK to return to the Six Party talks and implement its commitments, including verifiably dismantling its illicit weapons programmes and resuming its engagement in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="60314w04.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 The Department&#039;s National Transport Model uses fuel prices that are based upon DTI crude oil price projections. We update our fuel price forecasts in line with DTI oil price updates. DTI usually make their oil price projections (which they normally update one or two times a year) publicly available on their website and also subject them to periodic public review&#151;most recently in the summer of 2005 (http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/fossil&#095;fuel&#095;price&#095;assumptions.pdf). Their latest projections are for crude oil to fall from its current high levels to $35 (in 2004 prices) in 2010 and then remain at that level in real terms through to 2020&#151;the end of their projection.

<a name="stpa_17">The Aviation White Paper published in December 2003 says that DfT will continue to update forecasts in the light of trends.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps his Department is taking to encourage <i>(a)</i> Governments and <i>(b)</i> other organisations to support the establishment of the proposed Arms Trade Treaty.  [57494]</p>




<p><a name="st_65"><a name="60314w07.html_spnew6"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Ensuring better regulation of the arms trade is an essential pre-requisite for conflict prevention and development. As a result, DFID has worked very closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to promote the Government&#039;s commitment to an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). When the first committee of the UN General Assembly meets this year, the UK will aim to secure a UN resolution which will establish a formal UN-based ATT process. Significant progress has already been made, notably the endorsement of an ATT by the EU Council and the call for negotiations on an ATT from Commonwealth Heads of Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w07.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_36">DFID has contributed to a range of FCO-led initiatives, including the May 2005 meeting of experts at Lancaster House in London. This year, DFID is developing a joint strategy with Whitehall partners on how to encourage other countries and regional bodies to actively promote the ATT. This will focus on building wider support for a first committee resolution, and will include awareness raising events and the establishment of a &quot;friends of ATT&quot; group of supportive Governments. In addition we will use ministerial visits and discussions with partner countries, regional and international organisations to generate support for a resolution. For example, this month we participated in a cross-Whitehall lobbying visit to China.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w07.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_37">In parallel, given the devastating impact of small arms and light weapons (SALW) on the developing world, DFID is working closely with the FCO and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) on strengthening language on transfer controls within the existing UN Programme of Action on SALW. When the UN Programme of Action is reviewed in July we will seek agreement to develop a set of politically binding criteria for SALW transfers. In the run up to the review conference DFID will work closely with the FCO to win support for a common text on universal principles for SALW transfers. There has been good progress in developing regional agreement on standards for small arms transfers in Central America and the Horn of Africa/Great Lakes region. Under the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, we have funded non-governmental organisations such as the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA) and Saferworld, which work with African Governments and civil society to ensure that African voices are heard in discussions on transfer controls.

<p><a name="st_67"><a name="60314w08.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Maternal mortality is quite difficult to measure over relatively short time periods, and DFID looks to the World Health Organisation (WHO), with the United Nations Children&#039;s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to collectively produce global estimates. These are supplemented in some countries by information on maternal mortality obtained from demographic and health surveys conducted every four to five years. From the data available, it is estimated that each year 529,000 women die from complications in pregnancy and childbirth, and that 99 per cent. of these deaths take place in poor countries. With the exception of Afghanistan, the countries with the highest maternal mortality ratios are all in Africa. These include Sierra Leone which has a maternal mortality ratio of 2,000 deaths for every 100,000 live births, and Malawi which has a ratio of 1,800 deaths for every 100,000 live births.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w08.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_40">DFID is supporting research with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Gates Foundation to improve the way maternal mortality is measured. This will enable poor countries to both better track progress of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of improving maternal mortality and to advocate for more resources for maternal health. Some countries in sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing a reversal of previous gains and without considerably more action this MDG target will not be met.

 Over 529,000 women; mostly young, impoverished and vulnerable, die each year as a result of pregnancy or childbirth. Much more effort is needed if the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) to lower maternal mortality is to be achieved by 2015.

<a name="60314w08.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_41">This is why DFID launched its strategy &#039;Reducing maternal deaths: Evidence and action&#039; in 2004. The strategy sets out four clear priorities for action:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">4. to develop and apply new knowledge, through support for research on approaches to improve maternal health.</p>

<p>
<a name="60314w08.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_42">The UK is the only major bilateral donor to have developed a strategy specifically to address &#039;improving maternal health&#039; (MDG 5). We are also supporting the global Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health which is working to advocate on a much bigger international and national platform.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w08.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_43">Improving maternal health depends on functioning health services, and stronger health systems, with the right staff, equipment, drugs and supplies in place and functioning properly. Women also need to be able to access sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, and care to deal with the causes and consequences of unsafe abortion, as well services to prevent, treat and care for HIV and AIDS. DFID has invested &#163;650 million for health sector support since 2000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w08.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_44">DFID support in Nepal is addressing all these issues. For example, the remote Baglung district hospital is providing emergency obstetric care (Caesareans), with local nurses who have been trained in giving epidural anaesthesia. Blood transfusions are available, transport is possible because bridges have been built and communications (now through mobile phones), is working. Access to obstetric care is increasing, irrespective of the conflict. And that means that not only are women benefiting, but children with fractured limbs and others who need blood transfusions are getting help.

<a name="stpa_45">In Malawi, DFID has provided &#163;100 million to an Emergency Human Resource Programme. In a country where two out of three nurse-midwife posts are vacant and where only eight out of 27 districts have a Malawian doctor, there is now early evidence to suggest a positive shift. And importantly, pregnant women are beginning to be able to have HIV tests and some are receiving anti-retroviral drugs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60314w08.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_46">In 2004&#150;05, DFID spent more than &#163;243 million on bilateral programmes on maternal health (including sexual and reproductive health) and are continuing to ensure that good country plans which highlight maternal health are fully funded. In several countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and Kenya, DFID is investing strongly in specific safe motherhood programmes with a focus on skilled birth attendants and access to obstetric services. We further support maternal health through multilateral support to our partners in UN agencies, the World Bank and the EU.
