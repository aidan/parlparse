 The total amount of subsidy for passenger air services in the UK in the last financial year was &#163;2,320,720. All of this was in support of lifeline air services in Scotland and was provided either by the Scottish Executive or the Islands Councils.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50609w01.html_spnew5"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 The Department only authorises subsidy of air transport services through the use of Public Service Obligations (PSOs). The imposition of PSOs is governed by European legislation laid out in Regulation 2408/92. This Regulation sets out a number of criteria which must be met in order for a PSO to be imposed.

 Measures to mitigate the effects of noise vibration from trains are a matter for the railway industry. In response to concerns raised by residents who live near the North London Line, Network Rail has undertaken to carry out a number of measures to reduce noise vibration on this line. This will include carrying out grinding and joint removal work to improve the track surface. Network Rail will also look at a number of potential contributory factors in the area, including the speed of trains and local environmental conditions and will continue to engage in discussions with freight operators and the local authority to keep them advised of any relevant findings.

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="50609w01.html_spnew11"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 We continue to develop and implement our wide-ranging road safety strategy. The provisional 2004 casualty figures show we are now over halfway towards our 2010 target of a 40 per cent. reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured, and over three-quarters towards our 50 per cent. target for children.

 The latest available data from the NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA) is shown in the table. There is no directly comparable data available for 1997. However, the National Audit Office estimated that of claims closed in 1999&#150;2000, the average time taken from claim to payment of damages was five and a half years, and the average total time from incident to payment of damages was just over seven years. These figures were for existing liability scheme (ELS) cases. The ELS covers clinical negligence claims made against the national health service in England where the incident in question took place before April 1995. While initially, NHS bodies were responsible for handling and funding lower-value ELS claims themselves, since April 2000 all ELS claims have been handled centrally by the NHSLA.

In addition, the prevalence of antibodies among those who began injecting in the last three years, that is, recent injectors, is also available from this survey. Figures for the last three years are available from the Health Protection Agency report &quot;Shooting Up&quot;, October 2004.

 [holding answer 6 June 2005]: In line with &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot;, most national health service funding is now passed on to local NHS organisations so that they can make decisions about local needs and services.

<a name="stpa_29">In June 2004, the then Secretary of State, John Reid announced plans to achieve better and equal access to NICE-recommended therapies. As part of these proposals, it is intended that information about NICE-recommended drugs prescribed and dispensed in hospitals will be available to the NHS. This will enable SHAs to compare their own uptake of drugs recommended by NICE with the national distribution. Where uptake locally appears to be below average, SHAs will be expected to investigate and take action to overcome the barriers to implementation. This information will also be available to the Healthcare Commission, which has indicated that assessing the implementation of NICE guidance will be one of their key priorities.

 Phthalates are a family of chemical substances, with a range of properties. Extensive research into the effects of certain phthalates on both the environment and human health has been carried out at a European level, under the auspices for the European Union&#039;s Existing Substances Regulation (793/93/EC). Details of the programme can be found on the European Chemicals Bureau website at: http://ecb.jrc.it/existing-chemicals/.

This antitoxin is manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) and has been granted a Special Licence to enable it to be administered under the direction of, and by, medical personnel in the event of an emergency. The Ministry of Defence aims to obtain a full product licence for this antitoxin. Part of the regulated production process involves the use of commercially produced botulinum toxin in an animal model to assess the efficacy of the antitoxin.

 Following the judgments against British Coal in both the vibration white finger and respiratory disease litigations, the High Court ordered the DTI to set up schemes, in agreement with miners&#039; solicitors, to assess compensation for both types of claim. Claims had by then been registered through the Claimants Solicitors Group (the CSG), some of which were sponsored by the main mining unions, the NUM and NACODS. The UDM had also registered a large number of claims directly on behalf of their members, through their dedicated claims handling company, Vendside Ltd. The CSG and the UDM were unable to work together or enter into single arrangements for historical reasons. The legal advice received by the Department was that it was appropriate to enter into

 A total of 169,197 claims have been received for vibration white finger of which an initial Group 3 denial was made in 46,913 cases. This denial was contested in 16,260 cases and 9,937 of these cases have been investigated, with further information being provided at this stage. Completed investigations show that 36 per cent. of investigated claims are classified as Group 1 or 2 and 9 per cent. are accepted as Group 3 with exposure. So, of the 46,913 initially classified as Group 3 and denied, so far, 8 per cent. have been reclassified as Groups 1 or 2 and 2 per cent. have been accepted as Group 3 with exposure.

 Decisions which confirmed occupational group (and therefore liability) were originally taken by claims handlers. From late 2001, disputed Group 3 claims have been investigated by a separate team who have substantial direct mining experience. This team also reviewed all claims which were initially denied to ensure the correct liability decision had been made. I am confident that the significant experience of this team, amounting to some 1,300 years in total, has resulted in sound decisions on liability being made. There are dispute procedures where claimants think otherwise

We have introduced a new criminal offence of trafficking for the purpose of exploitation, including forced labour, punishable on conviction by a maximum of 14 years&#039; imprisonment. We supported the legislation establishing the Gangmaster Licensing Authority, which will tackle illegal employment practices in the agricultural labour provision sector through statutory licensing. We will also introduce on the spot penalties for employers found to be using illegal migrant workers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50609w13.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_75">The current work permit arrangements include checks to ensure work permit applicants are protected from potentially exploitative employment arrangements, and investigations are carried out where there is intelligence of abuse. We are also improving joint working across departmental boundaries. The Home Office is a key participant in Reflex, the multi-agency initiative created to tackle organised immigration crime, including people smuggling and human trafficking. We will also pilot a joint team in the West Midlands to examine the scope for closer co-operation between workplace enforcement agencies in relation to the use and exploitation of illegal migrant workers.

 It is not possible to estimate at the moment how many people in Coventry South will benefit from the Government&#039;s proposals for low cost home ownership. The West Midlands Region has been allocated &#163;379 million of funding for housing for the two years 2006&#150;08 and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently awaiting Regional Housing Board recommendations as to how and where this should be invested. Once priorities for investment have been established, housing providers will be invited to bid for funding. The number of people in Coventry South who will benefit will depend on which bids are successful. In addition, the Government is currently consulting on details of social homebuy which will enable social tenants to buy a part share in their home.

<sup>(23)</sup> For the years 1999&#150;2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used by ONS to define alcohol-related deaths are listed as follows:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>

For the years 2001&#150;2004 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>

The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in: Baker A and Rooney C (2003). Recent trends in alcohol-related mortality, and the impact of ICD-10 on the monitoring of these deaths in England and Wales. Health Statistics Quarterly 17, pp 5&#150;14.<br>

The Office of Government Commerce is currently considering, with the Criminal Records Bureau, how this need for information on convictions, via a competent authority, can best be implemented in the UK. This will then be reflected in guidance on Article 45, which will be published before the implementation of the new Directive.

From September, as the Training and Development Agency for Schools, it will assume responsibility for the training and development not only of the whole school workforce, but also of teachers who work outside the classroom. The Agency is currently planning how to discharge these new responsibilities and the Secretary of State will receive its advice on this in due course.

Risk management is a statutory requirement that covers staff and pupils on educational premises and offsite on educational visits. &quot;Standards for LEAs in Overseeing Educational Visits&quot; (DfES 2002) sets out the principles of risk assessment, emphasising that schools must strike the right balance, being neither overcautious nor careless.

<sup>(30)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>





<sup>(31)</sup> Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending LEA maintained secondary schools and are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(32)</sup> 1999&#150;2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DfES. 2002&#150;03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the dotted lines.<br>

<sup>(33)</sup> The 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 calculation is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001&#150;02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses, while in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 only the schools element of these categories is included. In 2001&#150;02 this accounted for approximately 70 per pupil of the England total, while the schools element of these categories accounted for approximately 50 per pupil of the England total in 2002&#150;03. Also, for some LEAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LEA part of the form in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 and would therefore be excluded, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>

<sup>(34)</sup> The 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of grant maintained schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

Figures are reported in cash terms and rounded to the nearest 10 as reported by the LEA.<br>

For example, revenue expenditure will increase in years where there have been adverse weather conditions (e.g. repairing storm damage) and is also likely to vary with the number and age of the school buildings within the LEA. Revenue expenditure will also be affected by the amounts of capital expenditure employed at a school. Capital spending in Coventry LEA on school buildings has increased from &#163;6.96 million in 1997&#150;98 to &#163;13.57 million in 2003&#150;04. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;1,000.

<sup>(35)</sup> Figures for 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02 cover the repair and maintenance of buildings, fixed plant and grounds which includes all expenditure on non-capital building works, including repairs and maintenance of buildings, and non-capital expenditure on fixed plant and grounds. Figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 are the combination of the revenue expenditure on building (including fixed plant) maintenance and improvement and grounds maintenance and improvement (CFR categories E12 + E13). Any capital expenditure on school buildings is not included in this table.<br>

<sup>(36)</sup> Figures for 2002&#150;03 onwards will not be directly comparable with the figures for earlier years as figures for 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02 are for all LEA maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools (pre-primary expenditure accounts for &#163;18,000, &#163;46,000 and &#163;9,000 of the respective totals in 1999&#150;2000, 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02) while nursery figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 are not available and have therefore been excluded for these two years. Also, for some LEAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LEA part of the form in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 and would therefore be excluded from the totals for those years although the precise amount of this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>

<p>
<a name="50609w25.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_143">From September 2006 we will have in place a revised package of student financial support, which includes for new students, the introduction of a new maintenance grant of &#163;2,700 for those students from low income households. Those in receipt of the full &#163;2,700 maintenance grant and who are paying &#163;3,000 for their tuition fees will be entitled to a minimum non-repayable bursary of &#163;300.00 from their higher education institution, although many institutions will be offering much more. From 2006 students will be able to defer payment of their fees by taking out a non-means tested fee loan, which they will only start repaying once they have finished their studies and are earning over &#163;15,000 per annum.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50609w25.html_para2">
There are a number of initiatives aimed at stimulating closer links between employers and higher education institutions, including the new Sector Skills Agreements being developed by Sector Skills Councils. They provide an opportunity to look at ways that students can acquire higher level skills, including those from low income households. Other initiatives, including Aimhigher and the expansion of Foundation Degrees, are aimed at raising aspirations and attainments and providing new work based higher education opportunities developed with employers. We have also supported projects that promote and deliver paid secondments, work placements and work experience opportunities for higher education students.
