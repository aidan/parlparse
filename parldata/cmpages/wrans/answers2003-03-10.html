<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hopkins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the Government's official estimates are for the total of UK carbon dioxide emissions in <i>(a)</i> 2001 and <i>(b)</i> 2002; what proportion of each total is attributable to emissions from the domestic sector, as defined in the UNECE definitions of end user groups; and whether the Government has made an estimate of what those levels will be in 2003.  [100878]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
<i> [holding answer 6 March 2003]:</i> The most recent UK carbon dioxide emissions data, published in March 2002 show that total UK carbon dioxide emissions were 152.1 million tonnes of carbon per year (MtC/yr) in 2000. Provisional data suggest that while emissions were around 3.4 MtC higher in 2001 than in 2000, they declined between 2001 and 2002. Final data for 2001 will be available later this month.
<P>

<a name="30310w01.html_para0">Data based on the UNECE classification are available for 2000. This classification includes coal, oil and gas delivered for combustion in dwellings. The use of these fuels produced emissions of around 23 MtC/yr in 2000. In addition, approximately 18 MtC/yr were emitted from power stations, refineries and other energy industries serving the domestic sector. End user data for 2001 based on the UNECE classification will be available in April 2003.

 A great deal of progress has been made recently on tackling the significant difficulties experienced by DEFRA on dealing effectively with Member's correspondence since it's formation in June 2001 and the situation continues to improve.

<a name="30310w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has not yet reached an opinion on any of the 19 applications to place GMOs on the market under EU directive 2001/18. Each application is considered initially by the member state where the GMO is to be placed on the market for the first time. Once the lead member state is satisfied that the application complies with the directive it is passed to the other member states with an assessment report. The UK will consider each application on its own merits on a case-by-case basis using the criteria laid down in the EU legislation. The Government's view will be informed by the advice of its relevant independent expert groups, the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment and the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes, together with advice from the statutory nature conservation bodies, the Food Standards Agency and the Health and Safety Executive. If the UK has comments or reasoned objections to the placing on the market of the GMO in question these will be forwarded to the European Commission. A collective decision will then be taken by member states as to whether or not the GMO in question should be placed on the market in accordance with the provisions of the Directive.

<P>
<a name="30310w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 7 March 2003]:</i> The UK published its Climate Change Programme in 2000. It contains an integrated package of policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors of the UK economy. The programme estimates that these policies and measures could reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by 23 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010, and could reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by 19 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. A formal review of the Climate Change Programme will take place in 2004.

 DTI has established the UK Broadband Task Force to look at the aggregation of public sector broadband demand and it is envisaged that this will help extend broadband availability into rural areas. Projects funded through the &#163;30 million UK Broadband Fund are seeking to develop broadband networks, often in rural and remote areas, and spread best practice from these throughout the country.

I expect further discussions with the European Parliament to take place during the second reading process. The trading scheme is due to begin in 2005. There is provision for the European Commission to bring forward proposals to amend the scheme, including extending its scope to cover other sectors and gases, before the start of the second phase in 2008.

 The income for the Bishopstone estate has fallen by just over 14 per cent. during the last five years as a result of the general downturn in agricultural incomes. The Commissioners, in common with other large estate owners, do not publish precise income figures for their estates, as this information is commercially sensitive.

The Government are committed to ensuring that UK domestic security is given a high priority and the strengthening of the UK's defences against the threats posed by international terrorism was a key theme of last year's Spending Review. Consequently, departments have prioritised measures for improving the UK's resilience to, and capability to deal with, a terrorist attack. UK resilience arrangements have been reviewed and planning has been mainstreamed as a routine activity.

 The impact on developing countries of trade liberalisation depends on a variety of factors such as the nature and extent of initial trade distortions, whether trade liberalisation is comprehensive or limited to a few sectors, and whether other countries also open up their markets. As a result, estimates of impact vary widely. One assessment by the World Bank indicates that comprehensive multilateral trade liberalisation backed up with increased aid for trade related infrastructure (e.g. roads and ports) could lift an additional 300 million people out of poverty by 2015.
<P>

<a name="30310w11.html_para3">The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) provides the framework for multilateral (WTO) negotiations between countries on the liberalisation of trade in services, including water supply. The GATS is a bottom-up agreement, which means that countries themselves decide whether&#151;and 



<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 2003 : Column 40W</I><P>
when&#151;to open up their service sectors to foreign competition. Nor does GATS require or encourage countries to privatise public services. Should WTO members choose to involve the private sector, there is nothing under the GATS to prevent or pressure them into a specific public or private service delivery model.
<P>

<a name="30310w11.html_para4">My Department's priority is to make sure the poor benefit from improved water and sanitation services, through effective regulation and appropriate tariff structures, including subsidies for the poorest, if required. In all water and sanitation services, whether municipalities chose to involve the private sector or not, the principle of cost recovery is important and must be recognised as central to sustainability. Effective institutions that are accountable, representative and transparent are essential to manage and regulate the water sector.

 When a defaulter is brought before the court, the magistrates will have a number of enforcement options available to them. The sanctions to ensure the payment of fines include an attachment of earnings order if the defendant is in employment or deductions from social security benefits if they are not working. The maximum amount that can be deducted from an unemployed person is &#163;2.70 per week. Other options include the issue of a distress warrant, (which empowers the person executing it to seize a person's goods or money to the value of the sum owed), or as a last resort, the court may decide to commit the defaulter to prison. The Courts Bill currently before Parliament proposes a number of new arrangements to facilitate the enforcement of fines, including new penalties such as clamping vehicles and entering the fine in the Register of county court judgments.

 The Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science, in reporting on the UK vehicle registration system, recommended a review of the motor insurance industry aimed at reducing uninsured motoring. The Secretary of State established a Modernising Vehicle Registration Implementation Board to take forward the Jill Dando Institute's recommendations. The insurance industry are represented on that board. They have considered a number of matters and we are currently progressing measures which are intended, among other things, to help reduce uninsured driving. The Road Traffic (New Drivers) Act 1995 already provides that a driver caught driving uninsured within two years of passing his test will have his licence revoked.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what requirements the Department of Health places on <i>(a)</i> public and <i>(b)</i> private bodies to designate a proportion of parking spaces they provide for disabled only use; and what requirements are placed on such providers to enforce disabled only parking.  [101051]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The responsibility for the provision of disabled persons' parking bays on the public highway lies with individual local authorities. They have a wide range of powers available to them to designate parking places for specific users, including bays for use by holders of disabled persons' badges (Blue Badges). The position in private car-parks is different and the conditions of use and provision of parking for disabled people are matters for the individual operators concerned.
<P>

<a name="30310w12.html_para2">The allocation of parking spaces for disabled people is the subject of a Departmental Traffic Advisory Leaflet (5/95) which includes guidance on the proportion of spaces that might be appropriate. The decision on exactly how many parking spaces to provide, both on and off street, remains one for individual authorities and operators to determine, depending on local circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30310w12.html_para3">However, under Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (when fully implemented) service providers will be required to take reasonable steps to ensure that disabled people do not find it impossible or unreasonably difficult to enjoy the service on the same basis as non-disabled people. This will have implications for local authorities and car park operators, who may have to demonstrate that as well as marking out disabled person's parking spaces, they have taken reasonable steps to ensure they are available to disabled people.




<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 2003 : Column 46W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30310w12.html_para4">In terms of enforcement of disabled persons' parking bays, there are a wide variety of powers available to local authorities under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to tackle abuse and misuse on-street. For example it is an offence to park a vehicle which is not displaying a badge in a designated disabled persons' parking bay.
<P>

<a name="30310w12.html_para5">Off-street car parks are private property and the conditions of use are a contractual matter between the owner and the motorist. In these car parks, spaces marked for badge holders only are in most cases not legally enforceable, but depend on the courtesy and consideration of other drivers. Car park operators could ask a non-disabled driver to move their car from a space set aside for disabled people but they might not be in a position to insist upon it.
<P>

<a name="30310w12.html_para6">The Department has, however, given its full support to the 'Baywatch' campaign run by a coalition of disability organisations (including the Disabled Drivers Association and the Disabled Drivers' Motor Club). They are committed to encouraging greater protection of disabled persons' parking bays in retail car parks from abuse by non-disabled drivers.
<P>

<a name="30310w12.html_para7">The issue of enforcement was a key part of the major review of the Blue Badge Scheme that we have just completed. Following a public consultation process that ended last year, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC), the Department's statutory advisers on the transport needs of disabled people, considered responses and submitted 47 recommendations to Ministers on the future shape of the Scheme. I announced in the House on 18 December 2002 that the Government would be taking forward the majority of these, including a number of additional enforcement measures. Details of all the recommendations were placed in the House Libraries on 18 December 2002. The Government will be seeking to implement the changes at the earliest opportunity.
<P>

<a name="30310w12.html_para8">In the meantime, it is open to anybody to bring instances of fraudulent use to the attention of the police, traffic wardens, the appropriate local authority or car park operators and we will continue to work with these bodies and stakeholder groups to minimise the potential for abuse and misuse.

 Airlines, airports, air cargo agents and aviation caterers are currently directed under sections 12 to 14 of the Aviation Security Act 1982. While they may engage agents to act on their behalf, they remain legally responsible for the security function. Work is under way to create a list of approved providers of aviation security, which will include those companies contracted by Directed parties to provide a service. Such companies will have to meet certain criteria, set down by my Department, before they can deliver security functions at British airports.

 Croydon Tramlink is a matter for the Mayor and Transport for London (TfL). I understand that the Tramlink Concession Agreement is between TfL and Tramtrack Croydon Ltd. (TCL). It would not be appropriate for the Government to speculate about TCL's financial arrangements.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many cars in the UK run on biofuels; and if he will make a statement on the benefits of the use of biofuels for the environment.  [101063]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The best indicator of biofuel use is volume of sales rather than number of vehicles. This has increased significantly since the introduction of a lower rate of duty for biodiesel in July 2002; Customs and Excise figures for January indicate over 400,000 litres of the fuel being sold from around 100 filling stations. The November Pre-Budget Report announced a commitment to introduce a similar preferential duty rate for bioethanol and we would expect a similar pattern of take-up of this new fuel once this has been introduced.
<P>

<a name="30310w13.html_para3">Biofuels offer a number of environmental benefits compared to conventional mineral fuels. Importantly, they can contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions due to the absorption of carbon dioxide during the growth stage of the biofuel feedstock; recent studies have shown that both biodiesel and bioethanol can reduce emissions by at least 50 per cent. measured over the "life-cycle" of the fuel. In addition, the use of biofuels can help improve air quality, particularly when used in a blend with conventional mineral fuels. Furthermore, the low toxicity and high biodegradability of biodiesel in particular makes its use ideal for sensitive environments such as waterways.
<P>

<a name="30310w13.html_para4">Biofuels are mainly used in a 5 per cent. blend with conventional fuels. All cars are warranted for use with 



<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 2003 : Column 50W</I><P>
5 per cent. blends of biodiesel and bioethanol which meet the respective European Fuel Standards, EN590 and EN228. Biofuels not produced to these standards may damage vehicles and their use will invalidate car manufacturers' warranties. It is also an offence to use fuel on which the relevant duty has not been paid.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We are extremely concerned about the apparent increase in vehicle cloning in order to avoid road traffic enforcement cameras. We are taking action to tackle this difficult problem.
<P>

<a name="30310w13.html_para5">Since 1 January 2003 it has been a requirement for suppliers of number plates to be registered with DVLA. To date over 26,000 outlets have registered. This will ensure that in future number plates are only sold by registered suppliers to a purchaser who can show proof of entitlement and identity. Records will be kept of all sales for inspection by the police and local authority trading standards officers. Plates already have to be marked with the details of the producer.
<P>

<a name="30310w13.html_para6">In addition, in order to prevent the theft of number plates from vehicles for the purpose of cloning, consideration is being given to the use of additional security features designed to establish a clear and visible link between a number plate and the vehicle on which it should be displayed. The use of more secure fixings is also under urgent investigation.

 Transport for London (TfL) has projected an increase in overall public transport use of 1&#150;2 per cent. as a result of the introduction of congestion charging. TfL expect that there will be about 5,000 additional passengers on London Underground and national rail services in the morning peak (7&#150;10 am). This is around one extra person per carriage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w14.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government has regular meetings with the Strategic Rail Authority covering a range of issues including Mark 1 replacement. The SRA is leading an industry wide Mark 1 replacement programme to ensure that all Mark 1 rolling stock is removed from the Network by 31 December 2004. Because of the failure of Railtrack to ensure an adequate power supply for the South London Network, it has become clear that it may be necessary to provide for around 300&#150;350 vehicles to operate on the network after December 2004 but the SRA expects these vehicles to be removed from the network in Spring 2005. From 1 April 2003 all Mark 1 vehicles will be fitted with Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS), which seeks to prevent a collision by providing automatic braking if trains pass red signals or travel at excessive speed. Compensation is a commercial matter between the relevant parties.

 National statistics show that average motoring costs&#151;for motorists in rural areas and elsewhere&#151;have fallen by 5 per cent. in real terms since 1997. This fall is primarily due to lower car prices which we have encouraged through greater retail competition. We have also reduced vehicle excise duty for motorists who use fuel-efficient cars and introduced fuel duty incentives for clean fuels&#151;all of which rural motorists can benefit from.

From 1 April 2003 capital grants to the private sector will be classified as resource instead of capital. This is why the figures in the resource column increase from 2003&#150;04 onwards. In 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05, the negative capital figures reflect the fact that the main capital item is income from property sales.<P>

(5) pursuant to his written statement of 3 February, for what reason his power to guarantee the Strategic Rail Authority's borrowing under Schedule 14 of the Transport Act 2000 is confined to "sums which the SRA borrows temporarily"; and how he defines "temporarily" in this context;  [98977]
<P>
(6) whether the contingent liabilities of the Strategic Rail Authority in respect of which he proposes to issue a comfort letter includes <i>(a)</i> the Bridge Facility I, <i>(b)</i> the KfW facilities, <i>(c)</i> the EIB facilities and <i>(d)</i> the legacy working capital facility, as set out in Minutes from him laid before Parliament on 27 June 2002;  [98952]

<P>
(9) under what circumstances his statement in paragraph 12 of his proposed comfort letter to the Strategy Rail Authority, that the letter does not create binding obligations and should not be construed as a guarantee, would override his current intention as set out in paragraph 11.  [98969]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The contingent liabilities notified to Parliament on 27 June 2002 were in respect of the SRA's specific obligations for the support arrangements for Network Rail. These included support for the Bridge Facility, the KfW facility, the EEB facility, and the legacy working capital facility. The SRA comfort letter notified to Parliament on 3 February 2003 covers the generality of the SRA's financial obligations, and therefore covers, inter alia, the specific obligations notified in June.
<P>

<a name="30310w15.html_para0">It is not possible to quantify or limit the contingent liabilities in respect of the SRA comfort letter beyond the provisos set out in the letter, especially at paragraphs 9 to 11. The SRA is required to operate within its agreed budget and financial framework.
<P>

<a name="30310w15.html_para1">Any new contingent liabilities in respect of the SRA, or any significant changes to the nature or size of existing contingent liabilities, will be notified to Parliament in accordance with Government Accounting. Under UK 



<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 2003 : Column 57W</I><P>
accounting standards, a liability is defined as contingent if it is dependent on uncertain future events or is not likely to be called. Contingent liabilities do not score as public sector debt.
<P>

<a name="30310w15.html_para2">The Minute accompanying the proposed SRA comfort letter summarises the Secretary of State's statutory powers to finance the SRA. In particular it notes the Secretary of State's opinion that he has no legal power to guarantee the performance of the SRA's financial obligations apart from the provision in Schedule 14 of the Transport Act 2000 in respect of temporary borrowing by the SRA from another person. Temporary borrowing is intended to cover borrowing such as by way of overdraft or bridging facility, where moneys are not intended to be advanced on a long-term basis .
<P>

<a name="30310w15.html_para3">There are currently no such guarantees from public funds for any temporary borrowing by the SRA. If any such guarantees were to be given by the Secretary of State, or where any sum were to be paid out in fulfilling a guarantee, then notification to each House of Parliament is required in accordance with the provisions of the Transport Act 2000.
<P>

<a name="30310w15.html_para4">The statement in paragraph 12 of the SRA comfort letter, that it does not create legal obligations, reflects the legal position in respect of that letter. It is compatible with the statement of the Secretary of State's current intentions in paragraph 11 of the comfort letter.

<a name="30310w15.html_para7">Immunisation against anthrax is recorded in an individual's medical records when it is administered. However, it takes time for copies of these details to be passed back to Ministry of Defence and entered into central records, hence these figures do not include personnel most recently included in the programme. We are confident that a majority of personnel now deploying to the Gulf will opt to receive immunisation against anthrax, and expect take-up to improve further as the programme expands. Up-to-date information on second, third and subsequent immunisations could be only provided at disproportionate cost.

 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2003]:</i> I assume that the hon. Member is referring to the competence of the technical assessor of the bids for the second Wattisham Air Traffic contract. The Wattisham contract was for the provision of air traffic control services, associated equipment maintenance and simulator services. As the most significant proportion of the contract was for air traffic control services for the Ministry of Defence, the most appropriate technical assessor was a military air traffic controller. Against this background it was not considered necessary for the assessor to have had experience of civil air traffic contracting.

The second competition utilised a better defined requirement, a more rigorous and explicit approach to the risk assessment and a different assessment team&#151;all of which improved the quality of the risk assessment overall.

<a name="30310w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 While we have been exchanging information and discussing carrier procurement issues with the French Government, to date there has been no Anglo-French co-operation on CVF at the industry to industry level. As a result of France's decision to buy a second aircraft carrier we are exploring potential areas for co-operation&#151;such as transferring design information and facilitating, in due course, industry to industry links&#151;to inform the French decision-making process. Much will depend on the procurement route and solution selected by France. It is not envisaged that industrial co-operation will impact on our procurement strategy and our relationship with BAE Systems or Thales UK.

 From the start of the CVF Assessment phase contract in November 1999 to the end of the competitive stage on 20 November 2002, the Ministry of Defence paid around &#163;39 million (VAT inclusive) to both BAE Systems and Thales UK. Additional spending by the companies is a matter for them.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress has been made on new technologies for detecting and removing landmines; if he will list such new technologies that have been tested in the field; under what conditions such technologies have been tested; and in which mine-affected countries they are now operational.  [101294]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w16.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Research into mine detection, and destruction or removal, continues to be undertaken by several firms in the United Kingdom. A wide range of technologies have been tested, including: ground penetrating radar; magnetometers (sometimes combined with GPS locating equipment); aerial platforms for mine detection equipment; vehicle mounted mine detection and marking equipment; mine destruction flails; mine destruction and lifting rotators and scarifiers; and pyrotechnic disposal tools. Tests have included remote controlled equipment of all types. Testing work has also been carried out with explosive and mine detection dogs.
<P>

<a name="30310w16.html_para0">Technologies have been tested under control conditions against dummy targets (for example, a known number of targets buried at a known depth in a known location and in a certain type of soil), in dummy minefields laid in typical conditions found in various parts of the world, and under control conditions against live targets. Equipment that is derived from or has benefited from these tests is operational in the Middle and Far East, in Africa, and in Europe (including Bosnia and Kosovo).

 There are no British troops currently involved in landmine clearance. British troops may be required to clear mines on a war fighting deployment in support of operations. They may also be required to carry out limited mine clearance operations or operations other than war if the local situation demands. However, mine clearance on humanitarian operations will normally be passed to appropriate United Nations or civilian contractors.

 The provision of operational and non-operational welfare support to Service personnel and their families is a high priority within the Armed Forces personnel strategy and in particular during operational deployments. Welfare is part of the unit commander's responsibility, supported by welfare staff both within the operational theatre and at home. There are a number of avenues through which a Service person can raise a welfare concern. These include the officer commanding their unit or section, the Chaplain and medical staff. The specific procedures, which apply equally to operational and non-operational duty, are publicised to Service personnel through normal briefing arrangements. Welfare support is also available to the families at home.

The principle is to deal with a complaint in an effective, fair and timely manner at the lowest appropriate level but with provision for escalation if it cannot be resolved there.

Any general advice has to be carefully considered, to ensure that it is neither too vague nor too comprehensive to be useful, given the many different forms that threat may conceivably take. We already publish information on the current security position on the Government's emergency planning website, www.ukresilience.info, together with practical advice as and when necessary in connection with specific alerts, for example handling suspect packages. That site contains a wide range of emergency planning

We are, however, aware of one successful prosecution last year, brought by Crawley borough council in July 2002. The Corporation of London Port Health Authority issued six cautions in October 2002.
<P>

<a name="30310w18.html_para12">A decision to bring a prosecution before the courts is a matter for the enforcement authority. They would take a number of factors into account, including the weight of evidence to prove intent to break the laws in question, and the ability to bring the offender before the British courts. These criteria may not be easy to satisfy in the case of air passengers bringing in meat illegally, especially where small quantities are seized.
<P>

<a name="30310w18.html_para13">In many cases, other penalties may be more appropriate. Seizures are confiscated and destroyed. We have been working with the Home Office to add details of repeat offenders to the warning index used by immigration officers.

 Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has provided the information in the table. Police area constable is not a recognised category. The 



<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 2003 : Column 73W</I><P>
proportion of probationers has been rising as a consequence of the very substantial increase in recruitment that began in 2000&#150;01. As a result of that increased recruitment, by 31 March 2002, police service strength had reached the record number of 129,603, on track for the Government's targets of 130,000 by March 2003 and 132,500 in 2004.

 An independent evaluation of EMAs has been taking place since 1999. Evidence from the second year of the pilots, which was published last year, shows that EMAs have had a positive effect, increasing the number of eligible young people in full time education in year 12 in the pilot areas by 5.9 percentage points, compared to the local authority areas without EMA that we have used as controls.

 A major evaluation of Sure Start began in January 2001. It will examine the impact of Sure Start on children, families and communities, both in the short, medium and long term by tracking a sample of 8,000 children and their families over time. Information on impact and effectiveness will become available over the next 12&#150;18 months. 427 of the 524 planned Sure Start local programmes have been approved to date.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 There have been two independent national evaluation studies on the pre-16 work experience programme, both carried out by the Institute for Employment Studies: "Pre-16 Work Experience in England and Wales" (IES Research Report, 1996), and "Pre-16 Work Experience Practice in England: An Evaluation" (IES Research Report, May 2001). These evaluations both show that placements are generally satisfactory and well-received by schools, pupils and employers. The second evaluation indicated that overall quality had improved since the first, reflecting the impact of a number of initiatives taken to enhance it, but a very small minority of placements were not of good quality and there was scope for further improvement in aspects of practice in some schools. As I indicated in previous answers to the hon. Member, we are committed to enabling all pupils at Key Stage Four to have at least two weeks of high quality work experience, and have measures in hand to promote this.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will estimate the shortfalls in company pension schemes as a result of compliance with FRS17.  [100530]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 There are a number of alternative ways of evaluating the assets and liabilities of pension schemes. The FRS17 accounting standard sets out how pension assets, liabilities and costs should be reflected in 



<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 2003 : Column 84W</I><P>
company accounts. It offsets the long term liabilities of schemes against the current value of assets. The standard is the responsibility of the Accounting Standards Board which is independent of Government. Although companies are currently required to present balance sheet and performance statement information under the FRS17 standard in the notes to their accounts, mandatory full implementation of FRS17 has been deferred until 2005. FRS17 does not in itself create pension liabilities but seeks to make them clear in company balance sheets. It is therefore not appropriate to calculate an estimate of the shortfall in company pension schemes as a result of compliance with FRS17.

<P>

<a name="30310w23.html_para2">Forecasts issued "automatically" will be either a combined pension forecast (CPF) or a state pension forecast issued to a specific group. A CPF is the existing benefit statement issued by the employer/pension scheme provider coupled with a state pension forecast.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will review the practice of recording nil on individual pensions forecasts, when exact levels of entitlement are not known; and if he will make a statement.  [99961]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 There are two elements to a pension forecast. They cover the position at the time the forecast is issued as well as a projection of the position at state retirement age. The first element provides exact information on state pension at "today's" rates based on an individual's current national insurance record at the time the forecast is provided. No assumptions are made in calculating this element of the forecast.
<P>

<a name="30310w23.html_para6">The forecast of expected state pension at retirement age is based on the same record, which assumes that contributions will continue at the same level. Further information is supplied with the forecast to explain the calculation and the projection. In some instances the pension entitlement will be "nil" at the time the forecast is requested. For example, if someone asks for a state pension forecast but has less than 10 years national insurance contributions then they have not accrued enough national insurance contributions for a state pension at that time. However, taking account of current levels of contributions, and projecting that they continue at that level, may mean we can give a positive forecast at retirement age. Some women though may have elected to pay the reduced rate national insurance contribution, so they would not have an entitlement to a state pension in their own right and their forecast would remain as "nil".
<P>

<a name="30310w23.html_para7">The purpose of providing the calculation at "today's" rates and at retirement age is to provide information to individuals to help inform their pension planning and enable them to make informed choices with regard to their retirement income levels.

1. Estimates are based on Census 2001 Key Statistics for local authorities in England and Wales and the General Register Office for Scotland rounded to the nearest 5,000 households.
<BR>
2. A household comprises one person living alone or a group of people (not necessarily related) living at the same address with common housekeeping, that is sharing either a living room or sitting room or at least one meal a day.
<BR>
3. A pensioner household is defined as either a single person over state pension age, a couple, where both partners are over state pension age, or a group of individuals who are all over state pension age.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make it his policy to use the terms 'pension income' instead of 'annuity' and 'pension savings' for funds paid into a pension plan.  [101331]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The terms 'annuity' and 'pension income' are not interchangeable. An annuity is a product that guarantees an income stream rather than being the income stream itself. Consequently, while an annuity can be a source of pension income, pension income need not be in the form of an annuity and it is important that this distinction is made clear. As far as the term 'pension savings' is concerned, the Government are generally in favour of terms like these, which are simple and understandable to individual savers and pension scheme members. The expression 'pension savings' is used in several places in the Green Paper, "Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working and Saving for Retirement" (Cm 5677), which contains proposals to make information available to individuals in the clearest possible way, to help them make decisions about working longer and saving more for retirement.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will estimate the cost to the Exchequer, net of savings in means-tested benefits and of non-introduction of the pension credit and of additional income tax revenue, of an increase of &#163;5 per week in the basic state pension together with the introduction of age additions of &#163;5 per week at age 75&#150;79 and &#163;10 per week at age 80 years and over, on the basis that the age additions for those aged 75 to 79 and 80 years and over are paid in full, regardless of contribution record.  [94404]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Our priority is to target help on those current pensioners who have the lowest incomes. While it is true that older pensioners tend to be poorer on average, income inequality is far more pronounced across the whole pensioner population than between pensioners of different ages. For example, the median net income of the richest fifth of pensioner couples is around four times that of the poorest fifth.
<P>

<a name="30310w24.html_para7">Age additions are not the most effective way to target those pensioners with the lowest incomes. For example, just under half of all minimum income guarantee claimants are aged under 75.
<P>

<a name="30310w24.html_para8">From October 2003, the poorest third of pensioner households will have gained over &#163;1,500 a year in real terms as a result of the reforms introduced by this Government.
<P>

<a name="30310w24.html_para9">If the maximum rate payable of the basic state pension was increased by &#163;5 per week and weekly age additions of &#163;5 were introduced for people aged 75&#150;79 and &#163;10 for people aged 80 and over in 2003&#150;04, we estimate that the increase in public expenditure could be in the region of &#163;0.5bn. This assumes that pension credit is not introduced and spending is re-directed into the basic state pension. It is also calculated on the generous assumption that consequent savings in other benefits and any additional tax yield are channelled back into the basic state pension.
<P>

<a name="30310w24.html_para10">In this scenario, many of the poorest pensioners are no better off than they would have been under pension credit because their increased basic state pension is completely offset by the reduction in their minimum income guarantee. Instead, expenditure is targeted on those further up the income distribution. In addition many pensioners with modest private pension provision would be worse off under this scenario than under pension redit.
<P>

<a name="30310w24.html_para11">For example, a person aged 75 is receiving a full basic state pension and has a small private pension worth &#163;10 per week. Under these proposals, they would receive a basic state pension of &#163;87.45, plus their private pension of &#163;10 per week and would be topped up to &#163;102.10 by the minimum income guarantee.
<P>

<a name="30310w24.html_para12">Under pension credit they would receive &#163;77.45 from the basic state pension and would still be topped up to the guarantee of &#163;102.10. However in addition they 



<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 2003 : Column 95W</I><P>
would also receive a savings credit of &#163;6 per week, giving a total weekly income of &#163;108.10. This person is over &#163;300 per year better off under pension credit than under the suggested proposals.

paediatric continence, will be considered under the forthcoming national service framework (NSF) for children, young people and maternity services.
<P>

<a name="30310w26.html_para2">Good Practice in Continence Services was issued by the Department in April 2000 and provides guidance to primary care trusts (PCTs) on continence services. This includes that PCTs should have specialist continence services in place, which provide patients with an individual assessment of their needs. This assessment should include the provision of continence products to any patient who needs them.
<P>

<a name="30310w26.html_para3">Continence also features in the NSF for older people standard two- person centred care.

 No specific discussions have taken place. However, the Department has made a significant investment in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) over the last three years, &#163;105 million to 31 March 2003, and is committed to achieving radical improvements in the quality and quantity of CAMHS. Our current public service agreement target provides for an expansion of the service by at least 10 per cent, per year for the next three years, leading to a comprehensive service, able to respond to all children with mental health needs in all areas, by 2006. This development is underpinned by over &#163;250 million of additional funding, including &#163;140 million for local authorities. The children's national service framework will set out the standards and milestones for improvements in CAMHS services for all children, including those at risk.

<P>
<a name="30310w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 From 1 April 2002, independent health care establishments that provide treatment with Class 3B lasers, except where these are used by or under the supervision of health professionals, and all independent health care establishments that provide treatment with Class 4 lasers have been regulated under the Care Standards Act 2000 by the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC).
<P>

<a name="30310w26.html_para4">Independent providers of all Class 4 laser treatment are required to comply with regulations made under the Act. There are also two sets of national minimum standards: core standards, which apply to all independent health care providers, and service-specific standards for each type of service provided, including laser treatment. In deciding whether an establishment has complied with regulations, the NCSC must take into account whether it meets the national minimum standards.

 The current national standards of fire cover provide that the country should be divided into four main categories of fire risk, according to the nature of the premises, and that, in response to fires in a particular risk category area, a predetermined number of firefighting appliances will attend within a specified time. The national standards are under review. In the light of the recommendation of the Independent Review of the Fire Service, chaired by Professor Sir George Bain, that the Government should issue guidance to implement a new risk-based approach to fire cover, we are drawing up, for consultation, draft guidance on a new approach. This guidance would provide a national framework, against which fire authorities would prepare local integrated risk management plans, responding to locally identified needs.

<a name="30310w27.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The repeal of section 19 will not alter the statutory responsibility that rests locally with fire authorities to provide fire services. Fire authorities will have guidance on the proposed new approach to fire cover. In addition, they have a general duty, under the Best Value provisions of the Local Government Act 1999, to secure continuous improvement in the way their functions are exercised, having regard to economy, efficiency and effectiveness; and they must consult, amongst others, representatives of persons who use are likely to use their services. The Best Value framework, which is backed up by an inspection regime, gives my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister intervention powers if an authority is failing to comply with its obligations.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many clauses were <i>(a)</i> fully, <i>(b)</i> partially and <i>(c)</i> not debated during the Committee Stage of the Local Government Bill.  [101871]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 In the course of its 14 sittings, the Standing Committee of the Local Government Bill:
<P>

<a name="30310w28.html_para0"><i>(a)</i> fully debated 106 clauses (including 15 new clauses) and two schedules;
<P>

<a name="30310w28.html_para1"><i>(b)</i> partially debated one clause; and

<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w28.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the Standard Spending Assessment was for each year between 1996&#150;97 and 2002&#150;03 and the Formula Standard Spend for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 and the percentage change in each year from the previous year, for the Isle of Wight <i>(a)</i> in total and <i>(b)</i> broken down by major funding blocks; and what the aggregate external finance was for each year.  [101556]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w28.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Over the period requested there have been many changes in the functions and funding of services to local government. To enable a like-for-like comparison between years, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister calculates adjusted Standard Spending Assessment (SSAs) and grants. The percentage change figures have been calculated on the basis of these like-for-like comparisons.
<P>

<a name="30310w28.html_para3">Until the introduction of Central Support Protection Grant in 1999&#150;2000, there was no need to calculate grant on a like-for-like basis, and for this reason grant comparisons in the years 1996&#150;97 to 1998&#150;99 are not available. There were no changes in funding and function between 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 that needed reflecting in adjusted SSAs or grants for 1998&#150;99 to allow a like-for-like comparison; the actual 1998&#150;99 values have therefore been used in this case.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w28.html_wqn5"><B> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what recent guidance has been issued by his Department on the symbols and markings included on Ordnance Survey maps; what assessment he has made of the Ordnance Survey's decision to omit the traditional symbols and markings indicating <i>(a)</i> civil and parish boundaries, <i>(b)</i> national park boundaries and <i>(c)</i> churches from future editions of its maps; and if he will make a statement.  [101719]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w28.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Ordnance Survey, before making decisions about what is depicted on its maps, takes full account of the needs of its customers and other stakeholders. To this end, it consults widely before implementing any change.
<P>

<a name="30310w28.html_para4">Following Parliament's decision to widen public access to the English and Welsh countryside under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act (CRoW), Ordnance Survey has concluded that this access land should be shown on the 1:25 000 Explorer series, which is designed specifically for use during outdoor activities.
<P>

<a name="30310w28.html_para5">The way the access land is shown will be crucial in helping the Open Access initiative to be implemented successfully. Clarity will be vital in minimising any misunderstanding between users of the countryside and landowners. There is much additional information to be added to the mapping. Therefore, to avoid clutter and ensure clarity, it will be necessary to take off some existing information.
<P>

<a name="30310w28.html_para6">Consultation and research among users indicates that the removal of the national park, civil and parish boundaries while adding the access land, significantly improves clarity and helps avoid confusion on the ground. National Park boundaries will remain on the cover diagram of each Explorer and on the printed and data versions of the OS Landranger series. They are also freely available as part of the Get-a-Map service on the Ordnance Survey website.
<P>

<a name="30310w28.html_para7">Ordnance Survey has also consulted users on the proposed changes to symbols for places of worship on both Explorer and the 1:50 000 OS Landranger Map series. In this regard, the primary consideration has been the navigational importance of buildings with towers, spires, domes or minarets. These will continue to be marked with the familiar symbols. Other buildings that are places of worship will continue to appear on the 



<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 2003 : Column 112W</I><P>
maps, but without reference to their religious or cultural significance. Final decisions about the proposed changes will be made within the next few weeks and Ordnance Survey will take into account all points of view.

<P>
<a name="30310w28.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether all planning considerations of individual small-scale applications will be removed from local councils under his plans for regional assemblies.  [101663]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w28.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Local councils will continue to retain all existing powers of development control and none will be transferred to regional bodies now or in the future.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w28.html_wqn7"><B> Norman Lamb: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how much uncollected poll tax revenue remains outstanding in the UK, broken down by local authority.  [101512]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w28.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not currently collect information on the level of community charge (or poll tax) arrears owed to English billing authorities. It is estimated that the arrears in England totalled &#163;185 million at 1 April 2001. This estimate is based on information supplied to the Chartered Institute of Public Accountancy on its revenue collection statistics return and on information on amounts of community charge received, which is collected from billing authorities on the QRC4 return.
<P>

<a name="30310w28.html_para8">After discussions with local government, The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will, however, be collecting information from English billing authorities on the level of community charge arrears as at 31 March 2003 on the QRC4 return for 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="30310w28.html_para9">Figures for Wales and Scotland are a matter for the Welsh Assembly Government and the Scottish Parliament respectively. The community charge never existed in Northern Ireland.

We are now evaluating the responses and will announce our decisions after the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Bill has received Royal Assent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w29.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the interaction between changes in aggregate external finance to local authorities and passporting of schools funding; and what arrangements are in place to ensure that the latter is not undermined by the former.  [102033]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w29.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Aggregate external finance is distributed by formula (Formula Spending Share or FSS) and is not ring-fenced. All authorities with education responsibilities receive at least 3.5 per cent. more formula grant for 2003&#150;04 than they did for 2002&#150;03, on a like-for-like basis. Setting budgets is a matter for local authorities. The Government encourage them to increase spending on schools by an amount equal to the increase in their education FSS. Authorities who have difficulty with this are encouraged to discuss with the Department for Education and Skills. Increases in education FSS were themselves constrained between 3.2 per cent. and 7 per cent. on a per pupil basis, by means of a formula floor and ceiling.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 LASHG was an unfair funding mechanism that did not allocate funds to areas of greatest need, consistently under-spent nationally, and gave unfair advantage to debt-free local authorities.
<P>

<a name="30310w29.html_para0">As part of the measures outlined in "Sustainable Communities: building for the future", The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has decided to abolish LASHG to allow a more strategic use of resources. The change is to take effect from 1 April 2003. I announced the transitional arrangements on 5 March 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 82WS.
<P>

<a name="30310w29.html_para1">Torbay UA has submitted information to the Government Office for the South West indicating that it has a total Local Authority Social Housing Grant (LASHG) commitment of 2,181,500 for 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what plans he has to introduce a referrals unit for complaints to the Standards Board for England.  [101220]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30310w30.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 This is an operational matter for the Standards Board. I understand that a referrals unit is already in place, with the function of assisting the Board in its consideration of allegations. Provisions in the Local Government Bill will allow the Standards Board flexibility to introduce other arrangements for the efficient handling of misconduct allegations.
