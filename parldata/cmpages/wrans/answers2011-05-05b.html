 Churches play an important and often essential role in rural community life.

As well as offering regular opportunities for collective worship and prayer, rural church congregations can give care and support to those suffering isolation and loneliness. Church buildings often act as places where barriers are broken down between different social groups and people have the opportunity to meet together on equal terms, and provide spaces in which events, activities and meetings can take place. Though not all rural churches are suitable for the purpose, some already run formally constituted projects or initiatives, such as pre-schools, youth clubs or facilities for older residents. In some places the church building has been adapted to house specific services such as a Sure Start centre, post office, a community owned shop or library.</p>

 Pay for the armed forces is recommended by the independent Armed Forces' Pay Review Body (AFPRB) who during 2010-11 conducted a quinquennial review of special forces remuneration. Due to the public sector pay freeze the AFPRB did not recommend increases to the rates of basic pay for special forces, but it did recommend enhancements to specialist pay levels paid to the Special Reconnaissance Regiment and niche capability groups working in support of special forces. All these recommendations were accepted and introduced  <br/>

 No. The purpose of allowances is to reimburse service personnel for justifiable expenditure incurred either when on duty or as a result of the unique nature of service life, rather than to supplement income. The current financial position has placed pressure on the level of allowances that are affordable. While there will be some reductions and changes, appropriate allowances will continue in the future. Operational allowances are not affected by these changes. We accept that changes to the allowances package will be unpopular and that some of them may require adjustments to lifestyle, but they are a necessary part of the Department's contribution to the overall Government's programme to reduce the UK deficit we inherited. Nevertheless, we have concentrated on ensuring, where possible, that no group is disproportionately affected by any changes, and have sought to mitigate effects by phasing in some changes by up to two years. The Service Chiefs of Staff and their Principal Personnel Officers have been fully engaged in this process.</p>

 We are concerned by reports that Iran may be providing equipment and support to the Syrian Government to help them quell protests in Syria. Any such support is unacceptable. It would be a further example of Iran's monumental hypocrisy in claiming to support freedom in the Arab world, while violently suppressing demonstrations at home and helping to quell protests in Syria.

 The Red Tape Challenge aims to take a comprehensive approach, looking widely at regulation, whether introduced through primary or secondary legislation or other means. It seeks views on where regulations are working well, as well as where they are imposing unnecessary burdens on businesses, members of the public or voluntary organisations or restricting personal freedoms. We have taken into consideration the duty to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity for all and foster good relations. The website makes clear that the presence of a particular piece of legislation, such as the Equality Act 2010, on the website should not be read as implying any intention on the part of the Government to remove that regulation. We are committed to making this website accessible to all users, regardless of circumstances. The Accessibility Statement is available here:</p>

 In the Budget 2011 the Government committed to reviewing the stock of over 21,000 statutory instruments and regulations in order to reduce the burden on business, members of the public and voluntary organisations. The Red Tape Challenge was launched on 7 April 2011 and is scheduled to last until April 2013. As such, it is too early to estimate the costs and benefits of the Red Tape Challenge website.</p>

 The available information is as follows.

Information for 2010 will not be available until the Secretary of State's Annual Report on the Social Fund is published later in the year so I have provided information for 2009-10.</p>

 Departmental modelling estimates that, once fully implemented, approximately 200,000 households with a disabled child will experience a rise in benefit entitlement of, on average, £23 per week as a result of universal credit and the integrated reform of disability benefits. Approximately 100,000 households with a disabled child will experience a reduction in entitlement of, on average, £28 per week, but these households will receive full cash protection against this change to ensure that there are no cash losers at the point of transition. Estimates on a year-by-year basis during the transition period are not available and sample sizes are too small to yield estimates by income bands.</p>

 Following publication of ‘A state pension for the 21st century’ which launches a consultation on the future of the state pensions system, the Government are consulting on options for simplifying the state pension. Any reforms resulting from these proposals would apply to future pensioners only. The Government will be considering how supporting rules, such as inheritance rights to additional pension under the current scheme could be simplified in a way that ensures they are fairly recognised during the transition to a different system.</p>

 The Social Fund is not being devolved to local councils. The Welfare Reform Bill includes proposals to abolish the discretionary Social Fund. It will be replaced with a combination of locally designed and targeted assistance for the most vulnerable people in the community and a modernised and simplified national system of payments on account accessed through the benefit system.</p>

 It is not possible to report back to 2003 on Jobcentre Plus region, budget area or region as subsequent boundary changes mean the data would not be comparable. Information for 2010 is not available until the Secretary of State's annual report on the Social Fund is published later this year.

                     <i>Notes</i>:
1. The information provided is Management Information. Our preference is to answer all parliamentary questions using Official/National Statistics but in this case we only have Management Information available. It is not quality assured to the same extent as Official/National statistics and there are some issues with the data, for example they do not include applications which were processed clerically and have not yet been entered on to the Social Fund Computer System.
2. Figures are for applications received, not for the number of people who made an application, and for initial awards made, not the number of people who received an initial award. (Some people made more than one application or received more than one initial award.)
3. If an applicant receives an initial award and this award is increased on first review in the same month as the initial award was made, then the Policy, Budget and Management Information System (PBMIS) does not count the initial award and the review award separately, but counts one award on the one application. However, if a first review award is made in a later month than the initial award, then PBMIS counts two awards on the one application. Similarly, if an initial or first review award is increased by the Independent Review Service, then all awards made in the same month on one application count as one award. However, if an initial award or any review award(s) on one application are made in different months, then PBMIS will count one award for each month in which an initial or review award was made. Because of this counting method, only the numbers of initial awards have been given.
4. Figures have been rounded to the nearest 100 and figures may not sum due to rounding.

This can be used where there are no alternative sources of funding. There is no automatic entitlement, but where an Adviser deems the removal of tattoos as necessary to facilitate the take-up of a specific job offer and the cost represents good value for taxpayer’s money, an award could be made.

I also drew attention in this context to the strength of feeling in the United Kingdom on implementing the Court's judgment on prisoners' voting rights, as demonstrated by the recent debates in Parliament; I reiterated this point in bilateral meetings with key figures from the Council of Europe including the Secretary General, the President of the Court and the Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>

My ministerial colleagues and I shall also continue to discuss the reform of the Strasbourg Court with counterparts from other Council of Europe countries when opportunities arise, also particularly with a view to our forthcoming chairmanship.</p>

 Comparisons of the prison population over time are typically made using the figures for 30 June in each year, as the June figures are a good representation of the year, and reasonably unaffected by seasonal effects (such as bank holidays). The tables which have been placed in the Library show the population in each prison establishment in England and Wales as at 30 June in each of the last 10 years. Information on the prison population by establishment is published quarterly in the Offender Management Statistics quarterly bulletin on the Ministry of Justice website.</p>

Indeed some argued that a threshold would probably not achieve any higher yield than an allowance because of these effects with consequent impact on both economic activity and other tax receipts, such as corporation tax.</p>

These provide opportunities for children to learn how to act in an emergency to help others who are injured, ill, or otherwise in danger. External expert organisations such as the Red Cross and St John Ambulance support schools in teaching about first aid and dealing with emergency situations.</p>

                     <i>Notes:</i>
1. Estimates of the number of women who have had at least one live birth are from an ONS birth order model that combines data from birth registrations with survey data on fertility histories to estimate birth order, and then combines these with population estimates to produce the female population by parity.
2. The percentage of women in a particular age group who have had at least one live birth (ie are mothers) is not the same as a birth rate for that age group, which would show the proportion of women who give birth in a specific calendar year.
3. Because the percentage of women with at least one birth increases with age, any comparison of the figures above with figures for females in care may be affected if the female population in care aged 14-19 has a different age structure form the overall female population aged 14-19.
4. Estimates have been rounded to the nearest 10.

 There is no direct information on this. However, as part of their evaluation of the four national health service 111 pilot sites, the university of Sheffield will shortly publish their interim report. A copy will be made available in the Library. This will contain data on the proportion of people who call NHS 111 who are recommended to attend an accident and emergency department, the proportion of people who call NHS 111 for whom an ambulance is dispatched and the total number of calls to NHS 111.</p>

1. January 2011 is the latest available data.
2. Headcount totals are unlikely to equal the sum of components. Further information on the headcount methodology is available in the census publication here:

3. Data Quality
The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses.

 Following the report of Phase 1 of the independent review of the criminal records regime, measures have been included within the Protection of Freedoms Bill to increase the portability of Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) disclosures. This will enable employers to check whether any new information has come to light since a previous disclosure was issued. The review has not looked at specific occupations, but increased portability will be available to all those who apply for enhanced CRB disclosures, including dentists.</p>

 We do not believe it is appropriate to advertise sexual services in local newspapers and welcome the guidance published on this by the Newspaper Society in recent years. An outright ban on advertising sexual services would require legislation which we do not believe would be effectively enforceable. We will look at this issue more closely and consider what more can be done to prevent advertising of sexual services in the media.</p>
