To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals there are to exempt local employment trading schemes from benefit calculations undertaken by local government. [18930]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71210w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Local government does not undertake any benefit calculations on behalf of my Department. For information on benefit calculations undertaken on behalf of the Department for Social Security, I refer my hon. Friend to the reply given today by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham).

<P>
<a name="71210w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Prior: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on planning regulations in respect of the building of telecommunication masts in the countryside. [19331]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71210w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Planning regulations governing the building of telecommunications masts in the countryside are found in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995. This grants a general planning permission for certain telecommunications masts providing


<BR>
the mast is erected by a telecommunications code system operator licensed by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry under the Telecommunications Act 1984;
<BR>
the mast does not exceed 15 metres in height;
<BR>
the mast is not erected in a National Park, area of outstanding natural beauty, conservation area, or the Broads; and
<BR>
the mast is not refused prior approval by the local planning authority within the period allowed under the Order. The authority must be given the opportunity to say whether they wish to approve, within 28 days, details of the mast's siting and appearance. The authority may refuse approval if they consider there to be a serious threat to amenity.

<P>

<a name="71210w01.html_para0">A full application for planning permission is normally required for any mast which does not meet these criteria.

<P>
<a name="71210w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hawkins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many <i>(a)</i> special advisers, <i>(b)</i> task force members and <i>(c)</i> review body members his Department employs; what is the total salary and benefits of <i>(a)</i> to <i>(c)</i>; and what was the equivalent cost prior to 1 May. [19302]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71210w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Strang: </B> 
 There are six paid special advisers in DETR. Two of these are employed on a part time basis each working for half of the week. Prior to 1 May, there were four special advisers in the Department of the Environment and one in the Department of Transport. Special Advisers are paid within a range of &#163;24,349 to &#163;73,484. Their salaries are negotiated individually and are confidential within this range. Details are not provided in order to protect the privacy of the individuals concerned.
<P>

<a name="71210w01.html_para1">DETR sponsors eight task forces and review panels. The members of these bodies are drawn from bodies including local authorities. The voluntary sector, industry, green bodies and academics. Some members are unpaid or are paid expenses only. Where members are paid their fees are negotiated individually and remain confidential. Information on the membership of task forces and review panels prior to 1 May is not held centrally.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71210w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I understand that about 47,000 local government posts in England and Wales are politically restricted under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Information on the number of officials who have been disciplined under these regulations is not held centrally.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71210w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Local planning authorities are expected to have regard to relevant published statements of national planning policy, including Planning Policy Guidance notes, in the exercise of their planning functions. PPG22 states that in assessing proposals in designated areas there is a need to take full account of the specific features or qualities which justified designation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on current expenditure on the modernisation of the London underground service; and if he will list the current modernisation projects. [19810]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71210w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 London Transport expect to invest some &#163;324 million in the Underground network in 1997-98 (excluding investment in the Jubilee Line Extension and in Private Finance Initiative projects). We are looking urgently at public-private partnerships for the Underground in order to increase this level of investment substantially and to create a modern, reliable Underground system.
<P>

<a name="71210w01.html_para2">Among the larger projects completed or in progress this year are the installation of a new signalling and control system on the Central Line, the refurbishment of the East London Line, the modernisation of stations at the southern end of the Northern Line (including Tooting Bec and Tooting Broadway) and investment in new trains for the Northern Line under a PFI contract with GEC-Alsthom.

<P>
<a name="71210w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Todd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the standard spending assessment per head of population for each English shire county in ascending order <i>(a)</i> for 1996-97 and <i>(b)</i> under the draft 1998-99 settlement. [19944]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71210w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The figures for shire counties are shown in the tables enclosed. Note that the provisional 1998-99 and settlement 1996-97 Standard Spending Assessment figures are not comparable owing to changes in local government responsibility and local government reorganisation affecting Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Derbyshire, Dorset, Durham, East Sussex, Hampshire, Leicestershire, Staffordshire and Wiltshire in 1997 and Berkshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Devon, Essex, Hereford and Worcester, Kent, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire and Shropshire in 1998.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71210w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1997]:</i> No. The UK follows the Recommended Practice on international signs contained in the Chicago Convention, Annex 9, provision 6.9, published jointly by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the International Maritime Organisation for use at airports and Ports. Among the general principles set out in the joint publication (Document 9636) are that as far as possible symbols should be used without words on signs at airports and Ports.

<P>
<a name="71210w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1997]:</i> The Department has allocated &#163;1.9 million to the 1997 Christmas Drink/Drive campaign. The campaign uses national television supported by cinema and radio advertising. Print material for use in pubs, clubs and restaurants and by road safety officers has also been distributed.
<P>

<a name="71210w02.html_para0">The Department's campaigns have over the years helped to change the general public's attitude to drink driving to a point where such behaviour is no longer generally acceptable. Deaths have fallen from 1,643 in 1979 to 540 in 1993 and remain steady at this level.
<P>

<a name="71210w02.html_para1">This year's campaign takes a new approach and addresses those drivers who deceive themselves that they know how much they can drink and still be safe to drive, and who fail to recognise the increased risk they pose to themselves and other road users.

<a name="71210w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The 1993 Protocol to the International (Torremolinos) Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels, though not yet in force, will require the carriage of immersion suits on larger new vessels. Its provisions will be applied within the European Union during 1999 by means of a Directive for a harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 meters in length and above. Accordingly, we will introduce regulations to require the carriage of immersion suits on new vessels of 24 meters in length and above. We have no plans to extend this requirement to other UK registered fishing vessels without further consultation with the industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71210w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Seat belts already have to be provided for children being taken on organised trips in coaches first used after 1 October 1988 and in all minibuses. From 10 February next year this requirement will also apply to older coaches.
<P>

<a name="71210w02.html_para2">We take the adequacy of seat belts very seriously. We are therefore proposing that all belts in minibuses and coaches are checked at the annual MOT test, and also that the Vehicle Inspectorate include the condition of all minibus and coach seat belts in the random roadside inspections which they carry out. We have consulted on details and hope to announce shortly how we intend to take this forward.

 The Department makes funds available for after-school childcare under the Out of School Childcare Initiative (OSCI). The Initiative is delivered locally by Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) who have drawn up strategic plans which best meet the needs of their local labour market. For 1997-98 we made &#163;4.1 million available under OSCI to create 7,200 new places.

The Initiative has already created some 78,000 places and offers parents, especially women, the opportunity to participate more fully in the labour market by increasing the supply of good quality, affordable out of school childcare.

<a name="71210w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 UK Athletics 1998, an interim successor body to the British Athletics Federation, was announced on 28 November. The United Kingdom Sports Council is proposing to make a significant investment through its Exchequer funding to support the body during its envisaged 12 months' life. The Government welcomes the formation of this new body and very much hopes that the consultation process which the new body is to manage will be the first step to establishing the most effective structures for athletics in this country. I am pleased that the United Kingdom Sports Council has been able to assist with this process.

 A grant of &#163;1.46 million has been awarded to British athletics by the National Lottery Sports Fund for their World Class Performance Plan, an agreed development programme for 195 of our top athletes. This includes provision for the employment of a Performance Director and four Technical Directors, as well as support for 18 National Event Coaches. This will ensure that our top athletes have access to the professional coaching they need to achieve greater success on the world stage. A separate stand-alone company has been established to receive the Lottery Grant and manage the programmes set out in the World Class Performance Plan.

<a name="71210w05.html_para3">These differences do not affect the PSBR.
<P>

<a name="71210w05.html_para4">The Control Total figure for 1998-99 reflects the decision not to proceed with the commutation of &#163;4.5 billion of local authorities housing debt to central government that was assumed in the 1997-98 FSBR. The commutation was cancelled because it would have had a net cost to the government and the PSBR, mainly because of administrative costs, and because it had no merits in terms of housing policy. However, it appeared to reduce public spending because of an anomaly in the old definition of the Control Total which scored both the subsidy paid to local authorities' housing revenue accounts by central government and the interest payments by local authorities that the subsidy financed. As the Pre-Budget Report announced, this double counting has now been removed from the Control total.

(5) Figures are shown for the national accounts definition of capital spending (including expenditure out of the proceeds of the National Lottery). See paragraph 5A.10.<P>

(6) Outturn figures for 1996-97 are not yet final and will be subject to revision.<P>

(7) The figure for local authority capital spending in 1997-98 corrects that used in preparing figures for the Pre-Budget Report. Cm 3804, which was &#163;0.3 billion too high. The figure for net capital spending in Table B1 of the Pre-Budget Report is therefore inconsistent with the figure shown here for public sector capital expenditure net of depreciation.<P>

(8) Excluding the capital expenditure of industries privatised or planned to be privatised before 31 March 2000.<P>

(9) Including industries now privatised while they were in the public sector.<P>

(12) Education<P>

<P>

The &#163;1 billion provided for schools in 1998-99 in the Budget has been added to support for local authorities and appear in the figures for DETR--Local Government, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Education SSA line shows central government's provision for a nominal "standard level of service" in education. The amount of money is a broad indicator of local authority spending on education; the final decisions are made by individual local authorities. The Education SSA line includes the 1998-99 money transferred to DETR--LG following the abolition of nursery vouchers.<P>

The spending plans for the Department of Education and Employment are reduced on 1997-98 and 1998-99 by the expected proceeds from sales of student loans (&#163;1.6 billion in each year). The apparent reduction in spending between 1997-98 and 1998-99 principally consists of transfers to other departments including DETR--Local Government and DSS. There is a real terms increase in overall provision for education in 1998-99.<P>

<P>

(13) Further EYF Take-up<P>

<P>

This is the Treasury estimate of likely further take-up by departments before the end of 1997-98 of unspent provision carried forward from last year under the end-year flexibility rules. Some &#163;450 million of EYF has already been taken up in the Winter Supplementary Estimates and is included in the departmental totals.<P>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will update Table 6.5 of the Financial Statement and Budget Report 1996-97 to show comparisons of the outturns with Table 6.5 estimates for 1996-97, and comparisons of current estimates for 1997-98 and 1998-99 with such estimates for these years as appeared in Table 6.5 (FSBR 1996-97).

 <i>[holding answer 8 December 1997]:</i> The Government is wholly committed to PFI, and has wasted no time putting into place the changes needed to revitalise the initiative. Following consultation with PFI practitioners, Malcolm Bates' review identified a number of areas that warranted attention, and the Government has acted quickly to issue guidance and help from the centre, to encourage departments to set realistic priorities, to work on establishing standard templates to reduce the need for repetition of effort, and to put in place legislation to facilitate the flow-through of contracts in the health and local authority sectors. We are already seeing positive results, with contracts signed for two major hospitals, and education establishments at Clarendon College and Colfox School in Dorset.
<P>

<a name="71210w06.html_para3">This table is compiled every six months. The latest version, set out below, represents the latest figures that have been collected centrally. These are estimates, and not targets to be met at any price. The Government's priority is to conclude good value for money projects. We are also promoting a wide range of other public-private partnerships, many of which would not be captured by this table:

<P>

<a name="71210w07.html_para1">The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply, as the Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), to your recent question on the method of collating unemployment figures.


<BR>
ONS uses the International Labour Organisation (ILO) measure of unemployment, derived from the quarterly Labour Force Survey (LFS), and counts as unemployed people who are: (a) without a paid job; (b) available to start work within the next two weeks and (c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained. The LFS has used the ILO measure since 1984. Prior to this a slightly different definition was used. This included people who were without a paid job who were looking for work in the reference week, or prevented from seeking work by temporary sickness or holiday, or were waiting to start a job they had already obtained or were waiting for the results of a job application. Full-time students who were seeking work but who were not available to start work in the next two weeks because they had to complete their education were excluded. The LFS moved over to the ILO measure because it is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis and the ONS does not intend to revert to the earlier definition.
<BR>
Since October 1983, the ONS has also published the monthly claimant count, which is based on the administrative system and includes all people claiming unemployment-related benefits (i.e. Jobseeker's Allowance or National Insurance credits) at Employment Service offices on the day of the monthly count, who on that day had signed on as unemployed and available to do any suitable work. Essentially, all people who attend an Employment Service office to sign on the designated day are counted.
<BR>
No official estimates are available for current claimant count under any previous coverage as no information is available on how many people would be registered unemployed now, on the basis of old procedures which no longer exist. The effects of changes in the coverage of the monthly claimant count vary over time. Attempting to calculate their effects today would involve speculative estimates about economic, demographic and other factors.

<BR>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply, as Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), to your recent parliamentary question on deaths attributed to methadone.
<BR>
The number of deaths in the United Kingdom for which methadone was mentioned on the death certificate are given in the table below, for 1993 to 1996.
<BR>
The deaths included correspond to those with an underlying cause of death of drug dependence, nondependent abuse of drugs, accidental poisoning, suicidal poisoning or poisoning undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted.
<BR>
The figures include deaths attributed to methadone in combination with other drugs. In some cases, therefore, the deaths may not be directly or solely due to methadone.

<i>Note</i>: Since 1993, the ONS has coded all diseases, injuries, drugs, operations and external causes mentioned on death certificates for England and Wales. This information is held electronically and we were able to extract data from 1993 to 1996. Comparable figures for years prior to 1993 could only be produced at disproportionate cost. A revised system for collecting information on drug-related deaths in Scotland was introduced in 1994. It is likely that the increase in numbers since 1993 is in part due to better information being provided by this new system.

 The recently announced proposals for the reform of the legal aid scheme are aimed at controlling expenditure. It is only when spending is under better control that we can consider extending the number of benefits which automatically qualify an applicant for legal aid.
<P>

<a name="71210w08.html_para0">Recipients of the benefits mentioned are not excluded from the legal aid scheme. However, they do not automatically qualify. Since the award of these benefits is not means tested a financial assessment must be undertaken before legal aid can be granted.

 Since my predecessor as Chairman of the Accommodation and Works Committee, the hon. Member for Ogmore (Sir R. Powell), last reported to the House on 20 March 1997, <i>Official Report</i> column 686, good progress has been made by our designers and contractors. However, we have had to wait 11 months longer than London Underground Ltd. promised for its Jubilee Line Extension works at Westminster Station to be completed to an acceptable standard, so that construction on our site above the new station could start. On 13 October 1997 London Underground Limited made part of the site available so that the House's contractor could start preliminary work, and it is planned that our contractor will occupy further parts of the site, sufficient for the main construction to begin, on 5 January 1998.

The structural engineers, Ove Arup and Partners, have had to resolve complex design issues to span the building over the District and Circle lines and the Jubilee Line extension, and to accommodate special security requirements. Our construction managers, Laing Management Limited, also face a most demanding engineering task in assembling this unique structure and commissioning the building. Manufacture of components is now proceeding satisfactorily to meet requirements of the programme, and it is planned that the House will be able to occupy the building from the beginning of 2001.

 Every patient has a right to be registered with a GP. Health Authorities have a statutory responsibility to ensure that patients resident in their administrative area have adequate access to general medical services. Health Authorities have the power to allocate patients to GPs in exceptional circumstances where no GP is willing to take them on.
<P>

<a name="71210w08.html_para6">Information on the number of GPs refusing to register children whose parents choose not to have them immunised is not available. This is because GPS are not obliged to give their reasons for refusing to register patients or to notify their Health Authority of the overall number involved. However, information relating to number of patients removed from GPs' lists is collected. Reasons for removal vary and include an act or threat of violence against a GP, a breakdown in the GP/patient relationship and patients themselves requesting a transfer to another GP. In 1995-96, 2,913 patients were removed from GP lists in Wales (out of a total patient registration of nearly 3 million). A breakdown of this figure is

 In 1998-99, the Welsh Office budget will amount to over &#163;7.1 billion. This provision is based on plans set by the previous administration. The Government took the view that it would not be sensible to make hasty decisions about changing existing public expenditure plans. We do not want to put money into areas where the objectives are unclear and the outputs uncertain. Instead, we are conducting a Comprehensive Spending Review of public expenditure across all Government Departments. In Wales, the Review is well underway and I expect it to be completed in the spring of 1998. This will help to ensure that we are better equipped to make informed judgments of where to target public expenditure to meet our priorities and achieve the best results. It will provide a sound basis for the Assembly to set its own priorities. In the meantime, we have recognised that there are some sectors which require immediate help and that is why we have made additional provision for health and education.

<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para1">In a written answer to a question tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. Caton) <i>Official Report</i>, 2 December 1997, columns <i>117-20</i> I have already announced the provisional settlement for local government. I have now allocated the remainder of the Welsh Block resources and the major elements are set out in the following table. It is my intention to discuss the details of the allocation at a sitting of the Welsh Grand Committee on 16 December.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para2">In the consultation document which I issued on 27 October, I made it clear there would be difficult decisions to make. The plans which I inherited have left little scope for manoeuvre. As a consequence, while I have been able to redistribute some cash this inevitably means those programmes which gain do so at the expense of others.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para3">For the NHS, I have allocated &#163;2,455 million which is an increase of over &#163;113 million or 4.9 per cent. in cash terms over 1997-98. This will provide real growth on health authority revenue allocations which will be announced soon.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para4">I have increased the plans I inherited for the Education Sector. In addition to the &#163;65 million extra announced for schools in the July budget, the reallocations I have made to my Block enables me to provide &#163;175 million for the Further Education Funding Council which will provide for an increase of 2,100 students on the original plan for 1998-99. &#163;232 million is provided for the Higher Education Funding Council which will give an extra 1,000 students over the original planning figure.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para5">Although the Training and Enterprise budget shows a reduction from the current plans, this should be seen in the context of the range of measures which have been introduced to help unemployed people. Under these "New Deal" arrangements I expect Wales to benefit by around &#163;190 million during the lifetime of this Parliament.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para6">For Industry programmes, I have made provision to meet the forecast demand for Regional Selective Assistance.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para7">I have looked closely at the budgets of all the quangos in Wales. I have taken particular interest in those which will form the Economic Powerhouse, and collectively, I have increased the amount of grant-in-aid available to these bodies to take account of the fall in the level of receipts that they will be able to generate. This will allow for a total gross programme of the combined bodies of &#163;185 million.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para8">Although there is a reduction in the overall provision for Roads and Transport, I am able to allow a start on some integrated transport schemes.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para9">In the housing sector, I have allocated sufficient funding to housing associations so as to allow around 2,300 new homes to be started next year which is an increase of 500 over the plans I inherited.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para10">I have maintained spending on the Arts bodies.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para11">For all the other bodies which receive funding from the Welsh Office I have retained the same provision as planned, although I have increased the budget for the Countryside Council for Wales to help it progress the new agri-environmental programme.




<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 1997 : Column: 582</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para12">I have also provided a sum of &#163;17 million to enable suitable accommodation to be obtained to house the National Assembly of Wales.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para13">Further to my announcement of the proposals for local government revenue spending for 1998-99 on 2 December, my officials have today written to all Welsh councils setting out my proposals for capping and council tax damping. The letter also gives councils details of their provisional standard spending assessment or SSAs--the amount included in my expenditure plans (total standard spending) for their individual spending.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para14">My capping proposals will enable Welsh councils overall to increase 1997-98 budgets by around &#163;125 million or over 4.6 per cent., if they see fit to do so. Each authority will have a 3 per cent. basic increase in its budget. In addition they will each receive a share of the &#163;26.5 million I am making available for community care, education for 4-year-olds and the National Grid for Learning. Around half of Welsh authorities will also benefit from the "passporting" of year-on-year SSA increases which are greater than the cash increase they receive under the 3 per cent. basic increase.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para15">Within each authority's SSA I propose to identify the sums relating to the extra &#163;50 million I am providing for schools; the $41.5 million (which includes the &#163;37.1 million in returned nursery voucher money) which I am making available for 4 year olds education; and community care.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para16">In my Answer of 2 December I said that the increased discretion my capping proposals give local authorities mean that the average band D council tax could rise by &#163;60. I also emphasised the need for local authorities to take full account of the impact on council taxpayers in using their discretion. My hope is that the average band D increase will not exceed &#163;50-or one pound per week.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para17">I accept, however, that there will be variations in tax increase between authorities, and for this reason I am proposing a community-based council tax reduction scheme for 1998-99 which will ensure that no council taxpayer faces an increase at band D of more than &#163;70. For the majority of people, who live in properties in bands A to C the increase will be less--slightly over &#163;1 a week for those living in bands B and C; under &#163;1 a week for those in band A properties.
<P>

<a name="71210w09.html_para18">I am making &#163;31 million available within aggregate external finance to fund the tax reduction scheme. This includes &#163;6 million extra I am providing specifically for damping.

 Clause 1 of the Teaching and Higher Education Bill will allow for the establishment of a General Teaching Council for England and Wales and Clause 6 allows for the establishment of the General Teaching Council for Wales as and when the Secretary of State decides. The Welsh Council could be set up at the same time as the English one or at a later date. In deciding when it should be established, the Secretary of State will take account of the emerging constitutional changes affecting the governance of Wales.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he will publish the Government's response to the Home Affairs Committee report into the management of the Prison Service (Second Report of Session 1996-97 HC57). [20455]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71210w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I am pleased to report that I will tomorrow publish the Government's response to the Home Affairs Select Committee's inquiry report into the management of the Prison Service. Copies will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="71210w10.html_para0">I am grateful for the Committee's report, and have studied its conclusions and recommendations carefully. I agree with the Committee's conclusion that the Prison Service has done well to manage a rapidly rising prison population and, against this background, has made considerable progress in providing acceptable accommodation for prisoners. The Government accept in principle the desirability of reducing the present high levels of overcrowding, although the Audit of Prison Service Resources, published on 25 July, shows that this will be difficult to achieve in the current circumstances. In the meantime, it will be a priority for the Prison Service to seek to provide adequate regime activities for those prison which are overcrowded. In order to ensure that the projected numbers can be accommodated safely, I have provided the Prison Service with an additional &#163;43 million this year and next to increase capacity and to pay for the costs of overcrowding and purposeful activity. Longer term resourcing issues will be considered as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review.
<P>

<a name="71210w10.html_para1">The Committee's conclusions that the needs for accountability and responsibility require Ministerial involvement are correct, and support the steps I have already taken to implement the Government's manifesto commitment to take proper Ministerial responsibility for the Prison Service. I have made clear that there are no present plans to end the Prison Service's agency status. I have considered and endorsed the findings of the Director General's organisational review of the Service, published on 10 November, which included measures to re-assert and reinforce Ministerial responsibility for the Prison Service.
<P>

<a name="71210w10.html_para2">The Committee also endorses the role of the private sector, and recommends that its involvement in the Prison Service should be allowed to develop further. The Government have expressed reservations about the principle of contracting out the management of prisons. It is generally accepted that responsibility for the incarceration of offenders must remain with the state. As I explained in my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall) on 19 June 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>247-49</i>, the issue is whether that responsibility should, as a matter of principle, be discharged through direct management in the public sector or whether it can properly and effectively be discharged under a regulatory framework. The Government will give careful consideration to the conclusions put forward by the Home Affairs Select Committee before settling their overall approach to this issue.

 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1997]:</i> The Prison Service is actively involved in identifying and caring for all prisoners, both female and male, who are at risk of suicide and/or self-harm.

Every prison has a local Suicide Awareness Team which has oversight of the strategy in their establishment.

<a name="71210w10.html_para9">The strategy involves the Samaritans, who befriend prisoners in crisis through visits to prison and by phone. Over the last five years, the Samaritans have been actively involved in setting up Listener/Befriender schemes in prisons where selected prisoners are trained to provide peer group support for fellow prisoners in crisis. These schemes have been effective in reducing instances of suicide and self-harm

<a name="71210w11.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1997]:</i> It is Prison Service policy to detain convicted and unconvicted female prisoners in the same prison to enable them, on their return from court, to await transfer to a training prison, to serve a short sentence, to be held close to their homes and, for those facing further charges, to remain near the courts.
<P>

<a name="71210w11.html_para0">This does not necessarily mean that unconvicted prisoners should mix with convicted prisoners, unless they are willing to do so. At most local prisons, however, overcrowding prevents complete separation and some mixing is unavoidable, both for activities and in living areas.

[19454]
<P>

<P>
<a name="71210w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 No. The position remains as set out in my reply to my hon. Friend of 20 June 1997, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>307-08.</i> Since 1992, only one company has been granted authority to possess prohibited electro-shock devices, and that authority does not allow the company to sell or otherwise dispose of the devices in any way. When the time comes for the company to dispose of the weapons, they will have to apply for their authority to be varied so as to allow them to do so. That authority will be worded to ensure that the devices are disposed of safely with no risk of their falling into the wrong hands.
<P>

 <i>[holding answers 20 November 1997]:</i> The contract for Her Majesty's Prison Altcourse requires the contractor, Group 4, with the Chief Probation Officer for Merseyside, to carry out negotiations under the terms of the Framework Document published by the Prison Service under cover of Instruction to Governors 30/93 and entitled National Framework for the Throughcare of Offenders in Custody for the Completion of Supervision in the Community. In the light of these negotiations, the contractor may decide whether or not to employ seconded 



<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 1997 : Column: 593</I><P>
probation officers in order to undertake his contractual obligations to provide welfare assistance, discharge reports and plans for individual prisoners that are fully compatible with the Prison Service's Sentence Planning Manual. Group 4 have decided not to do so. Instead, the contractor will employ its own staff.
<P>

<a name="71210w12.html_para1">As in many prisons, responsibility for this work will be shared. At Her Majesty's Prison Altcourse, it will be undertaken by staff, including prisoner custody officers, based on houseblocks, a specialist counselling team who will work closely with a clinical psychologist and a throughcare team. The latter will include four social workers required to hold one of the recognised qualifications for appointment as a probation officer, that is the Certificate of Qualification in Social Work or the Diploma in Social Work. Their duties include risk and needs assessments, plans for supporting individual prisoners, prisoner programmes, in-care and resettlement, reports for conditional release and external liaison with community supervision agencies.
<P>

<a name="71210w12.html_para2">Prison Service staff responsible for the administration of the contract have discussed these arrangements with Group 4 while reviewing preparations to open Her Majesty's Prison Altcourse on 1 December. Their effectiveness will be monitored as part of the general oversight of the contract undertaken by prison staff on site when the prison is operational. These arrangements do not reflect a change in Government attitude towards the issue of throughcare. Subsequent design, construct, manage and finance contracts reflect different principles which have been agreed in discussions between the Prison Service and the Association of Chief Probation Officers.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71210w12.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 November 1997]:</i> The Prison Service was allocated an additional &#163;43 million in July this year to increase prison capacities to avoid a shortage of accommodation during this financial year and next. However, the short-term population projection prepared by the Research and Statistics Directorate of the Home Office in October 1997 indicates that a shortage of accommodation may emerge in early 1999.
<P>

<a name="71210w12.html_para3">The projection was based on the surmise that recent trends in sentencing would continue. Measures have already been put in place which will reduce the prison population, including plea before venue, which is expected to save between 1,100 and 2,600 places. The recently announced home detention curfews are also expected to free up between 3,000 to 4,000 prison places a year.
<P>

<a name="71210w12.html_para4">The next prison population projection is scheduled for publication in January 1998.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade (1) what plans she has to ratify the treaties adopted at the WIPO conference in Geneva in December 1996 intended to enable British music companies to make their recordings available to consumers world-wide via digital networks; [19959]

<P>
(5) what plans she has to ratify the treaties adopted at the WIPO Conference in Geneva in December 1996.[19963]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71210w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The Government fully appreciates the fundamental significance of the new treaties to the UK music industry, which was one of the principal reasons why officials from my Department were at the forefront in securing the successful conclusion of the treaties last December. It follows therefore that we wish to ensure that the UK is in a position to ratify the treaties at the earliest possible time. We also intend to take every opportunity during the forthcoming UK Presidency of the EU Council of Ministers to impress the urgency of the task upon our European partners. In doing so, we will stress the particular relevance of the treaties to the protection of sound recordings in digital networks.
<P>

<a name="71210w13.html_para2">A number of changes to UK law are however needed to enable us to ratify the treaties. Several of these are in areas which the European Commission's planned Directive on copyright and related rights is expected to cover. We will need, therefore, to know the likely form of future EC law in these areas with reasonable certainty before we can reach conclusions on legislation to implement the treaties in the UK, in order to avoid inconsistencies between the two. We do not expect to be in such a position for some months at least, since the draft Directive has yet to be submitted to the Council of Ministers. Although we would hope to be able to proceed with treaty implementing legislation as soon as the situation regarding EC law becomes clear, it will not be possible for legal and other reasons for the UK to ratify the treaties until the Community as a whole and all of its Member States are in a position to do so.
<P>

<a name="71210w13.html_para3">Once the draft Directive is submitted, which we anticipate will be early in 1998, discussions on it will start at Council Working Group level, and we hope to make as much progress as possible during our Presidency. However, before the Council can reach a common position on the draft Directive, the European Parliament will have to give its opinion and we believe that this is unlikely to occur during the UK Presidency.

<a name="71210w14.html_wqn6"><B> Ms Julie Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) what information services are used in the New Deal for Lone Parent pilot areas; and who provides them; [16462]
<P>
<UL>(2) what resources she will make available for local partnerships as a result of the New Deal for Lone Parents pilots. [16442]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71210w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 New Deal for Lone Parents will fulfil the Government's commitment to provide practical help and advice for lone parents on Income Support whose youngest child is at school and who want to work. The programme is already available in eight areas and will be rolled out nationally from October next year, at a cost of &#163;150 million over the course of this Parliament, raised from the Windfall Levy.
<P>

<a name="71210w14.html_para1">Results from the first eight areas are encouraging. Many lone parents with pre-school children are asking if they can participate in the New Deal. An additional &#163;25 million has therefore been made available from October next year to offer the service to lone parents with a child under five who want to work. In addition, the New Deal for Lone Parents will be available to all lone parents who make a new claim for Income Support from April 1998.
<P>

<a name="71210w14.html_para2">New Deal Advisers are able to provide a range of information to participating lone parents. A key feature of the New Deal service is the provision of advice on how in-work benefits can help lone parents to be better off in-work. Advisers obtain estimates of likely entitlements to in-work benefits such as Family Credit from the Integrated Benefit Information System (IBIS) developed by the Benefits Agency.
<P>

<a name="71210w14.html_para3">Information on job vacancies is available via the Employment Service Labour Market System (LMS). Advisers based in Employment Service Jobcentres can access this information direct, whilst those based in Benefits Agency offices can receive information on LMS vacancies from the Vacancy Manager at their local Jobcentre. This information helps Advisers to match job vacancies to the needs of lone parents.
<P>

<a name="71210w14.html_para4">The lone parents who move into work as a result of the New Deal may need help to find suitable childcare. Advisers in all of the first eight areas of the New Deal for Lone Parents have access to a database of local childcare facilities which has been prepared by a consultancy following a competitive tender. In some areas, Advisers are making use of other childcare information services where these offer a better service. Advisers in Cardiff are using the Chwarae Teg database of childcare facilities in Wales, whilst those in Cambridgeshire have direct access, via the internet, to the Opportunity Links system.
<P>

<a name="71210w14.html_para5">Although there are no formal local partnerships in place in the eight first phase areas, New Deal Advisers have been encouraged to form close links with local employers, Training and Enterprise Councils, Local Authorities and voluntary organisations. As part of the process of planning for national implementation of the New Deal for Lone Parents, the Government is consulting with employers, Local Authorities, the TEC National Council and voluntary sector organisations. Any partnerships resulting from these negotiations will be financed from the funds already allocated to deliver the New Deal over the course of this Parliament.

 The Government is committed to supporting and strengthening the framework of occupational pensions, and to create a new framework of secure, flexible and value for money second pensions for those who do not have the opportunity of contributing to a second pension, either because they lack the resources or because they do not have access to a decent second pension.

Our top priorities will be to agree the EU negotiating mandate on the future of Lome and secure the EC's commitment to the DAC's 21st century strategy and international development targets.

<a name="71210w18.html_wqn12"><B> Mrs. Ewing: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will publish the total expenditure by his Department on <i>(a)</i> research and <i>(b)</i> nursing research within the NHS in Scotland for each year since 1990 broken down by health board. [18663]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71210w18.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) of the Management Executive of the NHS in Scotland has responsibility for managing funds which support research activity to further the development of health care in Scotland. Details of CSO expenditure for each year since 1990 are given in the attached table 1a.
<P>

<a name="71210w18.html_para4">Since 1994-95, the CSO has funded the Nursing Research Initiative for Scotland (NRIS) in Glasgow and, before that, the Nursing Research Unit (NRU) in Edinburgh specifically for nursing research. In addition, other CSO-funded research includes nursing research. It is possible only to distinguish nursing research funding in recent years, as shown in Table 1b. (It should be noted that nursing grants awarded in-year can be spent over a number of years).
<P>

<a name="71210w18.html_para5">It is not possible to break down the expenditure in Tables 1a and b by health board. NRIS is a national body (as was NRU before it), and other research funding frequently crosses health board boundaries and is collaborative.
<P>

<a name="71210w18.html_para6">Information regarding expenditure by health boards and NHS Trusts to support research infrastructural costs is not readily available prior to 1995-96. From that year, NHS Trusts in Scotland were asked to declare their expenditure to support research. As a result, the declared amount of &#163;27,743 thousand for each of the years 1995-96 and 1996-97 was allocated to Trusts. Details of allocation by health board area are given in the attached Table 2. Costs specific to nursing cannot readily be broken down by health board area but totalled &#163;0.7 million in the Declaration.

 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1997]:</i> <i>(a)</i> There are no existing guidelines for police forces in Scotland in respect of transsexuals although the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland is considering the need for specific guidance; <i>(b)</i> The Scottish Courts Service has no special arrangements in respect of transsexuals. All court users are dealt with on an equal basis. There are no plans to review these arrangements;<i> (c)</i> To date, the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) has not received any transsexual into its custody. SPS would confine the transsexual in whichever prison was most appropriate for the individual, taking account of the requirement to maintain good order and to care for all prisoners with humanity. Each case would be considered on an individual basis. There are no plans to review current arrangements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland (1) how many actions were raised under section 240(1) and (3) of the Criminal Procedures (Scotland) Act 1995 in relation to amendment or revocation of a community service order in the last year for which figures are available; and in how many cases legal aid was available; [19726]

 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1997]:</i> The information available on actions relates to breach of community service orders under Section 239(4) to (6) of the Criminal Procedures (Scotland) Act 1995 of which there were 568 in 1994; no information is available centrally for actions under the other provisions.
<P>

<a name="71210w20.html_para0">As for legal aid, in 1996-97 Assistance by Way of Representation (ABWOR) was granted for 606 cases under Section 42 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988; 1,260 cases under Section 232 of the Criminal Procedures (Scotland) Act 1995; 597 cases under Sections 239(4) to (6) of the 1995 Act; and 84 cases under paragraph 4 of schedule 7 to the 1995 Act.
<P>

<a name="71210w20.html_para1">ABWOR is available for actions under Section 233 of the 1995 Act but no information on numbers is available. For the remaining provisions, criminal legal aid is available for actions but only if it was previously granted in relation to the original procedure which resulted in the orders.

<P>
<a name="71210w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McLeish </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1997]:</i> Although no central record is kept of applications brought under sections 5(3) or 6(3), or of appeals under sections 5(4) or 6(4) of the Proceeds of Crime (Scotland) Act 1995, I understand from the Lord Advocate that he is not aware of any applications or appeals having been made under section 5 of the Act, and that in relation to section 6, he is aware of only three applications and one appeal.
<P>

<a name="71210w20.html_para2">Information is not available on which of these cases received legal aid. However, where a third party was involved legal aid covering representation would not have been available to them. That anomaly is however being resolved through regulations which have recently been laid before the House.

<P>
<a name="71210w20.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Ewing: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement on the fishery closures in the Moray Firth; what assessment he has made of the cause and source of the Captain's Field oil spillage; and by what means local fishermen will be able to pursue damages for loss of fishing opportunity. [19568]
<P>

<P>
<a name="71210w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Dewar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1997]:</i> The imposition of the exclusion zone on 21 October under Part I of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 followed the discovery of hydrocarbon contamination and associated taint in samples of shellfish (Nephrops) together with elevated levels of hydrocarbons in sea-bed sediment. Further testing subsequently confirmed that round fish taken from the area were uncontaminated and free from taint and the restrictions on these species were lifted on 14 November. Restrictions will remain in place for flatfish and shellfish until results of analysis show that these species are unaffected or no longer affected.
<P>

<a name="71210w20.html_para3">Originally it was considered that the contamination may have been caused by the oil spill from the Captain Field in August. However it is now clear that this was not the case. The scope for fishermen to pursue compensation claims will be dependent on an exact source of the contamination being established. Meanwhile it is very much in the interst of the fishing industry that contaminated catches do not find their way on to the market.
<P>

<a name="71210w20.html_para4">The Department of Trade and Industry has undertaken an investigation into the circumstances of the Captain oil spill and a report has been submitted to the Procurator Fiscal. As the Procurator Fiscal's own investigation is currently underway no further information can be given at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71210w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Dewar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1997]:</i> Relations with Europe are the responsibility of the United Kingdom Parliament and Government. However, the Government intend that Ministers and officials of the

<P>
<a name="71210w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McLeish </B>

 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1997]:</i> On admission to Cornton Vale Prison, every prisoner is assessed by a nurse. Every prisoner is also seen within 24 hours by the Medical Officer for a full assessment including current and past mental health history and treatment. Each Prisoner is the subject of a weekly care meeting attended by a multi-disciplinary team of prison staff and professionals. If a problem is identified, the needs of the individual are established and progress monitored. Prisoners may be referred at any stage for counselling and have ready access to staff, psychologists, psychiatrists, nursing and medical support. Support is also available from a range of voluntary organisations and the prison's "Listener" scheme.
