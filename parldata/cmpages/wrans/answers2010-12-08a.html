<p><a name="st_265"><a name="10120865000230"><a name="101208w0001.htm_spnew36"><a name="10120865001320"><b>Chris Grayling:</b>
 The Department for Work and Pensions is fully engaged with Government initiatives to promote the use of small and medium sized enterprises (SME) and third sector organisations (TSO) and increase the level of business they get from Government. This business can be either direct, by winning departmental contracts, or indirect working as partners with or sub-contractors to the Department's prime contractors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="101208w0001.htm_para25"><a name="10120865000231">The Department is achieving the new Government commitment that 25% of contracts will be let to SMEs and in 2009-10 achieved 29%. The Department is also fully committed to using the new cross-Government pre-qualification questionnaire which is designed to simplify the tendering process for small and medium enterprises and will be launched in December 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="101208w0001.htm_para26"><a name="10120865000232">The Department's plans to encourage and support SMEs and TSOs form part of a wider approach set out in the DWP commercial strategy. This has objectives to make it easier for suppliers to compete for contracts and encourage a diverse supply base.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="101208w0001.htm_para27"><a name="10120865000233">SMEs and TSOs are encouraged to contract with the Department, either as first tier suppliers, where capable, or as sub-contractors for more complex contracts. Part of the approach is to use the DWP supplier charter, signed by the department's top suppliers, which refers to extending its principles to SMEs as sub-contractors. Under the charter, larger suppliers are expected to use SMEs and voluntary organisations as sub-contractors, where it is appropriate, and brings definite added value for money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="101208w0001.htm_para28"><a name="10120865000234">A significant proportion of the Department's business with SME and TSOs is in welfare to work provision, where their specialist and local expertise can add great value. In preparing the market for the Work programme the Department has engaged with these organisations to gain their views and encourage them to become involved. It has taken steps to encourage potential prime contractors to come together with a range of partners and sub-contractors, particularly to use SMEs and TSOs where they could add value to bids. The Department will run local events to help prime contractors understand the needs and issues within each locality so they can put together appropriate supply chains for that area. The assessment of Work programme bidders will include a requirement to name all of their key sub-contractors and partners in their tenders and provide a letter of intent from each, this will allow assessment of SME and TSO involvement and the nature of their arrangements with the prime contractor. The department will expect its prime providers to gain accreditation of the Merlin Standard, to ensure provider supply chains are effective, high performing and that smaller organisations are treated appropriately and fairly. The Department recently won the Compact award for National Partnership Working, for development of the Merlin Standard, which demonstrates its commitment to stewardship of the welfare to work market, and equally the involvement and health of TSOs in prime provider led supply chains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="101208w0001.htm_para29"><a name="10120865000235">Each year the Department measures the number of SMEs and TSOs it has business with and the value of this business. In 2009-10 the Department had business with 5,039 SMEs, spending a total of £509 million with them, an increase of 18% over 2008-09. In 2009-10 the Department had business with 1,421 TSOs, spending a total of £305 million with them, an increase of 15% over 2008-09. Currently, some 30% of welfare to work provider sub-contracts are with voluntary sector  <br>

 Course and non-migratory trout fisheries are protected under various legislative measures. Under the Environment Act 1995, the Environment Agency (EA) has a statutory duty to "maintain, improve and develop fisheries for salmon, trout, eels, lampreys, smelt and freshwater fish". In addition there are UK obligations under the European habitats directive that covers several freshwater species and habitats. Continued and effective management of fisheries is essential to defining and achieving "good ecological status" as required in the water framework directive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"><a name="101208w0001.htm_para60"><a name="10120865000444">In general the status of non-migratory freshwater fish stocks is encouraging. Coarse fish numbers are increasing and are a big improvement on two decades ago, when many rivers were heavily polluted, with fish communities restricted in distribution and numbers. Many non-migratory trout are caught in put-and-take fisheries on still waters, and improvements to these depend largely upon local stocking policies. Wild non-migratory brown trout are the same species as migratory brown trout and the juveniles cannot be distinguished, and so it is not possible to assess their status independently.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>
2. It is known that in some police force areas, information on remand decisions is not always readily available to those coding court proceedings returns. In certain cases, the return may be mistakenly coded as if no remand had taken place. For magistrates court proceedings, the number of remands and more importantly, the number which are in custody, are believed to be under-recorded in total. As the breakdown of remands into bail and custody cases for a number of forces is not accurate for a number of forces, estimates have to be made to provide national figures.<br>
3. Some percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding.<br>

Such placements are arranged by a youth offending team worker and social worker, and put before a placement panel.

 Grey fleet travel refers to mileage in employee-owned vehicles. The Department for International Development (DFID) reimburses employees for private mileage undertaken in the direct implementation of their role at either the standard mileage rate, or the cost of public transport if public transport is less. In order to claim reimbursement at either rate, the employee must have a full comprehensive insurance policy permitting the use of their motor vehicle in connection with DFID business.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary routinely discusses a range of policing matters with the commissioner of the Metropolitan police. However, police tactics, including the use of horses and containment, are operational matters for the police. The Home Secretary has not made an assessment of video recordings of police tactics used on 24 November. The Home Secretary has not requested specific information related to the use of containment or police horses but has been provided with an overview of the police operation. The police have to maintain a difficult balance between supporting rights to peaceful protest and ensuring local communities are properly protected, and the Home Secretary has written to the commissioner conveying her support for the police operation on 24 November.</p>

 The legal framework for policing demonstrations is set out in the Public Order Act 1986 which gives the police powers to place conditions on demonstrations to prevent serious public disorder, serious disruption to the life of the community and serious damage to property.

<i> [holding answer 2 December 2010]:</i> The spending review settlement for the UK Border Agency will mean that it needs to reduce staff numbers by about 5,200 by the end of the spending review period. This will reduce the work force to around 18,000 by 2015. It is not possible to say what the likely effects of the reductions in staff number in Liverpool are at this stage. The UK Border Agency is still working through detailed planning but will let staff and the public know as soon as the plans are clear.

 The Government believe that it is in the interest of banks to serve the needs of businesses, to treat customers fairly and support access to finance. Decisions about the terms and conditions of individual loans are a matter for banks to make on a commercial basis and it would be inappropriate for Government to intervene in these decisions.</p>

The BBA Taskforce committed to improving customer relationships through a new Lending Code, ensuring better access to finance and promoting better understanding amongst their customers. In order to ensure better access to finance, the BBA Taskforce also committed to establish and invest in a new £1.5 billion Business Growth Fund, which will provide capital to growing businesses.</p>

<i> [holding answer 30 November 2010]:</i> The Department has no plans to commission an assessment of the risks from asbestos in schools. The Government Scientific Advisory Committee Working Group on Action to Control Chemicals (WATCH), which considers all aspects of risk from toxic chemicals including asbestos, is currently examining the risks of lung cancer and mesothelioma from low level exposure to asbestos fibres. Their findings will be made known to the recently formed Asbestos in Schools Steering Group chaired by the Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_551"><a name="101208w0004.htm_para21"><a name="10120883001540">On the numbers of maintained schools containing Asbestos Containing Materials (ACMs), I refer you to the answer given to me on the 4 June 2009, <i> Official Report</i>, column 657W, by the former Minister of State for Schools. This stated that:</p>
<a name="101208w0004.htm_brev3"><a name="10120883001603"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Our best estimate in September 2008 was that around 70% of school buildings contain some ACMs."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_552"><a name="101208w0004.htm_para22"><a name="10120883001541">These schools are likely to contain a range of ACMs, e.g. moulded or preformed asbestos in the lagging used as thermal insulation on pipes and boilers; asbestos insulating board used for fire protection, thermal insulation, partitioning and ducts; and asbestos-containing floor tiles and textured coatings. The responsibility to assess the condition of ACMs falls to the duty holder under the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_553"><a name="101208w0004.htm_para23"><a name="10120883001542">Under the Control of Asbestos Regulations, statutory duties are placed on those who are responsible for repair and maintenance of non-domestic premises. In a maintained school, the duty holder is normally the maintaining local authority-where there is delegated funding this duty is often shared with the head teacher. For academies, voluntary aided and foundation schools, the duty holder is the school's governing body. For independent schools, it is the proprietor, governors or trustees. The Department is working with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and asbestos training providers to produce training for head teachers to make sure they are fully aware of their roles and responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_554"><a name="101208w0004.htm_para24"><a name="10120883001543">A recent questionnaire survey and follow-up work of HSE shows that the majority of local authorities were managing asbestos in their schools. Formal enforcement action in the form of 18 improvement notices and one prohibition notice was taken against 10 local authorities requiring improvements to their asbestos management arrangements. The reports of this work and the letter to local authorities reminding them of their responsibilities under the Control of Asbestos Regulations can be found at:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_555"><a name="101208w0004.htm_para25"><a name="10120883001544">It is for the duty holder to assess, with expert advice, the action which needs to be taken when buildings are refurbished, depending on the location of the asbestos  <br>

materials in relation to the location, nature and extent of the works to be carried out. Removal, encapsulation, repair or management in situ may all be appropriate actions. Responsibility for prioritisation of specific projects rests with individual schools and local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_556"><a name="101208w0004.htm_para26"><a name="10120883001545">Asbestos does not pose a serious risk if it is in good condition and managed in accordance with the Control of Asbestos Regulations. HSE does not recommend the routine removal of asbestos. Its advice remains that, providing that ACMs are maintained in good condition, they can be left in situ and managed until a building reaches the end of its life, at which time ACMs can be removed without risks to building users who would otherwise be exposed to fibres arising from significant disturbance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_558"><a name="101208w0004.htm_para28"><a name="10120883001549">The regulations which set the standards do not specify that schools must provide meat options or vegetarian options. Schools should make every effort to cater for all pupils' needs in order to provide a popular, viable service that is also compliant with the standards. In doing so, many will want to take account of environmental and health considerations.</p>
