In order to achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. In 2002 we launched the first ever comprehensive national physical education, school sport and club links strategy with an investment of &#163;459 million. A school sport partnership involving five School Sport Co-ordinators and 35 Primary Link teachers is based at Wyvern in Woodspring. To achieve our challenging targets for increase participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities.

 The Cuban Government does not acknowledge the existence of political prisoners, nor does it disclose the number of those awaiting trial.

 I welcome the adoption of the EU Council Conclusions on Cuba on 31 January which should help enable us to pursue a critical engagement with the Cuban Government and to have enhanced contacts with the peaceful opposition. We believe this approach is the right way to achieve the EU&#039;s objectives as set out in the Common Position of 1996, including to promote the peaceful transition to a pluralist democracy in Cuba. Normalised contact with the Cuban Government will enable the UK Government to press the Cuban Government on issues of concern&#151;especially human rights, including our call for the release of all political prisoners&#151;and to further UK/Cuba co-operation in areas of mutual interest such as the fight against crime, child protection and in developing sustainable tourism in Cuba.

 Following Cyprus&#039; accession to the EU, as a divided island, the application of the acquis was suspended in the north pending a settlement.

 We fully support the African Union (AU) mission in Darfur. There have been some delays in deployment, but the AU now have more than 1,900 personnel on the ground. We and other donors have worked hard to help the AU overcome the logistical problems that they have faced in Darfur, by providing financial assistance, planning support and equipment. Where troops are equipped and on the ground they are playing a strong role, not only in monitoring, but also in defusing tensions; negotiating release of hostages; and offering protection to aid convoys. We note that the latest report by the UN Secretary General highlights the positive difference the AU are making in Darfur, particularly in facilitating the movement of humanitarian relief, preventing the escalation of violence, defusing tensions and providing security.

Section 36 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 already gives the court discretion to prevent cross-examination by a defendant in person in criminal proceedings, if it appears to the court that the quality of the evidence given by the witness is likely to be diminished by such examination. The wide discretion afforded judges in hearing family proceedings gives them sufficient powers to ensure that victims can be protected from intrusive and unfair questioning by the respondent in family proceedings. They can offer assistance in how questions are framed and evidence is presented. The judge also has an inherent power to refuse to admit evidence at a trial if he considers that it is in the interests of justice to do so.

<p><a name="50221w12.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 No. Given the way the questions in the TB99 questionnaire were framed it is not possible to ascribe the relationship between cause and effect to particular risk factors, nor clearly attribute factors to a risk from cattle or wildlife.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the extent to which the spread of tuberculosis by infected cattle in the re-stocking period immediately after foot and mouth disease was eradicated in the UK during 2001 was influenced by the absence of pre-movement tuberculosis restrictions in cattle herds.  [214704]</p>




<p><a name="50221w12.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 We are aware that cattle to cattle spread of bovine TB has taken place as a result of restocking following foot and mouth disease and Defra is funding research, by Warwick University, that aims to (i) identify and estimate risk factors associated with the introduction of bovine TB in restocked farms and (ii) model transmission dynamics within cattle populations. The modelling work will take account of the exposure of cattle to badgers. The research project is due to end in 2006 and results will be published on the Defra website.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w12.html_para12">
While no specific assessment has been made of the possible impact that pre-movement testing would have had on bovine TB in herds restocked following FMD, Government recognises that pre-movement TB testing is important as a mechanism to help prevent further spread of the disease. Defra&#039;s advice to farmers, published in the booklet &#039;TB in Cattle&#151;Reducing the Risk&#039;, has always been to consider private TB testing and isolation of any animals bought in to a herd. This advisory booklet has been available to farmers, free of charge, since 1999. Officials are currently working with stakeholders to develop detailed proposals to make pre-movement TB testing of cattle from the areas of the country most badly affected by bovine TB compulsory.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the average period of late receipt was for applications refused on the grounds of lateness under the British Cattle Movement Service Cattle Passport Scheme in the last year for which figures are available; and if she will introduce a grace period to take account of delays in the postal service as a cause of lateness.

<p><a name="50221w13.html_spnew0"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 In the year 2004, the average period of late receipt for cattle passport applications was 207 days. This figure is surprisingly high, because of a fairly small number of applications that were received many months or even years late.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w13.html_para0">
It may be more helpful to explain that 50 per cent. of applications that were refused because of late application were received up to seven days late. 8 per cent. were between eight and 14 days late. A further 18 per cent. were up to six months late. 24 per cent. were over six months late, including some that were several years late.
</p>


<p>

The Cattle Identification Regulations 1998 require that passports be refused when applications are received late. A comprehensive review of these regulations will be carried out shortly and possible changes to the procedures concerning late passport applications will be considered. However, it is important to maintain a system that encourages farmers to register cattle births promptly. The full and accurate traceability of cattle is essential for disease control, and for the protection of public and animal health and welfare.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what actions were taken by the UK authorities in regard to the November 2000 foot and mouth disease outbreak in Mpumalanga that were not taken in regard to the September 2000 foot and mouth outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal;  [208825]
</p>

<p>(3) what actions on the part of the UK authorities were <i>(a)</i> required and <i>(b)</i> recommended by the European Union with specific regard to the September 2000 foot and mouth disease outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal; and when these were implemented.  [208827]</p>




<p><a name="50221w15.html_spnew1"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 If there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health, European Community legislation allows us to take appropriate safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of meat from all, or parts, of that country. At the time of the outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal, we did not judge it necessary to take safeguard action since the South African authorities had prohibited the issue of export certificates for fresh meat from the area in which the outbreak had occurred. This meant that exports from South Africa could not take place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w15.html_para0">
On 7&#150;8 November 2000 the European Commission informed the Standing Veterinary Committee (SVC) (now known as the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health) of the outcome of an inspection carried out in South Africa by Commission inspectors, and indicated that safeguard measures may be necessary because of some difficulties the South African authorities were experiencing in dealing with the outbreak. On 25 November the Commission published legislation prohibiting imports into the Community of fresh meat from 16 districts in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The Government was satisfied that the action taken by the Commission and controls in place in South Africa were sufficient to prevent any risk of disease entering the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w15.html_para1">
By 20 December it was clear that the situation in South Africa had deteriorated. The Government reviewed the situation and a decision was taken to take safeguard action. This was delayed due to the Christmas period, and on 5 January the Government issued a Declaration under Regulation 35 of the Products of Animal Origin (Import and Export) Regulations 1996, prohibiting imports into England and Wales of meat from all of South Africa. Similar action was taken in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w15.html_para2">
The outbreak in Mpumalanga was confirmed on 30 November. The Commission took action in February 2001 to extend EU restrictions on imports of meat in respect of Mpumalanga. By that time, the UK had already banned imports of meat from the whole country, so no further action was necessary.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact of the REACH (Chemicals) Directive on UK industry; and if she will make a statement.  [215952]</p>




<p><a name="50221w16.html_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Government have worked with all stakeholders to ensure that the REACH proposal is well focused on achieving maximum practical benefit to human health and the environment with a minimum of direct impact on industrial competitiveness. In particular, our proposal for &#039;one substance, one registration&#039; is intended to lower costs to industry as well as improving the consistency of information available on chemicals across Europe and keeping animal testing to a minimum. We have recently completed a study which indicates that, if &#039;one substance, one registration&#039; were to be adopted, the cost to industry and the authorities of REACH would be decreased by at least &#8364;77 million in comparison to the Commission estimates on the basis of the current proposals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w16.html_para3">
The UK partial regulatory impact assessment is based on the current proposals and primarily reflects the direct costs to industry of REACH which are estimated at &#163;515 million over the 11-year phase in period. This is equivalent to total direct costs across the EU of approximately &#163;2.4 billion. These are in line with European Commission estimates published in October 2003 of a maximum overall cost of the revised proposal (including indirect costs) of &#8364;7.5 billion. We are currently carrying out further impact assessment work to assess the indirect costs passed down the supply chain.

<p><a name="50221w16.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 It is important to draw a distinction between treated and untreated sewerage discharges. Treated effluent discharges from sewage treatment works and some intermittent discharges from overflows during wet weather are measured in cubic metres. Discharges consented by the Environment Agency are made to the Thames by three water companies: Thames Water (inland and estuary); Anglian Water and Southern Water (estuary only).

<p>
<a name="50221w16.html_para6">
Thames Water reports it has discharged an estimated 4,800 million cubic metres of sewage effluent to the Thames in the last five years. Of this, 4,500 million cubic metres receives secondary treatment. Some of this effluent also receives more stringent treatment at Abingdon, Little Marlow and Windsor&#039;s sewage treatment works, which discharge to the freshwater section of the Thames. Approximately, 100 million cubic metres will have been treated storm sewage from treatment works, and the remaining 200 million cubic metres as untreated storm sewage (sewage and rainwater run-off). It is estimated that about 30 per cent. of storm sewage is discharged unmeasured.

The consented daily dry weather effluent flows, which receive secondary treatment prior to discharge, from three sewage works operated by Anglian Water are 95,514 cubic metres. As it is generally accepted that average daily flows are 1.25 times the dry weather flow, it is estimated that 218 million cubic metres of treated effluent has been discharged from these works (Canvey Island, Southend and Tilbury) in the last five years.

Southern Water discharges effluent after it has received secondary treatment from two sites (Gravesend and Northfleet). In the last five years (2000&#150;04) the sewage treatment works at Gravesend has discharged approximately 19 million cubic metres of treated effluent. Since April 2001, when flow monitors were installed at the Northfleet sewage works approximately 12.5 million cubic metres of treated effluent has been discharge to the end of 2004.

 Since the creation of Defra in June 2001 the following figures are available for lost and stolen passes. These passes are programmed electronically and once a loss is reported the pass is cancelled immediately. This greatly reduces the possibility of anyone using it illegally to enter Defra premises. The cost to produce an electronic photographic pass is approximately 10 (staff time and material). The sharp increase in lost passes in the core Department is in part due to the larger numbers of passes issued to contractors&#039; staff refurbishing buildings and losses by those staff.

 Methyl bromide is an ozone depleting substance (ODS) that is now banned in developed countries under the Montreal Protocol and EC Regulation 2037/2000.

Following the ban on production, methyl bromide is only permitted to be produced for agreed critical uses, quarantine and pre-shipment and emergency purposes. The Government&#039;s policy on future use of methyl bromide is that its use should not be phased back in by excessive critical uses.

The Montreal Protocol makes provision for critical use exemptions where there are no technically and economically feasible alternatives to methyl bromide.

<p><a name="50221w18.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Battle: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he expects the Inland Revenue to complete the necessary procedures to allow credit unions to accept child trust fund accounts.  [216097]</p>




<p><a name="50221w18.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 Credit unions have an important part to play in tackling financial exclusion within the communities they serve. The Government is keen to accommodate the special nature of credit unions within the Child Trust Fund where possible. They are already able to make available a CTF stakeholder account to their customers where they have the FSA permissions to do so. However there are a number of issues to be resolved before credit unions can offer cash deposit accounts. Discussions have taken place between credit unions, the Treasury, the FSA and the Inland Revenue and work is being taken forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w18.html_para1">
The Child Trust Fund is intended to encourage parents and children to develop the savings habit. It will ensure that every child born since 1 September, whatever their family background, will have access to a stock of assets from the age of 18, so they can invest in their future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w18.html_para2">
It will also help children and their parents to understand the benefits of savings and investment and how to engage with financial institutions.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) whether existing credit unions will be included for support under the Social Fund loan scheme referred to in the report on Promoting Financial Inclusion;  [215676]
</p>



<p>(2) how the Social Fund loan scheme monies referred to in the report on Promoting Financial Inclusion will be apportioned; and which institutions will qualify for inclusion.  [215677]</p>




<p><a name="50221w18.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 &#039;Promoting financial inclusion&#039; announced a series of measures to increase the availability of affordable credit to those on the lowest incomes. These measures include the next steps in the reform of the Social Fund. The Government will abolish the &#039;double debt&#039; rule for Budgeting Loans eligibility and will lower the highest loan repayment rates. These 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Feb 2005 : Column 67W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
reforms will be implemented in April 2006 and amount to an increase in funding for the Social Fund loans scheme of &#163;210 million over the three years to 2008&#150;09.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w18.html_para3">
&#039;Promoting financial inclusion&#039; also announced that the Government are considering arrangements whereby, in certain circumstances, private and third sector lenders&#151;including existing credit unions&#151;could apply for repayment to be made by deduction from benefit where normal repayment arrangements have broken down. The aim of this scheme would be to reduce some of the increased costs and risks of lending to vulnerable groups. The Government have been seeking responses from private and third sector lenders, on this scheme. However no final decisions have been made as to whether and how the scheme will operate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w18.html_para4">
Subject to any necessary state aids clearance from the European Commission, the Government will also set up a growth fund for third sector lenders from within the Financial Inclusion Fund. This growth fund will be available to credit unions and community development finance institutions to boost the coverage, capacity and sustainability of the sector in providing a source of affordable credit for the financially excluded.

<p><a name="50221w22.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The Home Office is satisfied that there is already sufficient independence in the immigration statistics, for which it is responsible. Immigration control and asylum statistics are part of National Statistics. They are produced by statisticians, whose independence is established under the National Statistics Code of Practice, and the statistics themselves are acknowledged as reliable. The National Audit Office&#039;s review in May last year found that &quot;the asylum data and statistics are in most respects reliable&quot;.

The Government&#039;s White Paper, &#039;Building trust in statistics&#039;, sets out the framework for assuring the quality of National Statistics.

The National Statistics Quality Review of the International Migration was published on 2 September 2003 and covered all forms of migration between the UK and the rest of the world, including statistics relating to all migrants and statistics relating to migrants subject to UK immigration control. The Home Office is about to embark on a National Statistics review of its publications relating to the control of immigration statistics, including the presentation of asylum statistics within these.

International students bring significant economic and social benefits to the UK. In recognition of this, students seeking to vary or extend their conditions of stay in the UK will be charged a reduced fee for postal applications. Our analysis, which is set out in the published Regulatory Impact Assessment, indicates that at the level proposed, the postal charges were unlikely to have a significant impact on the UK&#039;s ability to attract and retain international students. However, in order to ensure that remaining to study in the UK remains a competitive option, we have decided that charges should be at a lower rate of &#163;250 for the standard postal service. The higher, premium fee is an optional service which students can take advantage of if they so choose.

 Our first step towards eradicating child poverty as set out in our current Public Service Agreement target is to reduce the number of children in low-income households by a quarter by 2004&#150;05. This is measured using the proportion of children in relative low income households. Specific information regarding low income for the United Kingdom is available in &#039;Households Below Average Income 1994&#150;95 to 2002&#150;03&#039;.

&#039;Measuring child poverty&#039;, published in December 2003, outlines the Government&#039;s measure of UK child poverty for the long-term. The measure will consist of three tiers; absolute low income, relative low income and material deprivation and low income combined. The Government will set a target as part of the 2006 SR06 Spending Review to halve by 2010&#150;11 the numbers of children suffering a combination of material deprivation and relative low income. This new measure will commence with estimates taken from the 2004&#150;05 Family Resources Survey. Data will not be available below the regional level.

<p><a name="50221w27.html_wqn5"><b> Paul Holmes: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment his Department has made 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Feb 2005 : Column 104W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
of the effectiveness of the 52 week linking rule; and what qualitative research his Department has commissioned to evaluate it.  [214628]</p>




<p><a name="50221w27.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 The 52 week linking rule was introduced in 1998 to allow people moving off an incapacity benefit into work to re-access any higher rates of benefit that had been in payment if their job did not work out and they needed to re-claim. It was introduced as a result of research evidence which found that people feared moving off benefit in case their job did not last, leading to difficulties in requalifying for their old benefit. The importance of linking rules was confirmed in subsequent research. For example, an evaluation in 2003 of clients eligible for the new deal for disabled people identified the most important &#039;bridge to work&#039; was the knowledge that they could return to their original benefit if needed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w27.html_para2">
The Department of Social Security Research Report 141 incapacity benefits and work incentives included qualitative research into the operation of the 52 week linking rule. The conclusions of the researchers were that knowing about the linking rule could influence decisions to move into work; that it reduced some of the risks and anxieties about loss of income and security attached to moving into work and that it was generally appreciated by clients. There were also indications that lack of awareness of the rule reduced its incentive effect as did anxiety that the rule would be hard to access and there was evidence that this was the case. This has been borne out by recent research. The Department for Work and Pensions Research Report &quot;A Stepping Stone to Employment&quot; published last December noted the very low levels of awareness of the linking rules amongst clients on permitted work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w27.html_para3">
The Department&#039;s five year strategy published earlier this month includes our commitment to review the operation of the linking rules to ensure that existing claimants&#039; position is protected if they take a job and they then need to return to incapacity benefits.

<p class="tabletext">In answer to your specific question, the Secretary of State assesses the accuracy of benefits provision through the Jobcentre Plus target regime. Each year, annual targets are set for Jobcentre Plus and currently include the measures of Monetary Value of Fraud and Error, and Business Delivery. The latter includes elements on the accuracy of Income Support, Incapacity Benefit, and Jobseeker&#039;s Allowance. The targets are published in the Jobcentre Plus Business Plan each year, which is placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Turning to the subject of efficiency, Jobcentre Plus, within its unit cost target, has one element based on the total costs incurred for benefit processing divided by the number of claims actually processed. This measure forms a key part of the Jobcentre Plus aim to improve efficiency and is continually monitored by HM Treasury.</p>
</ul>
<p>

The figures are from the Financial Services Authority (FSA), and its predecessor the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), who collected information on pension charges and reported this using the Reduction in Yield (RIY) measurement. This is defined as the percentage point reduction in the gross return on a pension fund as a result of explicit charges and fees. Dealing costs and other implicit charges are not included.Until 2002, the figures were collected as part of the FSA and PIA annual disclosure surveys. However, they have been replaced by online comparative tables, which give present not historical data and so some figures are unavailable.

The RIY on personal pensions has fallen significantly since the mid 1990&#039;s, from around 1.9 per cent. in 1995 to around 1.1 per cent. in 2002, where it has remained.

This fall in charges has ensured more of peoples savings go towards their retirement, and less is consumed by charges.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w28.html_para8">
However the Government recognises that it has been difficult to ensure that the pensions industry can effectively market Stakeholder Pensions within the constraints of a 1 per cent. charge cap, and to increase the proportion of under-savers actively targeted by providers the Government have, after commissioning an independent review by Deloitte, announced a revised charge cap of 1.5 per cent. for new members joining on or after 6 April 2005 for the first 10 years of membership, reverting to 1 per cent. thereafter. These changes will increase the number of under-savers the pensions industry can cost effectively target, while still ensuring good value for the consumer.

 The Services, as part of their system of support to bereaved relatives, seek to provide full information on the progress of inquiries. However, a Board of Inquiry is an internal inquiry held to investigate the facts of an incident in order to prevent recurrence. It is not a court of law and it does not fulfil the same function as a Coroner&#039;s inquest (or a Procurator Fiscal&#039;s inquiry in Scotland), which is to establish the cause of death. Boards of Inquiry do not sit in public; and members of the public, bereaved relatives and the press have no right to be present. It has been the policy of the MOD since December 1992 to make available to the next of kin, at no cost, copies of completed Board of Inquiry reports, subject only to the redaction of security sensitive information and third party data, and the avoidance of prejudice to any other investigation.

<p><a name="50221w31.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 As has been made clear in previous responses, the process of restructuring the infantry has been worked through by the Army in consultation with the divisions and regiments concerned. As part of this process, infantry divisions were asked to suggest options for new regimental titles. &#039;The Royal Lancashire Regiment&#039; was put forward by the King&#039;s Division as an option for the new regimental title. However, of the options put forward by the Division, the proposed title of the &#039;King&#039;s, Lancashire and Border Regiment&#039; was judged by the Army Board to best reflect all the antecedent regiments from which it will be drawn. This was felt to be particularly important because of the fact that this reorganisation involved the merging of three previously distinct regiments, into a two-battalion regiment. That the word &#039;Royal&#039; is not included in the new title should not be taken as an omission. Rather it simply reflects the fact that, of the options put forward by the Division, the one settled upon by the Army Board happened not to contain the word &#039;Royal&#039;.

 Improving interoperability between networks is a key theme of Network Enabled Capability, and there are a number of initiatives to this end.

The Multiple Tactical Datalink Management System (MTDMS) forms part of a programme funded from the Equipment Plan to provide a deployable tactical datalink management capability for out of area operations. Neither programme has yet received final approval to proceed but our current planning assumption is that they will be introduced in 2006. The two systems address different requirements but they are required to be interoperable as there are circumstances when the MTDMS could be used in the UK. The MTDMS is intended to be usable in operations with US forces and we are therefore monitoring closely the development of the US Joint Interface Control Officers Support System.

 The &#039;Future Capabilities&#039; White Paper published in July 2003 explains how we plan to make the armed forces more flexible and deployable. At sea, deployability has already been improved through six new Roll-On-Roll-Off ships. A robust and modern amphibious capability, based around two new ships, HMS Alibon and Bulwark, supported by the Bay Class landing ships, will provide a step change in our ability to launch and support forces ashore. For the Army, there will be a shift in emphasis towards light and medium weight forces. These will be supported by a number of new equipment programmes, including the Future Rapid Effects System family of vehicles and the Light Mobile Artillery Weapon System. In the air, as well as introducing 25 A400M aircraft from 2011, we now intend to buy our current fleet of four leased C-17 aircraft together with one additional aircraft, significantly increasing our strategic lift capability.

 The Ministry of Defence&#039;s research budget is focussed on examining technical possibilities in a variety of technology areas. These can be exploited through many different routes to new techniques, concepts and equipment. It is not possible to definitively split weaponry research out of that on materials, electronics, system integration, engines, communications and others. The development of technology into equipment is handled by the Defence Procurement Agency and it has a development budget that is spent on specific items such as satellites, communications equipment, vehicles, and weaponry, such as small arms, missiles, artillery. As we do not collate information on research activity in the way requested, it would be disproportionately expensive to provide a more detailed breakdown.

Notes:<br>

1. Finished in-year admissions&#151;A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)&#151;The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

3. Cause code&#151;The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects.<br>

4. Ungrossed data&#151;Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

We are undertaking the most far-reaching reforms of national health service dentistry since 1948, supported by the biggest investment programme in the history of NHS dentistry. We are providing NHS dentistry with extra funding of over &#163;250 million a year from 2005&#150;06, an increase of nearly 20 per cent. over 2003&#150;04 levels. We are also funding an extra 170 dental training places from this October (a 25 per cent. increase) supported by &#163;80 million capital investment. We are recruiting the equivalent of 1,000 extra dentists this year and we have allocated &#163;59 million to improve access to NHS dentistry.

The great majority of dental practices treat both private and national health service patients. The Office of Fair Trading Report, &quot;The private dentistry market in the UK&quot;, published in March 2003, estimated that, out of 11,000 dental practices, about 210 are totally private. We are not aware of any dentists with personal dental service contracts who have sought to reduce the value of their contractual commitment to the NHS.

Finished in-year admissions<br>

A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

Finished consultant episode (FCE)<br>

An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

Ungrossed data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

Time waited<br>

Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Eligibility for NHS sight tests was extended to patients aged 60 and over from 1 April 1999. PCTs took over responsibilities from HAs in October 2002.<br>

2. Sight tests can not be equated to the numbers of patients. Although most people do not come back for a sight test within the year, some patients suffering from medical conditions are advised to have re-examinations sooner.<br>

3. Patients aged 60 and over are not eligible for free NHS optical vouchers for help towards glasses or contact lenses on age grounds. However, some patients will be eligible under other category such as adult income support, Pension Credits guarantee credit or holders of HC2/HC3 certificates. It is not possible to break down voucher numbers by age for these categories.<br>

Notes:<br>

Three-month vacancy:<br>

1. Three month vacancy information is as at 31 March 2004<br>

2. Three month vacancies are vacancies which Trusts are actively trying to fill, which had lasted for three months or more (whole time equivalents)<br>

3. Three month vacancy rates are three month vacancies expressed as a percentage of three month vacancies plus staff in post<br>

4. Three month vacancy rates are calculated using staff in post from the Vacancy Survey, March 2004<br>

5. Percentages are rounded to one decimal place<br>

6. Figures where sum of staff in post (as at 31 March 2004) and vacancies is less than 10<br>

7. Figures where sum of staff in post (as at 31 March 2004) and vacancies is zero<br>

Staff in post:<br>

1. Staff in post data is from the Non-Medical Workforce Census, September 2003<br>

General:<br>

1. Vacancy and staff in post numbers are rounded to the nearest whole number<br>

2. Calculating the vacancy rates using the above data may not equal the actual vacancy rates<br>

3. Due to rounding, totals may not equal the sum of component parts<br>

4. Strategic HA figures are based on trusts, and do not necessarily reflect the geographical provision of health care<br>

5. London Ambulance Service NHS Trust cannot be assigned to a particular Strategic Health Authority<br>

These figures do not include dentists who moved to other areas and continued to work in the general or personal dental services. The dentists could have ceased doing national health service work for a number of different reasons, for example retirement or to take a short-term absence, as well as because the dentists only wished to treat private patients.

<sup>(57)</sup> Total number of people who have used the NHS stop smoking services is not collected centrally, however information is collected on the number of people setting a &#039;quit date&#039;; some people may use the service but not go onto set a quit date.<br>

<sup>(58)</sup> In 1999&#150;2000, NHS smoking cessation services were set up in the 26 health action zones (HAZ) in England and services were rolled out across the NHS to the rest of England in 2000&#150;01.<br>





<sup>(59)</sup> The cost of the NHS stop smoking services and the cost per successful quitter in 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 included the cost of giving clients &#039;free&#039; NRT/NRT (or vouchers); from 2001&#150;02 onwards the cost of the service and the cost per quitter excluded the cost of NRT or Zyban on prescription. Only a few nicotine replacement therapy products were available on prescription until 17 April 2001, when all NRT products became available on NHS prescription. Bupropion (Zyban) became available on NHS prescription from June 2000. Therefore, the costs from 2001&#150;02 onwards are not directly comparable with the costs in previous years.<br>

<sup>(60)</sup> Net ingredient cost is the basic cost of a drug and does not take account of discounts, dispensing fees or prescription charge income. Note that some prescriptions for NRT/Bupropion are dispensed to people not using the NHS stop smoking services.<br>

<sup>(61)</sup> This figure only includes the costs of NRT, as bupropion (Zyban) was not available until June 2000.<br>

<p><a name="50221w46.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Health Service Guidance (95) 18, published in 1995, provides advice and guidance to NHS organisations on the use of laundry practices. This includes hospital bed linen and curtains around beds. The guidance covers the issue of temperature and disinfection. With regard to nurses&#039; uniforms, dilution in domestic washing machines will effectively disinfect them. Single use aprons and other equipment should be used if contamination is likely and if a uniform is visibly soiled then it should be put through a healthcare laundry intended for such items.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w46.html_para2">
It is for individual national health service trusts to determine their own policy on the laundering of nurses&#039; uniforms and the wearing of those uniforms outdoors. The prevention and control of infection is part of the overall risk management within the healthcare environment and NHS trusts are required to have risk management protocols in place with regard to effective laundry practices. The monitoring of the cleanliness of nurses&#039; uniforms should be part of these protocols.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the optimum number of patients in a primary care trust.  [215509]</p>




<p><a name="50221w46.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The new NHS White Paper of 1997 suggested that primary care groups (PCGs), the forerunners of primary care trusts (PCTs),

<p class="tabletext">&quot;may typically serve about 100,000 patients.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w46.html_para4">
However, this was qualified by the acknowledgement that there must be flexibility to reflect local circumstances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w46.html_para5">
These local circumstances include the advantages that coterminosity between PCTs and local authorities brings, as this facilitates joint-working by the national health service and social services. Geography is also important, as rural PCTs would need to cover a much larger geographical area to serve the same population as urban PCTs. Finally the configuration of hospitals and other health providers results in natural health communities which are not of equal size across the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w46.html_para6">
The impact of these local circumstances on size is such that the Department has never given a figure for the optimum number of patients in a PCT. However, PCTs have tended to be larger than PCGs, as a result of their greater functions and the desire to achieve economies of scale.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Feb 2005 : Column 180W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
is a correlation between the number of prescriptions for Roaccutane and recorded suicides in the last 10 years.  [209345]</p>




<p><a name="50221w47.html_spnew6"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Isotretinoin (Roaccutane) is a prescription only medicine indicated for the treatment of severe acne (such as nodular or conglobate acne or acne at risk of permanent scarring). Its use is limited to specialists in dermatology (with expertise in the use of systematic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w47.html_para6">
The safety of isotretinoin has been closely monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, with expert advice from the committee on safety of medicines (CSM), since it was approved in 1983.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w47.html_para7">
The yellow card scheme receives reports of suspected adverse drug reactions suspected to be associated with medicines. To date 22 cases of suicide that have been reported in association with isotretinoin. The first report was received in 1993. There does not appear to be any correlation between the frequency of these cases and isotretinoin usage data, which is estimated to be 30,000 treatment courses per year for the last ten years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w47.html_para8">
Warnings about the risk of depression and suicidal behaviour were added to the product information for prescribers and patients in 1998. Following a review of the isotretinoin product information by an expert working group of the CSM and within Europe these warnings have recently been strengthened, to include more explicit descriptions of the symptoms and behaviours associated with psychiatric disorders. The latest evidence of psychiatric disorders suspected to be associated with isotretinoin will be further reviewed as a commitment of the recent European review, with the United Kingdom taking the leading role.

It is important to note that doctors are asked to report suspected adverse reactions regardless of any doubts about a causal association. Therefore, a report of a particular adverse reaction on the database does not necessarily mean that the drug caused it, and other factors such as the patient&#039;s underlying condition may have played a part. As with all spontaneous reporting schemes, under-reporting is an inherent feature and reporting may be stimulated by publicity. 12 of these reports were received following the withdrawal of rofecoxib on 30 September 2004.

<p><a name="50221w49.html_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Trees provide benefits to urban air pollution, but can also have adverse effects on air quality.

<a name="50221w49.html_para3">
<i>Adverse effects of trees on air quality</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w49.html_para4">
Trees can have adverse effects on air quality. They can release biogenic emissions known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which in combination with oxides of nitrogen (NOx), can contribute to the formation of other pollutants, especially ozone and particles. Ozone and particles are known to damage human health when in the lower atmosphere. In addition, trees release pollen, which can cause allergic reactions in sensitive people, and can be associated with hay fever and asthma.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w49.html_para5">
<i>Beneficial effects of trees on air quality</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w49.html_para6">
Trees deliver air quality benefits in two ways. Firstly, the cooling effect of their shade can directly reduce evaporative emissions from vehicles and other fuel storage, and by cooling homes and offices, power generation emissions are also lessened. Cooling also reduces the speed at which atmospheric chemical reactions occur.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w49.html_para7">
Secondly, trees can remove various pollutants from the atmosphere via deposition to their leaves and needles. Trees can remove pollutants typically associated with urban air pollution such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and ammonia reducing atmospheric concentrations and improving air quality. The pollutants generally collect in the leaves or bark which are then shed as part of the tree&#039;s life cycle. Trees also reduce concentrations of harmful particulate matter when leaf surfaces collect airborne particles, that are subsequently washed to the ground when it rains. The trees most suited to removal of particles are those with large leaf areas, or sticky or hairy leaves. Studies indicate that the hairy leaves of lime trees can collect four times as many PM10 particles than plane trees.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w49.html_para8">
In addition, trees can have a positive benefit in terms of global warming by acting as a sink for carbon dioxide, which is the most common greenhouse gas. Trees remove carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen during photosynthesis. The carbon is stored in the tree and the oxygen is released back into the atmosphere.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w49.html_para9">
A recent report entitled &quot;Trees and Sustainable Urban Air Quality&quot;, produced under the Natural Environment Research Council&#039;s Urban Regeneration and the Environment (URGENT) programme by the University of Lancaster and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology Edinburgh, investigated the role of trees in reducing urban air pollution. The report concluded that trees that emit the least reactive VOCs and have large leaf surface areas have the best effect on air quality.

In general, the report concludes that the effects on air quality of large scale planting of most tree species in cities would be positive and for example, by doubling the number of trees in the West Midlands, the concentration of small particles could be reduced by 25 per cent., avoiding 140 deaths that are currently caused by airborne particles each year in the West Midlands.

 The Department has put in place a considerable programme of improvements across a wide range of transport policy areas since 1997. I am confident that the Blackpool, South constituency will have benefited from these. For example, the injury totals for all road causalities in Great Britain fell from 327,803 in 1997 to 290,607 in 2003, and the numbers of children aged under 16 years killed or seriously injured on our roads fell from 6,452 in 1997 to 4,100 in 2003. On our railways, passenger kilometres have increased from 32.1 billion in 1996&#150;97 to 40.9 billion in 2003&#150;04, a rise of 27 per cent. In terms of improvements to air quality, emissions of the UK&#039;s two main pollutants&#151;nitrous oxides and particles&#151;fell by 31 per cent. and 27 per cent. respectively between 1997 and 2002.

 Local authorities in England currently spend around &#163;500 million per year on concessionary fares schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w55.html_para0">
It is estimated that an extension of current concessionary fares schemes to provide free local public transport for people over 60 and disabled people within their local authority area would cost an additional &#163;200 million per year (approximately &#163;18 million for disabled people and &#163;182 million for the over 60s). This includes local bus journeys and, where the local authority chooses to fund wider concessions, journeys on trains, underground, light rail and ferries within the local areas. The additional cost would rise to around &#163;250 million per year (&#163;25 million for disabled people and &#163;225 million for the over 60s) if all local journeys on the national rail system were included.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w55.html_para1">
An England-wide scheme allowing free travel for all older and disabled people on all bus journeys would cost around &#163;260 million per year more than the current system (approximately &#163;24 million for disabled people and &#163;236 million for the over 60s). The additional cost would rise to &#163;500 million per year if all national rail journeys were included (&#163;50 million for disabled people and &#163;450 million for the over 60s).

To provide free local bus travel for all under 19-year-olds would require additional funding of &#163;520 million per year.

Costs have not been estimated for free travel restricted to those in full-time education; however it is estimated that a free travel scheme applying to educational trips only would cost an additional &#163;290 million per year.

 There is much effective practice in preventing and addressing bullying in many LEAs around the country and the &#039;Make The Difference&#039; conference programme has allowed this work to be shared and celebrated. The conferences offered LEAs as well as schools an opportunity to learn at first hand from the very successful. Many LEAs were represented at the nine regional conferences, either as speakers, workshop leaders or delegates and evaluations tell us that attendees left feeling inspired and motivated.
</p>


<p>

The Anti Bullying Alliance (ABA) has been funded to sustain the momentum created by those conferences and each of their regional leads is working with the LEAs in their region to promote best practice and develop innovative and practical approaches to tackle bullying at strategic level. Anti bullying work has a high profile within the Key Stage 3 behaviour and attendance (B and A) strand and within the primary behaviour and attendance pilot, and there are KS3 Behaviour and Attendance Consultants in every LEA working directly with schools to tackle a range of behaviour issues including bullying.
</p>


<p>

Many LEAs provide guidance on anti bullying to their schools to supplement and localise the guidance issued by the DfES nationally, and advice to parents on what to do if they are worried their child is being bullied.

We know that LEAs around the country are at various stages of addressing this agenda. A number are well advanced and have been successfully working in this area for a number of years and other LEAs have recently appointed dedicated anti bullying officers or are considering doing so, but some have yet to tackle the problem in a structured and systematic way. We will continue to work through the national strategies and the ABA to encourage these LEAs to move forward on this agenda.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the funding gap is between school sixth forms and further education colleges in the London North Learning and Skills Council area; and if she will make a statement.  [216679]</p>




<p><a name="50221w73.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The Department does not have information on what the funding gap is between school sixth forms and further education colleges in the London North Learning and Skills Council area specifically.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w73.html_para0">
However, the main measure the Department has used to identify the funding gap is the difference in Learning and Skills Council (LSC) national funding rates for an AS/A2 qualification.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w73.html_para1">
In 2002/03 the difference between the AS/A2 base rates was 10.5 per cent. Increased funding to support our Success for All strategy enabled the LSC to deliver a 4.5 per cent. increase in funding rates in 2003/04 for all colleges that agreed development plans. In the same year school sixth form funding rates increased by 3 per cent.&#151;resulting in a narrowing of the funding gap to 9 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w73.html_para2">
FE colleges that delivered against their plans receive a further 5 per cent. increase in funding rates for 2004/05 compared with a 4 per cent. increase for schools&#151;a further narrowing of the gap to 8 per cent. We expect a similar step in funding rates in 2005/06 reducing the gap to 7 per cent.

 Government recognise that there are differences in the funding allocated to further education colleges and school sixth forms nationally and has taken action to address this.

<sup>(150)</sup> The combined LEA and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LEA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LEA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LEA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA).<br>

2 Upto and including 1998&#150;99 financial data are taken from Revenue Outturn spending returns submitted to the ODPM. From 1999&#150;00 onwards financial data are taken from Section 52 Outturn Statements submitted to the Department for Education and Skills. 2003&#150;04 data remains provisional and is subject to change by the LEA.<br>

<sup>(151)</sup> Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of moneys from local government to central government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99.<br>

<sup>(152)</sup> Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place on the 1 April 1998 where pre-LGR Lancashire LEA was split into Lancashire LEA, Blackburn with Darwin LEA and Blackpool LEA. As a result, upto 1997&#150;98 data is for pre-LGR Lancashire LEA and from 1998&#150;99 data is for post-LGR Lancashire LEA. This break in consistency is shown by the dotted line.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Financial data is collected at local authority level and not constituency level and as such the figures provided are for Lancashire LEA.<br>

2. Figures are rounded to the nearest 1,000 as reported by Lancashire LEA at 14 February 2005.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the average cost of providing a pupil with education in a referral unit was in Lancashire in each year since 2000.  [216309]</p>

 We do not hold the information requested, although we do hold planned net expenditure on Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) places in Lancashire.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w75.html_para1">
The number of pupils shown in the following table is for pupils attending PRUs who are not registered at a maintained mainstream or special school. This underestimates PRU activity, and therefore over estimates the unit cost, as it does not include the number of pupils attending a PRU, but registered in another school. The figures do not include cross-border pupils who live in Lancashire but attend a PRU in a bordering authority, for which Lancashire LEA pays. This payments included in the planned expenditure, but the number of pupils involved is not known.

The average cost of a pupil attending a PRU in England is &#163;10,000.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what training is required for a teacher to teach in a pupil referral unit; what the cost of the training is; and if she will make a statement. [216862]</p>




<p><a name="50221w75.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 Teachers in pupil referral units are the same as any other teachers and therefore receive the same initial teacher training as teachers in other schools.

<p>
<a name="50221w75.html_para3">
There are a number of different routes into teaching. According to research, undertaken by JM Consulting Ltd. for my Department, the average annual cost of initial teacher training per full time equivalent student was &#163;5,973 in 2002/03. The research was based on a review of the costs of initial teacher training at 15 higher education institutions chosen to represent a broad range of types of institution and types of provision (primary, secondary, undergraduate and postgraduate).

 My right hon.

The guidance suggests that any member with such an interest should withdraw from the discussion and take no part in the decision. Alternatively, where it is known in advance that a conflict of interest will arise, a member may invite an alternate, who has no interest to declare, to attend the meeting in his place.

 The Judicial Studies Board (JSB) has developed a training package to support the implementation of the Criminal Justice Reforms, which include the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the Courts Act 2003 and the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The core of the programme is a series of two-day residential seminars held during the period January to March 2005 to which all judges exercising the criminal jurisdiction have been invited. The training package also includes seminar and distance learning materials in hard copy and electronic format. Section 101 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 forms a significant element of the seminars and training materials. All criminal judges were issued with written materials on the provisions of Section 101 before their implementation in December 2004, which are available on the JSB&#039;s website at www.jsboard.co.uk. Numbers of judges trained in the CJR programme are: <i>(a)</i> 268; <i>(b)</i> 1,146. It is anticipated that 2,212 judges will have been trained by the completion of the seminars on 23 March 2005.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

2. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

3. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

4. Length of stay&#151;duration of spell (LOS)&#151;is calculated as the difference in days between the admission date and the discharge date, where both are given. LOS is based on hospital spells and only applies to ordinary admissions, i.e. day cases are excluded (unless otherwise stated). Information relating to LOS figures, including discharge method/destination, diagnoses and any operative procedures, is based only on the final episode of the spell.<br>

5. Time waited statistics from hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited 



as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what guidance his Department provides to primary care trusts on commissioning primary care services for people with serious eating disorders.  [215959]</p>




<p><a name="50221w81.html_spnew7"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Tertiary eating disorder services are part of the national specialised services definition set (NSSDS), which provides guidance to commissioners on securing effective collective planning arrangements that take into account the needs of a planning population considerably larger than that of a single primary care trust. A group led by the national director for mental health is currently reviewing the NSSDS, with a view to publishing updated guidance later this year.

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority summarisation forms and primary care trust summarisation schedules, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure by the relevant HAs, and the commissioner costs of the primary care trusts (PCTs). Figures are given in cash terms.<br>





2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of HAs and PCTs.<br>

3. Figures for 1996&#150;97 to 2001&#150;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. This is to ensure consistency between years. Figures based on strategic health authority (SHA) areas have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure, which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.<br>

4. In many HAs, there are factors, which distort the expenditure. These include:<br>

the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and<br>

asset revaluations in national health service trusts being funded through health authorities or primary care trusts.<br>

5. The majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the individual health authority accounts or primary care trust summarisation schedules and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities or primary care trusts. Total expenditure on these items by the Dental Practice Board and the Prescription Pricing Authority cannot be allocated to individual health bodies. For these reasons, expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between health authorities or between different years.<br>

6. Expenditure on general dental services and pharmaceutical services accounted for by the Dental Practice Board and Prescription Pricing Authority, respectively, are excluded. This expenditure cannot be included within the figures for the individual health bodies as they are not included in commissioner accounts.<br>

The Government accepted and commended these recommendations to national health service primary care trusts, strategic health authorities and the Healthcare Commission, apart from one recommendation, the effect of which would have been to immediately close centres providing a high level of service, but which were carrying out less than a minimum of 300 operations per year. There was no evidence within the report to support this measure, nor has there been any since.

The Government agreed with the review&#039;s conclusion that council tax should be retained but reformed. It has appointed Sir Michael Lyons to undertake an independent inquiry that will consider, in the light of the report by Balance of Funding Review, the detailed case for changes to the present system of local government funding and make recommendations on any changes that are necessary and how to implement them. The inquiry will, among other things, conduct thorough analysis of options other than council tax for local authorities to raise supplementary revenue, including LIT, reform of non-domestic rates and other possible local taxes and charges, as well as the possible combination of such options.

In England, around 50 per cent. of housing association tenants qualify for the right to buy or the preserved right to buy. The right to buy is available to pre-1988 secure tenants of non-charitable housing associations. Housing association properties were generally let on secure tenancies until 1988, but all new lettings since then have been on assured tenancies which do not include the right to buy. In addition, tenants of former local authority housing stock that has been transferred to housing associations retain a preserved right-to-buy.

At 1 April 2003, there were around 3,200 local authority tenants in Chorley. The majority of these have the right to buy their homes. Secure tenants of local authorities (ie, the majority of local authority tenants) have the right to buy.

Tenants must have spent at least two years as a public sector tenant to qualify for the right to buy. The Housing Act 2004 increases the qualification period to five years for new tenancies granted on or after 18 January 2005.

This was stated at the presentation on 13 January by a control room officer who has 25 years of experience of working in four different fire and rescue service control rooms in both urban and rural areas. The requirement to have local knowledge does not form part of the selection criteria for staff so its depth, accuracy and currency are not measurable.

 Monthly disaggregated data of this nature is not readily available.

Between January 2004 and September 2004, Mali registered 805 Ivorian refugee arrivals, Guinea registered nine, and none were recorded in the other countries. Following the upsurge in violence in Cote d&#039;Ivoire in November 2004, 10,000 Ivorians were registered as newly-arriving refugees in Liberia, although more than half have since returned. The same events prompted up to 10,000 Burkinabe migrants to return to Burkina Faso, but, according to the UNHCR, there was no similar movement of Ivorians.

 Member state contributions to European Commission development programmes are an annual, legally-binding treaty obligation.

<a name="50221w98.html_para4">
As important is that working with the EC is an effective way to leverage more resources for development. EC aid equals 10 per cent. of world overseas development assistance and the member states of the European Union and the EC together provide over half of global development assistance. This collective effort has given Europe the credibility to challenge its own member states and other Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors to increase ODA/gross national income targets and global development aid. EU co-ordination led in 2002 to a specific EU ODA/GNI volume target commitment of 0.39 per cent. by 2006 as an input to the Monterrey Financing for Development Conference. This has contributed to a considerable increase of aid resources by EU and non-EU donors in support of the Millennium Development Goals.

<p><a name="50221w99.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 Hurricane Ivan has been a catastrophe for Grenada. Two weeks after the hurricane hit the island, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) undertook a macro-socio-economic assessment of the damage caused. This assessed that 90 per cent. of housing stock was either destroyed or damaged, and around 30 per cent. of the population made homeless. The OECS/ECLAC assessment indicated that the damage to schools, hospitals, businesses and infrastructure was estimated to be in the region of &#163;500 million, or twice Grenada&#039;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w99.html_para6">
Grenada had been recording impressive growth rates in recent years and was expected to grow by 5.7 per cent. in 2004. With significant losses to the main productive sectors of agriculture and tourism caused by the hurricane, the economy is now expected to have contracted by 1.4 per cent. in 2004. Some 90 per cent. of hotel rooms on the island were affected by the hurricane. A staff mission from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will provide a further update on the post-Ivan macro-economic situation and the prospects for economic recovery at a donor briefing meeting in Barbados at the end of February 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w99.html_para7">
Unemployment has increased with an estimated 40,000 jobs directly affected by the hurricane. However, as the physical reconstruction of buildings and infrastructure gets under way, it is anticipated that unemployment levels will start to decline.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221w99.html_para8">
The devastation to the agricultural sector caused by Hurricane Ivan was particularly severe: 95 per cent. of nutmeg trees&#151;Grenada&#039;s principal export commodity&#151;were uprooted. Regrowth and recovery of the nutmeg industry will take an estimated 7&#150;10 years. Grenada can, however, continue to export its reserve stocks for the next three years. This should help to cushion the impact of the loss of the trees on the economy. Cocoa was also affected, albeit, to a much lesser extent. 30 per cent. of the crop will need to be replanted, and it is expected that 50&#150;70 per cent. of the harvest for next year will be available.

At the 19 November donor conference on Grenada, the IMF announced that for the calendar year of 2004, donor contributions would fill the &#163;21 million gap in Grenada&#039;s finances. At that time, the IMF anticipated that a financing gap of &#163;4.2 million remained for 2005, which would widen in 2006 to &#163;19.2 million. The IMF currently has a team in Grenada to undertake a fuller assessment of financing needs in 2005 and 2006.

 Officials from the Department for International Development (DFID) are in constant contact with the other major donors, and receive regular updates on commitments and disbursements. Thus far, the Government of Grenada have received considerable commitments from the international donor community to provide reconstruction and recovery assistance. At the 19 November 2004 Second Donor Conference on Grenada, the World Bank reported that the total commitments were in the order of &#163;105 million.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Feb 2005 : Column 386W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
assistance is designed to support long term change in Kenya that will lead to improved governance, and to help Kenya to make sustainable progress towards the MDGs. The faster the pace of reform, and the more conducive the environment, the faster progress we will make.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221101.html_para10">
However, we are not providing poverty reduction budget support to the Kenyan Government, since we are not convinced that the Government is seriously committed to fighting corruption and making good progress on its overall reform programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221101.html_para11">
Nonetheless, we believe that we can make progress on the Millennium Development Goals by supporting specific sectors and projects. For example there are opportunities for constructive engagement in, and support to, the education and justice, law and order sectors. In these we have pooled our funding with other donors to support the Government of Kenya&#039;s own strategies such as free primary education, without putting our money directly into their systems. Under these arrangements, we helped the Government to set up reliable school management systems to attract large support for learning materials for primary schools. All 18,000 primary schools in Kenya now have textbooks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221101.html_para12">
In addition, there are opportunities even in sectors that have less well-established strategies by the Government of Kenya. In health for example, DFID is funding the social marketing of insecticide treated bed nets that is expected to reduce the rate of under five mortality by 14 per cent. (68,000 lives saved).

<p><a name="50221101.html_spnew8"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Progress on governance by the Kenyan Government has generally been disappointing. However, there have been a few exceptions. The Government established a governance, justice, law and order reform programme with support from 16 donors, including support for anti-corruption institutions, police training, and judicial reform. In addition, the investigations into the Goldenberg scandal have continued credibly; all public servants (including the president) have declared their assets; land policy has been formulated and land laws are being reviewed; and there have been wider governance achievements around improved national budgetary processes and primary school management. Progress is being made in the implementation of the national integrated Monitoring and Evaluation system at both central and devolved level, and this will be fully rolled out during 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221101.html_para13">
However, progress on dealing with corruption, especially on prosecutions, remains too slow. The biggest blow came last week with the resignation of the Permanent Secretary in the Office of President in charge of Public Ethics and Governance. The Public Procurement Bill has still not been passed. The continuing failure to bring the Constitutional Review process to a satisfactory conclusion has impeded progress towards the Government&#039;s objective of decentralisation and empowerment of local communities.

<p><a name="50221102.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Tobacco contributes 60 per cent. of Malawi&#039;s export earnings. It is produced increasingly by smallholders who make up 80 per cent. of the population. Furthermore, Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world and the Government of Malawi is naturally cautious about the risks of premature diversification out of tobacco. DFID knows of no evidence to suggest that there are alternative crops that are high value and low volume and therefore appropriate for export from a landlocked country and whose production could be scaled up rapidly under present circumstances in Malawi to replace tobacco in the short to medium term.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221102.html_para1">
However, if the Malawi Government&#039;s policies for promoting economic growth are successful, we expect agriculture to contribute significantly less to national income in the longer term and more emphasis to be placed in agriculture on the regional trade in food staples. Changes in international trade policies could facilitate this diversification.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps the United Kingdom is taking in partnership with other countries to ensure that the food, shelter, sanitation, healthcare and other basic needs of refugees in the Darfur region of Sudan are being adequately met; and what steps are being taken to assist in providing protection against attacks.  [216664]</p>




<p><a name="50221104.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The UK is the second largest bilateral donor to the Darfur crisis, having committed &#163;62.5 million since September 2003. The UK also contributes around 18 per cent. of the European Commission&#039;s &#8364;152 million contribution to the crisis. This year the UK will provide &#163;70 million in humanitarian assistance across Sudan. This includes &#163;20 million for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working in a wide range of sectors, including food, shelter, sanitation, and healthcare; &#163;5 million for the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) 2005 Sudan Appeal; &#163;5 million for the UN consolidated Appeal for Eastern Chad; and an un-earmarked &#163;40 million contribution for the UN Workplan for Sudan, which will allow the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Khartoum to target funding where it is needed most. When making funding allocations, DFID co-ordinates closely with other major donors, particularly the US and EC. The large majority of DFID interventions are jointly funded by other donors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221104.html_para0">
The UK remains gravely concerned about the security situation in Darfur, and we are pressing all sides to stop fighting and adhere to the Abuja protocols on providing unimpeded and unrestricted humanitarian access and refraining from all hostilities and military actions in the region. The UK has provided some &#163;14 million to the Africa Union monitoring mission in Darfur, including the provision of 143 vehicles; 470 more vehicles are on their way. DFID also funds NGOs and international organisations providing protection to the Sudanese population. One such example is, the ICRC 2005 Appeal, to which DFID will contribute &#163;5 million this year, this includes dialogue with all parties, and interventions to minimise violence due to competition for resources between internally displaced peoples (IDPs), nomads and farmers.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will make a statement on the humanitarian situation in the Sudan. [217390]</p>




<p><a name="50221104.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 UN social indicators for Sudan are among the lowest in the world. Infant mortality is 106&#150;111 per 1,000 live births and in large areas of the country people continue to rely on humanitarian assistance to survive. Needs are huge&#151;the UN Workplan for Sudan requires $1.48 billion for development and humanitarian assistance in 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221104.html_para1">
The recently ended conflict in southern Sudan is estimated to have displaced four million people. Food insecurity is critical and there is little primary health care except that provided by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). However the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, signed in January this year, now holds out the prospect of peace throughout Sudan. Ensuring a stable, sustainable environment for the return of the displaced population will be a critical challenge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221104.html_para2">
In Darfur the humanitarian situation remains precarious. There are over 1.8 million internally displaced people (IDPs), and a further 200,000 have fled to eastern Chad. The total population affected by the crisis in Darfur is estimated at 2.4 million. Despite limitations due to increasing insecurity, the humanitarian response continues to improve. In January 2005 food distribution reached 1.48 million people, some 140,000 more than the previous month. Shelter and non-food items have been provided to 73 per cent. of the IDP population while 56 per cent. were covered by sanitation activities. Of the total affected population, 49 per cent. had access to clean water, 62 per cent. to primary health facilities and 54 per cent. to secondary health facilities. Of major concern, is the observation of the first signs of food shortages among the general population, expected after the failure of the 2004 harvest season.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221104.html_para3">
Other areas of concern in Sudan include the Northern Red Sea State, which has suffered persistent drought and repeated crop failures since 1988, resulting in high food insecurity for the 700,000 population. Agricultural production for 2004 was better than the previous few years, but a large proportion of the population is likely to remain without sufficient food, and will require nutritional assistance for some time to come.

(FCTC) in Malawi or other countries. However, the WHO envisages that reducing tobacco consumption will take several decades. In the more immediate term, it is likely that national and regional policy factors such as domestic trade reform in China; energy, transport and land tenure crises in Zimbabwe; and the prospects of losing market share to expanding producers like Brazil are more pressing constraints for poor tobacco-dependent economies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221104.html_para5">
We are very sensitive to the serious adverse consequences of tobacco on public health, in particular the growing burden of tobacco-related disease in developing countries, and we recognise the importance of the FCTC. DFID funds are not used identifiably to support the tobacco sector, but it is consistent with our Millennium Development Goal mandate to provide advice to tobacco-dependent poor countries on constraints to their economic development and the livelihoods of their citizens. This may include measures to assist farmers dependent on tobacco crops to diversify into alternative activities.

 Uganda&#039;s Poverty Eradication Action Plan emphasises the need to improve the ability of individuals to plan the size of their families as a way of contributing to the reduction of poverty. The Government&#039;s family planning policy seeks to increase access to high quality, affordable family planning services for those that require contraceptives and to promote integrated family planning information and services. These objectives are set out in the Ministry of Health&#039;s draft Health Sector Strategic Plan for 2005&#150;10. Uganda faces a number of challenges in meeting these goals, including social misconceptions about family planning and a shortage of skilled staff and family planning commodities at the district level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221104.html_para6">
DFID welcomes Uganda&#039;s prioritisation of family planning in its efforts to reduce poverty, and its inclusion in the Health Sector Strategic Plan. The latter will help ensure family planning is not an afterthought, but an integral part of the evolution of the health sector. We strongly support the focus on improving services at the district level. DFID also welcomes the Ugandan Government&#039;s development of a comprehensive advocacy strategy tackling a range of issues including education for young people in school and public leadership.

 The UK currently provides 60 per cent. of its assistance as Poverty Reduction Budget Support, as a direct contribution to the Government of Uganda&#039;s budget.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221104.html_para8">
Uganda has a well-developed and consultative budgetary process which allows donors to ensure that Uganda meets its commitment to prioritise poverty reduction. It provides an opportunity to endorse the budget at the annual Public Expenditure Review. Allocations to the Government&#039;s &quot;Poverty Action Fund&quot;, for example, have risen from less than 20 per cent. of the budget in 1997 to 38 per cent. in 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221104.html_para9">
Budget execution is generally good and is closely monitored by Government and donors, including the International Financial Institutions. DFID&#039;s Poverty Reduction Budget Support, and that of other partners such as the World Bank, is conditional on endorsement of the budget and its subsequent execution. This ensures that allocations to the Poverty Action Fund are protected. Detailed half and full year budget execution reports are posted on the internet, and the Government continues to produce audited accounts within the statutory period of nine months. Uganda performs well in international comparative assessments of public financial management, including the World Bank/IMF expenditure tracking assessment conducted in 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221104.html_para10">
In addition to DFID&#039;s contribution to Uganda&#039;s budget, the UK provides a significant amount of project assistance, including support for improving public financial management. These projects are managed in accordance with DFID procedures and are subject to regular reviews to ensure impact and financial propriety. The National Audit Office was satisfied with DFID systems in Uganda when it audited our programme in December 2004.

 The Government strongly supports the analysis in the report, which shows the Millennium Development Goals are off-track and demonstrates that aid works.

Donors must commit more resources through traditional aid channels, enhanced debt relief, and the International Finance Facility. This will enable developing countries to develop and implement more ambitious poverty reduction strategies. On results-based management, we believe that aid should be provided to support country-led programmes with clear development outcomes and benchmarks.

<p><a name="50221105.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Recent assessments by NGOs working at community level in Zimbabwe suggest that malnutrition is not presently high by emergency standards, but that food availability and affordability are decreasing. The Government of Zimbabwe claimed last year that there had been a bumper crop and that it would not need international food aid during the period up to the next harvest (around April 2005). However, independent surveys suggest that the last harvest was much lower than the Zimbabwean Government claim. The Government cancelled the UN crop assessment and have not provided information to donors and UN agencies about their imports, stocks or their ability to sell or distribute grain. Even if the Government of Zimbabwe can import and distribute enough food, many vulnerable groups will not have resources to buy it. The World Food Programme continue to provide targeted feeding through their regional programme predominantly through institutions such as schools and clinics and some food supplements to Home Based Care programmes.

 The Government of Zimbabwe&#039;s decision not to renew their appeal to the United Nations for food aid is of concern to the humanitarian community.

Donor-funded relief programmes have remained generally free of political interference. But there has been some evidence that access to food distributed by the Zimbabwe Government is being politicised. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.

1. Figures taken from a 5 per cent. sample at 31 May 2004<br>

2. Figures are in thousands and rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>

3. Figures marked * are less than 500 and subject to a high degree of sampling variation.<br>

4. &quot;&#151;&quot; denotes nil or negligible.<br>

5. From November 2002, the methodology for producing these figures was changed to allow statistics to be published much sooner. This has resulted in a small increase in the reported caseload. This is because some cases which have actually terminated but have not yet been updated on the computer system are now included.<br>

</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Where customers have literacy difficulties, we can help them or, if they prefer, we could refer them to a third party in their local area, where such arrangements are in place.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) how the concept of normal handling and use contained in EU legislation on the classification and labelling of chemicals is applied in the United Kingdom; who is responsible for advising the Government on the application of this concept; what guidance has been issued by the Health and Safety Executive to the business community and others on how the concept of normal handling and use will be applied; and if he will make a statement;  [211172]

 The EU legislation which includes the expression &quot;normal handling and use&quot; is applied in the United Kingdom through the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging Regulations 2002. These regulations formally refer to the Approved Classification and Labelling Guide, a practical document which contains the expression without specific advice on its application. This guide is based on the relevant EU directive and was prepared by the Health and Safety Executive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221106.html_para1">
We are aware that there is some concern that the present advice does not sufficiently explain the application of &quot;normal handling and use&quot;. The term is particularly important in EU negotiations when the dangerous properties of chemicals are discussed and agreed between member states. Clarification of the concept should be developed at European level and UK officials are actively pursuing this in the appropriate fora.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply direct to your question concerning plans to close the Jobcentre Plus premises at Beeches Road, Chelmsford. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">I wrote to you in March 2004 regarding our plans for this site. Since then, the future of our Beeches Road site has been still under review as part of a DWP wide exercise to review Estate holdings throughout Essex. I am aware that a somewhat misleading article was recently featured in the press relating to the closure of our site in Beeches Road.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">It may be helpful if I briefly describe the changes we are currently planning.</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Feb 2005 : Column 407W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">With the Executive Board of Jobcentre Plus I have carefully considered how we can make benefit processing more efficient in the interests of all our customers. We have now concluded that we should consolidate this important area of our business into a smaller number of locations. Currently we carry out this work in several hundred sites and reducing this to around 77 Benefit Processing Centres by 2008 will enable us to deliver a faster, more efficient service using the improved information technology systems which are now starting to become available to us.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">As you are already aware, the benefit processing work we currently carry out at Beeches Road, Chelmsford will be moving to one of our new processing centres. The announcement of our planned changes was obviously a sensitive issue for the staff who currently undertake this work in Chelmsford and a number of similar sites nationally. We considered it vitally important that our people should hear about the plans as soon as possible and that they should hear the news from Jobcentre Plus Managers.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">We therefore planned and undertook an extensive programme of communications throughout our organisation, to MPs and to other people and organisations we work closely with. Even at this early stage, an essential part of our communications strategy was to set out the arrangements we are making to re-deploy employees who will be affected by the changes, including our commitment to avoid redundancies as far as possible. The timescale for the transfer of benefit processing work from sites such as Beeches Road has still to be determined, although our intention is that this will take place by 2008.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Jobcentre Plus provides a telephone contact centre network where our customers are able to make enquiries without having to come into one of our offices. Our Beeches Road site currently houses a small part of this network. Our current plans involve this work being undertaken from another part of the network by our staff based in Derby, from 2 September 2005.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Other face-to-face services will continue to be provided by staff at Beeches Road.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p class="tabletext">Jobcentre Plus keeps under constant review our Estates and operational delivery to customers. I hope it will reassure you to know that, at the present time, there are still no plans to close the Beeches Road premises.</p>

 The European Commission&#039;s Scientific Committee for Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL) met on six occasions in the last 18 months.

During the Dutch presidency the Committee met between 22&#150;23 September 2004 and 15&#150;16 December 2004. All meetings took place in the Jean Monnet Building in Luxembourg.

<p><a name="50221109.html_spnew1"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 The majority of tenders received are in response to low value, low risk procurements let locally under devolved budget arrangements. The Department does not collect information centrally about these tenders and to provide a complete answer to the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Feb 2005 : Column 416W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
question would incur disproportionate cost. However, information is collected centrally on high value, high risk procurements conducted by specialist procurement teams. In 2003&#150;04 the Department let 440 contracts and framework agreements with values over the EU threshold level (about &#163;100,000). The total value of these over their full durations, which range between two and 18 years, is expected to be about &#163;2,012 million. The actual value will depend upon the volume of business we place and the quality of services delivered over the period.

<i>Letter from Mr. David Anderson to Mr. Paul Holmes, dated 21 February 2005:</i>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning how the employment advisers pledged in the Department&#039;s Five Year Strategy will be recruited: and if they will be exempt from the Department&#039;s proposed job cuts. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Whilst external recruitment may be required in some locations, many of the Personal Adviser posts, which will help Jobcentre Plus continue to deliver services to jobless customers, are already occupied by our skilled staff. In other cases, as an important element of the Department&#039;s approach to seek to avoid compulsory redundancies, vacant Adviser posts will be filled by re-trained, surplus staff from Jobcentre Plus, or from elsewhere within the Department.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">It is not possible to say that any individual staff member will be exempt from the staffing reductions which will be implemented. The particular circumstances of, for example, a voluntary early release scheme could lead to a current Personal Adviser deciding to leave Jobcentre Plus to be replaced by a surplus person. However, given Jobcentre Plus will increase the proportion of our staff in active roles which support customers into work, it is likely that this group of staff will be affected less than those providing support roles which do not involve contact with the public.</p>

 We monitor processing times for new claims and change of circumstance across all local authorities, but we have not specifically assessed the impact of the Verification Framework (VF) since 2002. The assessment was inconclusive but suggested that there is an initial dip in performance followed by an improvement in some groups of local authorities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221109.html_para3">
Local authority performance is affected by a multitude of factors, but using the most recent data, the average processing times for new claims for VF and non-VF local authorities are currently 45 days and 52 days respectively. The average processing times for changes of circumstances are 13 days and 15 days respectively. In some other recent quarters, however, these differences have been smaller.

 We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.

<a name="50221110.html_para0">
Since 2001, the Government has significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Huddersfield will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly, families with severely disabled 3 and 4-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government&#039;s decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, while older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.

<p>

In 2002&#150;03 we estimate there were around 10 million adults (22 per cent.) and 0.7 million children (5 per cent.) in Great Britain likely to be covered by the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).

<p>
<a name="50221110.html_para2">
The figures can be broken down to regional level which shows that 25 per cent. of adults and 4 per cent. of children in the Yorkshire and Humber region are likely to be covered by the provisions of the DDA.

Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.5 million; in Huddersfield, the proportion in employment has risen to 70.3 per cent.

Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.2 million people have been helped into work by the new deals, with 2,970 in Huddersfield alone.

Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures (for 2002&#150;03) show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Feb 2005 : Column 419W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
children in relative low income than there were in 1996&#150;97. Since 2001&#150;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18-years-old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&#150;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 2,400 families in Huddersfield.

We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &#163;10 billion more in 2004&#150;05 (in 2004&#150;05 prices) on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997, with around half going to the poorest third.

<p>
<a name="50221110.html_para8">
Our reforms include the state second pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those aged 65 and over may be rewarded for savings and income. As of December 2004, around 4,750 pensioners in Huddersfield are receiving pension credit, with an average award of 40.58 per week.

We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2004&#150;05) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &#163;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over and &#163;300 to those with someone aged 80 or over to help with their fuel bills. Additionally, for this year, eligible households with someone aged 70 or over will receive the one-off 70 plus payment of &#163;100 to help with living expenses including council tax bills. It is paid with the winter fuel payment.

<p><a name="50221111.html_spnew2"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The minimum income guarantee was replaced by pension credit in October 2003. Information on the number of pension credit recipients in Bridgewater in September and December 2004 is given in the following table. Information on the number of people likely to be eligible for pension credit is not available at constituency level. However, we estimate that approximately 350,000 households in the south-west region, corresponding to approximately 450,000 individuals (rounded to the nearest 50,000), are likely to be eligible for pension credit in 2004&#150;05. This is an indicative estimate, subject to a significant margin of error. At the end of December 2004, 219,810 pensioner households in the south-west region, comprising approximately 268,430 individuals, were in receipt of pension credit.

In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18-years-old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&#150;02.

This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Legislation was changed in 2002 to allow crisis loan applications to be taken by telephone. Since then, a varying level of service has been offered in different parts of the country, due to factors such as the telephony equipment available in different areas. While the telephone service has generally proved popular 



<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>21 Feb 2005 : Column 435W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>and efficient, in the few areas where there have been problems dealing with the high volume of calls, urgent local management action has been taken to improve the service for customers. Irrespective of the level or adequacy of the telephone service, customers retain a right to apply for a loan in person at a Jobcentre Plus office.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">For the future, we plan to reduce the number of offices processing Social Fund applications from 142 to around 20, and to implement a standard operating model for the Fund. We are piloting the new model in two Welsh district offices and aim to roll it out nationally from April 2005 onwards. The model includes a standard telephone service for crisis loans, supported by the appropriate telephone technology. The increased size of the processing units will give much greater staffing flexibility and allow us to assign staff as necessary to meet fluctuating customer demand. Although the telephone will become the normal and preferred method of taking crisis loan applications, we will retain the option of face to face interviews for people who require them.</p>

<p><a name="50221116.html_spnew4"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Government believe that prison should be reserved for serious, violent and seriously persistent offenders. For all other offenders, alternatives to prison can often be more effective in addressing offender behaviour than short custodial sentences. The new generic community sentence, provided by the Criminal Justice Act 2003, will be commenced on 4 April 2005. This will give the courts a flexible range of tough community punishments suitable for dealing with a wide range of offenders whose offence is too serious for them to be fined but who do not fall into the serious, violent or seriously persistent category.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221116.html_para4">
The Government recognise that there is a lack of public knowledge and understanding of community sentences.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221116.html_para5">
That is why the National Offender Management Service has launched a major communications campaign which aims to demonstrate that community sentences are both tough and demanding whilst providing the opportunity for offenders to give something back directly to the community. It will target national, regional and local media to secure the broadest public audience.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50221116.html_para6">
There is a national visibility scheme in place to identify community work done by offenders. In the next few weeks a &#039;Clean Up&#039; campaign will start in 10 regions, which will give local people the opportunity to have a say in the unpaid work to be done by offenders as part of their community punishment.

 The European Refugee Fund has been for some years an important source of support for Britain&#039;s programmes for the integration of refugees and the voluntary return of asylum seekers to their own countries.

 The date of 1 July 1997 recognises when the Brigade of Gurkhas moved their headquarters from Hong Kong to the UK. Settlement is normally granted on the basis of residence in the UK and so it was considered appropriate to enable all those discharged after this date, and who would have developed close physical ties with the UK through being based here, to be able to apply for settlement. However, applications from Gurkhas discharged before 1 July 1997 will be considered on their individual merits, and discretion will be exercised in appropriate cases. Factors such as time spent in the UK, the presence of close family members here, or a chronic medical condition will be taken into account in reaching a decision on applications that are outside the rules.

Home Office guidance states that the decision to suspend should be taken only when the presence of an officer on duty may be detrimental to criminal or disciplinary investigations or proceedings, or when it is in the public interest to do so.

 Prison governors keep staffing levels under regular review. During the last two years, the public sector Prison Service has been successful in attracting new prison officer recruits. 2,420 new officers were recruited in 2003 (an increase of 50.5 per cent. on 2002), and 1,983 officers were recruited in 2004. Leaving rates are currently less than four per cent per year across the service.

 Working purposefully with other criminal justice agencies to protect the public from harm remains a key priority for the National Probation Service (NPS). Together with the local police and prison services, the NPS is responsible for reviewing and monitoring arrangements for assessing and managing the risks posed by sexual and violent offenders within multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA). This involves working with other criminal justice organisations, including the youth offending teams, together with local providers of health, housing, education and social services.

Chief officers of probation sit on local criminal justice boards (LCJBs) which are responsible for the local delivery of criminal justice system (CJS) objectives, improvement in the delivery of justice, the service provided to victims and witnesses, and securing public confidence in the system.

Working together with partners under each of these headings the NPS will continue work to improve child protection arrangements, enhance the service to victims, and develop a co-ordinated response to domestic abuse.

Every death that occurs in prison or following contact with the police is a tragedy and is treated with the utmost seriousness by the Government, and the Prison and Police Services. On 31 March 2004, I announced the outline suicide prevention strategy for prisons that can be summarised as, &#039;Reducing distress and promoting the well-being of all who live and work in prisons.&#039; This follows extensive consultations including those with the Howard League, Prison Reform Trust, Inquest, the Youth Justice Board, Prisons and Probations Ombudsman, Her Majesty&#039;s Chief Inspector of Prisons, Samaritans and the Department of Health.

This builds on the three-year Safer Custody strategy that ran from April 2001, which was geared towards making progress in resettlement, detoxification, health, and purposeful activity, as well as staff outlooks, leadership and training. Key achievements were the placement of Suicide Prevention Co-ordinators (or equivalents) operating in all prisons, an investment of over &#163;21 million at six &#039;Safer Local&#039; pilot sites, and the development of safer prison design, including &#039;safer cells.&#039;

Police forces are also working hard to ensure that all possible measures are in place to minimise the risks relating to suicide and self-harm.
