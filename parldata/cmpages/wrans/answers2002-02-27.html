 The Legal Services Commission (LSC) reviews trends in recruitment and the retention of publicly funded lawyers on a continuing basis to ensure that there are sufficient numbers of competent lawyers to do all categories of publicly supported legal work throughout England and Wales. The LSC reports regularly to the LCD and the evidence is that there is currently a sufficient number of lawyers to undertake publicly funded work. As at 15 February 2002, there were 4,935 solicitor offices with contracts to undertake publicly funded civil and family work. In addition to this, the LSC has also awarded contracts to 382 not-for-profit sector organisations. As at 31 January 2001, the total number of solicitor offices with General Criminal Contracts stood at 2,921. There are also four public defender offices with the fifth to open in April 2002 and the sixth shortly after.

 Total real terms costs for advertising are as listed. During this period the LCD ran an advertising campaign to support the recruiting of lay magistrates, which accounts for spending in 1998&#150;99 and mounted a major public information campaign throughout England and Wales on behalf of the Community Legal Service and the help and advice website "Just Ask!" which accounts for almost all of the advertising spend in 2000&#150;01.

Also there is the opportunity for BAE Systems to deliver a sound order book, based on the MoD contracts for Landing Craft (utility), Alternative Landing Ships Logistic and the Type 45 programme on which, for the first time in generations, the Clyde yards can plan and build for success. The work of the Task Force was part of that process.

<a name="20227w07.html_para5">In 1999&#150;2000 Stoke-on-Trent became one of the original 15 LEAs to be piloted for the roll-out of Education Maintenance Allowances. National evaluation of EMA shows it to have had a beneficial effect on post-16 participation.Participation rates by LEA for 16 and 17-year-olds are published in an annual statistical bulletin, "Participation in Education and Training by Young People aged 16 and 17 in Each Local Area and Region, England".

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much was allocated per pupil through the Standards Fund for each English education authority in 2001&#150;02.  [37771]<P>

<a name="20227w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The following table shows allocations for the Standards Fund, shown as an amount per pupil, for 2001&#150;02, for each local education authority in England. The figures include recurrent and capital Standards Fund grants excluding those that are specifically for under-5s education, further education and adult education. The Standards Fund includes Government grant and local authority contributions, which have both been included in the calculations.
<P>

<a name="20227w07.html_para6">The Standards Fund is one element of overall education funding and supports a range of national education priorities, such as the national literacy and numeracy strategies, support for Specialist Schools, measures to raise the level of achievement of pupils from ethnic minorities, the Excellence in Cities initiative and capital projects. As such the Standards Fund is not allocated on a simple per pupil basis, but in relation to the specific priorities it is designed to support. For example, the allocation a local education authority will receive to support its Specialist Schools will depend on the number of those schools in that authority. A local education authority will not necessarily receive an allocation for every Standards Fund priority. For example, not all authorities are part of the Excellence in Cities initiative,

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the 10 lowest education SSAs are per <i>(a)</i> primary and <i>(b)</i> secondary pupil for English education authorities in 2001&#150;02.  [37772]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The information requested is in the following table. The variations in SSA per pupil have two main causes: authorities in London and the South East receive an area cost adjustment, to compensate for the higher costs they face; and authorities receive funding according to their level of deprivation.
<P>

<a name="20227w08.html_para0">The Government acknowledge that there are disparities in SSA per pupil, which are not justified by the education needs of children. We are working up proposals, in partnership with local government and other education interests, for the introduction of a new funding system in 2003&#150;04.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what funding arrangements are proposed for pupils taking AS-level courses before age 16; and what the implications will be for the budgets of <i>(a)</i> the local learning and skills councils and <i>(b)</i> the LEAs respectively.  [37955]

<a name="20227w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Funding for pupils of compulsory school age who are not in a sixth form but are taking an AS-level a year or more early continues to be the responsibility of the LEA. In developing future funding arrangements we will take into account responses to the recent Green Paper "14&#150;19&#151;extending opportunities, raising standards".

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will list applications made to her Department in the last three years for consent to allow development on school playing fields giving in each case <i>(a)</i> the outcome of the application, <i>(b)</i> what steps were taken to ascertain whether adequate sports facilities would remain if permission were granted and <i>(c)</i> where consent was given, what assurances were secured as to how proceeds of sale would be used.

<P>

<a name="20227w08.html_para2">Before October 1998, there was nothing to prevent a local authority selling a school playing field if it wanted to. Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced in October 1998 to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields. Local authorities and governing bodies of all maintained schools are now required to obtain the Secretary of State's consent before disposing of playing fields or any part of a playing field.
<P>

<a name="20227w08.html_para3">Applications to dispose, or change the use, of school playing fields are assessed against the following criteria:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> schools' needs: that playing field provision and curriculum requirements at the school making the disposal, and at other schools in the local area, will be met;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> community needs: that community use of a school's playing fields is taken into account, with alternative facilities made available if necessary;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(c)</i> finance: that any sale proceeds are re-invested to provide new or improved sports facilities at schools, or are used to help to raise standards by providing better educational facilities.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="20227w08.html_para4">Only those applications that meet the criteria are approved. Since July 2001, all applications have been scrutinised by the independent School Playing Fields Advisory Panel to make sure that they conform to the published criteria. The Panel comprises representatives from the National Playing Fields Association, the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the education organisation Learning through Landscapes, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Local Government Association.

<P>
<a name="20227w09.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 It may help if I set the context by first explaining our plans to ensure that there is a careful review of the UK's current regulatory practices for statutory audit and financial reporting, following the collapse of Enron in the US.
<P>

<a name="20227w09.html_para0">The requirements in the UK are significantly different from the US in relation both to the relevant accounting standards and to the oversight and regulation of the audit profession. But it would be most unwise to conclude that problems of this sort could not arise in the UK; and it is right therefore to review arrangements carefully
<P>

<a name="20227w09.html_para1">I am therefore setting up a group jointly with the Treasury, and including the Financial Services Authority and other regulators such as the Accountancy Foundation, to oversee and co-ordinate the response in the UK to these issues raised by the collapse of Enron. These include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>whether the ethical standards of the professional audit bodies provide an adequate assurance on the independence of auditors, including the restrictions on the supply of non auditors, including the restrictions on the supply of non audit services
<P>
<BR>
whether there should be a requirement for the mandatory rotation of audit firms; or for the mandatory re-tendering for company audit
<P>
<BR>

<P>

<a name="20227w09.html_para2">The Group will report on progress and emerging conclusions by the summer.
<P>

<a name="20227w09.html_para3">At the same time I am also setting up an independent review of the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors in the UK. The review will report jointly to me and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I will provide further details of who is to lead the review and the terms of reference in due course.
<P>

<a name="20227w09.html_para4">Together these reviews are aimed at:

</FONT></UL>
<a name="20227w09.html_para5">The quality assurance systems for the statutory audit, both within and outside the audit firms, are an important part of the regulatory arrangements which give confidence in the audit process.
<P>

<a name="20227w09.html_para6">The European Commission's Recommendation C(2000) 3304 of 15 November 2000 on "quality assurance for the statutory audit in the EU: minimum requirements" recommends that all persons carrying out statutory audits should be subject to a quality assurance system. The Recommendation sets out acceptable methodologies and covers topics such as review cycles, the scope of the review and the quality of the reviewer.




<P>
<P><I>27 Feb 2002 : Column 1304W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20227w09.html_para7">The United Kingdom has an established system of monitoring of statutory company auditors, which was in place well before the Recommendation was adopted. The bodies recognised under the Companies Act 1989 to supervise registered auditors are required regularly to monitor the performance of audit firms or individual auditors registered with them. My Department asked the recognised supervisory bodies to review existing requirements against the detail of the Recommendation and to report the results. The arrangements were found to be broadly in line with the Recommendation. All audit firms and individual auditors are subject to regular review, including monitoring visits by independent reviewers, and those with public interest clients, such as listed companies, are subject to a higher frequency of coverage.

There is a requirement for further tests at regular intervals; the optometrist doing the first test can recommend when the next one should be. In addition, employers must pay the cost of special spectacles where normal ones cannot be used.

 The Indonesian Government believe the re-establishment of the Aceh military command will lead to improved accountability for the security forces and security in the province through improved communication. Any moves to increase accountability and reduce lawlessness in the province should be welcomed. We continue to impress on the Indonesian authorities the importance of upholding and promoting human rights throughout the country. On 18 February the British Ambassador in Jakarta raised our concerns about reports that the Indonesian Government intended to 'crush' the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) by military force with Co-ordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs, Bambang Yudhoyono.

<a name="20227w12.html_spnew2"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 On 18 February the General Affairs Council (GAC) of the European Union decided to implement targeted sanctions against the Government of Zimbabwe. The GAC expressed serious concern at continuing political violence, serious violations of human rights and restrictions on the media in Zimbabwe which call into question the prospects for a free and fair presidential election on 9&#150;10 March 2002. The GAC noted that the Government of Zimbabwe had objected to having nationals of six EU member states accredited as observers for the forthcoming elections and refused to accredit the EU Chief Observer, Ambassador Pierre Schori.

 Each case is considered on its merits in terms of the overall potential benefit to UK business and to the UK economy. A number of factors will be relevant in considering this, including whether the company is incorporated or registered in Britain, whether the company has a UK address, whether a company is UK controlled or owned, whether it employs people in the UK, whether it has a UK-manufactured product or service, and whether there are wider benefits for the UK, eg in terms of increased access to overseas markets, increased employment or increased competitiveness.

 New deal is pro-active in the promotion of equality of opportunity and outcome for people of all ethnic groups. In November 1998, we published a Strategy for Engaging Ethnic Minorities which looked at ways to identify and overcome the barriers to ethnic minority young people, providers and businesses participating in new deal. Action plans supporting the strategy are reviewed every six months.

 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report was published today in respect of North Lanarkshire council and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20227w13.html_para0">BFI Inspectors found that North Lanarkshire council is a poor performing authority that needs to make significant improvements to raise standards in almost every aspect of its benefits administration and counter fraud work. The report notes a lack of awareness of what constitutes a safe and secure benefits service at the council, despite an annual expenditure of more than &#163;95 million on housing benefit and council tax benefit.
<P>

<a name="20227w13.html_para1">Inspectors noted that the council was using three different types of claim form and considered that none of them was up to standard. They recommend that North Lanarkshire introduces a single claim form based upon the national BFI model. This is seen as vital to help claimants to provide all the supporting evidence needed for a claim to be worked out accurately from the start.




<P>

<P>

<a name="20227w13.html_para2">The report identifies weaknesses in a number of areas including the monitoring and control of benefit periods, the renewal of claims, and the way that the council deals with changes of circumstances to prevent overpayments. The council did not have a policy covering overpayments of benefit and had no management controls to show that overpayments were being dealt with correctly.
<P>

<a name="20227w13.html_para3">Inspectors also express concern over the council's benefit security procedures. They found that none of the key British Safety standards on security controls were being met. Inspectors consider that North Lanarkshire's benefits service is highly vulnerable to internal fraud.
<P>

<a name="20227w13.html_para4">The council's counter fraud policy was not being managed effectively. The report finds that the counter fraud team did not have enough staff to cope with the volume of work. Also, training and management direction was inadequate. Weaknesses were found in the council's IT security procedures, particularly on the standards of information security. The quality of investigative work was poor and inspectors considered that the council did not do enough to prevent fraud nor to deter repeat offenders. 80 per cent. of investigations examined by inspectors were found to be incomplete. Concern was also expressed in the report that the council did not refer cases to the Procurator Fiscal for prosecution.

 There will be no increase in the General Levy rates for 2002&#150;03. Rates will remain at the 2000&#150;01 level as set out in the table. Levy receipts are buoyant due to the growth in the number of members for which the levy is payable. Although Opra's costs have increased and it will have added responsibilities for regulating speeding up the winding up of pension schemes in 2002&#150;03, there will be sufficient funding without increasing the General Levy rates.

 It is not possible to make firm estimates of the change to the average payment of child support maintenance as a result of the introduction of the new child support scheme.

 The income of a non-resident parent's partner will not be taken into account in the new CSA calculation. The partner's contribution to a stakeholder pension will therefore also be irrelevant.

 To give parents who have existing child support assessments time to adjust to the new amounts, child support liability will be phased over a period of five years and in stages of &#163;2.50, &#163;5 or &#163;10, depending on the non-resident parent's net weekly income.

 There are already some VAT exemptions in place for sport: playing services provided by non-profit making clubs, lettings of sports and physical recreation facilities to all types of providers, and entry fees to sports and physical recreation competitions. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport received representations from the Central Council of Physical Recreation last year asking that a reduced VAT rate be introduced for the use of sporting facilities and for admission to sporting events. As with all proposals for tax reform the Government will need to consider full and detailed evidence of costs and benefits before taking any decision on additional VAT exemptions.

The role of the business manager is to manage the unit's administrative and business processes, thus releasing the senior lawyer to focus on a personal portfolio of the more serious cases, leadership, criminal justice liaison and line management of the prosecutors in the unit.

<a name="20227w17.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General how often members of the Crown Prosecution Service have met the family of someone killed as a result of a crime to explain their decision on prosecution, broken down by region, in each year since the inception of this initiative.  [37071]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w17.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 February 2002]:</i> One of the responsibilities of the Crown Prosecution Service under the current Victims' Charter, published 1996, is to meet on request the family of someone killed as a result of a crime, to explain decisions about prosecutions.
<P>

<a name="20227w17.html_para0">The figures for the number of such meetings held are collated each year and published in the Crown Prosecution Service's Annual Report. They are also submitted annually to the inter-agency Victims' Steering Group, which is charged with monitoring the Charter Standards for which the respective criminal justice agencies are responsible. Monitoring of the Charter Standards began in 1997.
<P>

<a name="20227w17.html_para1">In 1997&#150;98, the Crown Prosecution Service records show that 100 per cent. of requests for meetings were granted. However, further statistics for that period are not available.
<P>

<a name="20227w17.html_para2">In the following year, 83 requests were received and all were granted. All meetings were held, with the exception of one which was cancelled at the request of the victim's family.
<P>

<a name="20227w17.html_para3">In 1999&#150;2000, 102 requests were received and 101 granted, and meetings held in all these cases. One request was refused as the person making the request was a pivotal prosecution witness in two related cases that were ongoing, and it was not considered that a meeting would be appropriate.

<a name="20227w17.html_para4">In 2000&#150;01, 118 requests were received, all of which were granted, and all meetings were held.
<P>

<a name="20227w17.html_para5">Figures for 2001&#150;02 are not yet available but will be published in the forthcoming Annual Report.

 In the 2001 calendar year, DEFRA/MAFF has made 526 Statutory instruments (SIs). A full list and purpose of each instrument is available through the HMSO SI registrar, which can be found at (siregistrar@cabinet-office.x.gsi.gov.uk).

 I confirmed this morning that terms have been agreed to cease large-scale commercial peat working at Thorne Moor and Wedholme immediately and to phase it out over the next three years at Hatfield Moor. This has been achieved as a consequence of negotiations between English Nature and the major operator on the sites, Scotts Ltd. Upon satisfactory completion of contract Government will provide &#163;17.3 million to English Nature to buy out existing peat extraction consents and to buy the sites. The arrangements include measures to safeguard employment and to re-deploy effort towards restoration of the sites and the development of peat alternatives.

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2002]:</i> In its Strategy for sustainable development for the UK, 'A better quality of life' published in 1999, the Government established 15 headline indicators (and a core set of around 135 indicators) to measure progress towards sustainable development by the country as a whole. The first review, 'Achieving a better quality of life', Government annual report 2000, was published in January 2001 and the second annual review will be published shortly. Looked at as a set, the 15 headline indicators can be seen as a "Quality of life barometer".
<P>

<a name="20227w18.html_para0">The Government decided against aggregating indicators along the lines of the World Economic Forum's Environmental Sustainability Index. Such indices may be useful as tools to raise awareness but their choice of components, and the way in which they are weighted together, is largely subjective. A different choice of components, or of weights, would give wholly different results and hence the resulting measures are potentially misleading. This is aptly illustrated by the fact that the World Economic Forum's choice of components last year resulted in the UK being ranked 16th in the world in the same Index, as opposed to 91st this year.
<P>

<a name="20227w18.html_para1">The Government believe that the headline indicators established by the 1999 Strategy present an alternative, more transparent and comprehensive picture than any aggregated measure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w18.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The latest available figures, from the Department's municipal waste management survey, indicate that London produced approximately 4.4 million tonnes of municipal waste in 1999/2000. This figure was approximately 3.8 million tonnes in 1996/97, 4 million tonnes in 1997/98 and 4.1 million tonnes in 1998/99. 2000/01 data are currently being collated from local authorities.
<P>

<a name="20227w18.html_para6">It is of course up to individual waste authorities to promote waste minimisation and to develop minimisation schemes. However, I understand that the Mayor's municipal waste management strategy for London (currently in draft form) recognises this problem of growth in waste and emphasises the importance of reducing the amount of waste London produces.
<P>

<a name="20227w18.html_para7">The Government encourage all waste authorities to reduce the amount of waste produced and waste minimisation is at the top of the waste hierarchy, as set out in the Government's <i>Waste Strategy 2000</i>.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w18.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 It is for individual waste authorities to determine how and where their waste is disposed of. At present, much of London's waste is transported outside London for disposal at landfill sites. However, I understand that the Mayor's Municipal Waste Management Strategy (currently in draft form) proposed to address this issue, by looking at the current waste disposal facilities in London, and assessing what new facilities are required, with the aim of greater self-sufficiency for London in relation to waste, and maximised recycling and composting.
<P>

<a name="20227w18.html_para10">Greater self-sufficiency and increased recycling and composting will mean that less waste needs to be transported outside London. Where waste does need to be transported, the Mayor's draft strategy proposes to encourage the use of environmentally friendly modes of transport, such as rail, river and canal.
<P>

<a name="20227w18.html_para11">The Government's Waste Strategy 2000 stressed the importance of waste being dealt with as close to its source as possible. All waste authorities are encouraged to take this 'proximity principle' into account and to reduce transportation of waste, wherever possible, when developing their municipal waste management strategies.
<P>

<a name="20227w18.html_para12">In March 2001 the then DETR issued Guidance on Municipal Waste Management Strategies to all local authorities. This advised that opportunities for using forms of transport other than road haulage be considered by authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w18.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The department has not commissioned such research. Local authorities have a responsibility to plan waste treatment and disposal. Waste Strategy 2000 set targets for recycling and composting of household waste in England and Wales, and in March 2001 we introduced statutory performance standards for local authorities in England.
<P>

<a name="20227w18.html_para13">Where a local authority or company proposes a waste incineration facility, our policy is that it should be small enough that it does not act as a disincentive to increased recycling, and should not undermine the achievement of the statutory recycling targets that have been allocated.
<P>

<a name="20227w18.html_para14">Under the guidance we issued in September 2000 for Private Finance Initiative projects, proposals which include incineration must also demonstrate that all opportunities for recycling have been considered first, and that the arrangements proposed will not produce a barrier to the longer term development of recycling.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the quality and hygiene restrictions imposed on milk imported to this country; what proportion of the imported milk is tested to ensure it complies to these regulations; and what volume of milk has been imported to the UK in each of the last 20 years.  [36426]<P>

<P>
<a name="20227w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 All milk and milk products imported into the UK from other EU member states must have been produced in accordance with Community rules. Imports from third countries must have been produced to standards at least equivalent to those. Among other things, the legislation lays down the approval, structural, handling and enforcement requirements to be applied. In line with Community rules, random spot checks at destination may be carried out.
<P>

<a name="20227w19.html_para6">Consignments of milk and milk products imported from third countries are subject to veterinary inspection on entering the EU to ensure that conditions of import have been complied with and that they have remained in a satisfactory condition during transport. This constitutes a documentary check on all imports from third countries, as well as physical checks on 50 per cent. of these.
<P>

<a name="20227w19.html_para7">The amount of milk imported into the UK for each year from 1982 is as follows:

<P>
<a name="20227w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department does not collect data for milk sales by outlet. The Dairy Council estimates that around 69 per cent. of household purchases of liquid milk are now made in supermarkets and 23 per cent. from doorstep deliveries. 10 years ago doorstep deliveries accounted for around 61 per cent.

 The Department is contributing to an economic research project led by the Sea Fish Industry Authority which is examining the determinants of fish prices and demand at both the quayside and retail levels. This has not yet reported, although the results of the quayside phase are due to be published soon. What is clear at this stage however is that, because of the global nature of the markets for some important species, there is often no simple relationship between local catch levels and market prices.

 The Energy Saving Trust is an independent body grant funded by Government to promote the sustainable and efficient use of energy in the domestic and small business sectors. The trust's national network of Energy Efficient Advice Centres provides advice on domestic efficiency issues.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency has asked the Government to recognise and commit to meeting the need for a significant further increase in funding on a planned basis to (a) improve flood warnings and (b) maintain and improve the overall standard and extent of flood defence. This will be considered through the Spending Review 2002 process. Current plans are for this Department's spending on flood and coastal defences for all operating authorities to increase from last year's outturn of &#163;66 million to &#163;114 million in 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="20227w20.html_para3">Representations have also been received about the methodology governing the economic appraisal of flood defence works.

<P>
<a name="20227w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 This Department has policy responsibility for flood management in England and provides grants for capital works that meet economic, technical and environmental criteria and achieve an appropriate priority score. Operational responsibility rests with the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards who decide which works to promote and their timing. I have encouraged those operating authorities to consider action for areas of the country at highest risk from flooding and coastal erosion. Both DEFRA and the operating authorities have a responsibility to all taxpayers to ensure that value for money is obtained when funding works.
<P>

<a name="20227w20.html_para4">The Environment Agency in its Lessons Learned report following the autumn 2000 floods undertook to use all available information to catalogue the flooding, the local causes and how solutions or responsibility for action can be successfully attributed for the 8,554 properties that were flooded at 795 locations in England.
<P>

<a name="20227w20.html_para5">The agency has now assessed the locations. For many work has been included in maintenance or capital programmes resulting in the repair and improvement of damaged defences. Initially the agency identified some 700 properties (in 100 locations) where it was proving difficult to provide an early practical solution; these were primarily sites where there was flooding of less than 10 properties.
<P>

<a name="20227w20.html_para6">Investigations continue to identify scope for providing flood protection to the remaining properties through flood warnings, communal defences or individual property protection.

 It is not possible to calculate what CAP sterling payments to UK agriculture would have been in each of the last three years had they been based on the ecu rather than the euro. The ecu has not existed in the last three years. Eleven of the 15 currencies from which it was calculated were pegged to the euro throughout that period, and Greece joined subsequently. Since we do not know how those currencies would have fluctuated had the euro not been introduced, we cannot tell what the value of the ecu or any CAP payments linked to it would have been.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to her answer of 12 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 598W, on dioxins, what assessment she has made of where the dioxins emitted to air from an incinerator end up and how long they are likely to remain in the environment.

<P>
<a name="20227w21.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Low levels of dioxins can be detected in all environmental media and, in the UK, the mean levels are currently approximately:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Air (ambient rural)&#151;10 femtograms per cubic metre
<P>
<BR>
Air (ambient urban)&#151;100 femtograms per cubic metre
<P>
<BR>
Soil (rural)&#151;5 nanograms per kilogram
<P>
<BR>
Soil (urban)&#151;30 nanograms per kilogram
<P>
<BR>
River sediments&#151;20 nanograms per kilogram.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20227w21.html_para7">The critical factor for all of these is the concentration in air, which itself is controlled by emissions from primary sources and by complex exchanges/recycling of dioxins with water, soil and vegetation. Dioxin emissions to air from municipal solid waste incinerators contribute less than 1 per cent. of total dioxin emissions, so they currently make only a minor contribution to environmental concentrations.
<P>

<a name="20227w21.html_para8">Dioxins are persistent in the environment and commonly have half-lives in soils and sediments in the order of years, although these will vary between the different compounds and media.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to the answer to the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George), of 4 February 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 748&#150;49W, if there are exceptions to the policy of returning reprocessing wastes arising from contracts with foreign customers back to the country of origin.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 All BNFL's new reprocessing contracts for overseas customers since 1976 have included a provision to return the resulting wastes back to the country of origin. BNFL has proposed that it should be allowed to return an additional amount of high-level waste in substitution for a radiologically equivalent amount of intermediate and low-level waste. This proposal was referred to in the consultation paper "Managing Radioactive Waste Safely" which my Department and the devolved Administrations published in September 2001. Comments were invited on the link between waste substitution and the availability of a long-term management strategy. The consultation paper noted that BNFL is permitted to engage in waste substitution for low-level waste for which an environmentally acceptable disposal route exists.

<P>
<a name="20227w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Exports of UK-produced biungulate meat to EU countries have been possible throughout the foot and mouth disease outbreak, provided the meat was produced in accordance with the conditions set out in Commission Decision 2001/172/EC which introduced export controls on animal products in response to the outbreak. Exports to non-EU countries required the agreement of the importing country in addition to the conditions established under Community law. The requirements set out in the above Decision were in practice very demanding and only very few exports took place under those provisions.
<P>

<a name="20227w23.html_para1">On 7 June 2001, Community restrictions on exports of meat from Northern Ireland were lifted. Thereafter meat produced in Northern Ireland could be exported to other EU Member States without restriction.

On 5 February the European Commission's Standing Veterinary Committee agreed to lift all trade restrictions on the UK related to the FMD outbreak, including the need for export certification. As soon as this change to Community law has been formally adopted, we will reflect it in UK domestic law. This should be very soon. Trade in biungulate meat to EU countries can then resume under pre-FMD conditions. At that point trade with non-EU countries will solely take place on the basis of those countries' own important requirements. The Chief Veterinary Officer has written to non-EU countries informing them of the change to our official status and asking them to remove any conditions or restrictions that they applied because of our FMD outbreak.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Central Office of Information (COI) is funded in two ways. The great majority of its expenditure is recovered as a trading fund by recharging costs incurred to its clients who are all publicly funded bodies. A small element of funding is also received as central vote funding under class xvii vote 4.
<P>

<a name="20227w24.html_para3">Both amounts can be seen in the annual report and accounts published by COI and laid before Parliament each year. The vote funding is shown in an extract of the appropriation account and the funding from charges is represented by the income shown in the income and expenditure account.

<P>
<a name="20227w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The new role of the Chief Executive of the Central Office of Information (COI) as the Government's chief adviser on marketing communications and information campaigns was, as I reported to the House on 5 February 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 862W, a recommendation from a quinquennial review of the COI which was carried out by the Cabinet Office. The Chief Executive remains fully accountable to Cabinet Office Ministers for the work of the Central Office of Information, and they are accountable to Parliament. Individual Departments remain responsible for individual campaigns.

 Individual Government Departments are responsible for taking decisions on the goods and services they acquire, whether through the private finance initiative (PFI) or other procurement routes, taking into account the Government's policy of seeking value for money for the taxpayer.

They are also engaged in initiatives with the BTP to mitigate the effects of ticket touting, for example, by making announcements to customers to ask them not to give their tickets to touts and asking them to report touts to LU staff. Steps have been taken to make ticket purchase far simpler, by introducing phone and internet ticketing facilities and the installation of "Queuebuster" ticket machines at the busiest stations. The development of smartcard technology, being introduced under the Prestige project, should help to make fare evasion more difficult in the future.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make it his policy not to widen the M25 between junctions 12 and 15 within the vicinity of terminal 5.  [36853]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The decision to widen the M25 between Junctions 12 and 15 was made as part of the Roads Review announced in July 1998. This section of road was already severely congested and widening within the existing motorway boundary was considered to be and remains the most appropriate solution. The more recent decision to approve the construction of Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport will necessitate the construction of a new access road (T5 Spur Road) from T5 to the M25 between Junctions 14 and 15. Both sets of improvements can now be designed and constructed at the same time to limit the delays during construction.

 We have given approval to 31 local authorities to run electoral modernisation pilot schemes in this May's local and mayoral elections. We have been careful to ensure that all sectors of the electorate&#151;young and old, and those with physical disabilities including the visually impaired&#151;are not disadvantaged by the new arrangements. Where authorities pilot internet or other online voting techniques, these will be run alongside traditional methods of voting so that a person can choose to vote at the polling station or by postal vote on demand.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he has considered the recommendations of the North West Regional Assembly following completion of the A550/ A5117 Deeside Park Junction Study; and if he will make a statement.  [39373]<P>

<P>
<a name="20227w26.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I have today written to the Leader of the North West Regional Assembly and a copy of this letter has been placed in the House of Commons Library, together with a copy of the Department's Press Notice.
<P>

<a name="20227w26.html_para4">The Deeside Park Junction Study was commissioned by the Government as part of their 10-year Plan for Transport. The study looked at ways to improve safety and congestion on this strategic section of route between the M56 and the Welsh Border.
<P>

<a name="20227w26.html_para5">In my letter to the Assembly I outline my support for the recommendations made by the study. I am pleased to say that the scheme for on line improvements to the route, which includes the grade separation of the three junctions, is to be added to the Targeted Programme of Improvements with immediate effect. I am also encouraging the local authorities to take forward the other study recommendations.
<P>

<a name="20227w26.html_para6">This is good news for motorists in Deeside and North Wales and the improvements will reduce not only congestion and delays but also accidents. This route serves the expanding Deeside Industrial Park and is the main route into North Wales and the Port of Holyhead and these improvements will help the further economic regeneration of the region.

 We are providing &#163;53 million funding for the fire service to give further protection to the public and emergency services in the event of a major chemical, biological or radiological attack. The funding would provide new equipment, including decontamination facilities for members of the public and personal protective equipment for firefighters.

Detailed contingency plans are already in place and responses to a range of different threats, including chemical, biological and radiological, are tested regularly in exercises. This new equipment will further increase the level of preparedness.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w27.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hepburn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what further changes he is intending to make to draft regional planning guidance for the North East about the two proposed strategic employment sites in the broad location of north Sunderland and west of Stockton.  [39607]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w27.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Over 1,000 comments have been received in response to the proposed changes to draft Regional Planning Guidance for the North East (RPG1) which were published in April 2001. In his letter to the Association of North East Councils (ANEC) announcing the publication of the proposed changes, my right hon. Friend the then Minister for Housing and Planning specifically invited views on the proposal to reduce the number of new greenfield strategic employment sites from four to one.
<P>

<a name="20227w27.html_para0">This proposal raised significant objections from the Regional Planning Body, the local authorities, and the Regional Development Agency (One NorthEast). In the light of all the comments received we are proposing to reinstate the proposal for a strategic employment site in the broad location of North of Nissan, Sunderland. There will be strict control of the development of the site which would be promoted as a high quality site to assist in the creation of new business clusters, rather than as originally envisaged to provide a long term reserve solely for large single users. The re-instatement of the site is on the basis that ANEC will progress the proposed employment land review, and re-allocate or de-allocate unsustainable sites as part of the early review to be undertaken in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="20227w27.html_para1">To ensure appropriate development of the site it is proposed that after the precise location of the site has been defined a development brief be prepared. A joint brief may be needed given that the area of search straddles three local planning authorities: Sunderland City Council, Gateshead Council and South Tyneside Metropolitan Borough Council. This should safeguard the site for prestige development of national or regional significance, and ensure that public transport accessibility is maximised. The site boundaries will need to be defined in the relevant unitary development plans.
<P>

<a name="20227w27.html_para2">Whilst the principle of the need for an additional strategic employment site in the Tees Valley is accepted, further work is required to identify more precisely where this should be in the broad area West of Stockton. This proposal should be carried forward as part of the early review of RPG1 in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="20227w27.html_para3">Comments on the proposed further change are being invited over a twelve week period. These will be considered, along with all the representations already received, before RPG1 is finalised later in the year.

Annual costs include rent, rates, utilities and security. The figures relating to the years 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 take account of the fact that Lunar House, Croydon was also vacant pending refurbishment.The increase in the total estimated value of empty properties for years 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 is largely accounted for by the acquisition of property for the purposes of secure training centres by the Youth Justice Board and detention centres by the Immigration Nationality Directorate.

 I assume my hon. Friend's question relates to the potential site for an asylum seeker accommodation centre that has been identified in her constituency. Given the broad range of facilities which will be provided within the accommodation centres and the self-contained nature of the centres, there is not the same need to inquire into local language groups that existed with dispersal to cluster regions as the risk of asylum seekers becoming isolated is greatly reduced.
<P>

<a name="20227w28.html_para5">Information exists on the ethnic make-up of North Lincolnshire and North-east Lincolnshire from the last available census.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w29.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Forming an accurate estimate of the levels of trafficking in people is problematic due to the hidden nature of the act. There are currently no accurate, reliable data in existence within the United Kingdom or the European Union. A Home Office research study "Stopping Traffic" (Police Research Series 125) published in 2000 indicated that although there was intelligence to suggest that some women and children are trafficked into the United Kingdom for the purposes of sexual exploitation, it was impossible to make an accurate assessment of numbers, but that it was likely to be in the range of 140 to 1,400 per annum.

 Effective action against an organised crime, which does not respect borders, requires close co-operation with other countries, particularly with our European Union (EU) partners. The European Council at Tampere set out an agenda for tackling illegal immigration, especially human trafficking. We welcome the progress already made there, including the directive on smuggling and two framework decisions on smuggling and trafficking. We intend to legislate to give effect to the EU directive and framework decision on the facilitation of unauthorised entry, movement and residence when a suitable opportunity arises.

<a name="20227w29.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 As announced in the White Paper "Secure Borders, Safe Haven", we are currently preparing a pilot programme to support victims of exploitation escape their circumstances. Working with the voluntary sector, we will assist people to return home, and ensure that they have the support necessary to ensure that their return is safe and dignified. We envisage that the programme under development will provide initial counselling, and suitable accommodation for victims to return to, which will help them reintegrate into the community and find employment.
<P>

<a name="20227w29.html_para11">We intend to develop a best practice 'toolkit' to help those who deal with illegal immigrants and trafficking victims to distinguish victims in genuine need and to deal with them appropriately. This toolkit will be important for practitioners, chiefly police and immigration officers, who will use it to identify victims and ensure that the right procedures are followed to provide victims with the support and help they need. It will be a comprehensive summary of best practice based on 'what works'.

In addition, employers must pay the cost of special spectacles required where normal ones cannot be used.

<a name="20227w30.html_para5">The minutes of meetings are not published. The Victims Steering Group was formally disbanded at a meeting in November 2001, as it was recognised that the new services for victims in recent years, together with planned developments, required a more proactive, delivery focused national group. Consideration is being given currently to the terms of reference and membership of this replacement body.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how victims are classified for the purposes of the Victims' Charter; and how many victims have utilised the service since its inception, broken down by <i>(a)</i> region and <i>(b)</i> type.  [36999]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w30.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The Victims' Charter applies to all individual victims of theft, burglary, criminal damage, arson, assault, domestic violence, racial harassment, sexual crimes and homicide. It also applies to the parents or carers of child victims of any of these offences, and to the relatives or close friends of homicide victims.
<P>

<a name="20227w30.html_para6">The second version of the Charter, published in 1996, sets out 27 standards of service which victims should expect to receive from individual criminal justice agencies&#151;the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, the courts, the National Probation Service, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, the Prison Service, and Victim Support.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what extra help victims of serious crime have received; how many victims have received extra help <i>(a)</i> per year and <i>(b)</i> broken down by region; and how serious crime is defined in this respect.  [37004]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w30.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Victim Support offer help and support to all victims of crime, and will gauge how much help a victim needs according to the seriousness of the offence and the effect it has had on the victim. Most victims of crime will be automatically referred to Victim Support by the police, unless the victim specifically states he/she does not want this to happen. Victims of serious crimes will only have their details passed to Victim Support with their expressed consent. In this context, serious crimes are defined as sexual offences, domestic violence or homicide.
<P>

<a name="20227w30.html_para8">Information is not collected centrally which lists how many victims have received extra help <i>(a)</i> per year and <i>(b)</i> broken down by region.

<a name="20227w30.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Information is not collected centrally on which agencies have consulted victims; what the subject of the consultation was; or whether the reports are available to the public.
<P>

<a name="20227w30.html_para9">The most significant recent consultation involving victims was a review of the Victims' Charter. A consultation paper was issued on 28 February 2001 seeking views on issues such as a bill of rights for victims, the establishment of a Victims' Ombudsman, and whether victims of road traffic incidents should receive the services provided to victims of crime. The consultation period ended on 15 June 2001, and 120 responses were received, including 49 from individual victims. A summary of responses was placed in the Library and on the Home Office website in July 2001.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w30.html_wqn13"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how victims are informed of the <i>(a)</i> Victims' Charter and <i>(b)</i> Victims' Support Group.  [37000]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w30.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 After reporting a crime, all victims will be given the opportunity, by the police, to be contacted by Victim Support if they so wish. At or about the same time, the "Victims of Crime" leaflet is also issued by the police, and it outlines how Victim Support can be contacted directly. Victims are also made aware of Victim Support through television programmes such as "Crimewatch UK".
<P>

<a name="20227w30.html_para10">The Victims' Charter is available at police stations, at Victim Support Schemes, and from some public libraries and is published on the Home Office website.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w30.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Victim Support is an independent charitable organisation which receives grant aid from the Home Office (&#163;25 million in 2001&#150;02) to provide support to victims of crime and to witnesses.
<P>

<a name="20227w30.html_para11">There is no requirement for Prison Service staff to inform prisoners who allege that they have become victims of crime about the services of Victim Support. However, if a prisoner had a need for such information and sought it from a member of staff, such as his personal officer, probation officer or a health care worker, the information would be provided.
<P>

<a name="20227w30.html_para12">Victim Support advise that they work from a non-judgmental position, and accept that a prisoner can become a victim and thus qualify for their support. Victim Support schemes are accordingly willing to visit prisoners on request and with permission from the prison authorities. They do not collate data on how many prison visits have taken place.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many criminals in prison who are victims of crime <i>(a)</i> have been taken to visit courts before their case is started and <i>(b)</i> have had seats reserved for a friend or relative, broken down by area since inception of the service; and what recent research he has undertaken to examine the link between abused children and their potential to become abusive adults.  [37073]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w30.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The Witness Service, run by the voluntary organisation Victim Support, can arrange pre-trial visits to familiarise victims of crime with the layout of the court and the courtroom. No statistics are collected on how many victims, including those serving prison sentences, take advantage of this opportunity, nor how often seats are reserved for a friend or relative during the trial itself.

One key element of this is to ensure that we can sift out adults posing as children and deter those seeking to abuse the system. Home Office staff are already taking steps to challenge older applicants and divert them to the adult asylum process.
<P>

<a name="20227w32.html_para6">We are exploring opportunities for better sharing of costs across the country and in particular the joint commissioning of accommodation for unaccompanied minors who are 16 or 17 on arrival. We are already doing more to support local authorities by improving information exchange and UASC will be included as part of the asylum audit.

 Detailed statistics are not collected centrally on race-related crimes involving asylum seekers. The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) records the numbers of allegations of racial harassment made by asylum seekers and their dependants in receipt of NASS support. Between May 2000 to December 2001 NASS investigations team recorded 1,159 allegations of racial harassment.
<P>

<a name="20227w32.html_para8">When NASS first learns of such incidents it always ensures that they have been reported to the relevant local police, who have prime responsibility for investigating the allegation. If, following police advice, it is decided that safety or wellbeing of an asylum seeker, who is receiving NASS support, is in any doubt NASS would arrange to move that person to alternative accommodation while the case is under investigation.
<P>

<a name="20227w32.html_para9">If an asylum seeker does not wish to report allegations of harassment to the police, they can do so through their solicitor who can make a report on their behalf, or an asylum seeker can report the incident to their landlord. Alternatively, there are voluntary organisations with whom an asylum seeker can report and discuss their concerns. The voluntary organisation would then liaise with NASS as regards further action.

<a name="20227w33.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 There have been numerous wide- ranging initiatives in England to raise the public's awareness of the shortage of organs for transplantation. The Department runs a public information campaign with a current annual budget of &#163;900,000. A public information leaflet incorporating the organ donor card is widely distributed, and is also available through the Organ Donor Literature line. The campaign is further enhanced by securing free TV airtime for short public information films, a campaign website and partnerships and arrangements with the DVLA, the Passport Agency, rotarian clubs, Boots the Chemist and some banks who have chosen organ donation as a cause to support.
<P>

<a name="20227w33.html_para3">The Department runs a special campaign to raise awareness among members of the Asian Community. This includes short TV films featuring well known Asian personalities and leaflets in various languages. Awareness is also raised by maintaining a presence at cultural and religious events, and by facilitation of debate on this issue at forums set up within Asian communities. Phase three of this campaign was launched in September this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w33.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Preliminary information available from regions of the position at the end of December, indicates that around 80 per cent. of the nursing homes with residents eligible for National Health Service funded nursing care had had their residents' needs for care determined by a registered nurse. The majority of the remaining assessments were completed by the end of January.
<P>

<a name="20227w33.html_para6">Around 99 per cent. of people in nursing homes whose needs have been determined have been found to be eligible.

 No such allocation of dedicated funding has been made. The programme of action provided by the National Service Framework for Older People to address the issues of age discrimination is centred on giving older people fair access to all services. This is regardless of age, on the basis of clinical need in the national health service, and in social care services by ending the use of age in eligibility criteria to restrict access to available services. Older people as the major users of health and social care services will benefit from increased levels of funding over the coming years, building on the announcements in the NHS Plan.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w34.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Employees working on job-share contracts are recorded as "part-time" workers. It is therefore not possible to identify the number of staff employed on a job-share contract, as the figures do not differentiate between those actually employed part-time and those employed specifically on a job-share contract.

 The Department does not hold any data specifically on the number of reported cases of work related stress. While the Department collects data on sickness absence, which includes stress, it is not possible to identify if the cause of the 'stress related illness' was work related. It is not possible, therefore, to identify costs.

 All Accident and Emergency Departments have the capability to provide thrombolysis for patients suffering from heart attacks and the vast majority provides this treatment. In a very small number of trusts, arrangements for the management of patients with heart attacks include rapid admission to Coronary Care Units for thrombolysis rather than treatment in the Accident and Emergency Department.

<P>
<a name="20227w35.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 There are two levels of access to over the counter medicines. General sale list medicines are available from a range of retail outlets. Pharmacy medicines are available from pharmacies. As part of national health service arrangements medicines may be administered or supplied by a range of professional staff or prescribed by doctors, dentists and some nurses. Depending on the circumstances, prescribed medicines can be dispensed by hospital or community pharmacies or by dispensing doctors. There are restrictions on the types of medicines which most professional staff may administer, supply or prescribe, some of which arise from legislation under the Medicines Act, and some of which are specific to the NHS.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make it his policy that a change to the procedures for the reclassification of medicines from prescription-only to pharmacy sale will not remove availability by way of the NHS medicines reclassified for over-the-counter availability.  [36294]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w35.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The NHS Plan committed the Government to making more medicines available over the counter and therefore giving people a greater choice in their treatment and empowering patients to manage their care with the help of skilled health care staff. However, before a medicine is made more widely available, it is assessed against strict criteria relating to its safety in the circumstances in which it will be used. The policy is to improve access to a range of medicines without affecting their availability on the national health service, unless there are existing restrictions on NHS availability.

 All health authorities have in place dentistry action plans aimed at meeting the Government's dental access pledge. These action plans identify local issues and develop solutions. Over the last two financial years the Government have allocated &#163;10 million from the Dental Care Development Fund and the Dentistry Action Plan Fund to support local plans to improve access. This money enables health authorities to assist dentists seeking to set up new practices and to expand and modernise existing ones. For the future dentistry will be included in the local improvement finance trust scheme. This will provide locally focused support for the establishment of new national health service practice facilities.

 As of 26 February, seven patients had undergone knee replacement surgery in the Lutherhaus Hospital in Essen and the Eduardus Krankenhaus in Cologne under a contract between West Sussex Health authority and Germedic.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what reporting regime exists for incidents where the anaesthetic breathing system is believed to have <i>(a)</i> been blocked and <i>(b)</i> malfunctioned.  [36263]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20227w36.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Medical Devices Agency (MDA), an executive agency of the Department, currently operates two systems for reporting adverse incidents involving medical devices.
<P>

<a name="20227w36.html_para6">Incidents involving blocked or malfunctioning breathing system components should be reported to the MDA by health care professionals or the National Health Service through the user reporting system or, if the report comes from a manufacturer, through the agency's vigilance reporting system.
<P>

<a name="20227w36.html_para7">At the beginning of each year, the MDA publishes advice in the form of a safety notice to health care professionals to encourage them to report adverse incidents and to outline how to do so. MDA's website also provides advice on reporting incidents involving medical equipment, together with reporting forms and an online reporting facility.
<P>

<a name="20227w36.html_para8">MDA liaison officers have been appointed for each health authority, NHS trust and social services department in England (also for the majority of primary care trusts) with a dual role of raising awareness of the need for incident reporting and secondly to ensure that any safety advice issued by MDA is disseminated within their organisation to those who need to know.
<P>

<a name="20227w36.html_para9">The mandatory scheme for reporting adverse incidents relating to medical devices, often termed vigilance reporting, is an obligation laid upon all European Member States via the Medical Devices Directives. These Directives have been implemented in United Kingdom law via the Consumer Protection Act which places statutory obligations on manufacturers to report incidents which led to, or could have led to, death or serious injury.

<a name="20227w36.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 After discussion with the Essex police I am able to make the following statement.
<P>

<a name="20227w36.html_para10">A police investigation commenced with the tragic death of Tony Clowes at Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford on 18 July 2001. Further incidents involving blocked anaesthetic breathing equipment components came to light and a linked enquiry was launched headed by Essex Police under the name Orcadian.
<P>

<a name="20227w36.html_para11">The basis of the enquiry and the linking process was to look for a common factor. As the enquiry progressed a number of other incidents were reported from a number of sources, including patients who felt they may have been involved in an incident in the past. Some manufacturing faults were also reported.
<P>

<a name="20227w36.html_para12">In many cases the information available is, or was, very scant. There have been difficulties in obtaining accurate accounts and records for incidents that are historic and 



<P>
<P><I>27 Feb 2002 : Column 1416W</I><P>
which may not have been considered significant at the time. Some of the incidents involved date back to the late 1980s.
<P>

<a name="20227w36.html_para13">During the course of the investigation, experiments were carried out which showed that a blockage could be replicated whilst the items were in storage. This finding changed the focus of the enquiry from 'whom' to 'how'.
<P>

<a name="20227w36.html_para14">To date no common factor has been found although the enquiry is still ongoing.
<P>

<a name="20227w36.html_para15">Orcadian has been a joint enquiry involving nine police forces and the close co-operation of the National Health Service, Health and Safety Executive and the Department of Health.
<P>

<a name="20227w36.html_para16">The Medical Devices Agency (MDA) has assisted the police by providing Orcadian with advice on breathing systems and their use. Since the enquiry began, the MDA has published three Hazard Notices to advise and alert users to related safety issues as they have emerged from the police enquiry.
<P>

<a name="20227w36.html_para17">It is difficult to predict at this stage when Orcadian will be concluded.

<a name="20227w36.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Medical Devices Agency (MDA) report that there are three main ways in which anaesthetic breathing system components can become blocked. These are: manufacturing problems; user error; and possible tampering.

 There are currently no plans to stop the use of glutaraldehyde in hospitals in England. National Health Service employers are already to give priority to preventing their employees being exposed to glutaraldehyde by inhalation, ingestion or skin contact under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1994.

 The Department funds the National Drugs Helpline to provide information, advice and support to anyone concerned about substance misuse. The helpline provides a range of information about date rape drugs, including their effects, risks and referral to local agencies that offer support. This service is free and confidential, and is open 24 hours a day.
<P>

<a name="20227w38.html_para0">The Department also funds Drugscope, an organisation that provides information on all aspects of drug policies and problems, including information on prevention and safety issues for people who feel that they may be affected by date rape drugs.

 Area child protection committees are inter-agency forums for agreeing how the different services and professional groups should co-operate to safeguard children in their area. They are not statutory bodies, but are accountable for their work to their main constituent agencies. They are therefore not accountable to any Secretary of State. Each local authority with social services responsibility should take lead responsibility for the establishment and effective working of ACPCs. Local authorities are ultimately accountable to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health in respect of their social services functions.

 The Department conducted a survey of sickness absence, accidents and violence in national health service trusts in England in 1998&#150;99. The survey found that there were approximately 65,000 violent incidents against NHS trust staff recorded each year. Figures for each individual NHS ambulance trust are shown in the table. A further survey of recorded violent incidents in 2000&#150;01 has been conducted, and the figures are currently being analysed by the Department.
<P>

<a name="20227w38.html_para1">Information on levels of sickness absence resulting from violence at work is not collected centrally, but may be held at a local level by individual national health service employers. The average sickness absence rate for staff directly employed by NHS ambulance trusts in 1999 was 6.6 per cent.
