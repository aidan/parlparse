 Roads with concrete surfaces such as the A50 at Doveridge are surveyed at regular intervals and any deterioration that is identified is used to prepare and prioritise appropriate maintenance works. The present condition of the surface of the A50 Doveridge bypass does not suggest a need for resurfacing for the foreseeable future, so no scheme is currently, programmed. Estimates of cost of any such scheme would only be made once work is programmed.</p>

 On 12 June 2006 my right hon. Friends, the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced new sustainable operations targets for the Government Estate. The new targets include a specific commitment on energy:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="70309w0001.htm_para1"><a name="07030958000164">Government Departments are mandated within the new targets to source at least 10 per cent. of electricity from renewables (such as wind, wave, tidal, solar, thermal and photovoltaics (PV&#146;s)) by March 2008* and at least 15 per cent. of electricity from Combined Heat and Power (2010). These targets are a continuation of an existing operations targets, originally set in 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="70309w0001.htm_para2"><a name="07030958000165">In 2005-06 (the latest data available) the Department sourced 66.47 per cent. of its electricity from renewable sources. 10 per cent. of our electricity was sourced from Good Quality Heat and Power during the same period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="70309w0001.htm_para3"><a name="07030958000166">In order to improve further, the Department has commissioned a report to evaluate its plans for meeting this target across the estate and gain an estimate of their impact in terms of CO<sup>(2)</sup> reductions.

 The report on the second review of the Government&#146;s Road Safety Strategy was published on 26 February. That includes proposals for a fundamental review of the way the training of new drivers is approached so that it is more relevant to today&#146;s conditions and roads. The aim is to produce drivers who can drive safely in the broadest sense, not just know how to control a car, and how that can provide the basis for lifelong learning. There will be a consultation in due course. The review is available on-line at:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="70309w0001.htm_para4"><a name="07030958000169">The last time the issue of a minimum learning period was considered was in the Department's consultation &#147;Introducing a structured approach to learning to drive&#148; of March 2002&#151;available at:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="70309w0001.htm_para5"><a name="07030958000170">The decision in 2004 following that consultation was not to require a minimum learning period. Requiring such a period is no guarantee that it would be used as intended. In addition there was evidence that it was taking longer to learn to drive anyway following the strengthening of the driving test. Research has found that learners take on average 11 months of learning before passing the test.</p>

<i> [holding answer 6 March 2007]</i>: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates the total impact of aviation on climate change to be 2-4 times that of its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions alone. The Government have consistently called for both the CO2 and non-CO2 impacts of aviation to be addressed to the extent that is possible. For an international industry, an international trading scheme is the best solution and we are therefore pursuing this in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). However, we recognise that the need for consensus among the participating states in ICAO means progress will take time, and until a truly global solution can be found, including aviation CO2 emissions in the EU ETS represents the best multilateral option available.</p>

However <i> The Guardian</i> refused to undertake not to publish. Accordingly lawyers acting for the Attorney-General&#146;s office, at the request of the police, sought an injunction to restrain publication of the material. Mrs. Justice Swift declined to grant such an injunction, on the grounds that during the hearing of the application itself the newspapers were printed and were being distributed.</p>

 The number of young people receiving treatment as a result of alcohol misuse is a matter for concern. The Government are determined to reduce the harm caused by alcohol to those under 18 and to young people generally and is committed to educating young people, for example through the Know Your Limits campaign, the Healthy Schools Programme and the Teen Life Check, on the very real harm it causes. It is vital that we make children and young people aware of sensible drinking messages. This will be an important issue for consideration when the alcohol harm reduction strategy is reviewed during 2007.</p>

5. Data quality: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
6. Ungrossed data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

 When the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published their technology appraisal on liquid based cytology (LBC) in October 2003, we estimated that it would take five years for full implementation across the national health service as all staff who take and read cervical screening samples have to be retrained in the new technique.</p>

This will mean that around 300,000 women a year will not have to go through the anxiety and discomfort of being retested, and the NHS will not have to use resources to undertake these tests.</p>

Not all the schemes submitted affect community hospitals as the intention of the programme is to support any capital scheme that delivers care in settings that are more convenient for patients, this includes for example one stop primary care centres and healthy living parks. A number of the schemes create new facilities that do not affect existing community hospitals.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the problem was which was identified on the routine audit of the North London Breast Screening Service and which resulted in its suspension; how long she expects the temporary suspension to last; what estimate she has made of the number of women affected by the suspension; how many women per month are normally seen by the service; what plans she is putting in place to clear the backlog; how long she expects the backlog to take to clear; what steps are being taken to resolve the issue which caused the suspension; what estimate she has made of the additional financial costs resulting from the suspension of the system and the steps necessary to resolve the problem; and if she will make a statement.

 This is a local matter. However, I understand that the temporary suspension was due to system process errors that were discovered during a routine audit by the quality assurance service. The audit flagged up that women were not invited for further assessments following their mammogram. All the women affected received a normal mammogram. However, the women had mentioned other possible symptoms during their appointment and guidelines specify that further assessment should take place. All these women have been offered appointments for further assessment either from the unit or via their general practitioner.</p>

Once this is complete they will be able to advise on estimates. It will also depend on whether arrangements can be made to screen women at other sites across London and the surrounding area.
