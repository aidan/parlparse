 There have been a very small number of instances during the last 12 months where tendering exercises have been cancelled prior to the award of the contract and thereby costs have been incurred with no contract awarded.

Our consultation paper notes that the total amount of housing debt held by councils under self-financing could be higher or lower than the current level of debt supported through the HRA subsidy system. The debt allocated to each council would be set at a level which it could support within a sustainable business plan which delivers the extra investment we have identified is needed (including an average 24 per cent. increase in funding for major repairs) while continuing to set social rents in line with national policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_486"><a name="91110w0009.htm_para1"><a name="09111066001090">The aggregate amount of housing debt allocated under self-financing will depend on a range of variables in addition to assumptions on annual management, maintenance and repairs. These include rent levels, interest rates, the pricing of risk and the funding of the backlog of repairs. As work on assessing these issues has not yet been completed, I am not in a position to estimate the amount of debt under the new system and ministers have not had discussions on this issue with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I am however clear that the additional spending on management, maintenance and major repairs which we have committed to fund as part of our reforms will mean that all councils are better off under self-financing than they would be if the current system continued unreformed.</p>

 The Defence Clothing Team (DCT) provides a range of environmental clothing, including boots, to meet both summer and winter deployments. All armed forces personnel receive a deployment pack, commonly known as the 'black bag' worth &#163;3,000, which provides sufficient clothing and personal equipment to carry out combat operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_508"><a name="91110w0011.htm_para0"><a name="09111070000155">The 'black bag' includes a warm weather sleeping bag for use in the summer conditions found in Afghanistan. In addition, troops are issued a temperate sleeping bag as part of their standard kit issue. Experience has shown the temperate sleeping bag to be capable in temperatures down to around -30°C. Clothing and sleeping bags are designed to be used as layered systems in order to achieve the desired protection and will not work as effectively if not worn as a system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_509"><a name="91110w0011.htm_para1"><a name="09111070000156">Additionally, those personnel who are in Afghanistan during the colder months receive extra equipment in their deployment pack, such as 'softee' thermal jackets and trousers, cold weather socks, gloves, headwear, windproof trousers and jackets and cold weather boots. This is the equipment used by our commando forces in Arctic terrain. When worn with the CS95 ensemble, this equipment provides suitable environmental protection for the cold weather temperatures that occur in the winters in Afghanistan.</p>

 MOD fully supports the need for high quality research which examines the mental health of service personnel and veterans.

Many of their findings have already been published in the peer-reviewed medical literature, including major pieces of work published in 2006. Within KCMHR, the Academic Centre for Defence Mental Health (ACDMH) has been established as an in-house mental health research resource which is looking into a variety of smaller scale aspects of dealing with the mental health of service personnel.</p>

Psychiatry 2009, 9:68). This concluded that the rate of common mental disorders in the sample was 27.2 per cent.; this figure is in keeping with a substantial review of European adults, carried out in 2005, that also found 27 per cent. suffered with a common mental disorder. This study confirmed previous findings which show that depression and alcohol abuse are the most common mental disorders in the UK military, not post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as previously assumed by some commentators. The paper&#146;s results support MOD&#146;s provision of a compressive mental health service rather than a service which is overly focussed on treating PTSD.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_523"><a name="91110w0011.htm_para15"><a name="09111070000250">Research commissioned from other academic institutions includes an investigation by Manchester university into the levels of suicide amongst those leaving the UK armed forces over the period 1996-2005, compared with matched personnel remaining in service and the general population. This work was published in the peer-reviewed journal Public Library of Science (PloS) Medicine in March 2009. The results showed that overall rates of suicide of those who left were little different from the equivalent serving or civilian general populations. We also commissioned research into Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) from Royal Holloway and University College London, comparing immediate and delayed onset PTSD in military veterans. The study looked at clinical course, symptoms, risk factors, stressors and disabling effects; we understand its findings will be published in peer reviewed literature shortly.</p>

We shall continue to support well-founded research into these issues, to inform our policies to provide care for those whose mental health has been affected by serving in the armed forces.</p>

 There is always a balance to be struck in allocating equipment to meet both operational and training needs. When new equipment is introduced into service, the Department's priority is to ensure that sufficient quantities are available for training to enable operators to meet basic qualification standards prior to their deployment. This must be balanced with the requirement to get equipment into theatre as quickly as possible so that troops can benefit from the additional capability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_532"><a name="91110w0013.htm_para2"><a name="09111070000610">We recognise that achieving this balance can mean that it takes longer to establish a sufficient pool of equipment fully to meet the training requirement. In such cases, the training pool is managed in a way that ensures operators have as much experience of the equipment as possible before they deploy. If necessary, this training will be supplemented after individuals arrive in theatre. Where troops already in theatre are provided with newly introduced equipment, specialist training teams will deploy to ensure the equipment operators get the training they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_533"><a name="91110w0013.htm_para3"><a name="09111070000611">The quantities of equipment available for pre-deployment training continue to improve. For example the numbers of Jackal and Ridgback vehicles in the training pool increased by 50 per cent. between July and October this year.

 The decision to deliver the future helicopter search and rescue (SAR-H) service from nine full-time and three part-time (12-hour, daytime only) bases continues to ensure our ability to reach all &#147;very high&#148;, &#147;high&#148; and 75 per cent. of &#147;medium&#148; risk areas within one hour of take off. This decision has no day-time impact on the expected SAR-H demands on RNAS Culdrose. RNAS Culdrose is likely to be the first alternative responder to night-time incidents for one &#147;medium&#148; risk area that RMB Chivenor currently provides lead cover for RAF Valley and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency site at Lee on Solent will provide cover for other areas. Cover to this area will remain within the required one hour response time.</p>

This means that the possibility of virus transmission through blood products is likely now to be rare, but it is not possible to completely eliminate infection risk. One case of variant Cretzfeldt-Jakob disease infection in a haemophilia patient was reported in February 2009.

These figures may include occasional minor spend through COI by NHS organisations, to supplement national campaigns in their area.

 Each national health service body has a duty to address the risks to staff and ensure their safety. The NHS Security Management Service (NHS SMS) can assist employers through guidance on assessing risks and acting to protect staff from attacks and, where incidents do occur, on taking action against offenders.</p>

Consultation on guidance on the use of the powers took place between May and August and commencement of these provisions is due later this year. The NHS SMS will provide free training for NHS staff who will use the power of removal.</p>

1. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)&#151;An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. It should be noted that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
2. Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)&#151;The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital. <sup>(1)</sup>The ICD-10 codes used in this analysis were as follows:<br>
C45 Mesothelioma;<br>
D19 Benign neoplasm of mesothelial tissue<br>
3. Assessing growth through time&#151;HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
4. PCT and SHA Data Quality&#151;PCT and SHA data were added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of Treatment and SHA of Treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup><i>  Discharges:</i><br>
A discharge episode is the last episode during a hospital stay (a spell), where the patient is discharged from the hospital (this includes transfer to another hospital). Discharge episodes have been included as it is here that 'died in hospital' events are recorded. For a small proportion of hospital stays the diagnosis on admission may not be present on the discharge episode hence the difference in counts between admission and discharge episodes.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup><i>  Deaths:</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data cannot be used to determine the cause of death of a patient while in hospital. Deaths recorded on the HES database may be analysed by the main diagnosis for which the patient was being treated during their stay in hospital, which may not necessarily be the underlying cause of death. For example, a patient admitted for a hernia operation (with a primary diagnosis of hernia) may die from an unrelated heart attack. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) collects information on the cause of death, wherever it occurs, based on the death certificate and should be the source of data for analyses on cause of death.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup><i>  Primary Diagnosis:</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup><i>  Secondary Diagnosis:</i><br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
<sup>(6)</sup><i> Assessing growth through time:</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Data quality:</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

 There were 154 active suspensions and exclusions at the end of 2008-09. The end-of-year numbers fluctuate without a clear upward or downward trend. It is not possible to estimate the current cost of such suspensions.

The NAO&#146;s hospital and community weekly cost estimate was therefore &#163;4,000 at 2001-02 prices.

</td></tr></tbody><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="7"><sup>(1)</sup><i> Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)</i><br>
A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. It should be noted that the figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup><i> Number of episodes with a (named) main or secondary procedure</i><br>
These figures represent the number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and four prior to 2002-03) operative procedure fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one operative procedure field of the record. It should be noted that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure. For example, patients under going a &#145;cataract operation&#146; would tend to have at least two procedures&#151;removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one&#151;counted in a single episode.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup><i> Ungrossed data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<sup>(4)</sup><i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup><i> Changes to coding classifications: OPCS-4</i><br>
Operative procedure codes were revised for 2006-07 and 2007-08. The 2008-09 and 2007-08 data uses OPCS 4.4 codes, 2006-07 data uses OPCS 4.3 codes, data prior to 2006-07 uses OPCS 4.2 codes. All codes that were in OPCS 4.2 remain in later OPCS 4 versions, however the introduction of OPCS 4.3 codes enable the recording of interventions and procedures which were not possible in OPCS 4.2. In particular, OPCS 4.3 and OPCS 4.4 codes include high cost drugs and diagnostic imaging, testing and rehabilitation. Some activity may have been coded under different codes in OPCS 4.2. These changes need to be borne in mind when analysing time series and may explain some apparent variations over time. Please note that care needs to be taken in using the newer codes as some providers of data were unable to start using the new codes at the beginning of each data year. More information about OPCS 4 changes is on the Connecting for Health website:<br>
www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk<br>
<sup>(6)</sup><i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>

 Our proposals for self-financing would put every local authority in a position to sustain their homes from their own revenues in future, ending the need to redistribute income by means of a one-off reallocation of housing debt. Our consultation paper notes that the total amount of housing debt held by councils under self-financing could be higher or lower than the current level of debt supported through the HRA subsidy system. The debt allocated to each council would be set at a level which it could support within a sustainable business plan which delivers the extra investment we have identified is needed (including an average 24 per cent. increase in funding for major repairs) while continuing to set social rents in line with national policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_615"><a name="91110w0022.htm_para15"><a name="09111081000426">The aggregate amount of housing debt allocated under self-financing will depend on a range of variables in addition to assumptions on annual management, maintenance and repairs. These include rent levels, interest rates, the pricing of risk and the funding of the backlog of repairs. As work on assessing these issues has not yet been completed, I am not in a position to estimate the amount of debt under the new system and Ministers have not had discussions on this issue with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I am however clear that the additional spending on management, maintenance and major repairs which we have committed to fund as part of our reforms will mean that all councils are better off under self-financing than they would be if the current system continued unreformed.</p>

 Under the homelessness legislation (part 7 of the Housing Act 1996), local housing authorities in England must consider all applications for accommodation or assistance in obtaining accommodation, including any applications made by people accommodated in refuges for people who have suffered domestic violence. The local authority must consider whether there is reason to believe the applicant may be homeless or likely to become homeless within 28 days, and, if there is such reason, must make inquiries to determine whether any duty is owed under the legislation.

 Homeowners Mortgage Support is part of the range of assistance available at every stage to households struggling with their mortgage. The scheme encourages lenders to allow households who have suffered a temporary income shock to defer some of their interest payment, if this is necessary to make their monthly payment affordable. This form of support provides a safety net for those who cannot avoid repossession in other ways.</p>

 Safeguards are in place that enable local authorities to make payments of the local housing allowance to landlords in circumstances where tenants are likely to have difficulty in managing their rent payments.

 Jobseeker's Allowance is paid at a lower rate to single people under 25 as the majority of 16 to 24 year-olds do not live independently and may legitimately be regarded as having lower living costs than those aged 25 and over. In addition, lower benefit rates for young people reflect the realities of the labour market where earnings tend to increase with age.

1. Data are unrounded, and not seasonally adjusted.<br>
2. The Jobcentre Plus data does not cover the whole UK economy. Coverage relates just to vacancies notified to Jobcentre Plus and as such represent a market share of vacancies throughout the whole economy. This proportion varies over time, according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer, and by local area. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>
3. The stocks of live unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br>

In 2002, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) used one such survey to estimate the proportion of total vacancies advertised at jobcentres at 44 per cent. Allowing for sampling variation, the ratio was likely to be in the range of around a third to a half. However, this estimate is likely to have changed over time.</p>

1. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)&#151;An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. It should be noted that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
2. Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)&#151;The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital. <sup>(1)</sup>The ICD-10 codes used in this analysis were as follows:<br>
C45 Mesothelioma;<br>
D19 Benign neoplasm of mesothelial tissue<br>
3. Assessing growth through time&#151;HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
4. PCT and SHA Data Quality&#151;PCT and SHA data were added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of Treatment and SHA of Treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>
5. Northumberland, Tyne and Wear SHA and County Durham and Tees Valley SHA combined to form the North East SHA in 2006-07.<br>

 I have not received any representations from representatives of small businesses about the fees charged by insolvency consultants and lawyers. I would suggest that anyone seeking professional advice should always seek to establish the possible costs involved.</p>

The amendments also make it clearer how to challenge such expenses.</p>

 Based on bottom-up company data, Innovas estimated that in 2007-08 there were 880,000 jobs in the UK Low Carbon and Environmental Goods and Services Sector (LCEGS).</p>

There will be a range of opportunities at all skills levels across the economy.</p>

<i> [holding answer 2 November 2009]:</i> President Mugabe&#146;s policies prior to the formation of the power-sharing government in February 2009 had a disastrous impact on Zimbabwe. They also had, and continue to have, ramifications for the region more widely. Zimbabwe&#146;s economic collapse has lowered investor confidence across the entire region, reduced regional growth, and triggered political and economic migration leading to increased pressure on services and inter-communal tensions in receiving countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_776"><a name="91110w0035.htm_para13"><a name="09111081002210">Since the formation of the inclusive government in February, Finance Minister Biti has worked hard to stabilise the economy, increase revenue generation to allow the payment of salaries to the civil service, and improve public finance management. Much remains to be done to restore investor confidence in Zimbabwe, including by reforming the Central Bank. We commend the progress so far, and urge Zimbabwe to implement fully the economic reform envisaged in the Global Political Agreement.</p>

 The majority of people who drink enjoy alcohol sensibly. We are however determined to take action to reduce the levels of crime and disorder caused by those who don't. This includes commencing drink banning orders (DBO) on application on 31 August 2009 to allow the police and local authorities to crack down on those who commit criminal or disorderly behaviour while under the influence of alcohol; earlier this year we spent &#163;3 million on targeted enforcement activities in over 190 areas, as well as a further &#163;1.5 million on enforcement campaigns in our top 50 priority areas. This summer we launched a &#163;1.5 million partnership support programme in our top 50 priority areas to specifically target public perceptions of drunk or rowdy behaviour by ensuring that local people's concerns are being acted upon and the results are made known to the local communities.</p>

We are now running a further series of two-day alcohol-enforcement training seminars in our 50 priority areas aimed at magistrates, courts officials, elected members who sit on licensing committees and operational police officers. To support these seminars we have recently published a comprehensive guide for delivery partners on alcohol-enforcement tools and powers and we have developed a digital resource pack, which has recently gone live.</p>

 The UK Border Agency is unable to identify from its records those visa applicants who wished to visit the UK for the specific purpose of speaking in mosques. There has been provision in the Immigration Rules since November 2008 for non-EEA nationals who wish to undertake some preaching or pastoral work in the UK to enter as business visitors. While the agency keeps a record of those applying for entry in this category, the category is open to applicants of all faiths and the agency cannot therefore identify Moslem applicants from others. The agency is also unable to identify from its records of visit visa applications prior to November 2008 those that were made for religious purposes.</p>

<i> [holding answer 2 November 2009]:</i> The Independent Schools Standards (England) Regulations 2003, as amended, require that proprietors of independent schools must have a criminal background check conducted to confirm their suitability. In common with all other independent schools the CRB check on the proprietor of the two Islamic Shakhsiyah Foundation schools in Haringey and Slough has been undertaken. Beyond this the proprietor must ensure that the school meets all the requirements of the regulations including the quality of the teaching, the spiritual moral, social and cultural development of pupils and the welfare, health and safety of pupils. Ofsted conducts regular inspections against these standards and any failings are taken up with the school to ensure they are put right.</p>

In terms of free entitlement funding the Department sets the framework for how this is distributed in the statutory code of practice. All settings must meet Early Years Foundation Stage requirements. It is for local authorities to decide whether providers meet the criteria, and are therefore suitable to receive funding for the free entitlement.</p>

 The recommendation to change the date of the key stage 2 tests was made by the Expert Group on Assessment, set up by the Secretary of State to advise on the future of testing and assessment across the key stages. The group took into account a range of stakeholder&#146;s views including schools, local authorities, academics, social partners and others. The Government accepted the group&#146;s recommendations in full in May 2009. The Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA) is currently consulting schools, local authorities (LAs) and other interested stakeholders on the date of the 2011 tests.</p>

 We do not expect the change of timing for the National Curriculum tests to have any major effect on opportunities for learning outside the classroom in the summer term. Activities should not, and need not, be left to the summer months. For it to be truly effective, learning outside the classroom should take place on a regular basis and be informed by what teachers want learners to achieve. We know schools recognise the importance of ensuring every child has access to learning beyond the classroom as such experiences excite young people, deepen their understanding of classroom subjects, and help develop their own mechanisms for identifying and managing risk. Learning outside the classroom is vital to make young people independent, confident and self-reliant.</p>

Therefore a new school will have a registration number before it is funded. The focus of inspection is on outcomes for pupils and the school needs to be operating before that can be assessed, therefore maintained schools do receive funding prior to being inspected.</p>

This information includes the recent series of reports on school behaviour from Sir Alan Steer, school inspection evidence from Ofsted and a range of surveys conducted by our partners, including teacher professional associations and the National Audit Office. In 2007/08, Ofsted judged that behaviour in 93 per cent. of primary and 72 per cent. of secondary schools was good or outstanding. On 30 September 2009 the Government launched a new Behaviour Challenge to local authorities and schools, making clear our ambition that by 2012 all schools will either have a good or outstanding Ofsted rating on behaviour, or be on track to reach one at their next inspection. The Behaviour Challenge will ensure delivery of the guarantee we made in the White Paper on 21st Century Schools earlier this year that all schools will have good behaviour, strong discipline, order and safety.</p>

 The National Evaluation of Sure Start report The Impact of Sure Start Local Programmes on Three Year Olds and Their Families', was published in March 2008. This report found a number of positive impacts for children in Sure Start Local Programme (SSLP) areas. Parents of three-year-old children showed less negative parenting while providing their children with a better home learning environment. Three-year-old children areas had better social development with higher levels of positive social behaviour and independence/self-regulation than children in similar areas not having a SSLP. Families living in SSLP areas used more child- and family-related services than those living elsewhere. The effects associated with SSLPs appeared to apply to all of the resident population sub groups assessed, including those on low incomes.</p>

These providers have also been informed that they have a limited time to secure improvement, before the next inspection as further cuts will be initiated. Given the provider&#146;s track record, the TDA would review (taking regional and other factors into account) whether to continue allocating places to any provider which fails to achieve improvement.</p>
