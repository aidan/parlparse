 We deploy British military engineers on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to conduct close engineer support (such as mobility support, counter mobility support, explosive ordnance disposal, boat support, and search) and general engineer support (such as infrastructure development, construction, geographic support, and civil-military cooperation). We cannot provide the total number of engineering personnel deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan for each year since 2001 as these records are not held centrally and cannot be provided without disproportionate cost. We can, however, provide the details of the main engineering units deployed to Iraq since 2003 and Afghanistan since 2006. In addition to these units, there are also Royal Navy/Royal Marine, Army and Royal Air Force Engineers deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan undertaking maintenance tasks in support of both rotary and fixed wing aircraft and vehicle squadrons.</p>

 No specific research has been commissioned into these techniques and none is needed. The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate licence conditions for the Atomic Weapons Establishment demand that appropriate safety cases are generated as a matter of routine in the evaluation of risk. Deterministic and probabilistic risk assessments are tools employed in defining and ranking the postulated hazards. The use of such risk assessment techniques is considered best practice within the nuclear industry. Their use by AWE plc is regularly benchmarked against&#151;and compares favourably with&#151;other nuclear operators.</p>

The proposals included supplementing the existing set of indicators with four newly available indicators that measure outcomes recognisable by local residents or vulnerable people. It was also proposed to remove four indicators (where there are issues with data availability, data quality or national consistency) and replace three indicators with more meaningful measures of performance. These represent only a small proportion of the total number of indicators; in 2006 there were 31 indicators included in the environment service assessment, 20 in housing and 18 in culture.</p>

This sunset clause was introduced by amendment in the Commons in response to concerns of the Local Government Association that the Secretary of State&#146;s power to direct would otherwise be too wide. The Secretary of State may therefore only issue a direction under clause 2 from after the enactment and commencement of Part 1 of the Bill (likely to be November 2007) up until 25 January 2008.</p>

in 2005). Also, the stock of available brownfield land is not static as new sites are coming forward for development all the time. Historically, studies to provide a comprehensive technical analysis of London's potential for future housing growth have been the responsibility of the Mayor of London, or predecessor body, and the boroughs. Regular studies have been undertaken, namely London's Housing Capacity (Greater London Authority, September 2000) and the 2004 London Housing Capacity Study (GLA, July 2005). As a result, housing targets for London have recently been increased, from 23,000 homes per year to 2006-07, to 30,500 homes per year from 2007-08.</p>

On this occasion, as announced by the Prime Minister on 7 July, 100 per cent. grant will be paid on expenditure in excess of 0.2 per cent. of the authority's revenue budget, an increase on the normal 85 per cent. grant aid.

Instead key workers access our New Build HomeBuy programme as a priority group alongside other priorities such as social tenants. Any key worker specific schemes yet to complete will have been funded under old shared ownership programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="70903w0018.htm_para5"><a name="07090420002198">In addition to the numbers in the table above, we have helped 4,982 key workers in London through our KWL Open Market HomeBuy scheme and 4,168 key workers in London through the Starter Home Initiative (SHI). SHI was the predecessor to KWL and ran from 2001-2004. The majority of SHI completions were as Open Market HomeBuy, with a small number of newly built units that were grant funded via an equity loan for the purchaser.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="70903w0018.htm_para6"><a name="07090420002199">Since the launch of KWL the Housing Corporation has been collecting data on when the construction of a scheme has been completed and when the final unit has been occupied. The purpose of this data is to actively manage the portfolio of new build properties and take action to prevent long term voids&#151;it does not permit us to produce an average of the time it takes from completion of construction to occupation of individual units.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="70903w0018.htm_para7"><a name="07090420002200">Responsibility for marketing and sale of the units lies with Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) and Homebuy Agents. The longest period of time that a unit built exclusively for key workers on our intermediate rent and shared ownership schemes has been unoccupied is 12 months and 20 months respectively. The former property remained unoccupied for this amount of time due to delays as a result of prospective tenants dropping out which meant that the property had to be remarketed. The latter property remained unoccupied as a result of legal issues, which were only recently resolved. These were exceptional circumstances and the Department has made clear to RSLs operating the scheme that speedy action needs to be taken when legal or other problems arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="70903w0018.htm_para8"><a name="07090420002201">At present there are no properties available exclusively for key workers that have been unsold for more than six months.</p>

 General requirements on these matters are set out in planning policy documents issued by Government and by individual local planning authorities.

 Information on new house building is collected at local authority level only. The numbers of new homes built in Leeds local authority area are tabulated. It is not possible to distinguish between owner occupied and private rent. The numbers of affordable homes built for Registered Social Landlords are for social rent or intermediate housing (e.g. low cost home ownership). The local authority figures are new build for social rent.</p>

 The Open Market HomeBuy product which is provided in partnership with lenders, enables purchasers to buy a property on the open market with the help of two 12.5 per cent. equity loans, one from Government and one from a lender. If house prices fall, and the property is sold, the proceeds of the sale are used to firstly pay off the balance of the mortgage and then the value of the lender's equity loan. For three of the participating lenders this will be the original value of the equity loan, as they do not share in a fall in value. For one lender the loan will have fallen in value to reflect the fall in value of the property.</p>

If the proceeds are not sufficient to pay off the lender's conventional mortgage and equity loan then they have 'recourse' to the borrower. This means that the borrower is still in debt to the lender after the property is sold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="70903w0020.htm_para13"><a name="07090420002565">Government, however, do not have recourse to the borrower.

Under the current scheme purchasers buy the property outright, but only need to raise around 75 per cent. of the purchase price of their home from a conventional mortgage. The balance is made up by two equity loans, each of around 12.5 per cent. of the purchase price. One loan comes from Government through a HomeBuy Agent and the other comes from one of four mortgage lenders participating in the HomeBuy scheme. For the remainder of 2007-08, we are expanding the range of Open Market HomeBuy products. From 23 July we are offering a new 17.5 per cent. Government equity loan which purchasers will be able to use more flexibly as a deposit and take to any lender on the open market.

 By the end of June 2007, the Buildings Research Establishment (who administer the scheme and train and accredit assessors) advise us that 432 trained and accredited assessors were available to undertake assessments for the Code for Sustainable Homes (the Code), and that they are training approximately 50 assessors a month and anticipate having approximately 900 assessors in place by April 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="70903w0021.htm_para5"><a name="07090420002736">The Code involves a two-stage assessment process. At design-stage the different types of homes in a development are assessed rather than each individual home; the post construction check is against a sample of the home-types that have been completed. The Government are consulting on proposals for homes to receive a mandatory rating but not a mandatory assessment. Some homes might therefore have no assessment and simply receive a zero rating or non rating. Therefore, it is not clear yet how many assessors would be needed. If new house building were to be around 165,000 new homes and all of these were assessed against the Code, the existing 432 assessors would need to carry out 51 assessments each a year. Based on the current growth assessor numbers the estimated 900 assessors available in April 2008 would need to carry out about 25 assessments each a year. These figures are based on the average development size, and the number of different types of properties on each development. In the past year one assessor has completed 60 assessments and registered a further 350 against the Code or its predecessor Ecohomes. These issues will be considered further as part of the consultation.</p>

The Department is currently providing funding to Volunteer Reading Help (VRH)&#151;a charitable organisation which recruits, trains and places volunteers to give one-to-one help twice a week to children aged 6-11 years who find reading a challenge. Currently VRH has around 2,000 volunteer readers working with around 5,000 children.</p>

 In the &#147;Making Good Progress&#148; pilot one-to-one tuition will be an out of school hours programme of up to 10 hours of individual tuition in English and/or mathematics. Tutors will liaise with the class teacher to ensure that the tuition that they offer meets the needs of the child and is closely tied in to the work that the child is doing in class. Each pilot local authority will be responsible for making its own arrangements for delivering tuition, including overseeing the recruitment of suitable tutors, who must be qualified teachers, and organising locations for tuition to take place.</p>

The pilot is helping 5,000 six-year-olds with significant learning difficulties to learn to read. It does this by placing specialist literacy teachers into schools to provide intensive one-to-one or small group support to children most in need. Results from the first year of the pilot showed that children made well over four times the normal rate of progress. As a result, a national roll-out will begin from 2008-09 benefiting over 30,000 children a year by 2011.</p>

 The performance points for qualifications reported in the Achievement and Attainment Tables are determined by the size of each qualification and the challenge it represents, where size is an indication of the time spent by a centre in supporting a learner and challenge based on the grades it is possible to achieve at a particular level within the National Qualifications Framework. Size is converted into a measure based on the guided learning hours attached to a qualification, with GCSEs having a size measure of one. The Cache Certificate in Child Care and Education at Level 2 currently accredited (Qualification Accreditation Number 100/0645/X) requires 480 guided learning hours which converts to a size measure of five.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="70903w0031.htm_para12"><a name="07090420004410">The size indicators are based on set ranges of guided learning hours, or bands.

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="70903w0031.htm_para16"><a name="07090420004418">I am aware of two letters received by the Department about the recent &#145;Tellus2&#146; survey undertaken by Ofsted, both of which were referred to Ofsted for reply. I understand that Ofsted itself received seven queries from primary schools during the response period, three of which questioned the general suitability of some questions for younger children. Of these three, one specifically mentioned the question on drinking. These queries did not result in a complaint. Since the closure of the survey, Ofsted has received nine communications from parents, of which two expressed concern about the nature of the questions and two specifically mentioned the question on drinking. One of these latter two also mentioned the question on smoking. The primary school questionnaire did not include a question on drugs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="70903w0031.htm_para17"><a name="07090420004419">Respondents to such questionnaires quite rightly have their anonymity protected. In the case of the Tellus2 survey, children and young people responded using an individual, randomly generated &#145;log in&#146; identifier, rather than their names or dates of birth. Postcode information was collected, at the request of local authorities, to enable summary information to be produced about groups of children living in different parts of an authority. However, this was on the basis that data would only be reported if no individuals or schools could be identified from it.</p>

 The Department does not collect information about the cost of school meals or school lunch take-up. It has also not made an assessment of the new standards for school meals on levels of demand. However, the School Food Trust will be publishing in August the results of its annual survey on school lunch take-up. Early figures from that survey indicate that take-up in primary schools is down by 1.8 percentage points (to 40.6 per cent.) and in secondary schools by 5.3 percentage points (to 37.4 per cent.). And a recent survey by the Local Authority Caterers Association reported that total meal take-up has dropped over the three year period from 2003/04 to 2006/07. In primary schools the drop is 3 percentage points (to 40 per cent.) and in secondary schools 7 percentage points (to 35 per cent.).</p>

But we are in the early stages of our long-term ambition to transform school food: and we have other measures planed for the short and the longer term to promote school lunch and encourage children to eat more healthily. We also know that where schools take steps to manage the changes carefully through, for example, good marketing and pupil and parent involvement, take up can rise sharply.</p>

 Where employers in the education sector have ceased to use the services of a person because they consider that person is unsuitable to work with children, or they would have ceased to use the person&#146;s services where the person has left their employment, they are required to refer information to the Department. In addition, the Police refer to the Department cautions and convictions for those who have been working in educational establishments in accordance with Home Office Circular 6 / 2006 (The Notifiable Occupations Scheme). Therefore, school staff and others working with children are referred to the Department for a range of reasons including convictions or cautions for a wide range of offences, allegations involving various forms of misconduct, and referrals on the grounds of ill health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="70903w0032.htm_para7"><a name="07090420004478">The total number of all types of referrals received by the Department over the 12 months until 31 December 2006 was 2,784. Identifying how many members of school staff in each local authority had their employment terminated because of inappropriate relations with a student in the last 12 months would require detailed checks to be made of individual case records and this would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

 The Training and Development Agency for Schools in England (TDA) allocates grant funding to accredited initial teacher training (ITT) providers for the purpose of delivering initial teacher training courses. The amount of funding is based on the number of ITT trainees recruited and registered on courses. The unit of funding varies according to the type of ITT. The TDA does not collect information on how providers use that funding as the cost is only a comparatively small part of the total cost of ITT. Therefore, the Department does not hold comparable information on the average cost of training primary and secondary teachers.</p>

 The information collected by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform identifies the number of motoring offences fixed penalty notices issued by result at police force area level. Data are collected on the disposal, (i.e. paid, fine registration certificate issued etc.).

In addition, provisional data show that a further 4,357 PNDs were issued in 2006; detailed information on the number paid, contested in court and fine registered will be available this autumn.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 July 2007]: </i>We have increased public investment in further education by 48 per cent. in real terms between 1997-98 and 2005-06 and funding for adult education has increased by 7 per cent. between 2005-06 and 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="70903w0035.htm_para0"><a name="0709051000252">In October 2005 the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) published &#147;Priorities for Success&#148; which set out our funding strategy for 2006-07 and 2007-08 and was updated in October 2006 with the publication of the LSC&#146;s Annual Statement of Priorities. The strategy set out our funding priorities and in line with our Skills Strategy focused public funding on helping adults to develop the skills they will need for sustained employment and further progression in learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="70903w0035.htm_para1"><a name="0709051000253">The LSC has worked with providers across the country including in Liverpool to align provision to meet these priorities. Where providers have previously delivered large volumes of short courses and other lower priority activity then this has resulted in significant shifts of funding towards more substantive programmes that meet national priorities. In these circumstances the LSC have looked at the extent to which provision can be aligned in a single year taking into account historical levels of delivery and the needs of the local community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="70903w0035.htm_para2"><a name="0709051000254">In terms of provision outside of these priorities we have safeguarded &#163;210 million for personal and community development learning, including leisure learning in both 2006-07 and 2007-08. We also recognise the need to ensure that we have sufficient provision at lower levels to support progression through to higher level qualifications and we will be supporting this activity through the Foundation Learning Tier.</p>

 The Adult Learning Grant (ALG) provides income assessed support of up to &#163;30 per week to adults studying full time for their first full Level 2 or first full Level 3 qualification. Following a successful pilot period during which ALG has been shown to improve retention and success rates among learners it is being introduced across England from September 2007. The scheme is administered by a single helpline, Assessment and Payment body, with further education colleges providing voluntary support to applicants. Outline guidance was distributed to all colleges in June. Full, detailed administrative guidance will be published in early August 2007.</p>

 Data relating to progression for apprenticeship to advanced apprenticeship is not currently available in a comprehensive manner because of the lack of unique learner identifiers in the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s (LSC) individualised learner record (ILR) data prior to 2007/08. The unique learner number (ULN) will enable the linking of two mutually exclusive records and episodes of learning to estimate the volume of learners progressing to advanced apprenticeship. The ULN is expected to be rolled out to all provision from January 2008, with a plan to compel use by LSC funded provision from September 2008. It will then take some years to work through the system before the ULN can be used to comprehensively monitor the progress of learners across provision, where there has been a break in the training.</p>

 Individual higher education institutions (HEIs) will decide whether they should best be described as 'business-facing', and in which contexts. However, several have undertaken action that should make them more clearly 'business-facing'. The university of Hertfordshire is one that has recently done so. Government wishes to see many more institutions becoming comfortable with this term, or alternative ones, that accurately describe their significant level of collaboration with business and their wider communities and the value that they and their partners perceive in such links.</p>

 The Department has a policy of encouraging universities to increase their interaction with business. The Higher Education Innovation Fund, which provides funding to all Higher Education Institutions in England, is a key incentive. The funding for this programme has increased from &#163;187 million for the two academic years 2004/05-2005/06 to &#163;238 million for 2006/07-2007/08. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has allocated &#163;60 million of its research funding (QR) in 2007/08 by reference to research grants and contracts from business.

The reduction in the average number of staff in post between 2006 and 2007 is a consequence of the announcement in September 2005 by Mark Haysom, the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s chief executive, of proposals for a new structure for the organisation. This process is expected to result in a reduction in the LSC&#146;s overall establishment figure (that is the number of posts required to run the organisation) from around 4,700 to around 3,630&#151;a reduction of almost 1.100 posts. This will achieve estimated savings of up to &#163;40 million, which could be released to the front line for the further benefit of learners. As a result, the LSC will have a strong regional and local capacity, spending less time on transactional processes and more time developing relationships with key partners and stakeholders.</p>

 The Charity Research Support Fund does not aim to cover a fixed percentage of the full economic cost of projects.

 The latest available figures on participation in higher education by local authority based on students entering courses were published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England in January 2005 in &#147;Young Participation in England&#148;, which is available from their website at http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/hefce/2005/05_03/ This report shows participation rates for young people who enter higher education aged 18 or 19, disaggregated by local authority, for the years 1997 to 2000. The figures cover all 18 or 19-year-olds, not just those with A-levels. HEFCE have not produced participation rates beyond 2000.</p>

The latest provisional figure for 2005/06 is 43 per cent. The HEIPR is not calculated at local authority level.</p>

 As set out in &#147;Machinery of Government: Departmental Organisation&#148;, in order to provide strong strategic leadership for the 14-19 phase, overall planning responsibilities for that phase will transfer to the Department for Children, Schools and Families, as will all funding for 14-19 learners. Subject to consultation on the details and timing, to ensure there is no disruption to schools, colleges and training providers and the introduction of new diplomas, and the need to pass the necessary legislation, funding for school sixth forms, sixth form colleges and the contribution of FE colleges to the 14-19 phase will transfer from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to local authorities&#146; ring-fenced education budgets. No decisions have yet been made about the proportion of LSC funding which will transfer to local authorities&#146; ring-fenced education budgets and I estimate that it will be 2010/11 when the necessary legislative changes can take effect. In the three years until then, the LSC retains the legal responsibility for securing and funding all forms of post-16 education and training outside higher education, including 16-19 provision.

<sup>(2)</sup> It is not currently possible to split out the funding for the Business Link Network into core expenditure and programme expenditure.<br>
<sup>(3 )</sup>Only programme funds are provided to Connexions Partnerships, the majority of which pays for the salary costs of Connexions Personal Advisers. The figures exclude funding for Connexions routed via Local Area Agreements to local authorities since this does not go to Connexions Partnerships. Figures only cover grant from the former DFES. We do not hold figures for any funds brought in by Connexions Partnerships which may include some public sector funding.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> These figures include some of the funding identified separately for the University for Industry.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> Subject to the successful passage of the Further Education and Training Bill, the LSC is expecting to reduce administration expenditure in 2007-08 through restructuring and the associated reductions in staffing, property and related costs. Expenditure on LSC administration Is expected to reduce from &#163;239 million (2.2 per cent. of LSC&#146;s budget) in 2006-07 to planned expenditure of &#163;219 million (1.9 per cent. of LSC&#146;s budget) in 2007-08.<br>
<sup>(6)</sup> The LSN is a private company competing for contracts through competitive tender. It receives some public funding from the QIA which is included separately in the figures quoted for the QIA, Many colleges and other providers in the FE system subscribe to LSN services using public funds, but this is an indirect relationship with government and the funds are not shown here.<br>
<sup>(7)</sup> The Skills for Business Network is the brand under which the 25 Sector Skills Councils and the SSDA come together for marketing purposes. It is not a separately funded body or a legally constituted body of any description.<br>
<sup>(8)</sup> The Office for Fair Access was established on 14 October 2004 but expenditure was incurred from 1 July 2004.<br>
<sup>(9)</sup> Figures cover the HEFCE contract with the QAA only. HEFCE is not the sole source of income for the Quality Assurance Agency which also receives subscriptions from institutions and funding from other UK funding councils. It is not currently possible to provide the breakdown between core and programme expenditure.<br>
<sup>(10 )</sup>The Quality Improvement Agency was only formed in 2006 so figures have only been provided for that year.<br>
<sup>(11)</sup> We have not included a breakdown of Ufi administration costs as they are not available in the format required.<br>
<sup>(12 )</sup>The National Education Business Partnerships Network is the umbrella organisation and national voice for the 126 local Education Business Partnerships working in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Since 2003-04 DFES has grant-funded NEBPN to manage national networks for local and national practitioners of (a) work experience, (b) teachers&#146; professional development placements in business, (c) enterprise education. It is not possible to separate out core costs from the programme expenditure.<br>

 On 14 June the Government launched the Skills Pledge with commitments from 157 employers with more than 1.7 million employees. Since the launch, employers have continued to register their interest in the Skills Pledge through the Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) Train to Gain website and helpline. The Learning and Skills Council is responsible for the operational aspects of the Skills Pledge, including recording which of those employers making a Skills Pledge are from the public sector. Mark Haysom will write to the hon. Member and a copy of his letter will be placed in the Library of the House. Employers who make a commitment to a Skills Pledge are able to access the support of a skills broker. These independent, impartial experts will help employers identify the skills needed to meet their business needs and any sources of public funding available. Those employers who have already committed to the Skills Pledge are now working through how best to fulfil their commitment, including any requirement for public funding.</p>

 Train to Gain is a new service that reached national coverage in August 2006 and is a critical part of the drive to make this country&#146;s skills world class. Skills brokers are contracted for and performance managed by the Learning and Skills Council. It is a contractual requirement that, within 12 months of their appointment, every skills broker meets the new independently assessed City and Guilds accredited skills broker standard as part of the business support profession.</p>

 I am unable to make predictions about common agricultural policy payments this year. As far as the main CAP scheme, the single payment scheme (SPS) is concerned, the Rural Payments Agency has paid as at 18 July a total of &#163;1.49 billion. Detailed analysis of all the payments made under the SPS is not yet available. Once the remaining scheme payments have been completed, a decision will be taken on the level of detail that will be published. The validation of claims under the 2007 SPS is at an early stage.</p>

 A specific technology that the Government are keen to promote is anaerobic digestion (AD).

 Although Dog Control Orders do not need confirmation by the Secretary of State, local authorities can only introduce them after completing the procedure prescribed in the Dog Control Order (Procedures) Regulations 2006. The procedure includes a period of local consultation and notification in the local press.

 The licensing system under the Animals (Scientific procedures) Act 1986 is demand-led and provides the Home Office, as regulator, with no mechanism for reducing animal use. Instead the Act requires that the procedures authorised must cause the minimum possible suffering to the smallest number of animals of the least sentience. The Act also requires that, before a project licence is issued, we must weigh the benefits to humans, other animals, or the environment against the costs to the animals involved. A licence cannot be granted if the work could be carried out without using animals. The overall amount of animal research which takes place is determined by a number of factors, including the economic climate and global trends in scientific endeavour.</p>

It is able to fund high-quality research and facilitate the exchange of information and ideas, the identification of knowledge gaps, and the translation of research findings into practice to benefit both animals and science.

The result has been a significant fall in illegal extremist activity, and many significant convictions of animal rights extremists in the past 18 months, with others awaiting sentence and other major investigations ongoing.

 Enforcement of offences is an operational matter for individual chief officers of police enforcement of road traffic. Section 41D, Road Traffic Act 1988 consists of failing to have proper control of a vehicle and using a mobile phone while driving. The likelihood of detection of such offences has increased through the increasing numbers of police, including the deployment on roads of teams involved in the use of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) equipment. They can stop vehicles as a result of direct observation, as well as an ANPR hit. Otherwise, the police enforce as operationally appropriate, taking into account other demands on their resources. Training for roads policing duties including the enforcement of Section 41D offences is a matter for individual chief officers.</p>

 The number of profiles held on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) by all forces in the UK as at 31 March 2007, broken down as requested, is shown in the following table. It is currently estimated that 13.7 per cent. of profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, i.e. that a profile for a person has been loaded on more than one occasion (one reason for this is that the person gave different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests). Thus the number of individuals on the database is approximately 13.7 per cent. less than the number of subject profiles.</p>

Work is under way to ensure that the magistrates courts case management system currently being implemented by the Ministry of Justice reports all motoring offences to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated. 2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many cautions were given to those accused of sexual offences in <i> (a)</i> Leeds, <i> (b)</i> West Yorkshire and <i> (c)</i> England and Wales in each of the last five years. [151285]</p>

<p><a name="st_595"><a name="0709051008405"><a name="70903w0068.htm_spnew5"><a name="0709051009706"><b>Mr. Coaker</b>
<i> [holding answer 23 July 2007]: </i>The number of persons aged 10 to 15 cautioned for all offences in West Yorkshire police force area for the years 2001 to 2005, along with the number of defendants of all ages cautioned by offence type in West Yorkshire police force area, and the number of defendants of all ages cautioned for sexual offences in England and Wales for the years 2001 to 2005 can be viewed in the following tables. This information is from the court proceedings database held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_574"><a name="70903w0068.htm_para0"><a name="0709051008406">Information on cautions collected by the police is only reported to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform broken down at force area level, not by police division, so it is not possible to separately identify the number of cautions in Leeds from our data.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_575"><a name="70903w0068.htm_para1"><a name="0709051008407">Technically an offender could receive a second caution for a similar offence but it should be in very extenuating circumstances. The Home Office Circular discourages repeat use of the same penalty with the same offender. Someone who offends again needs to know that the next response will be a tougher one. And where a serious offence is committed, then the case should go to court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_576"><a name="70903w0068.htm_para2"><a name="0709051008408">Therefore both national and locally held records must be checked before a caution is given. If the suspect has previously received a caution then a further caution should not normally be considered. If there has been a sufficient lapse of time to suggest that a previous caution has had a "significant deterrent effect" then a caution can be administered, but it is at the discretion of the police and CPS. The lapse of time varies, in practice, between forces.</p>

To achieve this individual NHS bodies must achieve energy usage targets of between 33 and 55 GJ/100cu.m per annum (Gigajoules/100 Cubic Metres) for all new capital developments and major redevelopments or refurbishments; and that all existing facilities should achieve energy usage of between 55 and 65 GJ/100cu.m per annum.</p>

 The information requested is shown in the following table for years where the information is available.
