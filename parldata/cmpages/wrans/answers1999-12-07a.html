<a name="91207w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The information requested is as follows:
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para0">The basis for setting and approving in-service dates (ISDs) is currently under review in the context of the Smart Procurement Initiative. It should also be noted that costs quoted are for acquisition only, expressed in constant prices at 1999-2000 levels.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para1">1. <i>Future Offensive Air System (FOAS)</i>--The original in-service date (ISD) was 2015. The current ISD is 2017. The current cost estimate is about &#163;10 billion, though this should be seen as a broad estimate only. Years of peak expenditure are expected to be 2017-18 and 2018-19. The FOAS project is currently in the Concept phase. Contractors for the Concept phase studies include British Aerospace and Matra BAe Dynamics (UK).
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para2">2. <i>BOWMAN</i>--The original ISD was 1995. The current ISD is 2002, but this is under review. The current cost estimate is around &#163;2.2 billion and the years of peak expenditure are expected to be 2002-03 and 2003-04. The prime contractor is ARCHER Communications Systems Ltd.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para3">3. <i>BARMINE Replacement</i>--The original and current ISDs are 2010. The current cost estimate is &#163;54 million, with peak expenditure in 2007-08 and 2008-09. The prime contractor is not yet known.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para4">4. <i>Area Weapons Effect Simulator</i>--The original ISD was 1999. The current ISD is 2003. Current estimated costs are &#163;99 million with peak expenditure in 1999-2000 and 2000-01. The prime contractor is Cubic Defense Systems, USA.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para5">5. <i>Future Short and Very Short Range Air Defence Systems</i> (now known as Future Ground Based Air Defence--FGBAD)--The original ISD was 2015. The latest estimated ISD is 2020 but this will be considered further in the concept and assessment phases. The current cost estimate is around &#163;4.5 billion. The peaks in expenditure will depend on the decisions made in the concept and assessment phases. The prime contractors for the two International Feasibility Studies--now completed--were Matra BAe Dynamics and Thomson- Thorn Missile Electronics. The planned further Concept work is likely to be placed on the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, who would be supported by the Rapier and High Velocity Missile Design Authorities.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para6">6. <i>Combined Arms Tactical Trainer</i>--The original ISD was 2000. The current ISD is 2001. The current estimated cost is &#163;247 million with years of peak expenditure in 1997-98 to 2001-02. The prime contractor is Lockheed Martin Information Systems.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para7">7. <i>TERRIER</i>--The original ISD was 2005. The current ISD is 2009. Information on the current cost estimate is commercially sensitive and is being withheld under exemption 7 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. The two prime contractors for the competitive Project Definition phase are Vickers Defence Systems and Marconi Marine Land and Naval Systems.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para8">8. <i>Range Extension for Tactical Trunk Communications</i>--We have assumed that this is a reference to the satellite extension to the PTARMIGAN trunk communications system which was brought into 



<P>
<P><I>7 Dec 1999 : Column: 453W</I><P>
service in September 1997 at an actual cost of &#163;24.5 million. The prime contractor was Siemens Plessey and peak years of expenditure were 1995-96.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para9">9. <i>Future Engineer Tank</i>--The original ISD was 2001. The current ISD is 2006. Information on cost estimates is commercially sensitive and is being withheld under exemption 7 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. The three contractors for the competitive Feasibility studies are Vickers Defence Systems, Alvis Vehicles and Obrum, Poland.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para10">10. <i>Lightweight Mobile Artillery Weapons System (LIMAWS)</i>--The original and current ISD is 2007 for the howitzer only. The other elements of the system are not yet sufficiently defined. Information on cost estimates is commercially sensitive and is being withheld under exemption 7 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. The prime contractor is Marconi Marine Land and Naval Systems.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para11">11. <i>Next Generation Light Anti-Tank Weapon (NLAW)</i>--The original and current ISD is 2006. Information on cost estimates is commercially sensitive and is being withheld under exemption 7 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. The two prime contractors for the competitive Project Definition phase are Matra BAe Dynamics (UK) Ltd. and Bofors Carl Gustaf AB (Sweden).
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para12">12. <i>Formation Battle Management System (FBMS)</i>--The original and current ISD is 2002. The project is, however, linked with BOWMAN and revisions to that programme could impact on the ISD of FBMS. The current estimated costs are &#163;74 million with peak expenditure in years 2001-02 to 2004-05. The prime contractor is British Aerospace Defence Systems Ltd.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para13">13. <i>Theatre Wide Area Communications Network (TWACN)</i>--The TWACN original and current ISD is 2002. The cost estimate is commercially sensitive and is withheld under exemption 7 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. Expenditure is likely to peak in 2001-02 to 2004-05 once a prime contractor has been identified.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para14">14. <i>Future Carrier Borne Aircraft (FCBA)</i>--The original and current ISD is 2012. Overall FCBA numbers and hence the total cost of the programme, which could be in the region of &#163;5 billion to &#163;7 billion, have yet to be determined. Peak expenditure is likely to occur in 2013-14 and 2014-15. We are participating in the Concept Demonstration Phase (CDP) of the US Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) programme. Lockheed Martin and Boeing are the prime contractors for JSF CDP, with several UK companies as sub-contractors. We are also undertaking feasibility studies covering navalisation of Eurofighter, other potential solutions and various ship/aircraft interface issues. A number of contracts have been placed with UK industry as part of these UK feasibility studies.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para15">15. <i>Future Amphibious Support Helicopter (FASH)</i>--The provisional ISD is 2008. The current estimate of costs is around &#163;1 billion with peak expenditure estimated to be in years 2009-10 to 2010-11. The prime contractor is not yet known.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para16">16. <i>SCOT Capability Upgrade (SCUG)</i>--The original ISD was 2004. The current ISD is 2005. The cost estimate is commercially sensitive and is withheld under 



<P>
<P><I>7 Dec 1999 : Column: 454W</I><P>
exemption 7 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. Expenditure is likely to peak in 2005-06 and 2006-07. A prime contractor has yet to be identified.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para17">17. <i>Naval EHF Satellite Terminal (NEST)</i>--The original ISD was 2004, the current ISD is 2005. The cost estimate is commercially sensitive and is withheld under exemption 7 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. Expenditure is likely to peak in 2004-05 and 2005-06. A prime contractor has yet to be identified.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para18">18. <i>Electronic Warfare Database and Rapid Reaction Facility</i>--There is at present no formal user requirement for this programme.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para19">19. <i>Sonar 2087</i>--The original ISD was 2003. The current ISD is 2004. Current estimated cost is around &#163;390 million with peak expenditure expected in years 2003-04 and 2006-07. The prime contractors are Thomson Marconi Sonar Ltd. and Babcock Defence Systems.
<P>

<a name="91207w01.html_para20">20. <i>EW 2000</i>--The original and current ISD is 2006.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps are being taken to ensure that the current terms of service of young people in the armed forces are compatible with the Human Rights Act 1998.  [100122]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 In line with other public authorities, my Department is taking steps to ensure that all personnel policies will be compatible with the main provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998 when they fully come into force on 2 October 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Barry Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the progress of the Smart Procurement Initiative.  [101194]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 This initiative, which is at the heart of our efforts to reform the way we procure and support defence equipment, is currently being implemented. The programme to roll out Integrated Project Teams (IPTs) with full industry participation is on course; all the teams will be fully operational by April 2000. The design and implementation of new arrangements to ensure effective relationships between IPTs, their new Equipment Capability Customer in MOD Headquarters and the Front Line Commands is also making excellent progress. We remain on track to achieve savings of &#163;2 billion to which we are committed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w02.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Harris: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many research contracts have been let by his Department since May 1997; what is the value of each contract; and in each case whether the contract included <i>(a)</i> a departmental veto over publication of the research 



<P>
<P><I>7 Dec 1999 : Column: 455W</I><P>
results, <i>(b)</i> departmental control over the date of publication of the research results and <i>(c)</i> a requirement that the final research results incorporate departmental amendments.  [100146]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 December 1999]:</i> The Ministry of Defence conducts research on a wide range of matters. Details are not all recorded centrally, but information available indicates that since May 1997 the Ministry of Defence has placed over 740 research contracts at a total value of over &#163;250 million, excluding those let by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). DERA has, in addition, placed some &#163;300 million worth of extramural contracts on behalf of the Department. The total number of DERA contracts placed is not readily available. I am withholding the value of individual research contracts under exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, as this information is commercially sensitive.
<P>

<a name="91207w02.html_para0">The Department generally retains control over the publication of research results, and the date of publication, except where ownership of results of work has been vested in contractors. There is no prohibition on publication except where justified under the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. MOD and DERA would not seek to change the results of research.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 December 1999]:</i> The MOD is working towards publication, and aims to issue an updated Compendium early in the new year. Since publication of the last Compendium in September 1998, the Department has undergone major organisational change in the implementation of the Strategic Defence Review. We wish to ensure that the Compendium will represent an accurate view to industry of future equipment needs throughout the MOD.

<P>
<a name="91207w02.html_wqn4"><B> Dr. Vis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what reports he has received regarding the demolition of Iraqi munitions at the Khamisiyah depot in March 1991 and its possible effect on British troops; and if he will make a statement.  [102057]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Government's 1997 'New Beginnings' policy statement set out the way forward for addressing the health concerns of Gulf veterans and included a statement of the MOD's commitment to review specific events in response to Gulf veterans' concerns that they were exposed to chemical weapons during the Gulf Conflict. The work reviewing the incident at Khamisiyah in March 1991 has now been completed and I am today publishing a detailed paper entitled "Review of the events concerning 32 Field Hospital and the Release of Nerve Agent Arising from US Demolition of Iraqi Munitions at the Khamisiyah Depot in March 1991". In conjunction with this I am also publishing a detailed paper to provide the background of how chemical warfare defence was organised in the UK during the Gulf conflict entitled 



<P>
<P><I>7 Dec 1999 : Column: 456W</I><P>
"British Chemical Warfare Defence During the Gulf Conflict 1990-91)". Copies have been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="91207w02.html_para1">As a result of our review of the information on the Khamisiyah incident, we do not believe there is evidence that any UK troops were definitely exposed to Iraqi chemical agents on 10 or 11 March 1991. Although some British troops were located within the computer modelled composite plume footprint, such theoretical exposure would have been at a very low level. We judge that if such an exposure took place it would present no risk to health.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on how many occasions the United Kingdom exercised a national veto on proposed actions during NATO operations connected with Kosovo in 1999.  [101336]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The reply I gave to a similar question from the hon. Member on 30 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 85W, explained that NATO decisions are taken by consensus and outlined the procedure for consultation by national commanders in support of Alliance decision-making. Releasing details of the applications of these processes in specific operations would be harmful to defence, security and international relations.

 The Government have not commissioned any assessment of the environmental effects of using such munitions in Kosovo but the Joint UN Environment Programme/UN Commission on Human Settlements issued its report "The Kosovo Conflict: Consequences for the Environment" on 5 October 1999. A copy of the report has been placed in the Library of the House. We are aware, however, of the concerns that have been expressed about the use of uranium-based munitions and have commissioned advice from officials within the Department on what further work we might do to improve our knowledge of how depleted uranium in ammunition behaves in the natural environment.

<P>
<a name="91207w04.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Jim Marshall: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what was the outcome of the Telecommunications Council held in Brussels on 30 November; and if he will make a statement.  [101168]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w04.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I represented the UK at the Telecommunications Council on 30 November which adopted a Directive on a Common Framework for Electronic Signatures. I welcomed this as a major step forward towards clarifying the legal framework for electronic commerce.
<P>

<a name="91207w04.html_para0">In addition the Commission presented a number of recent Communications which were followed by preliminary exchanges of views.
<P>

<a name="91207w04.html_para1">In presenting the fifth report on implementation of the telecommunications regulatory package the Commission drew attention to progress towards implementation of the existing package of telecoms liberalisation legislation, and concluded that the successes of the existing regulatory framework had led to market growth with increased competition and lower tariffs. The Commission also drew attention to the remaining barriers to a single European market in telecoms, including a comparatively low level of harmonisation of Community licensing and interconnection regimes, incomplete implementation by some member states of Community cost accounting provisions, and the lack of competition in local access markets in all member states. Member states approved this general analysis.
<P>

<a name="91207w04.html_para2">There was a first debate on the Commission Communication on the review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications. In presenting the Communication the Commission summarised its approach to the review of the regulatory package which would apply to all electronic communications systems and said it would report on the outcome of its public consultation in April before making legislative proposals in May. In the following debate all member states 



<P>
<P><I>7 Dec 1999 : Column: 465W</I><P>
recognised the need for swift action in the face of the pace of technological change, and simplification of the regulatory framework. A number, including the UK, stressed the need for a flexible framework with a minimum of regulation. I emphasised that strengthening competition in the market for communications services is vital to produce an environment in which e-commerce can flourish in Europe, and welcomed the Commission's recognition that regulation should be on a co-regulatory basis with business where possible. The Council adopted Conclusions endorsing the Commission's principles for the new regulatory framework as set out in its Communication.
<P>

<a name="91207w04.html_para3">The Commission also presented its Communication on the results of its public consultation on its Green Paper on radio spectrum policy. The Commission summarised the outcome of its consultation and the areas in which it indicated future legislative proposals. There was no discussion of the Communication: the Presidency concluded that the Council noted the Commission's intentions which would require further study when specific legislative proposals emerged in 2000.
<P>

<a name="91207w04.html_para4">There was also a debate on the information society of the future and how to build trust and create effective rules for electronic commerce. The Commission will produce guidelines on the use of self-regulation in this area for discussion at the Information Society meeting in Lisbon in April 2000.
<P>

<a name="91207w04.html_para5">The Council also noted, without discussion, the Commission Communication on implementation of Directive 97/47/EC on advanced TV standards. The 



<P>
<P><I>7 Dec 1999 : Column: 466W</I><P>
Commission also provided an oral update on member states' preparation for the Millennium Bug in energy, transport and other fields.

<P>
<a name="91207w04.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will define the phrase, "undue cross-subsidy", in paragraph 28 of the Post Office White Paper.  [101289]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The phrase "undue cross-subsidy" refers to any cross-subsidy from the monopoly to non-monopoly services which is intended or has the effect of being a breach of competition rules. It will be for the Postal Services Commission to regulate this and to make decisions based on the facts of any particular case.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when he intends to announce awards from round 2 of the Joint Infrastructure Fund.  [101685]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I have today announced jointly with the Wellcome Trust and the Higher Education Funding Council for England details of the awards from round 2 of the Joint Infrastructure Fund (JIF). Over &#163;320 million has been awarded to 45 successful applicants across 27 universities across the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="91207w04.html_para6">The projects awarded funding cover the broad spectrum of science and engineering. They range from projects costing &#163;750,000 to over &#163;30 million.
<P>

<a name="91207w04.html_para7">There are a further 3 rounds of the JIF with decision points in March and November 2000 and March 2001.

<P>
<a name="91207w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Government asked the independent Low Pay Commission to monitor and evaluate the operation of the national minimum wage, with particular reference to its impact on pay, employment and competitiveness in low paying sectors and small firms. I look forward to reading the Commission's findings, which will be included in their report to the Prime Minister and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State later this month, and we will consider carefully the recommendations it makes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the impact of the Employment Relations Act 1999 on the working of the entertainment industry.  [101087]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 No regulatory proposal which has an impact on businesses, charities or voluntary bodies is considered by the Government without a thorough assessment of the risks, costs and benefits, a clear analysis of who will be affected and an explanation of why non-regulatory action would be insufficient. These effects are examined in Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs), which are published with legislative proposals.

sector will depend on the scope of existing provision in that sector, whether this provision exceeds the statutory minimum in the Act, and the extent to which individuals take up their rights.

 The provision for the Government Indemnity Scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to their loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the loan. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects or bringing into the public domain the conclusions of any study.
<P>

<a name="91207w05.html_para8">In the six month period ended 30 September 1999, the following undertakings to indemnify were given under section 16 by the relevant Departments for objects on loan to national and non-national institutions:

 Ministers, when travelling on official business, may use a private car instead of an official car, and claim mileage allowance in the same circumstances and on the same terms as their civil servants. Use of public transport is encouraged. The Department's aim of minimising journeys by car to reduce the environmental impact of transport activity has been publicised widely. Where public transport is available but a private car is used, a single flat rate of 24 pence per mile is payable. Where it is impracticable to use public transport, payment for the use of a private car is at the rate of 40 pence per mile for the first 4,000 miles regardless of engine size, and 24 pence per mile after that. Claims for payment have to confirm that each journey was arranged in the most cost effective way.

 The Transport Council has yet to consider any recommendations on tunnel safety. However, paragraph 37 of the Cologne Council conclusions refers to road tunnels. It therefore seems likely that any recommendations would not be directly applicable to rail tunnels such as the Channel Tunnel.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You recently asked the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the value of porous asphalt roads surfacing as a means of reducing spray in wet weather. I am replying in the absence of the Chief Executive, Peter Nutt.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Research undertaken by the Highways Agency has assessed the value of using porous asphalt road surfaces, including the benefit of reduced spray. Work carried out in the 1980's has shown that porous asphalt can reduce spray by as much as 95 per cent. compared to conventional asphalt when new. This reduces to approximately 30 per cent. after about three years due to the clogging of the porous asphalt from road detritus. The reduction in spray and the better visibility it offers drivers in wet weather, could be expected to reduce accidents when using porous asphalt compared with conventional surfacing.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, surveys carried out for the Highways Agency indicate that vehicles travel faster on porous asphalt in the wet than on conventional surfacing which increases the risk of accidents. This work is supported by an extensive accident survey report from the Netherlands. Where porous asphalt is widely used. Their survey demonstrates that porous asphalt was no safer than conventional

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As part of a strategy to reduce impact of road noise the Highways Agency is carrying out research into alternative types of low noise road surfacing. As a result, new types of surfacing are now being introduced, some of which are often confused with porous asphalt, given their spray suppressing properties.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what emissions are produced from the use of a gallon of <i>(a)</i> unleaded petrol, <i>(b)</i> super unleaded petrol and <i>(c)</i> lead replacement petrol.  [101093]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 There is no fundamental difference in emissions produced by any of these grades of petrol, the primary combustion products being carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2</sub> ) and water vapour. Combustion of one gallon will produce approximately 10.7 kg of CO <sub>2</sub>  and 4.3 kg of water. Small amounts of secondary combustion products can also be created, but the actual amounts will vary from vehicle to vehicle depending on the combustion efficiency of the engine in which the fuel is burned and the efficiency of any exhaust gas after-treatment that may be fitted. These secondary pollutants are mainly comprised of hydrocarbons (HC) arising from unburned or partially burned fuel, oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulates. Depending on the level of sulphur in the fuel, sulphur compounds can also be produced. Other compounds, resulting from the use of fuel additives such as, for example, potassium that is used in lead replacement petrol, may also be emitted in trace concentrations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 There is no recycling target which each individual local authority is expected to meet. There is a national goal to recycle or compost 25 per cent. of household waste as soon as possible, hopefully by 2005. By 2010 we hope to see 30 per cent. of household waste being recycled or composted, and in the longer term we hope to see a third of all households being dealt with in this way.
<P>

<a name="91207w09.html_para0">Under our Best Value Initiative performance indicators are being developed for local authority waste services. From these, authorities will be expected to derive targets for their own performance on waste, having regard to any national goals we set in the forthcoming National Waste Strategy. I emphasise, though, that local targets should take account of local assessments of the Best Practicable Environmental Option, and will not therefore necessarily be at the same level as our national goals. I fully expect some authorities to put forward targets that exceed those that we propose, and others to put forward lower targets.

 The EURATOM Basic Safety Standards Directive Euratom 96-29 imposes a high degree of radiological protection revising earlier Directives setting 



<P>
<P><I>7 Dec 1999 : Column: 486W</I><P>
basic safety standards for the protection of workers and members of the public against the dangers of ionising radiation. Article five of the Directive makes the disposal, recycling or re-use of radioactive substances subject to authorisation by the regulators.
<P>

<a name="91207w10.html_para0">With most materials containing some radioactivity it is important to set thresholds in regulations below which materials will be treated as outside the framework of control. The Directive therefore permits member states to set levels of radioactivity below which materials can be disposed of, recycled and re-used without needing prior authorisation. This concept is known as clearance, with clearance levels setting a threshold at or below which the levels of radioactivity are small and pose negligible radiological risk, irrespective of the volume and fate of that material. The Government have recently issued a consultation document on implementation of the Directive including the issue of clearance levels. Responses to this are still being considered and Government proposals will be made in due course.
<P>

<a name="91207w10.html_para1">In the UK, the sale or disposal of radioactively contaminated material is closely regulated by the Environment Agency (in England and Wales), the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (in Scotland), and Department of Environment (NI) in Northern Ireland under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 to ensure that the levels of radioactivity involved pose insignificant risk to human health or the environment.

In addition, in response to a recent consultation exercise on implementation of the revised Basic Safety Standards Directive Euratom 96/29, further representations in support of the LLRC were received.

 We are committed to driving forward improvements in the benefit services authorities provide so that they are faster, more accurate and more secure whilst also achieving value for money and taking account of the views and needs of local people. A comprehensive range of best value performance indicators for the delivery of Housing and Council Tax Benefit was included in the recent joint DETR and Audit Commission consultation exercise ("Performance Indicators for 2000/2001"). Indicators will be finalised by the end of 1999 and will cover the key aspects of local authorities' performance in delivering Housing and Council Tax Benefit.
<P>

<a name="91207w12.html_para0">A number of initiatives are also currently being developed and implemented in partnership with local authorities to improve the efficiency and speed of Housing and Council Tax Benefit delivery.
<P>

<a name="91207w12.html_para1">Remote Access Terminals are now installed in 346 local authorities. These terminals provide the authorities with direct access to relevant benefit information held by the Benefits Agency and contribute towards reducing the time it takes to process Housing and Council Tax Benefit claims.
<P>

<a name="91207w12.html_para2">The Department has now completed piloting the Electronic Transfer of Data in 20 sites. This initiative, if implemented nationally, will remove the need for approximately 20 million paper transactions each year between Benefit Agency and local authority offices, while reducing transfer time to two working days.

 The PRIME contract contains not only technical data but also information of a commercially confidential nature. It is therefore subject to a confidentiality agreement between the Department and the contractor, Trillium. The Department will, however, take the matter forward with Trillium, with a view to obtaining an acceptable solution to the publication or disclosure of the document.

<UL>(2) if the PRIME contract with Trillium allows his Department to sub-let surplus parts of the estate above the 35 per cent. which his Department may vacate without charge.  [101843]

<P>
<a name="91207w12.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Now that the Department no longer owns any freehold accommodation, and has transferred the risk of all former leasehold properties to Trillium, we can no longer sub-let to the open market. We believe, however, that we have negotiated sufficient flexibility with this contract to meet our changing business needs.
<P>

<a name="91207w12.html_para5">On 1 April 1998, at the outset of the PRIME contract just under 30 per cent. of the total estate (some 1,644,089 square metres including surplus space) was designated "flexible". This is accommodation which we are entitled to vacate over the course of the contract without charge.
<P>

<a name="91207w12.html_para6">Up to 2 per cent. of this flexible space can be released each year with any unused allowance being carried forward until required. In addition to this, a further 10 per cent. of the total estate can be vacated subject to a charge, to cover Trillium's "unavoidable costs".
<P>

<a name="91207w12.html_para7">Having already given back to Trillium some 10 per cent. of the estate that was surplus to requirements on day one of the contract, we effectively have a package in place that will allow us to vacate half of the entire estate.
<P>

<a name="91207w12.html_para8">In the first year of the contract, however, only 1 per cent. of our flexible accommodation was returned to Trillium, so that we now have some 3 per cent. available for release this year. The current indication is that we will return around 0.5 per cent. before April, so, with the roll over allowance, we could feasibly give back 4.5 per cent. of space to Trillium in the third year of the contract.
<P>

<a name="91207w12.html_para9">The Department is, therefore, well within the flexibility allowance. If a situation arose where we were ever in a situation that we had used up all flexibility in the contract, we could still attempt to return space to Trillium by negotiation or offer it to other Government Departments.

 It is not possible in the statistics held centrally to distinguish between convictions for driving while under the influence of drugs and convictions for drinking under the influence of alcohol because the charge does not distinguish which of the two is involved.
<P>

<a name="91207w14.html_para2">Figures of convictions for motoring offences in 1998 have not yet been published, but provisional figures show that some 93,000 convictions for driving after consuming alcohol or taking drugs were recorded in England and Wales, some 7 per cent. lower than the previous year.
<P>

<a name="91207w14.html_para3">Figures from the Forensic Science Service, however, show that 1,779 blood samples were analysed by them on behalf of the police service in England and Wales during 1998-99, following charges under Section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, approximately 90 per cent. of which were found to contain one or more drugs (although it is known that some police forces may have submitted blood samples for analysis elsewhere).

<P>
<a name="91207w14.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Stunell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what quantitative assessment he has made of the levels of efficiency of individual police forces, and of the differential impact of his proposed 2 per cent. efficiency savings on their operational capacity; and if he will make a statement.  [101114]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Home Office uses a number of different measures to assess police performance. There is no agreed formula for measuring police efficiency, although work on measuring comparative efficiency is being carried out locally to meet the requirements of Best Value. In addition, the Public Service Productivity Panel is assessing tools for measuring efficiency to assist Police Authorities in meeting their Best Value duties.
<P>

<a name="91207w14.html_para5">The efficiency targets set by the Government require each force to plan efficiency gains to equal to at least 2 per cent. of non-revenue expenditure for reinvestment in front line policing. Each force will retain any cash savings for use in improving their service to the public. The overall impact will be to make efficiency gains worth &#163;440 million available for police operations between 1999 and 2002. The differential impact for each force will depend on the strength of the efficiency plan.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the impact on numbers of <i>(a)</i> total employees, <i>(b)</i> uniformed officers and <i>(c)</i> civilian staff of his planned 2 per cent. efficiency reduction for 2000-01 in respect of the (i) Greater Manchester, (ii) Cheshire, (iii) Merseyside and (iv) Lancashire police; and if he will make a statement.  [101116]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 This Government's Comprehensive Spending Review has set the police a 2 per cent. year on year efficiency target from April 1999. This is not a reduction in police funding--the resources released by efficiency gains will be reinvested in frontline policing.
<P>

<a name="91207w14.html_para6">As in 1999-2000, each police authority has been asked to produce an efficiency plan for the year 2000-01 detailing how this 2 per cent. efficiency target can be reached, and how cashable savings will be reinvested to provide a better public service.
<P>

<a name="91207w14.html_para7">The impact of efficiency plans on numbers of employees, whether police officers or civilians, is a matter for police authorities and chief officers to determine. We expect efficiency plans to be submitted to the Home Office by April 2000, and until they have been finalised I can make no assessment.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 One of the "gateway" criteria against which bids will be assessed is that forces are on target to meet the 2 per cent. efficiency gains for 1999-2000 as required by the Government Comprehensive Spending Review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w14.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Just over 162,000 handguns were surrendered to the police under the terms of the Firearms (Amendment) Acts 1997. Records are not held centrally of those illegally or legally held firearms, including any handguns, which might have been handed in to the police for other reasons.
<P>

<a name="91207w14.html_para8">The ban on handguns was a direct response to the tragic shootings at Dunblane Primary School in March 1996, which were carried out with legally held handguns. It did not purport to solve the more general problem of armed crime, the vast majority of which is carried out using illegally held firearms. Nevertheless, the ban has removed one potential source of handguns for criminal use: in 1997, 305 handguns were stolen or otherwise misappropriated, mostly from private homes.
<P>

<a name="91207w14.html_para9">As at 30 November, a total of just over &#163;89 million had been paid in compensation to those individuals who surrendered firearms and ancillary equipment under the terms of the 1997 Acts. The final figure is currently forecast to be approximately &#163;90.2 million.

operations are used by the police to recover firearms from criminals, and Firearms Inquiry Units operated by the police concentrate on the licensing and administration of legitimate firearms to prevent legally held firearms being diverted into the criminal market. Additionally, the National Crime Squad and metropolitan forces run proactive operations against criminal sources that supply illegal handguns. The Association of Chief Police Officers two sub-committees, Criminal Use of Firearms and the Administration of Firearms and Explosives Licensing are also revising strategies to enhance the detection of illegally held firearms in criminal use.

 Data are collected on drug offences only, not on offences which may have been committed owing to drug taking. Nor can information be provided at police sub-division level. There is readily available information on proceedings in the Easington Petty Sessional Division for possession of class B drugs. (These drugs are essentially cannabis and amphetamines, and probably account for about 80 per cent. of all drug offences.) In 1995, out of the 25 persons proceeded against in the magistrates court, 22 were sentenced by that court; none were committed for trial to the Crown court. The following year, 1996, 35 out of 39 proceeded against were sentenced by the magistrates court; one person was committed for trial. In 1997, the latest year for which published data are available, 15 out of 18 proceeded against were sentenced in the lower court, while two were committed for trial.

The Government are committed to ensuring that New Deal actively promotes equality of opportunity and outcome for young jobseekers of all ethnic and racial groups, and has published their strategy for engaging ethnic minority jobseekers and businesses in the New Deal.

 In November 1998, the Government announced a new grant, the Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG), to replace the education element of the Home Office's Section 11 Grant. EMAG was established to raise standards for those ethnic minority and Traveller pupils particularly at risk of underachieving and to meet the particular needs of pupils for whom English is an Additional Language. All London local authorities received funding through EMAG for 1999-2000. Details of individual allocations, which mirrored Section 11 allocations in 1998-99, are set out in the following table.

<P>
<a name="91207w16.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Action Programme, published in response to the Green Paper "Excellence for all children: Meeting special educational needs", promotes the inclusion of children with special educational needs within mainstream schooling wherever possible, while recognising the continuing need for special schools for some children. Section 14 of the Education Act 1996 requires local education authorities to have regard to the need for securing that special educational provision is made to these pupils. This duty gives the local education authority a role to decide the organisation of provision to suit the needs of the individual child. The Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of Special Educational Needs which came into effect on 1 September 1994 provides guidance to help identify and assess children who have specific learning difficulties. The Code is currently being revised to strengthen and improve the guidance and provide examples of best practice.
<P>

<a name="91207w16.html_para3">Raising educational standards lies at the very heart of our education policy. This must include children with special educational needs (SEN) whether in mainstream or special schools. To support provision for SEN pupils the Department has taken a number of steps. For example it has provided a grant to the British Dyslexia Association to help them develop the "Achieving Dyslexia Friendly Schools" resource pack which seeks to demonstrate that it is possible to meet the needs of children with mild to moderate dyslexia in a mainstream classroom. Two copies of this pack have been sent to all local education authorities in England. Also the Department has funded and made available the findings of three research projects on inclusion:

 Both the documentation leading up to the inclusion of organisations on our list of function providers for LEA intervention, and the bids submitted in specific cases, are treated as commercial in confidence. Officials have had a large number of meetings with Islington Council, involving elected members, officers, headteachers and school staff, in order to discuss urgent action by Islington officers to improve standards and the planned outsourcing of the service. Officials have also been involved in the evaluation of tenders leading to the recent announcement of a preferred service provider. I have personally met Islington members and officers, spoken to groups of headteachers and visited a number of schools. The proposed contract with the preferred service provider remains under negotiation, but it will include arrangements for regular monitoring against service standards, and link payment to the delivery of targets for pupil performance.

 There have been a number of significant improvements in Iran's human rights record since President Khatami's election in May 1997. We welcome the Iranian government's commitment to develop an Islamic civil society based on respect for the rule of law. The people of Iran now enjoy significantly greater freedom of expression, despite recent closures of a number of reformist publications, many of which have subsequently reopened under different titles, compared to two years ago. February's local council elections, the first in Iran's history, were also particularly welcome, putting local power in the hands of the people and re-affirming the Iranian people's support for the reform process. There have also been some modest improvements in the situation of women, notably with the appointment of Iran's first four women judges and its first woman Vice-President. Over 50 per cent. of the university intake in Iran is now female.
<P>

<a name="91207w19.html_para2">However, we and our EU partners have a number of outstanding concerns.

 Reliable estimates for the numbers in receipt of Working Families Tax Credit in North West Norfolk are not available. It is estimated that in 2000-01 for the UK as a whole, the first full year of the Working Families Tax Credit, about 1.4 million families will enjoy the more generous help provided by the new scheme. Families in receipt of the Working Families Tax Credit will receive on average &#163;24 a week more than they would on Family Credit.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w20.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The climate change levy is designed to be revenue neutral for the private sector as a whole, with all the revenues raised being fully recycled back to business through a cut in employers' National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and additional support for energy efficiency measures. The levy package is also expected to be broadly neutral between manufacturing and services.
<P>

<a name="91207w20.html_para2">It is not possible to say what the exact impact of the levy on specific regions will be. That will depend on a number of factors, including, for example, the future energy consumption of firms in the region, the level of employment in those firms, the number of energy intensive sectors in the region, what use firms in the region make of electricity generated from 'new' renewable sources of energy and in 'good quality' combined heat and power plants, and the extent to which firms in the region take advantage of the proposed introduction of a system of enhanced capital allowances for energy saving investments.

 Listed companies are currently required under the Listing Rules to submit announcements to the Exchange's Company Announcements Office for distribution to the public through the Regulatory News Service. Although the Listing Rules do allow for simultaneous notification of announcements to other news organisations, we consider it would be inappropriate to retain this requirement other than for a transitional period when, subject to Parliament approving the necessary legislation, the FSA becomes the Competent Authority for listing. I have therefore asked the FSA to undertake a review of the arrangements for the dissemination of price sensitive information by listed companies and to come forward with amendments to the current Listing Rules requirements in this area. The FSA will be launching a consultation exercise with interested parties to devise alternative arrangements.

 <i>[holding answer 6 December 1999]:</i> An exercise is under way to eradicate the bacterium which causes potato brown rot (<i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i>) from watercourses in East Anglia where it is known to occur, by eliminating woody nightshade plants which act as a host for the bacterium. This work is being carried out in conjunction with the Environment Agency, the British Potato Council and, in the Middle Level drainage area, the Middle Level Commissioners. Information on the project has been sent to all growers with water abstraction licences in the areas concerned.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will ensure that all imported bacon is labelled so as to indicate if it was raised in accord with UK levels of animal welfare.  [100101]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 29 November 1999]:</i> We are consulting all interested parties on guidance aimed at ensuring that country of origin markings on food labels including those on bacon, do not mislead consumers about the true origin of the ingredients used. We also intend to promote changes to European and international labelling rules and advice to ensure that consumers are given accurate information about the true origin of the foods they are buying. In the meantime, we will continue to encourage retailers, caterers and public procurement authorities to source their supplies of pork and pork products to British standards.

<a name="91207w22.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the implementation of "Agenda 2000: A New Direction for Agriculture".  [102025]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91207w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 I announced today a package of measures which will radically redirect support for agriculture in fulfilment of pledges made in our manifesto and subsequently. My announcement focused on one particular aspect--the Rural Development Regulation.
<P>

<a name="91207w22.html_para0">Our decision in implementing options under all of the sectors of the Agenda 2000 reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy will have an important impact upon the future direction of the agricultural industry.
<P>

<a name="91207w22.html_para1"><i>Beef Regime</i>
<P>

<a name="91207w22.html_para2">Under the beef regime, we have decided to use the National Envelope to top up payments to suckler cow producers in the year 2000; the position for future years will be reviewed, in particular to consider the possibility of introducing area-based payments on permanent pasture used for low-density beef production in England.
<P>

<a name="91207w22.html_para3">We will retain the 90-head limit on beef special premium claims and introduce a UK-wide national ceiling against which the need for scale-back will be assessed; both these decisions will be reviewed in the course of the year 2000.
<P>

<a name="91207w22.html_para4">We have also decided to implement the cut in Suckler Cow Premium quota by reducing producers' holdings of quota on a flat-rate basis (probably at around 4 per cent.); producers who have reduced production below their 



<P>
<P><I>7 Dec 1999 : Column: 529W</I><P>
quota level as a result of participation in an EU-funded extensification scheme or who can show that the imposition of the cut would materially jeopardise the success of a development plan in progress on 1 January 2000 may apply for exemption from this quote-cut.
<P>

<a name="91207w22.html_para5">We will increase from the year 2000 onwards the milk quota limit for dairy producers claiming Suckler Cow Premium, from 120,000 kilograms to 180,000 kilograms.
<P>

<a name="91207w22.html_para6">We will apply a less restrictive two-tier model for extensification payments additional to payments under the Beef Special Premium and Suckler Cow Premium Schemes; and assess eligibility for extensification payments on cattle numbers on producers' holdings on six dates each year, notified to producers retrospectively; this method of assessment will be reviewed as and when our cattle database becomes fully operational, when it includes movement details for older animals.
<P>

<a name="91207w22.html_para7"><i>Dairy regime</i>
<P>

<a name="91207w22.html_para8">In relation to the dairy regime, we will be extending the quota leasing deadline from 31 December to 31 March with effect from the next quota year. At the same time, the deadline for processing permanent transfers of quota via a lease of land--though not for other transfers--is 



<P>
<P><I>7 Dec 1999 : Column: 530W</I><P>
being advanced to 1 March in order to ensure that the Intervention Board meets its deadline on the levy calculation. There was no widespread support for the other discretionary provisions set out in the consultation papers and these changes will not be implemented.
<P>

<a name="91207w22.html_para9"><i>Cross-compliance</i>
<P>

<a name="91207w22.html_para10">CAP reforms agreed in Berlin also gave powers for member states to attach specific environmental conditions to agricultural support payments, if they consider this to be appropriate. Our consultation exercise sought views on whether to introduce such conditions. Some relevant considerations in deciding whether to do so are: comprehensibility to farmers; ease of enforcement; environmental benefit; and extent of additional costs or regulatory burden for the generality of farmers.
<P>

<a name="91207w22.html_para11">We are still considering the responses to the England consultation on this issue. However, if following this consideration we identified possible cross-compliance measures, we would hold a further consultation exercise on any specific proposals before introducing them. Meanwhile, we will be retaining our existing cross- compliance measures which the UK has applied for some years, namely the current overgrazing condition in our livestock subsidy regimes and the management conditions for set-aside land.
