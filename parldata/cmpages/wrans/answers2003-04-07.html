<P>
<a name="30407w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) how much of the aggregates levy sustainability fund has been spent in relation to <i>(a)</i> the freight facility grant and <i>(b)</i> the transport action clean up programme; what percentages of the fund these payments represent; and if she will make a statement;  [105342]
<P>
<UL>(2) if she will list the projects <i>(a)</i> approved, <i>(b)</i> rejected and <i>(c)</i> awaiting a decision for funding under the aggregates levy sustainability fund for the stated purpose of (i) supporting cleaner and quieter aggregates lorry transport and (ii) encouraging the use of rail and water transport; what funding has been allocated; when each application was made; and when each decision was made.  [105298]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 March 2003]:</i> None of the aggregates levy sustainability fund has been spent so far on promoting environmentally friendly aggregates transportation. The Department for Transport, which is the distributing body for the freight facilities grant and the transport action clean-up programme, is considering their compatibility with state aid provisions. Around &#163;1 million of the 2002&#150;03 allocation for these schemes has therefore been diverted to funding for reducing the local effects of aggregates extraction.

<a name="30407w01.html_para1">My officials are meeting representatives of Network Rail to discuss their response in more detail.
<P>

<a name="30407w01.html_para2">Last year, in conjunction with Defra, ENCAMS (Environmental Campaigns) carried out a detailed survey of the state of England called the Local Environmental Quality Survey of England (LEQSE). The survey included elements of a range of land uses including transport facilities. ENCAMS are now building on the LEQSE to carry out a similar survey at district level, by local authority. This potentially would allow both the Government and local authorities to identify elements that require further investigation or remedy.

<a name="30407w01.html_sbhd5"><H3 align=center>Landfill Tax Credit Scheme</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Bill O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) how many of the stakeholders she consulted over changes to the landfill tax credit scheme recommended <i>(a)</i> no changes, <i>(b)</i> minimal changes, <i>(c)</i> major changes and <i>(d)</i> abandonment of the scheme;  [106463]
<P>
<UL>(2) if she will make it her policy to ensure that stakeholder opinions are taken into account when deciding upon the successor to the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme.  [106470]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The joint Treasury/Defra consultation on the future of the Landfill Tax Credit scheme went to 3,468 individuals or organisations and generated 683 responses. Of these 550 (82 per cent.) opted for keeping the Scheme as it is or with minor modifications, 59 (9 per cent.) opted for a major change and 58 (9 per cent.) did not comment. A clear majority (65 per cent.) were in favour of increased funding for sustainable waste management projects.
<P>

<a name="30407w01.html_para6">A consistent message also arising from the consultation was the need for a more strategic approach to funding sustainable waste management objectives. The Government fully endorse this view and will set out how they aim to achieve this in their response to the Strategy Unit Report 'Waste Not, Want Not' which will be published shortly. The Government will take into account the opinions of stakeholders in deciding on the new public expenditure programme.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Bill O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) how much money she estimates will be lost from the sustainable waste sector as a result of funding formerly distributed through categories C and CC of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme being distributed by a public body and losing the capacity to be used to draw further funds from private sources;  [106465]
<P>
<UL>(2) what figure she uses to estimate the leverage or gearing ratio between landfill tax credit scheme funding and further funding secured from other sources against it.  [106464]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The evidence available suggests that the vast majority of levered in funds have been directed at projects in category A&#151;land reclamation, category D&#151;public parks and amenities and category E&#151;building restoration. A survey carried out by Glasgow 



<P>
<P><I>7 Apr 2003 : Column 4W</I><P>
Caledonian University involving 1,053 Environmental Bodies (with a 40 per cent. response rate) indicates that over the period 1997&#150;2002, waste management projects (categories C and CC) levered in 34 per cent. of LTCS expenditure from other sources.
<P>

<a name="30407w01.html_para7">The Government believes that a public expenditure programme can work well with private sources (e.g. retailers or equipment manufacturers) to achieve a similar or better increase in total resources. Moreover local authorities can benefit from a public expenditure programme. Government will also be better able to direct how and where funds are spent through the public expenditure programme to ensure they are focused on areas which will contribute towards achieving our overall aims on sustainable waste management identified in the Strategy Unit Report "Waste Not, Want Not".
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Bill O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action she will take to guarantee transparency in a successor to the landfill tax credit scheme.  [106467]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Details of the nature of the new public expenditure programme which will replace some parts of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme will be made alongside the government's official response to the Strategy Unit report, which is planned for around the time of the budget.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Bill O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what consultations she has held to ascertain the <i>(a)</i> nature and <i>(b)</i> scale of (i) the transitional rump fund and (ii) the successor scheme to replace the landfill tax credit scheme.  [106468]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Because the transitional rump fund is a short-term measure and had to be put into place very quickly there was no formal consultation. However, discussions with interested parties did take place and their views have been taken into consideration. As indicated in the Chancellor's Pre-Budget Report, the proposals in the Strategy Unit report "Waste Not, Want Not" have formed the basis of the consultation for the public expenditure scheme. A large number of stakeholders were involved in the production of that report and, since its publication, we have received a number of written comments.

<P>
<a name="30407w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Grogan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement about how the National Air Quality Strategy will be applied to coal fired power stations.  [107035]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w02.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Government's policies and measures for reducing air pollution from industry, transport and other sources are set out in the 'Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland', published in January 2000 and the Addendum to the Strategy, published in February 2003. The Strategy contains ambient air quality standards for nine key pollutants and the dates between 2003 and 2010 by which they should be met. The Environment Agency is responsible for the regulation of larger power stations and other major industrial processes in England and Wales. The Environment Act 1995 requires that the 



<P>
<P><I>7 Apr 2003 : Column 5W</I><P>
Agency takes account of the requirements of the Air Quality Strategy in discharging its pollution control functions.
<P>

<a name="30407w02.html_para0">The larger coal fired power stations are currently regulated by the Environment Agency through the Integrated Pollution Control ("IPC") regime. IPC was established by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and regulates industrial pollution through a system of authorisation. IPC is being superseded by the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control ("IPPC") regime, which implements an EC directive of the same name. Power stations that came into operation before 31 October 1999 will be regulated by IPPC from 2006. New installations or those undergoing substantial change are required to apply for an IPPC permit with immediate effect.
<P>

<a name="30407w02.html_para1">Sulphur dioxide from power stations is controlled by system emission limits that restrict the amount that can be discharged in any given year. Limits are set for individual sites and for companies operating several sites to take account of the potential for local air pollution and long-range pollution. In order that the combined impact of adjacent power stations and other sources will not lead to a breach of the objective, operators are required to develop a local air quality management and monitoring plan which will ensure adherence with the Air Quality Strategy by 2005.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w02.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 I assume that this question refers to implementation options under the revised Large Combustion Plant Directive (2001/80/EC) for plants that were in existence in 1987. We are currently considering whether to implement the revised Directive for these plants by the emission limits approach or by adopting a National Emissions Reduction scheme and will issue a consultation paper in due course. Measures under the Directive would apply to these plants from 2008.

Expenditure on commercial and HMSO publications, including newspapers and periodicals, is now reported as one of a number of general administration costs and could only be separated out for financial year 2002&#150;03 at disproportionate cost.

 There are no funds available through grants from the Ministry of Defence which individual members of the public or organisations may apply for. Such funding that is available relates mostly to professionally provided welfare, health and social services by charitable organisations such as the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association&#151;Forces Help, who provide services at the specific request of the Ministry of Defence. Other organisations which received similar funding in the last financial year included the Women's Royal Voluntary Service and Relate. In financial year 2000&#150;2001 the Ministry of Defence provided almost 18 million in grant funding to such organisations.

 The Order of Battle for the Iraq theatre of operations comprises elements of all three Services, including reserves.

The amphibious package comprised Headquarters three Commando Brigade, 40 Commando Royal Marines and 42 Commando Royal Marines with supporting elements. The land force comprised Head Quarters 1(UK) Armoured Division, with support from 7 Armoured Brigade, 16 Air Assault Brigade and 102 Logistics Brigade. And the air package comprised a fixed wing force of around 100 aircraft and a rotary wing force from the Joint Helicopter Command of 77 helicopters.

 The announcement made by my right hon.

Consequently, they are not available for operations overseas as they continue to be committed to providing essential fire and rescue cover, should there be another strike.
<P>

<a name="30407w04.html_para0">The Ministry of Defence does, however, keep the operation under constant review to ensure that emergency fire cover is provided effectively and with the minimum impact on the Armed Forces. Based on the experience of the last 15 days of strike action, it has been agreed with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Chief and Assistant Chief Fire Officers Association (CACFOA), the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and HM Fire Service Inspectorate (HMFSI) that a reduction in the number of Armed Forces personnel committed to Operation Fresco from some 19,000 to around 16,000 can now be made. This reduction is made possible by revising shift patterns, reducing manning levels on fire appliances and amalgamating a number of Joint Operational Control Centres.

 The Consumer Credit Act licensing provisions cover a number of credit activities in addition to lending, for example, credit brokerage and debt collection.
<P>

<a name="30407w04.html_para12">The number of traders in possession of a current licence to lend money under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 is 102,476. The total number of current licences is approximately 215,000. (Traders can hold more than one category of licence). Since 1996, traders have been permitted to apply for a licence covering all the six categories licensable activity and, therefore, the figure I have just given will include traders who, although licensed to do so, do not actually lend money. In addition, the Consumer Credit Act licensing provisions do not apply to traders who only lend amounts in excess of &#163;25,000.

 The Government believe that sport can play a valuable part in achieving a range of social objectives such as alleviating economic and social deprivation, reducing crime, improving health and tackling social exclusion. This policy was set out in The Government's Plan for Sport and re-iterated in the joint DCMS/Strategy Unit report&#151;Game Plan published in December last year.
<P>

<a name="30407w07.html_para0">A number of measures to-achieve these objectives are in place. The policy-directions issued by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State require Sport England, in considering applications for Lottery funding, to have regard to their scope for reducing economic and social deprivation, to promoting access to sport for people from all sections of society and to promoting a knowledge and interest in sport in children and young people. Programmes such as Space for Sport and the Arts, the New Opportunities Fund School PE and Sport funding, the PE, School Sport and Club Links initiative and the Community Club Development programme are all targeted at deprived areas and at under-represented groups such as people with disabilities, ethnic minorities and women.
<P>

<a name="30407w07.html_para1">Sport England is involved in a range of initiatives and programmes which target deprivation and social inclusion. Its Lottery strategy provides for 50 per cent. of its funding to be directed to areas of greatest need and its Active Communities Development Fund specifically aims to increase participation amongst women and girls, people on low incomes, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities. It also works in close partnership with a range of organisations including the Home Office on Positive Futures, a programme which aims to reduce crime, anti-social behaviour and drug taking among 10&#150;16 year olds, and the Commission for Racial Equality on the Sporting Equals programme which aims to promote racial equality in sport.

<P>
<a name="30407w08.html_spnew3"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 In line with its wider approach to keeping burdens on business to a minimum, the Government seek to ensure that regulatory requirements on the alcohol trade are fair and proportionate, offering as much flexibility to businesses as possible while preventing unacceptable revenue losses.
<P>

<a name="30407w08.html_para4">The law endows Customs and Excise with the ability to exercise discretion over approvals of excise warehouses, and requires them to deploy that discretion in a fair, equitable and reasonable way. Customs have a responsibility to businesses to ensure consistency of treatment. To this end, they have developed and published a policy on the types of premises to which they would normally grant approval. One of the conditions for approval under this policy is that businesses must meet laid-down minimum throughput criteria, which have been in place since 1980, and which were converted into the current monetary criteria in 1996. There are, therefore, no new guidelines on throughput criteria for excise warehouses.
<P>

<a name="30407w08.html_para5">These criteria help ensure that a fair balance is struck between facilitating the trade in allowing traders to store goods in duty suspense, and minimising the cost to the Exchequer of allowing duty to be deferred after production or importation of excise goods, and the cost of controlling these premises. Without throughput criteria, any off-licence, tobacconist or supermarket would be eligible for excise warehouse approval and would be able to store its stock without payment of duty up until the time it was removed to its shop shelves. This would increase costs for Customs in assuring and collecting the duty from such a large number of warehouses, would delay the duty point with a consequent effect on revenue cash-flow, and would potentially provide unacceptably widespread opportunities for alcohol fraud.
<P>

<a name="30407w08.html_para6">To support this approach, a further condition was introduced which established that premises used for a retail business could not also be an excise warehouse.

 The Government have already introduced a range of measures to promote energy efficiency in the home. Budget 2000 reduced the rate of VAT to 5 per cent. on the grant-funded installation of new central heating systems and heating appliances. Budget 2002 extended the reduced rate of VAT to the grant-funded installation of factory-insulated hot water tanks, micro combined heat and power systems, and renewable energy heating systems in the homes of the less well-off.
<P>

<a name="30407w09.html_para1">Budget 2001 introduced 100 per cent. first-year enhanced capital allowances (ECAs) for designated energy-saving plant and machinery.
<P>

<a name="30407w09.html_para2">The ECA scheme enables businesses to write-off the whole cost of their investment in designated energy-saving equipment against the taxable profits of the period during which the investment is made. In the commercial sector, energy service companies can claim ECAs on their spending on qualifying equipment. Special rules enable them to claim allowances where, as part of a comprehensive energy services agreement, they provide equipment that becomes a fixture on another person's land in which they have no interest.
<P>

<a name="30407w09.html_para3">The Government's Affordable Warmth Programme supports the installation of modern energy efficient central heating systems in low- income homes, including registered social landlord homes. The equipment is leased to the landlord and where the equipment is designated energy-saving equipment. Special rules enable the lessor to claim the enhanced capital allowances. The benefit can be passed on in the form of lower rental charges.
<P>

<a name="30407w09.html_para4">The Government consulted on economic instruments to improve household energy efficiency during 2002 and a summary of responses has been published on the 



<P>
<P><I>7 Apr 2003 : Column 31W</I><P>
Treasury website. In his pre-Budget report in November 2002 the Chancellor announced that the Government will consult further on specific measures to promote greater energy efficiency by households, once the responses to the initial consultation have been fully considered.
<P>

<a name="30407w09.html_para5">The Government have also introduced other measures to improve energy efficiency and tackle fuel poverty in the domestic sector, including the Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC) and Warm Front. This commitment requires gas and electricity suppliers to encourage and assist their domestic customers to reduce energy consumption and to meet targets for quantified energy savings. At least 50 per cent. of the benefits from the EEC currently go to households on income and disability related benefits.
<P>

<a name="30407w09.html_para6">Since its launch in June 2000, the Warm Front Scheme, which provides packages of insulation and heating measures worth up to &#163;2,500 to private sector households in receipt of certain benefits, has assisted over half a million households, helping improve the comfort levels and living conditions of some of the most vulnerable members of society.

 There has been no change to the underlying tax rules that are used when determining the mutual trading status of health cash plan providers. Tax exemption continues to apply to providers which meet the requirements for mutual trading or which have amended their constitutions and membership rules in order to comply with them.
<P>

<a name="30407w09.html_para9">The Inland Revenue reviewed the status of these organisations in 2000, following an inquiry which discovered that the conditions of mutual trading were not being met by some providers.

<P>

<a name="30407w09.html_para10">No representations were made to Treasury Ministers during the Inland Revenue review. Inland Revenue held discussions with the representative body of these providers, and offered not to apply the changed treatment retrospectively and to allow a grace period for the providers to decide how to operate in future.

<a name="30407w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The White Paper "Respect and Responsibility", published on 12 March, sets out the Government's vision for tackling anti-social behaviour.




<P>
<P><I>7 Apr 2003 : Column 36W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30407w10.html_para5">The White Paper represents a cross-cutting agenda being taken forward by a number of Government Departments. It has been informed by the experience of local authorities, the police, voluntary organisations, and communities up and down the country. We will continue to work closely with local authorities, the police and others to ensure that effective action is taken to deal with anti-social behaviour.

 <i>[holding answer 4 April 2003]:</i> A final assessment of all responses received during the consultation period is still being undertaken, but the figure is well in excess of 2,000.
<P>

<a name="30407w10.html_para6">Copies of every response received will not, as a matter of routine, be placed in the Library. It would be disproportionate in cost to provide such a large volume of paper records.

<a name="30407w10.html_para7">In accordance with current policy on written public consultation, we will be publishing a summary of the views received and individual contributions will be made available on request, unless the contributor has asked for confidentiality or that such publication would unfairly affect third party interests or privacy.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the EU Directives and Regulations which have been implemented by his Department since 17 April 2002.  [106842]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w10.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Home Office plays a leading role in the UK's EU policy on asylum and immigration. Since 17 April 2002, the Home Office has implemented, on the basis of provisions in existing legislation, Council Directive 2001/51/EC of 28 June 2001 supplementing the provisions of Article 26 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement. Notification to the effect was sent to the Commission on 16 January 2003.
<P>

<a name="30407w10.html_para8">EC Regulations are, in general, directly applicable in the member states, without the need for further incorporation into national law. However, some Regulations may require UK measures to make them workable and enforceable. The legislative changes required to implement the EURODAC Regulation were made in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, effective from 11 December 2000, by virtue of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (Commencement No. 8 and Transitional Provisions) Order 2000. Implementation was completed when the centralised EURODAC fingerprint database became operational on 15 January 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Home Office has lead responsibility for the police forces covered by the Police Acts 1996 and 1997. Lead responsibility for other police forces resides with the relevant Government Department. However, wherever there are issues, including funding issues, that impact either on the relationship between such non-territorial police forces and the regular police forces in England and Wales, or on policing generally, the Home Office will discuss these issues with the relevant lead Department to endeavour to deliver the best joined-up policing on the ground.

 There are a number of ways in which the UK Government are improving understanding of the challenges faced by African countries in tackling HIV and AIDS. Working at a country level, many of our bilateral programmes are supporting National AIDS Councils to generate knowledge&#151;helping to build capacity in developing strategies that are based on sound evidence, to prevent the spread of HIV, care for those already living with HIV/AIDS, and to mitigate

against the impact of the disease. At a regional level, the International Partnership against AIDS in Africa (IPAA), a DFID funded initiative, is also helping to build governments' understanding of the epidemic so they can scale up their country responses, and assisting in the sharing of lessons learnt across the region.
<P>

<a name="30407w11.html_para1">More specifically, in South Africa DFID is co-funding (with USAID and AusAid) a number of research papers into the economic impact of HIV/AIDS. We plan to undertake similar knowledge generation in Kenya and Malawi.
<P>

<a name="30407w11.html_para2">My Department is also supporting the UNAIDS' initiative 'AIDS In Africa&#151;Scenarios for the Future'. This innovative project aims to map out the possible impact of HIV/AIDS epidemic on Africa in the next 20 years in order to identify what needs to be done to alter the course of events.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w11.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department recognises that HIV/AIDS is a terrible human catastrophe and is one of the most important development challenges facing Africa. Over &#163;180 million was committed to programmes focusing on HIV/AIDS and sexual health interventions in sub-Saharan Africa last year, with intensive bi-lateral action in Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Over &#163;25 million has been committed to support the International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa (IPAA) initiative&#151;a regional, Africa-led initiative aimed at building Governments' national responses to the AIDS crisis, with a focus on Ethiopia, Rwanda, Burundi, and Ghana. In addition to working with governments, DFID also supports the efforts of non-governmental and civil society organisations in their efforts at preventing the spread of HIV, caring for those already living with the disease, and working to mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS on people's lives. Support is given through DFID's Challenge Fund and Partnership Programme Agreements, with international NGOs, as well as directly to local NGOs and civil society organisations through our in-country programmes.

 I have contacted all OECD Development Ministers to ask them to do more to help Zimbabwe and have increased the UK's contribution, which now stands at &#163;51 million since September 2001. As a part of this, DFID has provided &#163;18.3 million in support of the World Food Programme's emergency operation, which is currently feeding almost five million Zimbabweans.

<P>
<P>

 Between April 2002 and March 2003, DFID spent &#163;292,957 on promotional activity to raise development awareness, and &#163;137,837 on the promotion of initiatives such as DFID's Public Service Agreement and HIV/AIDS Awareness to DFID staff in the UK and overseas.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how much money was pledged by donors in Tokyo for Afghan reconstruction in 2002; how much money has been received for Afghan reconstruction; and how much of this money has been spent on (i) relief and (ii) reconstruction and development.  [106917]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w12.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 At the Tokyo conference in January 2002 donors pledged US$4.5 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance over one to five years. As some donors made multi year pledges it is difficult to place a specific figure on how much of this aid was designated for 2002. However, over $1.8 billion was disbursed last year, with many donors providing more than their single year pledges or front-loading multi year pledges.
<P>

<a name="30407w12.html_para3">It is very difficult to sustain a meaningful distinction between relief and reconstruction and development assistance to Afghanistan. We estimate that up to 50 per cent. of assistance last year was for humanitarian assistance.The trend towards a larger proportion of assistance being directed towards long term development will continue in the next and future years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w12.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Urbanisation is a common phenomenon in developing countries in Asia. The situation is made particularly acute in Afghanistan by a combination of a shortage of shelter, due to the destruction of buildings caused by decades of conflict, and an increase in demand, caused by internal displacement of people to the cities and the return of 1.7 million Afghan refugees in 2002. 1.2 million more are expected to return in 2003. Limited or lack of employment opportunities in the rural areas add to the problem, with many rural inhabitants migrating to the cities.




<P>
<P><I>7 Apr 2003 : Column 43W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30407w12.html_para4">Lack of adequate shelter in informal urban settlements is a major humanitarian concern in Afghanistan. This was particularly serious during the recent winter months. The UN, working with local Afghans as well as international NGOs, have been providing assistance to meet humanitarian needs throughout Afghanistan, including in these urban areas and in particular through their recent successful Winterisation Programme. For example, UNHCR is assisting in the sustainable re-integration of returning refugees. Their assistance includes immediate needs including cash, and shelter kits. UNICEF is also working to provide shelter, water/sanitation, health, nutrition, and education.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w12.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of the rights of Afghan women outside Kabul.  [106923]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w12.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The rights of Afghan women remain a concern throughout Afghanistan, although we welcome the recent signing on 5 March of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The UK will help Afghanistan to implement CEDAW, with access to services by women and girls being monitored as in those reconstruction programmes that we support. Access to healthcare and education for women and girls in rural areas continues to be a problem, although 1.5 million girls have returned to school as part of the ATA and UNICEF's Back-to School programme.
<P>

<a name="30407w12.html_para5">Women's rights and access to services often vary between regions and provinces, however. In the north, for example, women hold senior positions in local government ministries and have influence in the local community. About a third of teachers in the north are women, and mixed classes of boys and girls are permitted. Approximately 30 per cent. of the students are girls.
<P>

<a name="30407w12.html_para6">In other areas of the country, with different ethnic balances and different cultural and religious norms the situation is less advanced. We are concerned about the recent decree from Ishmael Khan in Herat, enforcing strict gender segregation in schools. As there is a shortage of female teachers in Herat, we understand that this may prevent women and girls from receiving an education.

 Despite the 2 December 2002 ceasefire agreement with the FDD, fighting continues in Burundi. Moreover the FNL still remain outside the peace process. We welcome President Buyoya's decision to step down on 1 May, thereby honouring the provisions of the Arusha Accord settingup the transitional government. The early deployment of the African mission force is central to achieving a full ceasefire and the smooth transition of power after the 1 May

<P>

<a name="30407w12.html_para7">The humanitarian situation in Burundi is very poor, with very high levels of disease, high rates of malnutrition and, resulting from this, high levels of mortality. There are serious problems of access to some communities. DFID committed &#163;1.9 million to Burundi last financial year, made up of &#163;1 million in humanitarian interventions and &#163;0.9 million for peace building activities. Our humanitarian interventions have focused on nutrition and health support, channelled through international NGOs and UN agencies. The EC provided humanitarian funding totalling US$ 15.7 million (about &#163;10.12 million) in 2002. The 2003 Community budget for humanitarianassistance totals US$ 15 million (about &#163;9.67 million).

<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w13.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The trafficking of people is part of a wider set of issues related to the migration of poor people to better their lives, and to their vulnerability to national and international smugglers and traffickers. Trafficking is an international problem requiring co-ordinated action. DFID's role is to work to eliminate the poverty and social injustice that can lead to such abuse. Through our programmes to promote sustainable development and end poverty, DFID is helping to reduce the circumstances that give rise to this appalling trade, and which make women and children especially vulnerable. With other Government Departments, we are supporting the efforts of Governments and international agencies to strengthen social protection policies and justice systems in line with the international treaty framework covering these issues.
<P>

<a name="30407w13.html_para2">For example, in SE Asia, we are supporting the International Labour Organisation's work to reduce the trafficking of women in Laos, Thailand, China (Yunnan), Cambodia and Vietnam. It involves a number of interlinked interventions to raise awareness and prevent the trade. In the Balkans we recently supported the International Organisation for Migration in training the various agencies dealing with trafficked people, including police, social workers and the legal profession, in order to create and disseminate models of good practice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The provisions for local highway maintenance are through the Highways Maintenance Formula for Standing Spending element of Revenue Support Grant and through the Local Transport Plan capital settlement.
<P>

<a name="30407w14.html_para4">It is for local authorities to determine their own priorities for highway maintenance spending, and no separate provisions for bicycle lanes are made. As these lanes form part of a vehicular highway, they would normally be maintained in conjunction with the rest of the carriageway, and this makes deriving separate expenditure figures difficult.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 provides officers of the British Transport Police (BTP) with jurisdiction outside the railways in certain, specified circumstances. The number of incidents where BTP officers respond in such circumstances accounts for some 1 per cent. of their activities each year. The costs are absorbed within BTP's budget and are offset by the assistance provided to BTP by local police forces for which BTP are not charged.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The British Transport Police (BTP) Committee sets the budget for the force and the users of the BTP, such as London Underground, Network Rail and the train operating companies provide the necessary funding.
<P>

<a name="30407w14.html_para5">Where the BTP contributes to national policing initiatives and wider public benefits are available, the Government accepts that central funding can be justified.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the total level of Rail Passenger Partnership funding to be paid by the Strategic Rail Authority during the financial year 2003&#150;04, with particular reference to the nature of the schemes to which any such funding would be directed.  [104493]<P>

<P>
<a name="30407w15.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority's (SRA's) budget for Rail Passenger Partnership schemes in 2003&#150;04 is &#163;20 million of which &#163;16.3 million is currently committed. Funding is directed to the provision of new or enhanced local and regional rail services that cannot be justified on financial grounds alone but which contribute to the Government's wider objectives for rail, including modal shift and integration with other modes.

 The information cannot readily be provided in precisely the form requested. The table as follows sets out details of RPP scheme applications in 2002&#150;03, their current status and the amount of SRA and non-SRA support involved in the case of schemes that have been approved. The level of funding for schemes prior to approval stage is liable tochange.
<P>

<a name="30407w15.html_para5">Schemes may be deferred, cancelled or rejected for a number of reasons, such as failure to meet SRA's value for money and affordability criteria, failure to attract adequate sponsorship from non-SRA sources, and withdrawal of the application by the sponsor.

 The Government have long been committed to greater openness in the EU institutions. This was a key theme of the UK Presidencies in 1992 and 1998. Making it easier to gain access to non-sensitive documents is crucial to this. The Government welcome Regulation 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. As a result, more documents are released to the public, while genuinely sensitive documents are given the protection they need.
<P>

<a name="30407w17.html_para2">Much of the council's work takes place in preparatory bodies, including working groups.
<P>

<a name="30407w17.html_para3">Accountability and transparency of council business to Parliament are ensured by the scrutiny process, to which the Government are also firmly committed.
<P>

<a name="30407w17.html_para4">We strongly supported the measures agreed at the Seville European Council to make the council more open when in legislating mode. We remain committed to increasing transparency. The Future of Europe Convention is also looking at ways to make the EU more open.

<a name="30407w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The rights of children worldwide are a central part of our human rights policy. The UK ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991. We support its full implementation by all governments. We regularly raise our concerns about street children bilaterally and with our EU Partners. We are backing a number of practical projects in the region to improve respect for and protection of children's rights.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1) what progress has been made since representations by his Department in February 1999 to the Canadian Government in ensuring that the numbers of seals killed each year does not threaten the sustainability of the species;  [107678]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the impact of the annual Canadian slaughter of seal pups on the wild population; whether he has raised this issue with the Canadian authorities; and if he will make a statement.  [107681]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 No formal representations have been made since February 1999 but the FCO has been monitoring the situation and has made the Canadian Government aware of our concerns. Any seal cull should be sustainable and based on the precautionary approach. The Canadian Government has recently announced their Seal Management Plan for 2003&#150;2005 where quotas have been increased compared to previous years. The plan will be available to the public and government officials will assess the data on which the new quotas are based. After such an assessment has been carried out the FCO will review the situation.

 We are concerned about torture in Sudan. We part-fund the work of the Sudanese Organisation Against Torture (SOAT) which monitors incidences.

The latest available data are shown in the first table as follows. HEFCE do not calculate these figures by social class.

The IER differs from the API in both coverage and method of calculation. The API calculates the proportion of UK domiciled students who enter full-time HE by the age of 20; the IER calculates the proportion of English domiciled students

<sup>(10)</sup> New student support arrangements were introduced from academic year 1998&#150;99. New students in 1998&#150;99 (apart from certain specified exceptions) received support for maintenance expenditure through means-tested grants (comprising about a quarter of the support available) and non income-assessed student loans (comprising about three quarters of the support available). From 1999&#150;2000 students who entered higher education after 1998&#150;99 received support for maintenance expenditure through loans, of which approximately three quarters of the value was non income-assessed. Loans made under these arrangements are repayable on an income contingent basis. The ratio of support for mandatory award holders, i.e. those who entered higher education up to 1997&#150;98, was roughly 50 per cent. means-tested grant and 50 per cent. non means-tested loan repayable on a mortgage style basis.<P>

 The Spending review settlement for higher education in England for the years 2002&#150;03 to 2005&#150;06 is set out in the table on page 19 of the White Paper 'The future of higher education' (Cm 5735). That table shows a 31per cent. increase in expenditure between those two years, an element of which accounts for the increase in student numbers over that period. The increase in participation towards 50 per cent. of those aged 18&#150;30, will come mainly through two-year work-focussed foundation degrees.

<a name="30407w18.html_para4">The cost of higher education per student varies according to the subject, type and length of their course. The overall costs of increasing student numbers beyond 2005&#150;06 will therefore depend on their pattern of study.

<P>
<a name="30407w19.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 DfES is the lead Department for 16 of the commitments under the Government's National Strategy Action Plan for neighbourhood renewal. In addition to these commitments, the implications of the neighbourhood renewal strategy have an impact across a wide range of the Department's programmes, which are increasingly geared towards closing the gap between the most deprived neighbourhoods and the rest, in terms of educational achievement and skills. This means that, of the &#163;23 billion total planned programme spend in 2002&#150;03, progressively more than before is being spent on deprived neighbourhoods.

 Research carried out by Professor David Jesson (University of York) shows that the performance of each cohort of specialist schools and City Technology Colleges (from 1994&#150;2001) has improved more than non-specialist schools at the time, with the exception of the 1996 and 1997 cohorts, as in the following table. This research excluded grammar schools, which, however, form a very similar percentage of both specialist schools and non-specialist schools.

<a name="30407w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The cost of travel by train by staff within my Department in 2002 was approximately &#163;5 million. Departmental staff have a responsibility to give due consideration to cost when planning any official travel and extensive guidance is provided on how to get the best out of official travel. This guidance covers items such as method of travel, environmental impact and effective use of time.

<i>[holding answer 4 April 2003]:</i> The Standards Fund is a programme of Government grants to local education authorities to support a range of national education priorities, such as the national literacy and numeracy strategies, support for Specialist Schools, measures to raise the level of achievement of pupils from ethnic minorities, the Excellence in Cities initiative and capital projects. The grant is paid to local education authorities and most is then devolved to schools. Funding is distributed according to the requirements of each grant and there is no maximum entitlement. A local education authority will not necessarily receive an allocation for every Standards Fund priority. For example, not all authorities are part of the Excellence in Cities initiative, which is designed to raise performance through a targeted programme addressing the educational problems of our major cities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what his estimate is of the time needed to repay a student loan after 2006 on the assumptions of <i>(a)</i> a top-up fee of &#163;3,000 a year, <i>(b)</i> average earnings through the repayment period and <i>(c)</i> current levels of income taxation and inflation.  [105304]<P>

<P>
<a name="30407w20.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The repayments on student loans vary according to the income of the individual borrower. The time taken by an individual to repay a student loan will depend upon many factors such as: the amount borrowed; their salary and the rate of growth of their earnings each year as they progress through their career; and whether they take a career break or experience spells of unemployment (when no repayments would be made because their income would be too low), it will also depend on whether they make any additional voluntary repayments from their own resources or from their employer.

<a name="30407w20.html_para2">In recent years, there has been a shift away from four-year undergraduate courses of initial teacher training towards three-year courses. In 1998&#150;99, 70 per cent. of new undergraduate trainees started four-year courses and 23 per cent. three-year courses. By 2002&#150;03, only 53 per cent. of new undergraduates were starting four-year courses and 43 per cent. three-year courses. Between 4&#150;8 per cent. of undergraduate entrants have begun courses of other lengths each year since 1998&#150;99. There has also been a progressive shift from undergraduate teacher training to the Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) route. In the five years up to 2002&#150;03, the number of students on PGCE courses rose by 34 per cent., from 17,415 to 23,324. Together, these factors have more than compensated for the fall in the numbers of trainees starting four-year undergraduate courses.

 Both the Department for Social Development and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive recognise that the numbers of those presenting as homeless are increasing. However, homelessness is not just about bricks and mortar and many of the causes leading to homelessness are not within the control of either the Department or the Housing Executive.

 The consultation process on proposals for legislation which will enhance the educational opportunities of children and young people in Northern Ireland with special educational needs and disabilities has been completed. Consideration is currently being given to the content of such legislation in light of the responses to the consultative document and views expressed at consultation meetings. It is expected that draft legislation will be issued before the Summer and this will be the subject of further consultation. It is intended to introduce an Order in Council at Westminster or a Bill in the Northern Ireland Assembly towards the end of 2003, with a view to beginning implementation of the legislation in September 2004.

 A Needs and Effectiveness Review of Housing last year questioned the accuracy of the Net Stock Model which is the means for determining the level of new build social housing. Accordingly, the Department for Social Development commissioned research through the Northern Ireland Housing Executive with the aim of developing a more robust model, one that would identify housing need and demand over a 10-year period. The research, which will review and analyse the most recent demographic trends emerging from the 2001 census as well as the most up to date economic and social trends, will be available later this year. Clearly, the results of this work will be essential in helping inform decisions about the future level of new build social housing.

 The accounting systems that record payments to organisations that supply consultancy and other professional services to DWP are not able to provide disaggregated figures in the level of detail required, without encountering significant disproportionate cost. Such information is as follows:

DWP accounting systems do not currently allow us to reliably disaggregate expenditure by contract under this heading, so this figure does not solely reflect expenditure on consultancy. The Department is in the process of introducing systems which should rectify this problem (a legacy of the creation of the Department in 2001 and of the Department of Social Security and Employment Service Accounting Systems) and allow us to record this data more accurately in future.

This was due, we believe, to the inability of DWPs current accounting system to disaggregate expenditure on consultancy and professional services by contract.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what measures have been taken to reduce pensioner poverty since 1997; and what proposals he has to ensure that these measures are fully implemented.  [106093]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w22.html_spnew11"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We are taking action to tackle pensioner poverty and ensure that all pensioners share in the nation's prosperity. This is why our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners and why it is right to target more money on them through the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG): from April 2003 no pensioner will have to get by on less than &#163;102.10 (&#163;155.80 for couples). Rates will be linked to earnings throughout this Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30407w22.html_para11">We know that there is no single measure of pensioner poverty which is a complex, multi-dimensional issue, affecting many aspects of pensioners' lives. But providing a decent income is key. So we will be spending 



<P>
<P><I>7 Apr 2003 : Column 90W</I><P>
around &#163;7&#189; billion extra on pensioners in 2003&#150;04 as a result of the measures introduced since 1997. This includes around &#163;3&#189; billion on the poorest third of pensioners&#151;the very people who need help most, and is almost six times as much as an earnings link to the basic state pension since 1998 would have given them.
<P>

<a name="30407w22.html_para12">When Pension Credit replaces the MIG in October 2003, pensioners will, for the first time, be rewarded, not penalised, for saving. Pension Credit is radically different from MIG in that pound for pound deductions will be scrapped. Pension Credit will reward those with weekly incomes up to &#163;139.08 for single pensioners, and &#163;203.80 for couples. At the same time, further increases are proposed&#151;above inflation&#151;to the Pensioners' Tax Allowances.
<P>

<a name="30407w22.html_para13">Other measures have also been introduced to help tackle pensioner poverty. For example, in September 1997 the level of VAT on fuel was cut from 8 per cent. to 5 per cent., reducing a typical customer's fuel bill by around &#163;16 a year, at a cost to the Government of &#163;450 million a year. Winter Fuel Payments (WFP) will be &#163;200 for each eligible household for the remainder of this Parliament&#151;around 7.9 million households and 11.3 million individuals will benefit from WFPs in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="30407w22.html_para14">We have introduced various measures to ensure that the initiatives we have introduced are fully implemented. For example, we have undertaken a take-up campaign to encourage those pensioners who are entitled to it to claim the MIG. This has put an average &#163;20 a week extra in the pockets of 149,000 people who would not have received it otherwise. We have also reduced the MIG claim form from 40 pages to 10 and introduced a claim line for the MIG, which enables customers to contact the claim line by using a freephone number. The line has dealt with over one million inquiries.
<P>

<a name="30407w22.html_para15">Our commitment to encourage pensioners to claim Pension Credit can be seen in the fact that the Spending Review 2002 introduced a Public Service Agreement target to pay Pension Credit to at least three million pensioner households by 2006. We have introduced a comprehensive strategy to achieve this. Measures, include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Transferring existing MIG recipients to Pension Credit ready for payments to be made from October 2003
<P>
<BR>

<a name="30407w22.html_para16">The Households Below Average Income (HBAI) figures published on 13 March 2003 suggest that our strategy is succeeding. The figures continue to show large falls in the number of pensioners on absolute low income

(before and after housing costs) since 1997. The absolute low income figures numbers are down from 2.7 million (1996&#150;07) to 1.1 million pensioners (2001&#150;02), a decline of over 60 per cent. on the after housing costs measure.
<P>

<a name="30407w22.html_para17">Also, there has been a reduction of 0.4 million pensioners living in relative low-income households (after housing costs). This has been achieved even at a time of rapid growth in general prosperity that we've seen since 1997. Pensioners are therefore sharing in the country's rising prosperity. In fact on one measure, pensioners have more than kept pace with rising incomes overall&#151;the number of pensioners below 60 per cent. of median income (after housing costs) is down by around 15 per cent. since 1996&#150;97 (2.7 to 2.2 million pensioners).

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what steps are being taken to inform British people living abroad of the reduction in inherited SERPS, including the transitional arrangements and the compensation procedures.  [106192]<P>

<P>
<a name="30407w23.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 For those customers living overseas and affected by the reduction in Inherited SERPS, The Pension Service wrote to embassies, expat organisations, including website editors with full details of the transitional arrangements. As part of a concerted advertising campaign on-line banner adverts on websites were introduced which were only accessible overseas. These adverts were directly linked to the SERPS information pages on The Pension Service website. Press adverts appeared in the national press and TV listings during the advertising campaign, these publications are widely read overseas, latest figures show around 800,000 a day.
<P>

<a name="30407w23.html_para0">The Pension Service wrote to everyone who made inquiries about compensation. The majority of people who complained they had not been told about the original changes were either over pension age already or would reach pension age before October 2002. As a result they were not affected by the revised arrangements. The availability of compensation is signposted in The Pension Service complaints leaflets and full details of the scheme are publicly available on the internet. No specific action was taken to target British people living abroad with information about the compensation procedures when executing the advertising campaign, because it would not have been effective.
<P>

<a name="30407w23.html_para1">There is absolutely no requirement for people, other than those receiving benefits, to report changes of address to the Department. As a result the addresses held on Departmental systems, particularly those for people of working age, are not reliable. Addresses for people abroad are even less reliable than those of people living in the UK. This meant that direct mailing to people abroad would not have been effective. The local rate call telephone number was not available to people abroad, nor was the freepost return envelope service, so any direct mailing to people abroad would have been far more complicated to run operationally We therefore considered that other channels of communication, particularly advertising and internet, would be more productive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w23.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what measures are in place to reduce social exclusion among older people and to enable them to take a fuller part in society.  [106094]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w23.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Government are committed to putting in place policies that will help older people play their full part in our society. A wide range of measures have already been introduced to tackle social exclusion among older people, a multi-dimensional problem, requiring a multi-agency response. Initiatives so far have included targeted service improvements as well as targeted benefit improvements.
<P>

<a name="30407w23.html_para2">One of our key measures in reducing social exclusion among older people is tackling pensioner poverty.
<P>

<a name="30407w23.html_para3">The Government will be spending around &#163;7.5 billion extra on pensioners in 2003&#150;04 as a result of the measures introduced since 1997. This includes around &#163;3.5 billion on the poorest third of pensioners&#151;the very people who need help most. This is almost six times as much as an earnings link to the basic state pension since 1998 would have given them. From April 2003, basic state pension will be &#163;77.45 for singles&#151;(&#163;123.80 for couples). An increase of &#163;100 a year for single people and &#163;160 a year for couples. In future years the basic state pension will increase by 2.5 per cent. or the level of the September RPI, whichever is higher. Nearly four million households with someone aged 75 or over will benefit from free TV licences, worth around &#163;116 per year.
<P>

<a name="30407w23.html_para4">We also recognised that we have to do something for the poorest pensioners; that is why we introduced the minimum income guarantee (MIG). As a result, nearly two million people are benefiting from MIG and the take up campaign has put an average &#163;20 a week extra in the pockets of around 149,000 people who would not have received it otherwise.
<P>

<a name="30407w23.html_para5">We are now going a step further and introducing pension credit from October 2003 which will reward not penalise saving. It will be easy to apply for and will remove the indignity of the intrusive and bureaucratic weekly means test.
<P>

<a name="30407w23.html_para6">As a consequence of this change, those pensioners in receipt of pension credit will receive an average extra income of &#163;400 a year&#151;and at last the savings of those who are just above the MIG level are being recognised.
<P>

<a name="30407w23.html_para7">Following the Spending Review 2002, a Public Service Agreement target is now in place to pay pension credit to at least three million pensioner households by 2006. We have carefully devised a strategy to ensure maximum take-up of pension credit.
<P>

<a name="30407w23.html_para8">Winter fuel payments (WFP) are an important strand of the Fuel Poverty Strategy. Around 7.9 million households and 11.3 million individuals have benefited from the &#163;200 WFP to each eligible household in 2002&#150;03. The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme will have helped around 480,000 vulnerable pensioner households, by 2004. Further measures include a reduced level of VAT on fuel and on the installation of energy saving materials so that people can more easily afford to keep warm.




<P>
<P><I>7 Apr 2003 : Column 93W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30407w23.html_para9">But social exclusion is not just about tackling poverty, we are also actively promoting more engagement and participation of older people in public life and the community through our support for the Better Government for Older People Network. This has established partnerships across Government and is contributing to improvements in the delivery of services for older people at a local level. In addition, the Older People Advisory Group is becoming established at a basis for national, regional and local engagement with older people.
<P>

<a name="30407w23.html_para10">In the health and social care field we have introduced a National Service Framework for Older People setting clear national standards to ensure that older people receive the care, priority and attention that they should, root out age discrimination and promote health and active living among older people. In public transport, we have introduced for pensioners a free bus pass with a minimum half fare on local bus services. Recognising it plays a vital role in helping them remain active members of our communities, as well as keeping them in touch with friends and relatives.
<P>

<a name="30407w23.html_para11">In combating crime we are targeting crime against older people. The Distraction Burglary Task Force has brought together a wide range of organisations including the police, voluntary organisations, the utility companies, banks and local authorities, to gather data, publicise good practice, raise awareness and provide guidance for victims and those at risk of this type of burglary.
<P>

<a name="30407w23.html_para12">Providing opportunities to work are also key to tackling social exclusion. We have launched the Age Positive campaign aimed at employers and individuals to raise awareness of best practice and the business benefits of an age diverse workforce, using the Code of Practice on Age Diversity. The Experience Corps is aimed at encouraging older people to become involved in their communities through volunteering. The Learning and Skills Council is helping to increase participation of older people in adult and further education and the UK online centres are improving access to the Internet and new technologies&#151;the over 55s make up almost one quarter of the total learners in these centres.

 The Department of Health recognises that some looked after children displaying severe levels of challenging or anti-social behaviour require a specialised approach. The care planning process used for all looked after children seeks to ensure that the most appropriate carers, services and supports are available to meet the child's identified developmental needs. For some children, a specialised multi-agency approach, that will address the child's individual needs by providing specific therapeutic and behavioural management, will be required. The Department is therefore funding a Treatment Foster Care Intervention to provide structured support to the child, his/her foster carers and birth or adoptive families that addresses all the child's needs simultaneously. The model being used has been extensively evaluated in the United States and the Department of Health is commissioning evaluation of the English model.

 The attainment of children who spend shorter times in care is important. We will, therefore, be consulting stakeholders on how best to achieve the introduction of individual education targets for all children in care. The Government will also put in place arrangements to analyse data from the new pupil level annual school census, in order to improve our understanding of outcomes for those young people who have spent any time in care. The results of this analysis will be used to inform the development of future policy.

 To take forward the Government's commitments to electronic transmission of prescriptions (ETP) made in "Information for Health, Pharmacy in the Future&#151;Implementing the NHS Plan and Delivering 21st Century FT Support for the NHS", three pilots were initiated in June 2002. While the three pilots are currently working on different technical solutions in respect of information flows, lessons already learnt from the pilots are contributing to the development of a national model for ETP. This means that appropriate technical standards are being developed covering such areas as the format and content of the electronic prescribing message and security standards. In January 2003 the Department authorised a six-month extension to the pilots to further explore the issues associated with the development of a national model.
<P>

<a name="30407w25.html_para13">"Delivering 21st Century IT Support for the NHS" called for a phased implementation of e-prescribing.

 The Modernisation Agency runs programmes to turn around poorly performing national health service trusts with an average value of &#163;250,000 per zero star trust. Their performance improvement team addresses failures around access targets, while the clinical governance team assists trusts who received an adverse clinical governance review. This support aims to enable NHS trusts to improve their performance rating so that they have the opportunity to benefit from a range of earned autonomy freedoms, and to apply for foundation trust status. This is part of the Government's Plan to raise standards across the whole NHS, as set out in the Department of Health publication, "Raising Standards Across the NHS&#151;A Programme of Rewards and Support for all NHS Trusts", in December 2002.

 The Department works closely with and provides funding through the Section 64 General Scheme to the National Osteoporosis Society (NOS). NOS is the leading body in this field and produces a range of information leaflets and offers an advice helpline. For the majority of the population, preventative measures of a balanced diet, exercise, ceasing smoking and reducing alcohol intake prove sufficient. The Government has tackled increasing awareness and the importance of adopting these public health measures in a wide variety of ways in recent years.

<P>
<a name="30407w28.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The role and responsibility of health care officers were considered in a report on 'Nursing in Prisons', and published in October 2000. It is available at: www.doh.gov.uk/prisonhealth

<P>
<P>
<a name="30407w28.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 On first reception into custody, each prisoner has a general health examination/assessment, which aims to identify any current or previous drug usage and engagement with community drugs services. The decision whether, in the light of this information, to proceed with either detoxification or substitute prescribing, as a prelude to a broader based drug treatment programme, is a matter for the clinical judgement of the practitioner concerned.
<P>

<a name="30407w28.html_para1">The prison service's standard for clinical services for substance misusers requires all prisons which receive prisoners from court to have detoxification guidelines in place for at least one of Methadone, Lofexidine, and Dihydrocodeine. It also requires establishments to have evidence-based guidelines for maintenance prescription that are consistent with current Department of Health guidance and provides advice about the particular categories of prisoners for whom maintenance prescription is likely to be suitable.

 Artificial nutrition and hydration are a form of medical treatment and are subject to the same principles as those governing medical treatment. There is no lawful justification for giving or continuing treatment that is not in the best interests of a patient who is unable to consent. The guidance from the British Medical Association and the General Medical Council is in line with this legal position.

As a result it is not possible to calculate the amount of Revenue Support Grant that is paid out to local authorities as a result of the inclusion of ethnicity indicators in the FSS formulae.

 Remediation of the Dome site and Greenwich Peninsula, comprising some 121.4 hectares, was carried out in two stages. British Gas, as the original landowner, carried out statutory remediation. The second phase was carried out by English Partnerships (EP) to make the site fit for purpose as per the masterplan for the site.
<P>

<a name="30407w30.html_para2">British Gas and EP employed WS Atkins as remediation consultants, who secured agreement from the Environment Agency and the Environmental Health Department of the London Borough of Greenwich for the adopted remediation solutions. This has involved either the removal of any remaining contaminated material or works to contain and isolate remaining traces of contaminants such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons and petroleum hydrocarbons, which were tar by-products from the site's original use as a gasworks.
<P>

<a name="30407w30.html_para3">The depth to which materials were removed and treated varies across the site. In some areas material was removed to a depth of 14 metres. The containment of any residual contamination after treatment involved the construction of surface and vertical barriers. Such barriers vary according to the end use but in landscaped areas, for example, they are typically about 1.5 metres thick. Works were undertaken toachieve remediation fit for purpose as per the masterplan.
<P>

<a name="30407w30.html_para4">The cost to EP for the purchase and remediation, servicing and landscaping of the Greenwich Peninsula site was &#163;185 million. The requirement for any future remediation will depend partly upon whether there is a change of use from that proposed under the existing masterplan to a use proposed under the masterplan that

is currently the subject of a planning application to Greenwich Council. In any case, as with any brownfield site, further development will need to be done in such a way as to preserve the integrity of the capping layer, for which there are standard construction processes. Therefore, further remediation may not necessarily be required.
<P>

<a name="30407w30.html_para5">The land under the Dome itself will not be used for housing. A planning application was submitted to the London Borough of Greenwich, by Meridian Delta Ltd. jointly with Anschutz Entertainment Group, Quintain Estates and Development and English Partnerships, on 23 December 2002. The plan proposes a new 26,000 capacity arena inside the Dome and surrounding facilities in the Dome for various leisure, sporting, entertainment, exhibition, retail and community uses. It also outlines development over a 20-year period for: over 10,000 homes on the Peninsula with associated community facilities and public open space; and 3.5m sq. ft of commercial development on the Peninsula. The application covers some 76.9 hectares, and is currently being considered by Greenwich Council under the normal planning procedures.

 This is a matter for the unitary district authorities responsible for minerals planning in Berkshire to consider. In doing so they will need to take into account their revised individual apportionments within the regional guidelines for aggregates provision, which are to be issued shortly. The apportionments for individual authorities will be recommended by the South East Regional Aggregates Working Party, on which minerals planning authorities in the region are represented, in consultation with the Regional Planning Body for the South East. This will follow a process of testing the proposed regional apportionments against local environmental and economic circumstances, to be carried out in the months following their publication.
