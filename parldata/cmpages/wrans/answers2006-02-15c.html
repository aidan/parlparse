<sup>(1)</sup> in 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. When testing resumed in 2002, resources were concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds tested immediately after the FMD outbreak was greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, data for 2002 is not comparable with other years.<br>

 We do not provide additional funding to schools for the achievement of outstanding results, but we are actively harnessing the strengths of our most effective schools for the benefit of the system as a whole. Where schools are playing a wider role in support of the education system we make funding available to support that commitment. We have offered the opportunity for specialist schools that meet performance criteria at specialist re-designation, to take on a leading role. In 2005, high performing schools had the opportunity to

We have also funded Primary National Strategy Learning Networks which enable groups of primary schools to work together to raise standards in English and mathematics.

<p><a name="st_92"><a name="60215w10.html_spnew1"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The formula used to calculate Schools Formula Spending Share for 2005&#150;06 and previous years took account of the extra spending needed by sparsely populated rural authorities, mainly to keep larger numbers of small primary schools open; the additional costs for secondary schools are mainly from home to school transport, funding for which was delivered through the LEA FSS for 2005&#150;06, and which continues to be part of the local government finance settlement. Since the formula for Dedicated Schools Grant starts from local authorities&#039; spending on schools for 2005&#150;06, which in two thirds of cases was above Schools FSS, so that will also take account of the extra spending needed by rural authorities. In distributing their Schools Budget, most local authority formulae take account of the need to provide extra funding for smaller schools, to allow them to meet the extra costs they face, that a purely pupil led formula would not deliver.

<p><a name="st_93"><a name="60215w10.html_spnew2"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 The funding colleges receive for students taking larger programmes of study is reduced on the principle that colleges derive economies of scale as pupils take more intensive programmes, as costs do not rise in proportion to the size of the programme. It will continue to be the case that no funding is paid for parts of programmes larger than the equivalent of 6 AS/A2 levels. The current arrangements allow for the equivalent of 5AS/A2 levels to be fully funded with the sixth being funded at half the standard rate.

<a name="stpa_73">On 21 October as part of the announcements of our funding strategy for post 16 education and skills in 2006/07 and 2007/08 we set out our plans to revise the maximum qualification funding for both school sixth forms and FE colleges.

<p>
<a name="60215w10.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_74">The maximum qualification funding does not include the additional per pupil funding available for key skills, tuition support and enrichment activities. It is possible to make use of this funding to fund courses of enrichment activities rather than seek funding for such courses as separate qualifications. We need to ensure an equitable share of resources between schools and across a range of pupils with different needs. The LSC&#039;s funding system recognises both the additional costs of larger programmes while maintaining a proper level of funding for those pupils unable to study a larger number of AS/A2 levels.

 By 2010 we expect all schools to be providing access to a core offer of extended services, including child care from 8 am to 6 pm; a varied menu of study support activities; parenting support; swift and easy referral to specialist services and wider community use of facilities. Head teachers, along with others, will want to ensure that these services are planned to support the overall vision of the school and contribute towards the School Improvement Plan. However, we do not expect teachers to provide or head teachers to directly manage all these new services.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_91">Schools working with their local authority may wish to nominate an extended schools co-ordinator to develop services, and may work in clusters with other schools and children&#039;s centres in their area.

<a name="stpa_92">The National Remodelling Team will take a lead role in supporting schools through the development of extended services to ensure that it is consistent with the tenets of work force reform. Extended services can help remove barriers to learning and give support to pupils with their non-educational problems, helping school heads and teachers focus on their core job of teaching.

 With the introduction of new funding arrangements from April 2006, all local authorities will be required to use a single pupil count, based on pupil numbers in the January before the start of each financial year, to determine their schools&#039; budget shares. The use of a single pupil count will make a significant contribution to improved certainty of funding for our schools.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Feb 2006 : Column 2072W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60215w12.html_para4">
At the same time, fluctuations in pupil numbers may cause difficulty for some schools and so our school funding regulations allow authorities to vary school budget shares in the face of exceptional pupil turbulence. The new funding arrangements also recognise that primary and infant schools may operate an admission point for their reception pupils in the summer term that the use of a single pupil count would not recognise. Our school funding regulations therefore allow authorities to make an adjustment in the January pupil numbers used to determine a school&#039;s budget share, by taking account of the number of pupils admitted at the beginning of the previous summer term.

<a name="stpa_98">The Primary National Strategy has started work on writing a draft revised framework for more formal consultation, taking into account points arising from the informal consultation and the interim report of the Rose review of the teaching of early reading. This work will be completed by drawing on the findings that Jim Rose will set out in his forthcoming final report. The draft document will set out key learning objectives for the Foundation Stage and each year of Key Stages 1 and 2, giving a clear sense of the progression expected. It will also provide examples based on a particular year of the range of supporting material that the revised framework will marshal to ensure that teachers and practitioners have easy access to guidance and resources to help them plan and execute high-quality teaching. The draft revised framework will be published for consultation at Easter 2006.

 The independent study into teacher workload conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2001 identified that two-thirds of a teacher&#039;s time was spent on activities other than teaching. Following proposals made by the School Teachers&#039; Review Body and extensive consultation, the National Agreement on Raising Standards and Tackling Workload was signed in January 2003 by Government, employers and the majority of school workforce unions. The agreement contained a series of phased changes to teachers&#039; contracts including, from September 2003, that teachers would no longer be routinely required to perform administrative or clerical tasks.

 Somalia has had no effective Government since 1991. We are supporting the establishment of Transitional Federal Institutions to restore peace and security, but in the interim most of Somalia continues to be controlled by armed clans and factions which frequently resort to violence. We therefore advise against all travel to Somalia because of the terrorist threat, the dangerous level of criminal activity and internal insecurity. Westerners and those working for western organisations have been targeted in recent shootings.

 The absence of effective Government in Somalia creates a vacuum in which terrorists, such as, al-Qaeda, operate, threatening the region and the wider international community. Islamic fundamentalists are seeking to create an Islamic State in Somalia. We have been closely engaged in the Somali national reconciliation conference and the subsequent political process. We continue to work closely with the UN and other members of the international community to achieve a comprehensive and lasting settlement and a return to good governance in Somalia, through the establishment of Transitional Federal Institutions and a return to democracy.

 Relations between Chad and Sudan have been strained since the rebel attack on Adre, Chad on 18 December last year. Although an attack on that scale has not reoccurred, the security situation on the border remains extremely tense, with both Chadian and Sudanese militias operating. We have made clear our view that no action should be taken to inflame this situation and my noble Friend, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister for Africa, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, did so most recently during the Sudanese Foreign Minister&#039;s visit to London on 3 February.

 The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) was formed following an agreement between the Government, police and the internet service provider industry that a partnership approach was needed to tackle the distribution of child abuse images online. It provides a &#039;notice and take down&#039; service to UK ISPs so they can remove illegal content from their servers and works closely with law enforcement agencies to help them trace offenders. The IWF and ISPs have reduced the proportion of potentially illegal content found to be hosted in the UK from 18 per cent. in 1997 to less than 1 per cent. now. We have been working with the main UK ISPs as they put in place technical solutions to prevent their customers accidentally accessing illegal child abuse websites identified by the IWF.

 The British Crime Survey (BCS) provides an estimate of the number of people in England and Wales who used drugs in the year before interview.

<a name="stpa_174">The BCS is a good measure of drug use in the general population and provides a consistent measure of trends over time. However it should be noted that, as a survey of households, the BCS does not cover some groups who may have relatively high rates of crack cocaine use, such as the homeless and prisoners. Nor, in practice, will any household survey cover people whose lives are so busy or chaotic that they are hardly ever at home. Therefore these estimates may underestimate the number of crack users in the country. Home Office commissioned research to obtain better estimates of the number of problematic drug users, including crack users, on a regular basis is currently under way.

The aim is to continue to work with agencies on implementing fully the 2001 categories across the criminal justice system over the next few years. The results from this monitoring are annually published by the Home Office in the report Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System&quot;. Up until 1997 the published data covered racist incidents, homicides, stop and searches, cautioning, persons under the supervision of the probation service or in prison as well as the ethnicity of criminal justice practitioners.

 Section 10 of the Domestic Violence Crime and Victims (DVC&V) Act 2004 made the provision for common assault to become an arrestable offence.

This follows an assessment of their medical and personal needs by prison operational managers and health care professionals. The contractor should be advised of this requirement in advance of the journey. Where this has not happened, and the prisoner declares herself to be pregnant, the contractor must seek the advice of a healthcare professional as to whether a non-cellular vehicle should be used for the transfer.

 Staff who are employed on DCA terms and conditions are all subject to performance related pay. These include staff in the former Court Service agency (now part of Her Majesty&#039;s Courts Service), staff at the Public Guardianship Office and those staff who are part of the DCA and its Associated Offices. This is a total of 12,750 staff.

<p>
<a name="60215w32.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_208">On 1 April 2005, with the creation of Her Majesty&#039;s Courts Service as an executive agency of the Department, the DCA became responsible for all former employees of the Magistrates&#039; Courts Service in England and Wales. This is a total of 12,067 staff. Those staff who were previously employed by the magistrates courts currently remain on their previous terms and conditions and are not paid on a performance-related basis. There is a DCA Pay and Grading Project currently under way. New pay, grading and benefit arrangements are due to be introduced for all DCA staff later this year. Performance related pay is likely to be a feature of the new system.

 Specialist Support Contracts form part of the Legal Services Commission&#039;s (LSC) special projects budget, that was reviewed in the summer 2005 against a number of criteria.

 The Legal Services Commission contracting arrangements include quality assessment such as Peer Review, File Assessment, and Quality Profiles.

<a name="stpa_214">Bonfires on domestic and business premises are regulated by local authorities under the statutory nuisance provisions in sections 79 to 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Local authorities have a duty to investigate complaints of smoke from premises that might be prejudicial to health or a nuisance, and if satisfied that a statutory nuisance exists or is likely to occur or recur an abatement notice must be served requiring the abatement of the nuisance or the restriction of its occurrence or recurrence. Failure to comply with the terms of an abatement notice will, upon summary conviction, result in a fine of up to &#163;5,000 for domestic premises and &#163;20,000 for business premises, in addition, section 2 of the Clean Air Act 1993 prohibits emissions of dark smoke from the open burning of material on industrial and trade premises. The Act provides a maximum fine of &#163;20,000.

Notes:<br>

1. Population estimates are not available at parliamentary constituency level. Figures and percentages at GOR level are provided instead.<br>

2. Totals show the number of people in receipt of an allowance, and excludes people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital.<br>

3. Parliamentary constituencies and GORs have been allocated using the ONS postcode directory.<br>

4. Percentages have been calculated using the relevant ONS mid year population estimates.<br>

5. Figures pre 2002 have been based on the 5 per cent. QSE data and are therefore subject to sampling variation. Those below 500 are subject to a high degree of sampling error and are marked &#039;*&#039;.<br>

Definitions and conventions: -&quot; Nil or Negligible; .&quot; Not applicable; Caseload figures are rounded to the nearest hundred and expressed in thousands. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

<p><a name="st_336"><a name="60215w37.html_spnew1"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 In November 2004 the Department reached a negotiated agreement with the PCS, FDA and Prospect trade unions. This agreement states that staff would only be declared compulsorily redundant after full and meaningful consultation with trade unions has taken place. The agreement allows for consultation to be undertaken at the appropriate level within the organisation and with a view to reaching agreement about ways to avoid, minimise or mitigate compulsory redundancy. DWP Management and the unions agreed to work constructively together to seek to avoid compulsory redundancies through redeployment and voluntary measures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60215w37.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_247">In accordance with the agreement, a forum of management and departmental trade unions has met monthly to review jointly the operation of the agreement. At the latest joint forum the unions agreed that the agreement was holding up well in the majority of government office regions. To date the Department has reduced staffing by just under 15,000 with only one compulsory redundancy, which involved exceptional circumstances. The Department will continue to work with its trade unions to avoid compulsory redundancy wherever possible.

 The Department for Work and Pensions no longer has separate London allowances&quot; for its staff. Instead the Department has four pay zones which all attract different rates of basic pay: inner London; outer London; specified location pay zones, which are a number of offices in the South East which have experienced recruitment difficulties in the past; and national, which covers the rest of the country. The difference between pay rates in the national zone and inner London differs for each pay scale, but is generally about &#163;3,500.

<a name="stpa_274">That is why it is important that the Government and Post Office should work closely together to ensure customers are fully aware of developments and continue to have a range of choices in how they access their money. Our pilots will ensure that our future payments strategy between now and 2010 reflects the needs of our customers and helps the Post Office develop its proposed new banking and savings products.
