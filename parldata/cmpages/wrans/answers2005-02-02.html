 The planned level of programme resources for the Environmental Action Fund (EAF) was &#163;4.19 million per year for the three financial years from 2002&#150;03 to 2004&#150;05. In 2002&#150;03 a total of &#163;4.48 million was actually offered to groups, but this included some funding for groups in their third and final year of funding from a previous grant round. Groups were then required to reapply for funding at the start of each financial year. Following those applications, &#163;4.26 million was offered to groups in 2003&#150;04 and &#163;4.12 million in 2004&#150;05.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w01.html_para0">
The planned level of EAF programme resources for projects relating to sustainable consumption and production is &#163;2.25 million per year for the financial years from 2005&#150;06 to 2007&#150;08. Offers of grant totalling &#163;2.25 million have been made for 2005&#150;06, with 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Feb 2005 : Column 896W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
provisional offers of &#163;2.4 million for both 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 (reflecting the likelihood of some slippage or scaling-down of projects as they develop their work plans in the first year and then reapply for funding for the second and third years).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w01.html_para1">
In addition, &#163;1.95 million of EAF grant is being rolled over in 2005&#150;06 to existing recipients undertaking biodiversity projects. Arrangements for supporting biodiversity and natural resource protection in 2006&#150;07 are being considered and will be announced in the summer.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many groups have bid for funding from the Environmental Action Fund in 2005&#150;08; and how many of the unsuccessful bids are associated with increasing awareness and understanding of sustainable development.  [211409]</p>




<p><a name="50202w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 We received 250 bids for funding from the Environmental Action Fund (EAF) in 2005&#150;08. I have announced today that 36 projects were successful in the competition and are being offered grant funding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w01.html_para2">
The large majority of bids, both successful and unsuccessful, included elements of increasing awareness and understanding of sustainable development. It is not possible to quantify these elements, as the criteria for the 2005&#150;08 grant competition sought applications for projects that would focus on moving beyond raising awareness and towards action for influencing and delivering more sustainable consumption behaviours.

<p><a name="50202w01.html_wqn4"><b> Ms Walley: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on funding for environmental education projects following the wind-up of the landfill tax credit scheme; and what steps she is taking to ensure that there is no shortfall in funding.  [211398]</p>




<p><a name="50202w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Landfill Tax Credit Scheme was reformed in 2003, as a result of which waste projects with an education component (categories C and CC) are no longer eligible for funding. Only a small proportion of that funding was used to support projects with a formal education basis. Certain environmental educational projects remain eligible for funding under the current scheme, for example in the biodiversity category. There was no direct replacement of the LTCS funding stream to support projects that might previously have been eligible. Projects with an environmental education component are supported by the Environmental Action Fund. Several other Defra programmes contribute to more informal modes of environmental education and awareness raising, for example &#163;30 million over three years has been allocated to the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) for national and local waste awareness campaigns.

<p>
<a name="50202w01.html_para3">

 HM Treasury requires Government Departments to account for decommissioning liabilities in accordance with the Treasury Resource Accounting Manual (RAM) which is based on UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. The RAM does not require Departments to comply with International Accounting Standards (IAS) and, in particular, IAS 37 on this subject. Instead, the RAM requires Departments to follow the UK Standard, Financial Reporting Standard 12, that was developed in parallel to IAS 37 and is substantially the same.

 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what procedures will be used to amend the Legal Aid Funding Code.  [213168]</p>




<p><a name="50202w03.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 Sections 8 and 9 of the Access to Justice Act 1999 set out the procedures relating to the Funding Code. The Legal Services Commission may from time to time prepare a revised version of the code which must be subject to appropriate consultation. The Funding Code is in two parts: Part I contains the Criteria, and Part II contains the Procedures. Amendments to both Parts must be approved by the Lord Chancellor before the relevant Parliamentary process. Revised Funding Code Criteria must normally be approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament before coming into force, although the Act allows urgent amendments to come into force in certain circumstances in advance of that approval. Revised Funding Code Procedures must be laid before Parliament.

WFP has sufficient food in its warehouses to help Angola&#039;s 900,000 most vulnerable people until the end of March.

<p><a name="50202w07.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 No tendering processes have yet been established by the Government of Angola as there are no plans to introduce genetically modified (GM) foods for milling into Angola. Angola has limited capacity to mill any cereals and is unable to do so on an industrial scale. The World Food Programme (WFP) runs two small mills, one in Luanda and another in Lobito, which it uses to mill maize. Until now, WFP has not received any genetically modified (GM) products for milling, although they do have restricted capacity to do so.

<p><a name="50202w07.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 UK aid is delivered to Darfur through UN agencies, NGOs, and international organisations, the effectiveness of which is monitored through regular field visits by the British Embassy in Khartoum and the Sudan Unit, and UN reports and evaluations. I am satisfied that we are doing all that we can under difficult circumstances. For example, the joint DFID-UNICEF (United Nations International Children&#039;s Emergency Fund) evaluation of December 2004, said the response by UN agencies, NGOs and donors was inadequate through to early 2004, but that humanitarian assistance is now getting through. It described the situation since October 2004 as &quot;stabilising&quot;.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of the economic effects on developing countries of allowing free trade in agricultural products.  [212132]</p>




<p><a name="50202w07.html_spnew6"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID has supported a range of research examining the economic effects on developing countries of allowing free trade in agricultural products.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w07.html_para2">
This includes work on the impact of EU Dairy reform on developing countries and on Food Security, Trade and Livelihoods Links. DFID also funds the World Bank Trade Policy Development Project (TPDP) that 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Feb 2005 : Column 916W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
includes analysis of agricultural liberalisation, as well as work at the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation on impacts of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) agricultural policies on developing countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w07.html_para3">
The general results of such research are that in the short term, costs and benefits are estimated to vary across producers and consumers and net exporters and importers. However, in the long term, developing countries will gain from freer world trade in agricultural products.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w07.html_para4">
In the short term it is estimated that developing countries that are net importers of food, may see price rises when export subsidies are removed. Countries that benefit from the current distortions in global agricultural trade would also lose out (for example those that export products to the EU, receiving the same distorted higher price that EU producers receive).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w07.html_para5">
However, in the long term producers should benefit from higher prices and take advantage of lower tariffs to increase their exports. Studies have shown that liberalisation of all OECD farm policies would boost global agricultural trade volume by over 50 per cent. Also, following liberalisation, higher exports have boosted the agricultural component of economic growth in countries like Vietnam and Uganda at 4.6 per cent. and 4.4 per cent. per year respectively. This has also led to an increase in agricultural incomes and significant reductions in rural poverty.

<p><a name="50202w08.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Oaten: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps the Government are taking to ensure that civil society, including faith-based organisations, in developing countries are able to access resources for meeting the needs of orphans and children made vulnerable by HIV and Aids.  [210999]</p>




<p><a name="50202w08.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 We fully recognise the key contribution that civil society organisations (CSO) have to play in tackling HIV and AIDS. We are therefore actively working to promote CSO involvement in national AIDS responses. We are, for example, working to find ways to help the flow of resources from National AIDS Commissions to NGOs and CSOs. These, including faith-based organisations, have an important role in helping to meet the needs of children affected by AIDS&#151;orphans and vulnerable children&#151;in terms of protection, care and support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w08.html_para0">
At the Global Partners&#039; Forum on orphans and vulnerable children held in Washington DC in December 2004, I announced how the UK would meet our target of spending at least &#163;150 million over the next three years to meet the needs of orphans and vulnerable children. Most of this will be spent in Africa where the impacts of AIDS on children are most severe. We will mainly be providing funds though our country programmes to support national responses. We are already providing funds through NGOs to support vulnerable children in Rwanda, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In a number of countries, such as Kenya and Zimbabwe, we are supporting the rapid assessment, analysis and action plan processes which have been led by UNICEF; effective civil society involvement in their implementation is an important issue for us. We are also 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Feb 2005 : Column 918W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
in the process of developing support to UNICEF to work at both country level and in the case of southern Africa at sub-regional level to develop and implement national OVC action plans. We will be working with UNICEF to ensure that civil society organisations are appropriately included in these programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w08.html_para1">
An additional means of ensuring that civil society organisations are appropriately involved in responding to the needs of children affected by AIDS will be provided as we renew our agreements with key UK NGOs such as HelpAge International and Save the Children to include relevant AIDS-related work as a key objective. Out of the 18 partnership agreements we have with UK-based NGOs, 14 have specific objectives on HIV and AIDS. We will also increase our Civil Society Challenge Fund from &#163;10 million to &#163;14 million in 2005 and encourage proposals from NGOs wanting to provide support in this field.

<p><a name="50202w08.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 We will use our Presidencies of the G8 and the EU to increase action on AIDS. This will include attention to the situation of children affected by the pandemic, the orphans and vulnerable children. Committing resources to implement the &quot;Framework for the protection, care and support of orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) living in a world with HIV and AIDS&quot;, which is the global guidance developed by UNICEF and partners and widely endorsed by the international community, including DFID, is key. The framework is being translated into national OVC action plans&#151;16 have been developed in Sub-Saharan Africa and more are being planned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w08.html_para2">
DFID has announced a commitment to spend at least &#163;150 million over three years on OVCs (of which &#163;44 million will go to UNICEF for the development and implementation of national OVC action plans). We will be encouraging other G8 and EU member states to increase their support to national programmes. The USA has, like us, already earmarked funding and endorsed the framework as have Germany and Denmark. Canada and France also see OVCs as a priority issue, yet others have not yet followed this line.

Along with other member states we are engaging in the consultation process towards a new Programme for Action on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis which the EC expects to adopt in 2006.

<p><a name="50202w08.html_wqn3"><b> Angus Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment his Department has made of the impact of microenterprises on the economic development of developing countries; and if he will make a statement.  [212161]</p>




<p><a name="50202w08.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 A very large proportion of poor households own or work in microenterprises in the informal economy. In Africa, informal work is estimated to have accounted for almost 80 per cent. of non-agricultural employment and over 90 per cent. of new jobs. For women in Sub-Saharan Africa, the informal economy represents 92 per cent. of job opportunities outside agriculture.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w08.html_para4">
DFID has supported microenterprise development directly through financial services, skills, technology and buyers, and indirectly through an improved policy and legal operating environment for microenterprises. DFID&#039;s current commitments to microfinance development projects in Asia and Africa total approximately &#163;50 million. DFID supports country investment climate assessments, and contributed to the &quot;World Development Report 2005: A Better Investment Climate for Everyone&quot; that highlights how governments can promote investment, productivity and job growth.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w08.html_para5">
Most microenterprises operate informally, making collecting reliable data on their impact very difficult. However, microenterprises clearly play an important role in developing economies. The average share of the informal enterprise sector in non-agricultural official GDP varies from 27 per cent. in Northern Africa to 41 per cent. in Sub-Saharan Africa. We do know however that many poor individuals would much prefer less risky employment in larger enterprises or the public sector, than self employment in microenterprises.

The table covers adult enrolments on courses offered by local education authorities (LEAs). In April 2001, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) assumed funding responsibility for both LEA-secured adult and community learning and for former Further Education Funding Council (FEFC) funded provision. For 2003/04, the LSC introduced a new approach to collecting data on adult and community learning. The new data collection is more harmonised with other LSC funded learning (for example further education) and allows more flexible analysis. However, it is not possible to form a consistent historical series from the old and new data collections. Using the new data and methods, in 2003/04, a total of 842,000 learners were enrolled on Adult and Community Learning programmes.

There are obvious technical reasons for a certain distance between each turbine. It needs to be compact enough to minimise the capital cost, and big enough for adequate separations to lessen energy loss through wind shadowing from upstream machines. It is usual for there to be a distance between the turbines of around 3&#150;10 rotor diameters The issue of wind farms and their proximity to dwellings and roads should be considered at the planning stage of individual developments and will be subject to policies in the local authority&#039;s development plan and the national policies set out in Planning Policy Statement 22 (PPS22).

The increases in travel costs since 2000 can be largely attributed to changes in strategy within the Immigration and Nationality Directorate including increased staff numbers and the need to travel as a result of new policy initiatives and targets for improved IND performance. Other contributing factors have been related to providing advice to the organisers of the 2002 Football World Cup in Japan and Euro 2004 in Portugal and the creation of new units to support the police reform agenda.

 The Government have put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the South Dorset constituency, as well as for all parts of the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w18.html_para0">
For example, between March 1997 and March 2004, the number of police officers in the Dorset police force increased by 169, from 1,284 to 1,453. The Government&#039;s introduction of Community Support Officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 33 CSOs on Dorset streets to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Between 1997 and 2003&#150;04, Dorset has seen a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 27per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 25 per cent.

<a name="50202w18.html_para1">
Dorset police force will receive &#163;66.0 million in general grants in 2005&#150;06, an increase of 3.75 per cent. (&#163;2.4 million). Dorset benefits from the decision to provide a funding floor of 3.75 per cent. If the funding formula had been strictly applied, the force would have received &#163;4.2 million less. General grants funding to Dorset police has increased by 22 per cent. between 1997&#150;98 and 2005&#150;06. In addition to general grants, Dorset will also receive around &#163;5 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives in 2005&#150;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the Police Authority and the Chief Constable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w18.html_para2">
As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area has had a local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and anti-social behaviour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w18.html_para3">
The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a pioneering government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction. Grants of over &#163;340 million were allocated to over 1,470 projects, including CCTV, under 20 initiatives that formed part of the programme. Two CCTV projects in the Weymouth and Portland CDRP area received a total of &#163;691,489 from the CRP.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w18.html_para4">
Since 2001, successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in England and Wales. These initiatives include Communities Against Drugs, the Safer Communities Initiative, the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas scheme and the Building Safer Communities Fund. Since 2001, a total of &#163;380,488 has been allocated to Weymouth and Portland CDRP and &#163;295,714 to Purbeck CDRP under these initiatives. A further &#163;1.98 million has been provided over the two years 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 to the Home Office Regional Director in the South West for CDRP capacity building across the region.

Under this, the Government have invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focusing on the four strands of:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w18.html_para8">
Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &#163;1,244 million in 2003&#150;04, rising to &#163;1,344 million in 2004&#150;05. Dorset has seen a significant increase in direct funding for tackling drugs, in particular for drug treatment services and the throughcare and aftercare elements of the Drugs Intervention Programme. In 2003&#150;04 the allocation for Dorset Drug Action Team amounted to &#163;1.58 million, rising to &#163;2.09 million in 2004&#150;05. Details of action taken to tackle drugs in the South Dorset constituency can be obtained from the Dorset Drugs Action Team For contact details see http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams.

<a name="50202w18.html_para9">
The Government are working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &#163;125 million is being invested across the country through the &quot;futurebuilders&quot; fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services. Advice on ways to engage local people in helping their communities is available on the Active Citizenship Centre website, http://www.active-citizen.org.uk.

Firework offences can also attract penalty notices. When penalty notices for disorder were introduced in 2003&#150;04, under the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, they included the offence of throwing fireworks under section 80 of the Explosives Act 1875. Three further firework offences were added to the scheme from 11 October 2004. These were made under the Fireworks Regulations 2004 (under section 11 of the Fireworks Act 2003) and cover breach of the national fireworks curfew, the illegal possession of category 4 fireworks and possession of an adult firework by a person aged under 18.

<p><a name="50202w19.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The analysis of false matches/negatives was outside the scope of the United Kingdom Passport Service Biometrics Enrolment Trial which concluded on 24 December 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w19.html_para2">
The rates of false negatives and false positives in the enrolment have not been estimated with any degree of certainty because no final decision on the technology to be used in the scheme has been taken and work on this subject will be undertaken in the future.

<p><a name="50202w19.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 There is evidence from evaluations of equipment and research studies that for iris and fingerprints, between one per cent and two per cent of applicants will be unable to provide a usable fingerprint or iris biometric. For some within this group their biometrics may be readable with special equipment or with the help of manual assistance. The results from the UKPS biometric pilot, in particular the results from the disabled quota, will provide more detail.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the <i>(a)</i> scale and <i>(b)</i> nature of working by illegal immigrants in the UK.  [208887]</p>




<p><a name="50202w19.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 By definition, the scale of illegal migrant working is difficult to measure because illegal immigrants fall outside of the United Kingdom official statistics. Consequently, there is no official estimate for the number of illegal immigrants working in the United Kingdom. The experience of workplace enforcement officials indicates that illegal migrant working tends to feature in commercial sectors characterised by low skilled, temporary employment in which labour is often supplied via sub-contractual arrangements. The Immigration Service has detected illegal migrant workers employed in various sectors, including hospitality (including hotels and restaurants), car washes and repair garages, the sex trade, horticulture and agriculture, food production, contract cleaning, manufacturing and the care home sector. The Government take seriously the harm caused by illegal working, including the risk to our immigration control and the exploitative treatment often experienced by workers. We have strengthened the law preventing illegal working and are examining how best to improve compliance and enforcement.

<p class="tabletext"> <i>(a)</i> The purpose of the meeting of 24 January 2003 with Mrs. Henderson was to ensure that she and her daughter were updated with the progress of the re-investigation. Following that meeting, in March 2003, a suspect was arrested and interviewed, which subsequently led to papers being passed to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for advice in May 2003.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i> (b)</i> The re-investigation, which was headed first by DCI Wood and then, from April 2002, by DCI Dennis has now been completed. On the 26 May 2003, a file of evidence was forwarded to the CPS concerning one specific suspect who found that there was no basis for a prosecution in relation to the case papers provided to them. The case is not, however, closed and any new lines of inquiry that emerge will be fully investigated.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i> (c)</i> The Chief Constable did not record the complaint of Mrs. Henderson for two reasons. Firstly, Mrs. Henderson&#039;s complaint referred to complaints about the original investigation, which had already been dealt with. Secondly, the remaining points raised about the re-investigation did not amount to complaints about the conduct of individual police officers, but related to operational matters all of which were subsequently addressed by the restructuring of the force approach to critical incidents. The Secretary of State has no powers to review a Chief Constable&#039;s decision not to record a complaint under Section 69(1) of the Police Act 1996.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i> (d)</i> A full and unqualified apology was provided to Mrs. Henderson in a letter dated 31 October 2003. Press releases were available from 9 December 2002 to 8 October 2004. All of these press releases contained repeated apologies, personally made, to Mrs. Henderson and her family.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"> Following the Inquest, on the 8 October 2004, a public apology was posted on the Sussex Police public website acknowledging its failings in the case and accepting that there were serious failings in the original investigation. The apology also included an acknowledgement that Mrs. Linda Watson and her daughter, Ms Amanda London-Williams, were innocent of all charges in relation to Richard Watson&#039;s murder.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the percentage change in the numbers of full-time police officers in <i>(a)</i> Lancashire Constabulary and <i>(b)</i> Burnley has been since 1997.  [204341]</p>




<p><a name="50202w21.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 Police numbers for the Lancashire Constabulary increased by 9.8 per cent.

On 31 March 2004 the Pennine Division had 574 officers, an increase of 9.1 per cent. (+48) since March 2002.

 Force areas are divided into Basic Command Units (BCUs). These are typically commanded by police officers of superintendent or chief superintendent rank with responsibility for the delivery of policing, the management of officers and other police staff and a number of police stations in their area. The determination of areas of command and the deployment of resources within a force are matters for the Chief Constable rather than for Ministers.

There are currently 255 BCUs in England and Wales. Based on information currently available from forces, the number of BCUs is expected to fall to around 245 in 2005&#150;06. No estimates for BCU numbers after 2005&#150;06 can be made at this stage.

<a name="50202w22.html_para8">
The budget for probation areas has increased by two per cent in real terms in 2004&#150;05. Much of this increase relates to funding capacity-building for the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and so is not directly related to the increase in performance. It is fair to say, therefore, that the improved performance has increased the cost-effectiveness of the NPS, so improving the value for money of the service delivered to the community.

Notes:<br>

1. A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

3. The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects.<br>

4. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

 The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.

<a name="50202w29.html_para0">
<i>Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin to Mr. Gregory Campbell, dated 2 February 2005:</i>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question asking for a list of the major road schemes likely to commence construction in Northern Ireland within the next 12 months (211518). I have been asked to reply as the issue raised falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Rods Service.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">I can advise you that the major road schemes likely to commence construction in the next 12 months are as follows:</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">A1 Newry to Dundalk Link Road&#151;the Northern Ireland section of this scheme will upgrade 4.3km of route to high standard dual carriageway and include one grade separated junction at an estimated cost of &#163;33 million.</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Feb 2005 : Column 1002W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The first package of the Roads Service Design Build Finance Operate (DBFO) programme is expected to be awarded in 2005 and it is possible that construction of the following two capital elements of the package may start construction in the next 12 months:</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">the provision of on-slips to the M2 motorway at Antrim Hospital at an estimated cost of &#163;2 million; and</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">improvements to the M1/Westlink, costing an estimated &#163;75 million, which will include the widening of 2.8km of the M1 motorway to 3 lanes in each direction (Stockman&#039;s Lane to Broadway), the widening of 1.6km of the Westlink dual carriageway to 3 lanes in each direction (Broadway to Divis Street) and the provision of 2 grade separated junctions (underpasses) at Broadway and Grosvenor Road.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">However, the timing of the construction of these schemes will not be confirmed until later in the negotiations for the award of this DBFO package.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Of course, the commencement of these schemes on the Eastern Sea Board Corridor should be viewed in the context of recently constructed and ongoing schemes throughout Northern Ireland, as well as those schemes planned to start in 2006&#150;07.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">For example, schemes recently constructed that serve the North West include the Strabane Bypass Stage II and Limavady Bypass both opened to traffic in September 2003, and the Toome Bypass that was opened to traffic in March 2004. Several carriageway-widening schemes have also been completed on the key corridors 



<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>2 Feb 2005 : Column 1003W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>serving the north-west within the past year, including A37 Springwell Climbing Lane (Coleraine to Limavady) and A6 schemes at Munreery (Derry to Dungiven), Curran (Maghera to Castledawson) and Castledawson (roundabout towards Maghera under construction). It is also hoped to commence further widening schemes at A37 Gortcorbies (Limavady to Coleraine) and A6 Kilcattan (extension of Burntollet West&#151;towards Belfast) and Mulderg (to balance Munreery) over the next couple of years.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">In addition the planning and preparation of the A6 dualling scheme from Randalstown to Castledawson and the dualling of the A2 at Broadbridge (Eglinton to Campsie), is progressing well with construction expected to start in 2006&#150;07 (subject to satisfactory economic analysis, availability of finance and the completion of the statutory procedures).</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">You will also be aware that the schemes to provide the Skeoge Link and upgrade the A2 Buncrana road are being taken forward in consultation with the developers of the proposed extensive development in the area. While the timing of these improvements will be dependent on agreement with the developers, the first element of these improvements is expected in 2005&#150;06.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

<p><a name="50202w29.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will re-introduce school performance tables in Northern Ireland.  [211639]</p>




<p><a name="50202w29.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gardiner: </b> 
 I have no plans to re-introduce school performance tables in Northern Ireland. The information which the tables contained has for some time been available in respect of each school in its prospectus. With the Freedom of Information Act now in force, the information in respect of all schools will be released by the Department of Education in response to specific requests.

<p><a name="50202w29.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Paul Murphy: </b> 
 During the period 31 March 2003 to 31 March 2004 Northern Ireland Office special advisors travelled domestically on 35 occasions.
