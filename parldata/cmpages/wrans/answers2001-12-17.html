<P>
<a name="11217w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Butterfill: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, whether the Church Commissioners have provided support to the Bishop of Exeter in connection with his role as Chairman of the South West Regional Convention; and if he will make a statement.  [23627]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 The Church Commissioners support the Bishop of Exeter in paying for his office and working costs as Bishop of the diocese. The Bishop's costs in connection with his role as Chairman of the South West Regional Convention have been reimbursed by a non- Church organisation.

<P>
<a name="11217w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Rosindell: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, which European Community-funded bodies receive funding from the Church Commissioners, with particular reference to the Commission of the Bishops' Conference of the European Community.  [22878]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 None. The Church Commissioners' primary responsibility is to manage their assets for the financial support of the Church of England's serving and retired ministry.
<P>

<a name="11217w01.html_para0">The Commission of the Bishops' Conferences of the European Community is a Roman Catholic body, wholly funded by that Church. It holds regular dialogue with partner ecumenical organisations, which include Anglican representatives, but there is no direct financial or structural link.

To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission, who first briefed the media of the contents of the recent letter to the Chairman of the Commission from the Parliamentary Commissioner.  [21980]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 The Speaker's Secretary was approached by the media from 3 December seeking confirmation of reports that the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards had written to the Speaker informing him that she did not wish to apply for reappointment. On 4 December he confirmed to the media that these reports were correct. He made it clear that the text of the letter would not be released.

<P>
<a name="11217w01.html_wqn3"><B> Peter Bottomley: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission, when members of the Commission or the Chairman's office was informed of the Parliamentary Commissioner's intention to make her letter available in full to the media if part of its contents were communicated to the media.  [21981]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 Members of the House of Commons Commission were not aware that the letter would be released, nor did the Speaker's Office understand that this course of action would be followed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w01.html_wqn4"><B> Peter Bottomley: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission, if the Commission will establish an inquiry into reports of briefing against the Standards Commissioner.  [22723]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 The Commission will consider the reply of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to Mr. Speaker's letter of 5 December when it is received, and will then consider what action is appropriate.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w01.html_wqn5"><B> Peter Bottomley: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission, when the Commission was first informed of reports of campaigns against the Standards Commissioner; when a member of the Commission first raised reports of a campaign for discussion by the Commission; when the Commission was informed of <i>(a)</i> the contents, <i>(b)</i> the partial and <i>(c)</i> the total release of the contents of the Standards Commissioner's letter to the Speaker dated 28 November; and what action on the reports of a campaign against her was taken before the Speaker's statement of Wednesday 5 December.  [22724]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards said in her letter of 28 November to Mr. Speaker that pressure had been applied to her. The letter was copied to members of the Commission shortly after it was received, and was considered by the Commission at its meeting on 5 December. I and, I understand, other Commissioners were made aware by journalists of the release of the letter during the evening of 4 December. At its meeting on 5 December the Commission was informed that the Speaker's Office had the previous day in response to specific inquiries confirmed reports that the Parliamentary Commissioner had decided not to seek reappointment but had indicated to the media that the text of the letter would not be released. Following the Commission's consideration of the letter, Mr. Speaker wrote to the Parliamentary Commissioner to ask her to provide details.

<P>

<a name="11217w01.html_para3">In governance we fund the provision of civic education; are helping Kenya to develop its Poverty Reduction Strategy; fund anti-corruption activities; are helping with development of a new government financial management system and public service pay policy; support Parliament's key institutions; and through programmes in Nairobi's and Mombasa's urban slums, are helping to reform local government. Programmes in conflict prevention, drought relief and environmental governance will also reduce the threat to livelihoods.

 Last month DFID's field manager covering Somalia visited some of the most vulnerable parts of the south. The Somalia Desk also keeps in close contact with (and support) agencies working in the more at-risk areas, receiving regular reports from them.
<P>

<a name="11217w01.html_para6">Our current assessment of the situation, derived from these sources, is that there are pockets of urgent need, particularly in the south of the country. These needs are primarily a consequence of the continuing conflict&#151;though the background of poor rainfall has not helped (most notably in Gedo).

 The UNHCR is responsible for monitoring the situation of refugees in Bosnia Herzegovina. We have not provided bilateral funds to support refugee camps.

 Following the resumption of democratic rule in Serbia in October 2000, the UK provided a &#163;10 million immediate assistance package for Serbia. We also contributed &#163;22 million towards the EC's euro 188 million humanitarian aid programme, and provided a further &#163;8.4 million to help the Serbian authorities pay arrears in family welfare benefits.
<P>

<a name="11217w02.html_para1">Over the last year, we have developed a programme of support for economic and social reforms, as set out in the DFID Country Strategy Paper for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

 Humanitarian assistance from the international community, including assistance for internally displaced persons and refugees, is co-ordinated by the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and the European Commission Humanitarian Affairs Office (ECHO). The UK provides funds for these agencies, including 19.7 per cent. of the ECHO budget.
<P>

<a name="11217w02.html_para3">We are not planning to provide bilateral assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons this winter. Our bilateral programme focuses on providing technical assistance for institution and capacity building, and for economic and social reform. We aim to address the longer-term needs of poor people in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by helping to restructure the economy, strengthen public administration and improve the delivery of social and health care services.

Excludes &#163;15 million from the Coalfields Regeneration Trust and Coalfields Enterprise Fund whose expenditure is distributed on the basis of different regional boundaries, cross-cutting projects by other Government Departments and any local authority expenditure contributing to regeneration.

 New deal recruits take up existing vacancies so extra costs are limited to the subsidy, where appropriate, and any additional training and development which may be needed. The total number of new deal 18&#150;24 staff currently in DTLR is 29. The Department receives a subsidy of &#163;60 per week for six months, for each full-time new deal employee. In addition, a training allowance of &#163;750 is provided. The cost per employee is &#163;2,190. The total cost to public funds for the 29 new deal staff in DTLR will be &#163;63,510.

 I am not aware of any specific proposals to change the arrangements for the purchase or leasing of rolling stock. However, the industry has experienced problems in getting new stock into service and the Strategic Rail Authority has therefore set up a

<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There are provisions within the Railways Act 1993 (s27(9) and s54) and the Transport Act 2000 (s211) which, for example, enable specific undertakings to be given in respect of new rolling stock where the length of the new lease is greater than the remaining length of the franchise and which allow the SRA to ensure that specified rolling stock leases are passed from one franchisee to another in the event of a change of control.

<P>

 It is for the private sector rather than my Department to bring forward proposals for new motorway service areas and whether a developer opts for an on-line or junction location will depend on the circumstances of the individual case. The Department, through the Highways Agency, will invariably comment on specific proposals but it has no general policy preference between the two types of site.

[22063]<P>
<P>
<P>

 The planning inquiry into motorway service areas on the M25, M4 and M40 is being treated as a single inquiry. No decision has been taken to treat it as six individual inquiries. It is normal practice for the local authority to provide the venue and for the Planning Inspectorate to supply the Inspector, each bearing its own costs. At the pre-inquiry meeting on 3 December the

 Local authorities have the primary role in assessing whether bus service needs in their area are being met adequately by current provision.

No data are available on which bus services have been withdrawn in the Buckingham constituency since 1997.

<P>
<a name="11217w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 It is estimated that between 4 per cent. and 6 per cent. of motorists drive while uninsured, an offence for which 300,140 people were convicted and more than 28,000 were disqualified during 1999. The motor insurers' recently established Motor Insurance Database will lead to a significant reduction in uninsured driving as police are now able to query insurance details immediately from the roadside. Police inquiries to the database are running at 22,000 a day.

 There are powers already available to local planning authorities under section 215 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to require landowners and occupiers to clear up sites adversely affecting amenity in their area. If nothing is done, authorities can carry out the work themselves and charge the owner the cost. These powers are in addition to those available to authorities under environmental protection legislation to tackle fly-tipping and litter.

 All train operating companies are required to carry out regular Customer Satisfaction Surveys to monitor passengers' perception of the quality of service they offer. If satisfaction falls below benchmarks (based on the results of surveys carried out at the time of franchising) the companies can be required to produce an action plan to remedy the problem. The Strategic Rail Authority have initiated a new National Passenger Survey (NPS) which asks passengers nationwide the same questions about service quality. This enables the Authority to compare companies against one another. As with the existing Customer Satisfaction Surveys, benchmarks for the NPS will be set in new franchise agreements.

We propose to underpin this with new powers for Planning Inspectors to focus discussion at the inquiry, which will just look at the details of implementing the project on the ground.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what weighting was given in the recent provisional revenue support grant figures for West Sussex county council to <i>(a)</i> pressures on social services for the elderly, <i>(b)</i> changes in transport costs for education and social services and <i>(c)</i> flood damage in West Sussex caused by last year's heavy rains; and if he will make a statement.  [23653]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w06.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The Government looked at the pressures facing local government when setting the spending plans for 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 in the Spending Review 2000. Those spending plans provide for good increases in grant to local authorities overall. Our proposals for the funding of local authority revenue expenditure next year provide real terms increases for education, social services and environmental, protective and cultural services. The proposals include the &#163;300 million over the SR2000 plans which the Government have provided for this year and the next to assist councils in building care capacity.
<P>

<a name="11217w06.html_para0">In allocating the overall level of funding between authorities, the SSA formulae recognise that pressures on social services are higher for some authorities than for others. For example, they take account of the size of the elderly population in each authority and other factors such as deprivation. General grant to West Sussex in 2002&#150;03 under our proposals is &#163;343 million which is an increase of &#163;22.5 million or 7 per cent. on a like for like comparison. This is above the average for comparable authorities.

<a name="11217w06.html_para1">The Government have also provided &#163;26 million in emergency financial assistance through the Bellwin scheme to councils affected by flood damage as a result of last year's heavy rains. West Sussex county council received &#163;6 million. Revenue expenditure by West Sussex on flood defence not covered through the Bellwin scheme is taken account of in the calculation of West Sussex's flood defence SSA.
<P>

<a name="11217w06.html_para2">In addition, recognising the severity of last year's floods, the Environment Agency in Sussex has benefited from &#163;1.1 million for emergency response and repair costs and &#163;0.2 million for design and feasibility costs of river strategies. It will also receive a grant for the capital programme of &#163;9.6 million in 2002&#150;03.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w06.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The Department offers to local authorities standard forms of byelaws to prohibit or regulate the use of power-driven model aircraft, including those controlled by radio-signal, in pleasure grounds and open spaces. Before making this type of byelaw, local authorities are advised to bring their proposals to the notice of the British Model Flying Association and of any local model aircraft clubs, and consider their views.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w06.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 PPG25 already indicates that applications of such a size or nature relative to the receiving watercourse/drainage system that there could be a significant increase in surface water run-off from the area are likely to require particular consideration of flood risk issues. This applies whether a development is within the flood plain or is outside it but drains into the flood plain.
<P>

<a name="11217w06.html_para3">PPG25 also advises that developers should carry out an assessment of the flood-risk and run-off implications of their proposals that is appropriate to the scale and nature of the development and the risks involved. In particular it advises that the run-off implications of development for all areas are controlled, where possible, through the use of sustainable drainage systems.

 We have recently published the Local Government White Paper "Strong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services" setting out our vision for a stronger local government and improved public services.

<a name="11217w06.html_para6">We expect all councils to rise to this challenge, and deliver e-enabled services by 2005.

Subject to demonstrating that they have made good progress, and have used the first tranche of money to good effect, we also intend them to receive a further &#163;200,000 each in 2003&#150;04. We will accordingly lay a Special Grant report before the House setting out this intention, in the near future.

 The introduction of the 10p rate of income tax in April 1999, together with its widening in April 2001, is worth between &#163;100 and &#163;188 a year to taxpayers, with the largest gains going to the low paid. Together with the cut in the basic rate of income tax and the reforms to national insurance contributions introduced during the last Parliament, the 10p rate is worth &#163;330 a year to a single person working full-time on the minimum wage. This represents a 30 per cent. reduction in their combined income tax and national insurance bill, compared to the 1997 system.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the opinion in the memorandum on tax reform by the Tax Law Committee on the taper relief system for capital gains tax and compliance costs; what estimates he has made of the costs of compliance for taper relief; and what estimate he had made of the proportion of taxpayers who benefit from the taper.  [22466]<P>

<P>
<a name="11217w08.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Taper relief is an intrinsically simple system: the taxpayer decides whether an asset has been a business asset or a non-business asset and then applies a percentage figure from a table to reduce the amount of gain charged to tax depending on how long the asset has been held.
<P>

<a name="11217w08.html_para1">Our proposal to reduce the length of the business assets taper to two years will ease that calculation in many cases, and we are currently considering suggestions for further amendments to the details of the taper relief rules which have been proposed in response to our consultation on simplifying Capital Gains Tax.

<a name="11217w08.html_para2">The Inland Revenue has a programme of compliance cost research and will study the taper system once it has had time to settle in and data become available. The Inland Revenue estimate that about 85 per cent. of those paying Capital Gains Tax in 2002&#150;03 will benefit from taper relief.

As a small Department the Privy Council Office is not included in the published annual report "Analysis of Sickness Absence in the Civil Service" but it is fully committed to working to the overall target to reduce the level of sick absence to five days per person by 2003. The Privy Council Office Service Delivery Agreement confirms this commitment and our requirement to monitor sickness levels quarterly.<P>

 The Government recognise the importance of combating counterfeiting and piracy for all the creative industries, and are working with the industries concerned towards achieving this objective. My Department does not collect independent figures for the financial impact piracy has on these industries and the Exchequer. Figures from a survey carried out by the Alliance Against Counterfeiting and Piracy indicate, however, that the cost of counterfeiting and piracy to UK industry as a whole was almost &#163;9 billion in 2000, an increase of 8.36 per cent. on the figure for 1999. This is estimated to be equivalent to approximately &#163;1.55 billion in lost revenue to the Exchequer. Within this total, it is estimated that the loss to the music industry in 2000 was &#163;20 million and to cinema and home entertainment &#163;180 million. There are no separate sectoral figures for the arts and television industries.

 As a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, the Government take very seriously the findings of the European Court of Human Rights.

However, the Court was not prescriptive about the mechanisms the

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what practical benefits have resulted from achieving the Public Service Agreement target for obtaining commitments from other countries to co-operate with the UK in combating drugs, crime, abuse of human rights and environmental degradation.  [22585]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w11.html_spnew23"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The fight against drugs and crime requires political commitment and practical co-operation. In 2001, nine more ratifications of the three UN drugs conventions have been recorded, including from Turkey, Albania and Ukraine. The FCO's Drugs and Crime Fund (&#163;7.3 million in 2001&#150;02), supports bi- and multilateral project work to combat drug production and trafficking, organised crime, paedophilia, child pornography and money-laundering in more than 40 countries committed to working with the UK and others on these issues. FCO-funded training for overseas law enforcement agencies and operational co-operation with them has led to some notable drug seizures, removing some of the heroin and cocaine consignments destined for the UK and Europe. The UK was a leading player in the negotiation of the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime, which already has more than 120 signatory states, and will provide a new framework for international co-operation to fight serious organised crime world-wide. The UK is currently negotiating law enforcement memoranda of understanding with 14 countries as the basis for further practical co-operation with them.
<P>

<a name="11217w11.html_para22">On the environment, FCO engagement helped secure successful outcomes at international climate change conferences this year in Bonn and Marrakech; in particular, by maintaining the commitment of key countries to the Kyoto Protocol following its rejection by the US. The FCO's contribution to the UK's work in the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has been instrumental in maintaining the international commercial moratorium on whaling which came under heavy pressure but emerged intact from the IWC meeting in July 2001. FCO environmental project funds have helped leverage co-operation with other countries (and with UK's Overseas Territories) to directly address restoration of degraded habitats and the control or removal of invasive species of animals and plants.

Of course, there is still a great deal to be done&#151;including on child rights, where we have not been so successful in meeting our target (on reducing extreme forms of child labour). The Government remain committed to promoting human rights at the heart of foreign policy and to backing up action in international forums with practical support from our Human Rights Project Fund.

 Pay scales and other conditions of service for our locally engaged staff in each country are set in comparison with the generality of responsible employers in that country. Typically the comparators are other western diplomatic missions, international agencies and major private companies. Our missions pay what is required to recruit, retain and motivate suitable staff. Normally we expect to be in the middle range of rates of pay: neither leading the market nor poor payers. We also meet the requirements of local employment law. Accordingly we are confident that pay levels for our local staff will be above poverty datum lines.

 There was intensive discussion of the middle east at the 10 December General Affairs Council. The Council adopted the following conclusions:
<P>

<a name="11217w12.html_para0">At a time when the situation in the middle east is extremely serious, we cannot be inactive.
<P>

<a name="11217w12.html_para1">We are convinced that only determined and concerted action by the European Union, the United Nations, the United States and the Russian Federation can help the parties to break the cycle of violence and commit themselves once again to the search for peace. This requires:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the reaffirmation and full recognition of Israel's irrevocable right to live in peace and security within internationally recognised borders;
<P>
<BR>
the establishment of a viable and democratic Palestinian state and an end to the occupation of Palestinian territories.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11217w12.html_para2">As a first step, the following pledges must be given:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>by the Palestinian authority: the dismantling of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist networks, including the arrest and prosecution of all suspects; a public appeal in Arabic for an end to the armed intifada;
<P>
<BR>
by the Israeli Government: the withdrawal of their military forces and stop to extrajudicial executions; the lifting of closures and of all restrictions imposed on the Palestinian people; a freeze on settlements.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11217w12.html_para3">On the basis of this EU position and in the light of the discussions which took place on 10 December in Brussels with Mr. Shimon Peres and Mr. Nabil Shaath, we have asked Javier Solana, SG High Representative for the CFSP, to go to the region and report back to the Laeken European Council.
<P>

<a name="11217w12.html_para4">The aim is to contribute, in concertation with the United Nations, the United States and Russia, to a speedy resumption of negotiations, without preliminaries.

 The Department of Education and Skills believes everyone should be allowed to balance their work and home commitments and that home working should be available to all staff, not just those with caring responsibilities. We encourage a culture of trust where people feel comfortable working from home and do not feel tied to working a fixed 9&#150;5 pattern and try to discourage long hours working among staff. Staff can work at home on a full-time basis or for part of the week on a regular or occasional basis. Business needs remain at the top of our agenda. However, managers are encouraged to be sympathetic to all requests and grant them whenever possible.
<P>

<a name="11217w13.html_para2">The Department publicises its policy on flexible working to all staff and people working wholly or partly from home have access to our remote working system, which currently has 1,175 registered users, 27 per cent. of our total work force.

Education Standard Spending is the amount the Government consider appropriate for local authorities to spend on education from their total budgets. Local authorities receive about three quarters of their funding from central Government, through the Revenue Support Grant and business rates, and about a quarter through council tax. The figure for the Standards Fund includes Government grant only as the local authority contributions are included in the ESS figure.<P>

 Arrangements for training in the landscape contracting sector are a matter for the employers in that sector, as in any other. A network of national training organisations (NTOs), set up by employers and formally recognised by the Government, provides strategic leadership and practical guidance about the learning, skills and qualification needs for a defined sector.

<a name="11217w15.html_para4">The Government recently announced plans to build a stronger sector network that will engage employers more fully in the planning and delivery of learning and skills. Sector skills councils will be set up which build on the achievements secured by NTOs.

 All local education authorities have access to the European Commission's education, training and youth programmes, as well as the European social fund. Funding under each of these programmes is awarded on a competitive basis following a bidding round. Local authorities are well placed to encourage institutions and schools in their areas to take advantage of the opportunities the programmes offer, and can also apply for project funding themselves.
<P>

<a name="11217w15.html_para7">The Socrates programme aims to promote the European dimension in the field of education, and covers all phases of education from primary schools to higher education, including activities focused on adult education and ICT and distance learning; the Leonardo da Vinci programme funds vocational training, and the youth programme focuses on non-formal learning.

 The Government are currently working up proposals, in partnership with local government and other education interests, for the introduction of a new funding system in 2003&#150;04. We are taking a fresh and objective look at what provision is needed, and at the additional costs some authorities undoubtedly face. We want a system that is both fair and clear. The element of the proposals set out in the Green Paper most relevant to Worcestershire's position is that LEAs should receive a basic entitlement per primary or secondary school pupil, with enhancements only for authorities where significant deprivation adds to costs, or schools need to pay more to recruit and retain staff. This would mean that a number of LEAs would get the same funding per pupil, rather than those like Worcestershire getting less than almost all others.

 <i>[holding answer 13 December 2001]:</i> South Gloucestershire has a negative net post-16 SSA because the deduction in respect of its Learning and Skills funding allocation for post-16 education is greater than its gross post-16 SSA for 2002&#150;03. There are a further six authorities in this position. We will be making a special grant available, to guarantee that no authority will have a net post-16 SSA which is less than 7.5 per cent. of its gross post-16 SSA. Allocations of this special grant will be announced once the Local Government Finance Settlement is finalised at the end of January.

 Information on the total number of applications for the bonus received by local education authorities, and the number of those to have been assessed as ineligible, is not collected centrally. To date, four local education authorities have submitted claims to my Department for the reimbursement of bonus payments made to seven teachers in their areas, but the bulk of claims will not be made until the new year. Any teacher who has been disqualified from the profession would be barred from working in a school and therefore ineligible to apply for the bonus.

We have no other plans for special grants to support LEA budgets for 2002&#150;03, because increases in funding mean there is less need for special grant support from Government than there was in 2001&#150;02: over &#163;1.3 billion extra in Education Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs); a further increase in Standards Fund grant of almost &#163;160 million; and an increase in the direct grant for schools of 2.75 per cent.

 Ofsted's report, "Specialist Schools: An evaluation of progress", was published on 9 October 2001. An initial draft of the report was received within the Department for Education and Skills at the beginning of July. Ofsted's report confirms that four out of five of the schools surveyed are achieving the aims of the specialist schools programme and are making good use of the 



<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 2001 : Column: 70W</I><P>
advantages it brings. The report's first main finding states that: "For these schools specialist status has often been a catalyst for innovation and helped to sustain or accelerate the momentum of school improvement." Technology, language and arts colleges are improving attainment at a faster rate than is the case nationally and in GCSE examinations in 2000 the combined average points score for each pupil for specialist subjects was higher in all four categories of specialist school than the average for all other maintained secondary schools. Ofsted also found that, with few exceptions, the community dimension was the weakest part of the school's work. However, sports colleges had responded well to this challenge and the report found that about half of the technology and language colleges visited had developed good examples of community support. We expect all specialist schools to benefit from the findings in the Ofsted report.

 Over the last two years, the Ministry of Defence has objected to 26 proposals to site wind farms within the tactical training areas (TTA). The details of these are withheld for reasons of commercial confidentiality in accordance with Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. The objections relate to the physical obstruction that would be caused by the wind farms within areas where fixed wing aircraft are engaged in operational low flying (OLF) training down to 100 ft minimum separation distance (MSD). Outside the TTA low flying fixed wing aircraft are not permitted to fly below 250 feet MSD. In order to preserve the tactical freedom to practise OLF it is important that the number of tall obstacles, such as wind turbines, is minimised within those areas. For this reason an objection is often, but not always, raised to proposals to locate turbines in any of the TTA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has conducted a Comprehensive Review of Aircrew Retention this summer. We sought to identify why we have a shortfall in this highly trained group of personnel and how that shortfall might best be addressed. A study team including representatives from the three Services, HM Treasury and external consultancy have reviewed aircrew requirements and have looked at employment patterns, career structures, training systems and remuneration as well as the recruitment and financial policies of the commercial sector.
<P>

<a name="11217w18.html_para0">The Working Group collated the views of over 1,000 aircrew (probably the largest such survey the armed forces has undertaken) as well as those of managers. They examined and identified why people leave service life, as well as the attraction of the commercial sector.
<P>

<a name="11217w18.html_para1">The main cause of the shortage of aircrew was a failure of the training system to deliver against challenging targets. That has already been addressed, but it will take time to deliver. We intend, therefore, further to improve the retention of our current aircrew.




<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 2001 : Column: 75W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11217w18.html_para2">The Working Group identified a series of issues impacting on retention. Many of the quality of life issues emerging from the Review of Aircrew Retention were already being tackled. For example, the very significant programmes introduced to spend an additional &#163;1 billion over the next 10 years on modernising single living accommodation and to spend &#163;650 million by November 2005 on upgrading married quarters. We recognise that accommodation problems spread beyond housing and action is needed to address sub-standard working and technical accommodation as well. Senior service officers have also set in hand work to address a number of key concerns raised by aircrew&#151;for example on operational tempo, career management, frequency of moves, and more. The impact of resolving these concerns will also be of benefit to personnel beyond the aircrew community. Some of the issues raised by aircrew are misperceptions, and to address this better communication is being developed across the services.
<P>

<a name="11217w18.html_para3">There are some remuneration aspects arising from the review and, as is usual, we have made proposals to the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB). The outcome will be reported to the House in due course&#151;probably early February.
<P>

<a name="11217w18.html_para4">We are monitoring closely developments in the commercial sector. But, even if the pull to the private sector decreases as a result of a contraction in the civil sector, we still have a responsibility to deal with the natural factors which cause personnel to leave, and which are preventing us reaching aircrew manning balance.

<a name="11217w20.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Brooke: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what information he has collated on re-offending rates of discharged prisoners who have served sentences of more than two years, broken down by <i>(a)</i> prisons and <i>(b)</i> type of programmes provided within prisons in (i) 1999&#150;2000 and (ii) 1998&#150;99.  [22443]<P>

<a name="11217w20.html_spnew8"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2001]:</i> Information on re-offending rates for discharged prisoners is not collected. However information on two-year reconviction rates is collected and published annually in Prison Statistics England and Wales. The latest reconviction rates cover prisoners discharged during 1997 and the first quarter of 1998 and are contained in chapter 9 of Prison Statistics England and Wales 2000 (Cm. 5250) a copy of which is available in the Library. Prisoners who have served sentences of two years or more will often have spent time in a number of prisons. It is therefore difficult to attribute reconviction rates to the impact of a particular prison.
<P>

<a name="11217w20.html_para4">Two offending behaviour programmes within prisons have been evaluated using offenders' reconvictions following discharge. The following tables show the percentage of offenders (both treated and similar untreated offenders) who have been reconvicted of an offence within two years of discharge by risk category. Comparison group offenders were matched to those who had participated in treatment on factors which are known to increase the likelihood of reconviction eg age at discharge, number of previous offences etc. This is to ensure, as far as possible, that the evaluation was comparing like with like offenders.
<P>

<a name="11217w20.html_para5">Table 1 refers to offenders who participated in two pre-accredited cognitive skills programmes (Thinking Skills and Reasoning and Rehabilitation). These offenders were treated between 1994 and 1996 and had been sentenced to two years or more. Table 2 refers to offenders who completed the pre-accredited Sex Offender Treatment Programme between 1992 and 1996 and had been sentenced to four years or more.
<P>

<a name="11217w20.html_para6">Overall, the results illustrate that offenders who have participated in offending behaviour programmes have consistently lower reconviction rates, two years after discharge, than similar untreated offenders.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what definitions are used for <i>(a)</i> convicted after trial rate in Crown courts in quarterly Business Information and <i>(b)</i> percentage of those pleading not guilty convicted for persons tried at the Crown court in Table 6C of Criminal Statistics.  [22281]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The "Convicted after contested trial rate" in the Criminal Justice Business Quarterly Report focuses on those defendants, from Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) records, who pleaded not guilty in the Crown court, no guilty pleas being entered, and a jury was sworn in. The resultant contested hearings include those resulting in a judge directed acquittal as well as those convicted or acquitted on the verdict of the jury.
<P>

<a name="11217w22.html_para2">The "Percentage of those pleading not guilty convicted" given in Table 6C of Criminal Statistics England and Wales is derived from Crown court records and focuses on a larger group of defendants. Non-CPS prosecutions are included as well as some defendants who pleaded not guilty to the principal offence and guilty to other charges. A jury trial may not have occurred and those not convicted include judge-ordered acquittals, judge-directed acquittals and jury acquittals.

<a name="11217w23.html_para3">Tackling the problems associated with underage drinking is a key objective of the Home Office action plan on alcohol-related crime, disorder and nuisance. The most recent Youth Lifestyles Survey, published in October 2000, showed that 15 per cent. of young people aged 12 to 17 admitted to committing some form of antisocial behaviour during or after drinking&#151;most often getting into a heated argument. Frequent drinkers were also more likely to have behaved antisocially.
<P>

<a name="11217w23.html_para4">We have strengthened the law, from 1 December, to go further in tackling the sale of alcohol to underage drinkers. Section 30 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 now places a positive duty on staff in licensed premises to check the age of young customers before selling alcohol, and section 31 provides a power for the police and local authorities to enforce the law by using under-18s to make test purchases. We expect these important new measures to assist in our determination to tackle under-age drinking as part of our wider programme to reduce youth crime and antisocial behaviour.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the savings have been resulting from hedging the cost of interest make-up on fixed rate export finance loans offered by the Export Credits Guarantee Department in each of the last 20 years.  [21976]<P>

<P>
<a name="11217w26.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 ECGD's interest rate hedging activity protects against the risk of increased support costs arising from adverse interest rate movements under the Fixed Rate Export Finance (FREF) scheme.
<P>

<a name="11217w26.html_para3">ECGD began hedging its exposure 15 years ago, using interest rate swaps. During the previous five years, the total net cost of FREF interest support, without hedging, was &#163;2,189 million. Over the following 15 years, up to and including 2000&#150;01, the total net cost of support was &#163;1,703 million, within which the net cost of interest rate swaps was &#163;319 million. The yearly breakdown of net swap costs over the period was as follows:

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the reasons for which the annually managed expenditure of the Export Credit Guarantees Department has risen.  [22195]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w26.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Annually managed expenditure (AME) for the Export Credits Guarantee Department has risen due to the extra cost needed to unwind interest rate swaps. These swaps were used to hedge interest make up (IMU) costs on fixed rate export finance loans and commitments being guaranteed by ECGD. These loans are now being refinanced using direct funding from HM Treasury, as this produces greater value for money in terms of cost and hedging uncertainty. AME estimates have risen as the cost of unwinding swaps in the financial markets has increased since the AME forecast figures were last published at the time of the Budget 2001.

<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 2001 : Column: 106W</I><P>
The main mechanism through which this development will be supported is the Renewables Obligation and the associated Renewables Obligation Scotland. This will oblige all licensed electricity suppliers in Great Britain to supply a specified and growing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. The Obligation will create a long-term market incentive for renewables which taken with the exemption of renewables electricity from the climate change levy (CCL) and continuing support for NFFO projects, is expected to be worth over &#163;1 billion by 2010.

<a name="11217w27.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 December 2001]:</i> The agreement that was reached in 1994 with the Trustees of pension schemes for former British Coal staff and employees has supported the schemes' investment strategies, and has meant that members' have been awarded bonuses totalling around 30 per cent. These bonus awards are additional to the inflation linked increases applied to pensions each year to maintain their real value. The Government regularly review all information that they receive on these issues, and expect to be able to make a further announcement shortly.

<P>

 We have set up the Gas Industry Emergency Committee. Its membership includes Ofgem, Transco, NGC, HSE and many others from throughout the supply chain. It assesses the risks of new and emerging developments that could lead to large-scale gas supply failures. Its aim is to ensure that in the event of a gas supply emergency, contingency plans are in place to ensure the rapid and safe restoration of supplies to consumers.
<P>

<a name="11217w28.html_para1">These contingency plans have been tested in various exercises in recent months. Further tests are planned for the future to ensure that they are kept up-to-date and are fit for the purpose.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the emergency gas stockholding capacity is in days of use at full levels of generation for each of the combined cycle gas turbine power stations commissioned since 1990.  [22341]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w28.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Combined cycle gas turbine power stations do not hold emergency stocks of gas, nor are emergency stocks of gas specifically held as part of the UK gas transmission system for these generators. Where a gas facility is dual fired, power stations usually hold stocks of their alternative fuel&#151;predominantly coal or oil products. Some gas is stored, but this tends to be at the extremities of the transmission system in facilities such as salt cavities' offshore fields or as liquefied natural gas.
<P>

<a name="11217w28.html_para2">Some liquefied natural gas is held by Transco to cope with system emergencies. The remainder is used to help maintain the overall balance within the gas transmission system between supply and demand for gas. The stored gas tends to be used during periods of peak demand (e.g. winter months) and to meet shortfalls of gas supplies at other times during the year. Combined cycle gas stations compete for any gas coming from storage along with other gas users.

 Figures collated by Invest UK on inward investment are not recorded at constituency level but on a regional basis. Following are figures from the south-east for each of the years since 1997.
<P>

<a name="11217w30.html_para1">The figures are based on information provided by companies at the time of the announcement of the decision to invest in the UK. They are based on the companies' best estimate, at that time, of the number of jobs to be created/safeguarded by the investment in its first three years.

It is not possible to anticipate results for 2001&#150;02 as calculation requires end-year figures.

 Good progress is being made on universal banking services in advance of the migration of benefit payments to ACT in 2003.

<P>
<P>

 Tackling the amount of waste produced is the first priority in the hierarchy for waste management decisions set out in the Government's Waste Strategy 2000. The Government are supporting the National Waste Awareness Initiative and have issued guidance to local authorities on their powers under the Waste Minimisation Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="11217w31.html_para11">The Government have implemented the Packaging Directive and a voluntary agreement on the recycled content of newsprint.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w32.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government set out their strategy for delivering sustainable waste management in 'Waste Strategy 2000', published in May last year. Minimising waste production and maximising the re-use and recycling of waste is at the heart of this strategy and we have set statutory targets under Best Value for local authorities to double the amount of household waste recycled by 2003&#150;04 and treble it by 2005&#150;06. Targets have been set for each collection and disposal authority in England.
<P>

<a name="11217w32.html_para0">We have recently published a consultation paper on the operation and distribution of a new waste minimisation and recycling fund in England. The fund was agreed in Spending Review 2000 and provides &#163;140 million over the next two years.

[19373]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 November 2001]:</i> The companies that manage the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme provide regular advice to my Department on the average cost of work under the scheme. This advice, together with information on work which costs more than the current grant limits is used to review the grant maxima. I plan to consider whether any changes to the maximum grant levels are required early next year.
<P>

<a name="11217w32.html_para1">We have no plans to set an average grant, rather than the maximum grant approach used at present.
<P>

<a name="11217w32.html_para2">The present approach encourages scheme managers to reach those vulnerable householders in most need. These householders are likely to live in homes requiring the complete package of measures available under the scheme.

<P>

<a name="11217w32.html_para3">Under an average grant system, the scheme managers would be contractually bound to improve a set number of properties using the available moneys. This would create an incentive for them to target householders in less need, who require fewer improvements to their homes, simply to ensure that the average was not exceeded.

The economic impact on a particular sector of the industry would not form part of an assessment where the overriding priority is to protect those who work in the industry and consumers of the treated crop.

<a name="11217w32.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Pesticide products containing carbofuran and chlorfenvinphos have been reviewed as part of the general review in the UK of all organophosphate pesticides. The review was undertaken because of public concerns about the potential toxicity of these chemicals.
<P>

<a name="11217w32.html_para8">Organophosphate pesticides are mainly older compounds and the review will establish whether there is sufficient safety data available to satisfy modern standards. Companies are therefore required to submit data they hold on human health and environmental effects to support the continued safe use of the products containing these compounds. If data are not submitted then the approval for these products are revoked.
<P>

<a name="11217w32.html_para9">The approval holders for carbofuran and chlorfenvinphos did not submit supporting data for their products under the UK review and therefore these products will not be available in the UK after 31 December 2001.

There is a requirement for appliances to be collected and transported carefully to ensure that any re-usable equipment does not get damaged in transit. There is also a requirement for consumers to be informed of return systems, which could include information on offering equipment for re-use.

 <i>[holding answer 13 December 2001]:</i> In 1999, one three-year and three five-year research projects for finding a vaccine for TB in cattle were commissioned by MAFF at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency and at the Institute of Animal Health. &#163;1.2 million funding is being provided by DEFRA in this area each year up to 2004. The key objectives of the research are to produce live candidate vaccines, to develop a test to differentiate vaccinated animals from infected animals and to evaluate the vaccine candidates in the host species. The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) is undertaking a detailed study of vaccine development and their potential use. In its third report the ISG advised that vaccines in either cattle or badgers remains a potential policy option although likely to offer prospects only in a long-term context. Nevertheless, research into vaccines remains an important element in the strategy to control TB in cattle and will receive funding accordingly.

<P>

<a name="11217w36.html_para5">Outturn figures for 2000&#150;01, when they become available, are likely to show a reduction in expenditure on TB, due to diversion of veterinary resource to deal with the classical swine fever and foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks. The outturn figures for 2001&#150;02, when they become available, will almost certainly show a more marked reduction because of the diversion of resource to deal with FMD and the length and severity of the outbreak in this financial year.

<a name="11217w37.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 From 1 January 1999 all British registered fishing vessels over 10 metres in length and catching more than 2 tonnes of quota stocks have had to demonstrate an economic link with fisheries-dependent communities in the United Kingdom. This link can be demonstrated in a number of ways, for example by vessels landing at least 50 per cent. by weight of their quota catch into the UK or by employing a crew of whom at least 50 per cent. are normally resident in a UK coastal area.
<P>

<a name="11217w37.html_para0">In 2000, 1,627 vessels caught more than 2 tonnes of quota stocks and in each case achieved a satisfactory economic link, primarily through landings into the UK. The economic link arrangements have maintained the increases in UK landings and expenditure achieved by foreign-owned UK-registered vessels in 1999. In addition almost 400 tonnes of quota was made available for redistribution to the UK fleet.

As regards tourism, our best estimate is that overall UK tourism revenues may fall by over &#163;3 billion over the eight month tourism season (March-October).

This percentage includes samples taken from animals slaughtered on infected premises, as dangerous contacts, on contiguous premises and as slaughter on suspicion cases. Not all animals slaughtered on infected premises are sampled; confirmation of the disease frequently being based only on clinical examination. Additionally, a negative test result does not necessarily mean that the premises was free from disease. For instance, if the disease is old the virus may not be present in the sample collected, and blood tests from newly infected animals may not give a positive reaction to the laboratory test as antibodies may not yet be present.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what scientific evidence there is that vaccination can prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease.  [15363]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w37.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2001]:</i> There are three principal lines of scientific evidence which demonstrate that suitable foot and mouth disease (FMD) vaccines, properly applied, can minimise or prevent the spread of the disease. These are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the results of routine, laboratory-based, vaccine potency tests which are required of licensed vaccine manufacturers in compliance with pharmacopoeial criteria;
<P>
<BR>
the testing of the duration of immunity engendered by FMD vaccines, by means of similar tests. These tests have shown immunity following a primary course of vaccination with conventional FMD vaccine typically lasts for four to six months; and
<P>
<BR>
the results of vaccination campaigns which have been associated with the successful control of FMD, as has been apparent in a number of countries.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11217w37.html_para5">It is essential that any vaccination campaign is both effectively and efficiently managed in order for it to work and there are many aspects to this, including, the correct strain of vaccine and enough of it, targeting the correct population of animals in the right location and that there are enough trained vaccinators.
<P>

<a name="11217w37.html_para6">Throughout the outbreak, the Government have kept vaccination actively under review. Vaccination would be used if scientific advice were clear that it was the most appropriate measure to shorten the outbreak. But vaccination on its own could never have eradicated FMD entirely.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of alternatives to mass slaughter of livestock in the event of further outbreaks of foot and mouth disease.  [18020]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w37.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The disease control policies employed by the Government to eradicate foot and mouth disease are being guided by advice received by the Chief Veterinary Officer and the Chief Scientific Adviser. The requirements to slaughter animals which are infected or suspected of being infected with FMD is also a key part of the rules established by the European Union on the control of the disease.
<P>

<a name="11217w37.html_para7">The use of vaccination in certain circumstances would be considered if scientific advice were clear that it was the most appropriate measure to shorten the outbreak. However, vaccination does not provide complete protection against FMD and could never be used solely to eradicate FMD entirely. The Government recognised early in this year's outbreak that future EU and international policies for handling FMD would need to be reassessed, including the role of vaccination. The UK, with the Dutch, took the initiative to organise an International Conference on Prevention and Control of Foot and Mouth Disease on 12&#150;13 December in Brussels.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the risk of the transmission of foot and mouth disease from the consumption by dogs of fallen stock.  [17969]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w37.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 November 2001]:</i> Although experimental studies demonstrated a degree of susceptibility to FMD in some dogs, there is no direct evidence to show that the species has been involved in the transmission of FMD to susceptible livestock. There is a theoretical risk that dogs could be involved in the mechanical transmission of the virus by carrying infective virus on their paws or coat. There is also a remote possibility that the consumption by a dog of FMD infected material could pass infection on to susceptible livestock, particularly if the dog vomited soon after consuming the infected material. However, provided the dog had a normal digestive process, it is unlikely that any viable virus would survive passage through the stomach and intestines. It is considered most unlikely that this theoretical possibility poses a serious risk of spreading FMD.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to her oral statement of 12 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 578, on what basis she stated the number of local appeals which were lodged against the contiguous cull in the Thirsk blue box.  [20822]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w37.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Since my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's statement of 12 November, I have asked my officials to re-check the source of the figures I provided on challenges to the contiguous cull in the Thirsk area. I can now confirm, that while accurate in themselves, the figures my right hon. Friend gave then relate to North Yorkshire as a whole. Thirsk was the name given to the area imposed for foot and mouth disease control and is often used as a shorthand to describe the wider area. I apologise if this led to any confusion.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list the changes in foot and mouth <i>(a)</i> management and <i>(b)</i> eradication policy since the previous significant outbreak; and if she will make a statement.  [20991]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w37.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 An accurate and complete list of headline changes in the management and eradication of foot and mouth disease since 1967 would need to pick up a wide range of issues such as changes in legislation, science and technology. This could be produced only at disproportionate cost. However, a comparison of the way in which the current outbreak differs from the 1967 outbreak may be found on the DEFRA website at http:\\www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/about/current/ comparisons/1967 a.asp. This contains a section on how the 1967 and 2001 outbreaks were tackled.
<P>

<a name="11217w37.html_para8">A clearer picture of the changes requested by the hon. Member will emerge as my Department and the independent inquiries commissioned by the Government are able to assess the lessons learned from the current outbreak.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w37.html_spnew12"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 December 2001]:</i> Pre-action disclosure is governed by the Civil Procedure Rules which regulate the conduct of civil litigation.

<P>
<a name="11217w37.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2001]:</i> The number of vets that work for the State Veterinary Service is 286 (full-time equivalents, as at January 2001). All of these veterinarians have assisted in the eradication of foot and mouth disease in some capacity.

 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2001]:</i> The total cost of payment to those temporary veterinary inspectors (TVIs) appointed for foot and mouth disease, (as of November 2001) is &#163;33,183,049. This comprises fees plus travel and subsistence expenses.

 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2001]:</i> It is not possible to provide the number of temporary veterinary inspectors (TVIs) employed by area during the foot and mouth epidemic. We appointed 2,575 TVIs during the foot and mouth crisis and they moved around the country where they were most needed. TVIs were not necessarily assigned to one area.

 <i>[holding answer 20 November 2001]:</i> It would make no sense to carry out research into the relationship between interest rates and the level of tariff income deducted. This is because a tariff is deducted from income support on a sliding scale for capital held between the lower and upper capital limits. Capital is treated in this way so that people with capital in excess of the lower limit make a reasonable weekly contribution from those resources to help meet their normal living expenses before having recourse to public funds. It is not intended to represent any return that could be obtained from investing capital and is not based on the current bank interest rate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on take-up of stakeholder pensions among the target group.  [20998]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11217w39.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 As set out in our 1998 Green Paper "Partnership in Pensions" the Government's long-term pension reforms are designed to ensure that all pensioners have a decent income in retirement, building on the foundation of the basic state pension available to all. This means everyone recognising their responsibilities; with those who are able, saving for their retirement, the Government supporting those who cannot save, and the private sector providing affordable and secure second pensions.
<P>

<a name="11217w39.html_para9">Before April 2001, many of those who could put money aside to provide for themselves in retirement had no straightforward, good-value way to enter a pension scheme. Stakeholder pensions, which were introduced from that date, offered such people a route through provision of a simple, low-charge, flexible pension scheme which, for many employees, can be accessed through their workplace.




<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 2001 : Column: 154W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11217w39.html_para10">Stakeholder pensions are open to everyone and over 490,000 have been sold in their first seven months on the market. They are particularly targeted at moderate and higher earners who do not have access to an occupational pension or to a cost-effective personal pension. Many of the target group work for employers without a comprehensive occupational or personal pension scheme for their staff before the introduction of stakeholder pensions. The requirement for such employers to provide their work force with access to a stakeholder pension scheme came into force on 8 October. It is too early to have sufficient information on which to base a reasoned assessment of take-up by the target group.

 The Pension Service will offer an improved service for pensioners. It will be customer focused and will give pensioners a modern, personalised and efficient service designed to meet their needs. It will be accessible by telephone, post, in time the internet and locally where pensioners need to do so. It will also provide information for future pensioners to help them make decisions about their future pension arrangements.

<a name="11217w40.html_para1">The Pension Service is committed to providing a seamless service to its customers. The local service will develop relationships with third parties and other local service providers, and will be looking to use other premises, particularly to enable them to hold surgeries, either for appointments or for drop-in sessions. This negotiation will be done at a local level.

<P>

<a name="11217w40.html_para2">We estimate that over a quarter of a million people have passed through the Jobcentre Plus pathfinder offices during the first month of their operation. To date there have been no serious incidents in these offices. While it is still early days, this experience from the Jobcentre Plus pathfinder offices so far confirms our belief that the new service and the new environment which we are offering in these offices promotes better behaviour in our customers. This, along with improved risk management arrangements, will we believe lead to fewer incidents of verbal and physical assaults on staff.

<P>
<a name="11217w40.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Since the beginning of September 2001, my officials have engaged in over 60 hours of talks with the PCS union about their concerns on the safety of staff. Proposals for settling the current dispute were put to the PCS on 17 October, but were narrowly rejected by the PCS national executive committee. These proposals reflected the fact that the safety of staff has been our number one concern in developing the Jobcentre Plus offices. Security measures are stronger than ever, underpinned by comprehensive risk assessments which were developed in conjunction with PCS. In November, following further discussions, the PCS were asked, if they were still unable to accept the previous proposals, to put forward their own tangible and detailed proposals on which the dispute could be settled. We have made it clear to the PCS that we are willing to have further discussions on this basis.

 The Modernisation Agency's national health service orthopaedic service collaboratives programme shows a number of NHS trusts have developed innovative solutions to improving waiting times, access and throughput of patients.

 The importance of affordable, appropriate accommodation for national health service health care workers in areas where property prices are high is an important factor in the recruitment and retention of staff and in particular nurses.

In addition suitable accommodation is being sourced outside of London in appropriate locations.

When considering whether an inquiry (in public or private) is appropriate, our main concern is to ensure that the full range of relevant issues is identified and subjected to proper and effective scrutiny. This would include consideration of the depth and nature of any earlier investigations, for example, an inquest or internal review. In making a decision we would also bear in mind the need for effectiveness, fairness, speed and economy.

<a name="11217w42.html_para4">A dedicated helpline was set up; support for family liaison officers was provided; and the Department issued a leaflet to all general practitioners on the management of acute stress disorder and post traumatic stress disorder. We have embarked on a radical programme of modernisation to improve access to effective treatment and care, reduce unfair variation, raise standards, and provide quicker and more convenient services across the spectrum of mental health services. The National Service Framework for Mental Health, published in September 1999, sets out general standards for treatment and care. In addition, the Allen Report 1989 and 'Planning for Major Incidents: the NHS guidance' 1998 were issued to help those involved in the provision of support for people with post traumatic stress disorder to identify psycho-social support, and disseminate messages about good practice.

 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> Proposals were submitted by the two regional tertiary paediatric trusts in the north-west, which reflected a service model based on one single regional centre providing all primary surgery to children with cleft lip and palate. A cleft review panel considered these proposals and recommended that the Royal Liverpool Children's Trust should go forward as the preferred option in the consultation document.
<P>

<a name="11217w43.html_para0">However, Ministers sought reassurance as to whether the proposed single site options to be consulted upon would provide the best quality service.

Organisations undertaking research into xenotransplantation in the UK are required to comply with all relevant legislation. No clinical trials involving humans have yet been approved in the UK. Our position remains that clinical trials in xenotransplantation involving humans will only be allowed to take place when we are fully satisfied that the risks associated with such procedures are acceptable taking account of all the available evidence at the time.

In the context of the terms of reference established for this investigation the NSPCC concluded that no young person at the centre could be identified as having suffered significant harm or abuse.
