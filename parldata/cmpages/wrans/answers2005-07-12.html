 The South East England Development Agency (SEEDA) is now running a number of programmes targeting broadband take-up in addition to availability.

The title of the project is &quot;Social and Economic Advancement in East Sussex through Accelerated Broadband Service Availability&quot;. Its aim is to grow demand for broadband services and to develop the benefits to businesses and less advantaged communities in priority areas.

All telephone exchanges except one in East Sussex are enabled for broadband and that one, Isfield, has a commercial wireless service installed. The wireless solution at Isfield was funded from a grant of &#163;50,000 from the South East of England Development Agency to the East Sussex county council to support wireless broadband community co-operatives. Apart from this, no direct funding has gone to East Sussex county council because we have successfully focused upon delivering a competitive marketplace to encourage the rollout of broadband.

 Although the UK currently remains a net exporter of oil, it is likely we will become a net importer by around 2010. However, relying on imports need not be a problem in itself, although it does require us to take a longer-term strategic international approach to energy reliability. Oil is an internationally traded commodity and all countries, whether import-dependent or not, have a common interest in promoting open markets. Most other advanced industrial economies already import significant proportions of their oil needs without noticeable disruption.

Moreover, the Government are already putting in place policies that will help ease the UK economy away from power supplied primarily through fossil fuel supply, by increasing energy efficiency and developing alternative technologies.

 On 28 June 2005, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary placed in the Library a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the Identity Cards Scheme which shows that the benefits outweigh the costs once the scheme is fully operational. The Police Service of Northern Ireland has been contributing to this process. The cost of equipping premises will depend on the nature of the use of the Identity Cards Scheme and the type of identity check(s) necessary to deliver the business benefits. In some cases, benefits could be realised without the use of card readers and the cost of installing any readers needs to be considered alongside future plans to refresh or upgrade IT systems. As the design of the scheme matures, during and after the procurement exercise, so will our understanding of where the scheme will be of most benefit which will allow us to further refine our estimates of costs and benefits.

It also proposed other adjustments to the own resources decision so as to reduce the net contributions to the community budget of Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. The combined effect of these changes would have meant that over the 2007 to 2013 period, the UK net contribution to the Community Budget i.e. the UK&#039;s gross contribution less the abatement and UK public and private-sector receipts would have been approximately &#8364;25 billion higher than it would have been if the current own resources system continued unchanged.

We are pressing the parties to return to Abuja on 24 August, the date set for resumption of talks by the AU Special Envoy Salim Salim, and to negotiate in good faith, towards a full political agreement, necessary to achieve peace in Darfur. Such an agreement will need to be complementary to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, signed in Nairobi on 9 January. We also continue to insist that the parties abide by the commitments they have already made to improve the security situation in Darfur, notably the Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement and the Abuja Humanitarian and Security Protocols.

 David Moran, our Ambassador to Tashkent, presented his credentials to President Karimov on 8 June 2005. The meeting was largely ceremonial. Earlier in the day, in a meeting with Foreign Minister Ganiev, Mr. Moran had said that were the opportunity to arise, he would look to discuss two principal points with the President: firstly, Mr. Karimov&#039;s concrete plans for the reforms mentioned in his 28 January speech to Parliament, and secondly, the question of allowing an international independent inquiry into the events of 12&#150;13 May in Andizhan. In the event, President Karimov raised these issues himself, sticking to well-known Uzbek positions on both.

<p><a name="st_49"><a name="50712w11.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Douglas Alexander: </b> 
 Uzbek Deputy Foreign Minister Nematov requested a meeting with our Ambassador to Tashkent, David Moran, following my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary&#039;s 14 May statement on Andizhan. A copy of the statement is available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website: www.fco.gov.uk/policy/news/press-releases. Mr. Moran told Mr. Nematov that a peaceful solution to the Andizhan situation would need to be accompanied by progress on both economic and political reforms. He noted that Uzbek President Karimov had mentioned such reforms in his 28 January 2005 speech to Parliament. A number of decrees have been issued in June by the Uzbek Government, which if implemented, might reduce the burden on businesses, for example by reducing the scope for official inspections.

<a name="stpa_36">Uzbek Foreign Minister Ganiev has undertaken to discuss these areas with EU Heads of Mission in Tashkent. We look forward to this opportunity for dialogue towards reform.

 The Government have been closely monitoring the situation regarding ATM charges and will continue to do so. This includes monitoring the effectiveness of LINK rules on signage and regular discussion of relevant issues with LINK and other interested parties. The Office of Fair Trading&#039;s Payment Systems Task Force, established to address competition problems in payment systems, is about to start work on LINK Access and Governance.

<p>
<a name="50712w11.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_37">We believe it is important that people are able to obtain cash free of charge. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of surcharging ATMs in the UK. However, statistics on the number of withdrawals at these ATMs indicate that most are to be found in locations where there are only a low number of transactions and where interchange fees would therefore be insufficient to cover the operating costs of the ATM, were it to offer free withdrawals. The Government believes that direct regulation of retail prices should only be a last resort, implemented where it has been very clearly established that competition is not feasible, or where a monopoly supplier would be the most efficient option.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712w11.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_38">Overall, relatively few withdrawals are made at charging machines. Over 96 per cent. of withdrawals are free of charge to consumers and there are over 30,000 free ATMs in the UK. The number of free ATMs is still increasing and the Government does not see any reason to believe that free ATMs are under threat. There are also alternative ways to obtain free access to cash. Many of the major banks now offer their customers free over-the-counter withdrawals at the Post Office and &#039;Cash Back&#039; is widely available in supermarkets and shops.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712w11.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_39">The Government have responded to the Treasury Select Committee&#039;s recent report on cash machine charges (Treasury Committee&#039;s Fifth Report of Session 2004&#150;05) and the Treasury Committee is expected to publish the response shortly, once it has been re-appointed following the general election. The Government&#039;s response to the Treasury Select Committees&#039; report sets out policy on the issue in more detail.

<sup>(6)</sup> For the year 2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used by ONS to define alcohol-related deaths are listed below:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>

For the years 2001&#150;04 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>

Deaths were selected using the original underlying cause.<br>

<sup>(7)</sup> Figures provided relate to the current county of Bedfordshire. This excludes the unitary authority of Luton, created in 1997, which was part of the former county.<br>

The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in:<br>

<p><a name="st_96"><a name="50712w17.html_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Under the provisions of the Licensed Premises (Exclusion of Certain Persons) Act 1980 a court can make an order prohibiting a person from entering specified licensed premises, following conviction for an offence committed on licensed premises involving violence or threats of violence. In addition, Antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) that were introduced under Section one of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and first used in 1999 can also be used to prohibit certain people from entering specific areas or premises. ASBOs however have a two year minimum period and can contain various prohibitions. We are therefore introducing Drinking Banning Orders (DBOs) under the Violent Crime Reduction Bill that we introduced on 8 June 2005. The Bill received its Second Reading on 20 June 2005. A DBO has an effect for a period not less than two months and not more than two years and would be more appropriate where binge drinking and alcohol fuelled behaviour needs to be addressed and discouraged and where there is a need for more flexible time limits to apply to a ban.

How the police exercise this power is an operational matter for individual chief officers.

Any sub-contract awarded for the manufacture and supply of chips to be used in ePassports would thereafter be placed by SPSL. Such a contract has not yet been placed.

<a name="stpa_76">Personal attendance for passport renewals would become necessary in connection with the addition of fingerprints to biometric passports, and interview of all passport applicants would provide a further strengthening of UK Passport Service premises in line with International practises. The EU has decided that fingerprints should be included in passports issued by member states in the Schengen area, within three years of agreement on the technical specification. The UK is currently excluded from this requirement but there would be disadvantages for British passport holders if UK passports were issued to a lower standard than those of other EU member states. The UK is currently challenging its exclusion, and in parallel is considering whether to mirror the EU requirement. A statement will be made when final decisions have been made.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment the Department has made of the cost-effectiveness of the proposed interview scheme in the Passport Office. [11182]</p>




<p><a name="st_105"><a name="50712w18.html_spnew3"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 The Passport Service&#039;s Authentication by Interview (AbI) scheme is intended both to deter and to detect fraudulent applications among adult first time applicants but its business case has been constructed on its potential deterrent effect, for which evidence exists. UKPS data sampling has identified the first time adult channel as accounting for 74 per cent. of all fraudulent applications, although this group accounts for less than 10 per cent. of all applications processed annually by the Agency. AbI closes the loophole that currently exists in the postal application system by bringing together the physical applicant, and current biographical information, to ensure they are one and the same. A fraudster will now be faced with having to act out their false identity, and risk a real possibility of detection. There have been a number of instances in the past where the requirement to attend for interview would have enabled UKPS to identify a fraudulent application and prevent the issue of a passport in a false identity. The estimated cost of the scheme in its year of introduction is aggregated within the total estimated unit cost of &#163;67.93 for 2006&#150;07, published within the UKPS Corporate and Business Plan. The benefit the scheme is designed to deliver is in deterring fraudulent passport applications and thus contributing to the overall fight against identity fraud and reducing numbers of such frauds with consequent benefits to the individual and to the UK public and private sectors.

<a name="stpa_77">The planned interviews will be conducted after improved checking of the information provided by applicants, including database checks. The interview will then enable genuine applicants to demonstrate their knowledge of the identity claimed but will face fraudulent applicants with the likelihood of detection. The interview will have an important deterrent effect, and will close off loopholes associated with illegal immigration where the applicant is often not in the UK and would be unable to answer questions related to residence in the UK. Only a procedure that includes an interview will enable the UKPS to confirm that the intended passport holder is the rightful owner of the identity claimed and to close the loophole that is inevitable when applications can be submitted by post.

<a name="stpa_85">Overall, Officer recruitment continues at a high level compared with previous years and the Service-wide shortfall among operational staff is well within an acceptable operating margin. To cover any vacancies in the short-term, certain establishments are allowing officers to work additional hours as part of the &#039;Contracted Supplementary Hours Scheme&#039;. This scheme contributed the equivalent of 412 full-time officers at 31 March 2005. At that time the total operational staff availability was 25,858 compared to an operational staffing requirement of 26,087, resulting in a Service-wide shortfall of just 0.9 per cent.

<p>
<a name="50712w18.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_86">Staffing levels in non-operational roles are more fluid and vacancy figures require qualification. This is in part due to the number of reviews taking place across the Prison Service and on-going work to introduce greater efficiencies which has led to decisions to leave posts unfilled.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many <i>(a)</i> men and <i>(b)</i> women were being held in prison on 24 June; how many prisoners were released on early release on 24 June; how many prisoners were eligible for early release on 24 June; and how many prisoners were released on 24 June.

<p><a name="st_122"><a name="50712w18.html_spnew20"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 On 24 June 2005 there were 71,578 males and 4,501 females held in prison establishments in England and Wales, as recorded on the Prison Service IT system. There were an estimated 154 prisoners with a sentence length of three months to less than four years whose home detention curfew (HDC) eligibility date was 24 June 2005. On that date, 46 prisoners were released on HDC. Information on the number of prisoners discharged by other means on 24 June 2005 is 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Jul 2005 : Column 936W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
not yet available. The number of prisoners with a sentence length of three months to less than four years will include some prisoners who are not eligible for HDC because of the nature of their current or previous offences. The figures also exclude a small number of prisoners in the population who are on remand at the end of the previous month, but are subsequently sentenced to a custodial sentence suitable for HDC and whose HDC eligibility date falls on that date. This occurs when they have spent a significant time on remand.

<p><a name="st_123"><a name="50712w18.html_spnew21"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 Prisoners have access to television in-cell as part of the Incentive and Earned Privileges Scheme. Prisoners rent these sets for a weekly charge of &#163;1. The revenue generated is used to pay for the televisions and their replacements. Televisions in-cell are covered by Crown exemption and do not require a television licence. A small number of televisions in communal areas of a prison are licensed. The amount of money spent by each establishment on television licences for these sets is not centrally recorded.

 The information requested with respect to apparent natural causes deaths in prisons in England and Wales is provided in the following table. Prisons, together with their local healthcare partners, assess the healthcare needs of their populations, whatever their age, and develop services to meet those needs. The National Offender Management Service, Prison Service and Department of Health are working closely together to improve health care provision for prisoners. Key achievements include developing better mental health provision, including NHS-funded in-reach teams; supporting improvements in primary care services; developing the prison health workforce and improving the prison health estate. NHS primary care trusts started to assume responsibility for the commissioning of prison health services in public prisons in England in April 2004. This process is expected to be completed by April 2006. All deaths in custody are subject to a coroner&#039;s inquest and (since April 2004) an investigation by the prisons and probation ombudsman (PPO). The PPO&#039;s recommendations are considered carefully and the reports are analysed to identify common trends, issues that need to be addressed and good practice examples that can be disseminated.

For veterinary medicines a certain amount of animal testing is required by Directive 2001/82/EC in order to demonstrate efficacy as well as human, animal and environmental safety.

<a name="stpa_103">Provision of animal test data is not optional but if sufficient information were available on a chemical through its historical use, through human exposure data, or from alternative non-animal testing methods, then expert judgment would be used by Regulatory Authorities to avoid unnecessary further testing on animals. Regulatory Authorities are fully cognisant of the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes and will not require unnecessary testing on animals. They welcome any proposals for non-animal testing that provide equivalent assurance of safety.

<p>

The use of meat and bone meal and the anaerobic digestion of slurry for the generation of electricity are eligible sources of renewable energy. Detailed guidance on the anaerobic digestion of slurry has been provided to industry. The Biomass Study Task Force, led by Sir Ben Gill, is looking at the barriers to developing biomass energy, including the use of slurry, and will recommend ways to overcome the problems. We will consider the way forward in the light of their recommendations. The Government are also looking at the scope for supporting renewable heat.

The production of biodiesel, including that produced from tallow, is supported by the 20 pence per litre reduction in duty compared to fossil fuels. The Government are carrying out a feasibility study on a renewable transport fuel obligation. If adopted, this would require a specified proportion of the total fuel supply to be from biofuels.

Notes:<br>

1. Finished in-year admissions:<br>

A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis):<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

3. Main operation:<br>

The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, for example, time waited, but the figures for all operations count of episodes give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

4. Ungrossed data:<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, that is, the data are ungrossed.<br>

5. Time waited (days):<br>

Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

1. The figures are in nominal terms ie the Department has applied a deflator (RPI&#151;the one normally used in contracts) to the baselines figure submitted to it by the Trust. Figures will vary as a result of changes in RPI.<br>

2. Unitary payments are subject to satisfactory performance by the contractor and other factors such as refinancing.<br>

3. Details of length of contracts for each scheme are only kept centrally for prioritised schemes (marked *). For other schemes in the table the contract length is assumed to be 30 years, the standard length introduced under the NHS Standard Form Contract in 1999.<br>

<p><a name="st_247"><a name="50712w32.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 International aviation is already subject to a well-developed and closely monitored regulatory regime established by the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago Convention). Under the Convention the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) establishes detailed standards and recommended practices for the airworthiness of aircraft, the operational standards of airlines, and many other aspects of aviation. These standards and recommended practices relate primarily to safety and security issues, and cover safety issues relating to the carriage of munitions and other dangerous goods. In addition the Convention itself provides that weapons and munitions of war may only be carried through the airspace of a state with the permission of that state.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712w32.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_178">To ensure that these standards are properly implemented, ICAO has established the Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme under which the regulatory regime of each Contracting State is audited at regular intervals, and the results made available to all other States. Where deficiencies are identified, the State concerned is required to draw up an Action Plan agreed with ICAO, and ICAO subsequently assesses the implementation of the Plan.

<p>
<a name="50712w32.html_para1">
Within Europe there is already a regulatory regime on aviation insurance, with the relevant national authority required to ensure that airlines/carriers have sufficient insurance cover, and in line with EU law and our bilateral agreements with third countries we require foreign aircraft visiting the UK to demonstrate evidence of adequate cover. Further rules on insurance would impose an additional regulatory burden in already well-regulated States but might not be adequately implemented or enforced in countries with less stringent governance.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps he is taking to encourage people to buy cars that are fuel-efficient.  [9220]</p>




<p><a name="st_264"><a name="50712w33.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The main steps are summarised in the Government&#039;s 2002 Powering Future Vehicles Strategy. The progress we have made in encouraging people to choose more fuel efficient vehicles is described in the first two annual reports on the delivery of the strategy. All of these documents are available via the Department for Transport&#039;s website.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712w33.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_186">In 2001 we introduced a graduated vehicle excise duty system which rewards those who choose the most fuel-efficient vehicles. In 2002, we introduced a revised company car tax scheme, under which those who choose the most fuel efficient vehicles can save up to several thousand pounds a year. These changes have reinforced the actions of the motor industry to deliver fuel efficiency improvements under their voluntary agreements with the European Commission, improving the average fuel efficiency of new cars sold in the UK by some 10 per cent. over the last decade.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712w33.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_187">We have also this year launched a colour-coded fuel efficiency label which will be displayed on new vehicles in nearly all UK car showrooms by the end of the summer. This will highlight the savings that motorists can make by choosing more fuel efficient vehicles. We are also considering, subject to the necessary state aid approval from the European Commission, the introduction of a purchase grant scheme which will reward those who choose the very cleanest and most fuel-efficient vehicles.

 Discussions were first held in January when the Secretary of State for International Development visited Sri Lanka to make an initial assessment of the situation and the impact of our emergency assistance. I visited Sri Lanka from 15&#150;17 June to review progress and to consider how best we may maintain support. During my visit I held discussions with the Finance Secretary, the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, the President&#039;s spokesperson for Relief, Reconstruction and Reconciliation, the Heads of the Government&#039;s Task Forces for Relief and Reconstruction, and local government representatives. I also met officials leading the peace process. I discussed progress with other donors, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and met some of the communities devastated by the tsunami.

There has been good progress: some 30,000 transitional homes have been constructed for families who lost their homes; contracts have been signed to rebuild 176 of the 182 schools damaged and funds promised for the balance. Some 95 per cent. of the children affected by the tsunami are now back at school. Hospital reconstruction is also underway and fully financed. Roads, railways and power supplies (where these existed) have been restored.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712w34.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_192">Much remains to be done however. Increased effort is required to restore livelihoods. In addition the Government ban on rebuilding within a buffer zone stretching 100 to 200 metres from the sea is causing problems in some districts because of the scarcity of suitable alternative land. Furthermore the immense size of the reconstruction task is stretching the capacity of central and local government to manage and coordinate the reconstruction effort. Inevitably this contributes to bureaucratic delay in some instances and assistance reaching some communities sooner than others. The Government and LTTE agreement to establish a post-tsunami operational management structure should help ensure that communities in the north-east are better able to access external support.

<p><a name="qn_279"><a name="50712w35.html_wqn1"><b> Mark Simmonds: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of the likely effect of the European Commission&#039;s proposals for changes to the EU sugar pricing and subsidy regime on African Caribbean Pacific countries; and if he will make a statement.  [9266]</p>




<p><a name="st_279"><a name="50712w35.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 The EU sugar regime is an anachronism and must be reformed. It supports EU growers and processors with expensive subsidies, to the disadvantage of efficient developing country exporters. The EU is one of the highest cost producers in the world, yet it is also the second largest exporter, thanks to these subsidies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712w35.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_197">The existing system leads many African Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) country producers to export raw sugar to the EU even when it is not profitable to do so, meaning that scarce government resources are often diverted to maintain a sugar industry. It also forces the EU to dump approximately five million tonnes of heavily subsidised sugar on the world market each year. This keeps the world price low, making it difficult for developing country producers to sell in their own markets locally, as well as making it harder for them to export. Reform should create an environment where growers make their decisions on the basis of their own competitiveness, not on how much money they will be paid in subsidies, and enable Least Developed Countries (LDC)s to benefit in a sustainable manner from the duty-free and quota-free access to Europe that they will receive for sugar by 2009 under the Everything But Arms initiative.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712w35.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_198">We are aware, however, that reform will have serious ramifications for some of the 18 African Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) Sugar Protocol countries that receive preferential access to the European market. These countries will face a price cut of up to 39 per cent. for their sugar exports to Europe. Some of them export only a relatively small proportion of their sugar crop to Europe, but others are heavily dependent on the European market. In Guyana, for example, sugar production makes up 18 per cent. of GDP, most of which is exported to Europe. We believe that reform could cost the ACP up to &#8364;500 million per year in lost revenues and lost foreign exchange. This is why we have placed such an emphasis on the transitional assistance measures that are an integral part of the overall reform. The UK has been pushing for timely and adequate assistance to be made available, and we have been working with the ACP to help them to develop the country plans through which assistance will be delivered.

The Commission anticipates that the plans will provide for a combination of trade and aid measures to improve productivity in the sugar sector, to assist diversification into other sectors and to respond to the broader impacts of adjustment (such as on social services and macro-economic stability), with the balance between these varying country by country.

<sup>(33)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>

<sup>(34)</sup> Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending LEA maintained schools and are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(35)</sup> 1999&#150;2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DfES. 2003&#150;04 is the latest year for which figures are available.<br>

<sup>(36)</sup> The main difference between the 1985&#150;86 and 2003&#150;04 figures is that meals and milk is no longer excluded and that no adjustments for balances are now made. However, 1985&#150;86 also includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie 



payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses, while in 2003&#150;04 only the schools element of these categories is included. Also, for some LEAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LEA part of the form in 2003&#150;04 and would therefore be excluded, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>

<sup>(37)</sup> Figures are reported in cash terms and rounded to the nearest 10 as reported by the LEA.<br>

<sup>(38)</sup> Figures for 1985&#150;86 are published in the Departments Statistics of Education, Finance and Awards volume 1985. The all England figure published in the earlier Official Report, column 1446W, was taken as an aggregate of the individual LEA level unit costs for special schools. The individual LEA special School data are no longer available and therefore are not included in the answer to this PQ.<br>

 This Government were the first to introduce statutory support for students studying on a part-time basis. From 2001 support for English part-time students was in the form of an income-assessed loan of &#163;500 per annum; a fee waiver system was also available to students in certain circumstances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712w40.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_239">In 2004/05 a new package of statutory support was introduced comprising a non-repayable fee grant of up to &#163;575 and a non-repayable course grant of up to &#163;250. The grants are means-tested in order to target funding most effectively at those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712w40.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_240">For the academic year 2005/06 the maximum fee grant is being increased to &#163;885. And we are improving the fee grant by linking the amount available to the intensity at which the student is studying.

<p>

<a name="stpa_241">We will continue to monitor the sector to ensure that we use available funding in the most effective way to support those part-time students who most need it.

<a name="stpa_242">Data from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) shows that four of the six west London boroughs (Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Hillingdon and Hounslow) have post-16 participation rates below the national average with participation rates in Hillingdon as low as 73 per cent. (2003). A particular issue in west London is the relatively low participation rate of white students (67 per cent.), particularly boys. This variation is also reflected in Higher Education participation rates where 30 ward areas within the six boroughs have been identified as having low participation.

<a name="50712w40.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_243">The Academy aims to attract students who might not otherwise have remained in education at age 16. The curriculum to be offered by the Academy will principally cover education at levels 2 and 3. The sponsors expect about 50 per cent. of the intake to progress from level 1 to 2 and 50 per cent. to progress from level 2 to 3. They recognise that some students will require additional support before commencing level 3 courses in the Academy&#039;s specialisms of science, technology, maths and Chinese. There will be extensive discussions with education professionals and local providers to ensure that a suitable curriculum, which complements existing provision, is available for the students.
