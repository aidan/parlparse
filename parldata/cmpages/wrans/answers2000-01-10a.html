<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hilary Benn: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if he will issue guidance to the Crown Prosecution Service on improving communications with the victims of stalking; and if he will make a statement.  [104040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Victim's Charter commits the police to keep all victims informed of developments in the case regardless of the nature of the offence. Currently, the CPS provides to the police information about prosecution decisions for them to forward to victims, or their families, as appropriate.
<P>

<a name="00110w01.html_para0">The CPS has a specific role in stalking cases to assist victims when the court has made a restraining order under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, and when subsequently there is a need to seek a variation of the order. The victim is informed of any application to vary the restraining order and asked to express views and, if necessary, to attend. Again, however, the guiding principle is that the CPS communicates with the victim through the police.
<P>

<a name="00110w01.html_para1">The Home Office will shortly be issuing national 'good practice' guidelines to the police and other agencies resulting from the final evaluation of the "One Stop Shop" initiative, which was established to see how the Victim's Charter commitment to keep victims informed might best be met.
<P>

<a name="00110w01.html_para2">Following recommendations in Sir Iain Glidewell's report into the CPS and Sir William Macpherson's report into the death of Stephen Lawrence, the CPS is committed to adopting a more proactive role in communicating with victims. The Service is currently piloting arrangements for taking on responsibility to communicate direct with victims rather than via the police. The pilots will be evaluated before an implementation plan is devised.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1) on what occasions <i>(a)</i> he, <i>(b)</i> Ministers in his Department and <i>(c)</i> his officials have discussed the case of Konrad Kalejs with the Australian authorities; and what was the nature of the discussions and information received;  [104389]

(3) on what occasions <i>(a)</i> he, <i>(b)</i> Ministers in his Department and <i>(c)</i> his officials have discussed the case of Konrad Kalejs with the United States authorities; and what was the nature of the discussions and information received;  [104390]
<P>
(4) on what occasions <i>(a)</i> he, <i>(b)</i> Ministers in his Department and <i>(c)</i> his officials have discussed the case of Konrad Kalejs with the Canadian authorities; and what was the nature of the discussions and information received.  [104377]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 Neither the Secretary of State nor FCO Ministers have had contact with their American, Australian, Canadian, or Latvian counterparts on the issue of Konrad Kalejs.
<P>

<a name="00110w01.html_para3">At the request of the Home Office, British officials in Riga and Canberra discussed Kalejs with host Governments. British officials passed a request for information from the American Embassy in London to the Home Office. Officials in Ottawa and Washington have been in contact with their host Governments.
<P>

<a name="00110w01.html_para4">The purpose of discussions with the Australian and Latvian authorities was to make them aware of developments in the Kalejs case, and to inform them of our readiness to pass on all relevant information, held by HMG.
<P>

<a name="00110w01.html_para5">The purpose of discussions with the Americans and Canadians was to ask that all relevant information they had on Kalejs be passed to authorities in Australia and Latvia.




<P>

<P>

<a name="00110w01.html_para6">The Latvian authorities informed us on 3 January that they were reopening their investigation into Kalejs, indicated that they had first investigated him in 1992, and said that they had since maintained close links with US and Canadian authorities.
<P>

<a name="00110w01.html_para7">The Australians informed officials that they did not have an extradition treaty with Latvia, but would consider any extradition request made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the running costs of the British embassies in <i>(a)</i> Paris and <i>(b)</i> Washington.  [104087]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The running costs for Paris include all Locally Engaged (LE) staff costs of subordinate Posts throughout France. Similarly Washington costs include LE staff throughout the USA. The total staff levels are 248 for Paris, of which 44 are UK based, and 535 for Washington, of which 55 are UK based. It is therefore not possible to draw proper comparisons between the running costs of the two Embassies. However, the ratio of 5:4 UK based staff between Washington and Paris is not considered unreasonable.
<P>

<a name="00110w01.html_para8">It is important to look at these figures in context: the FCO employs fewer staff and costs less to run than Birmingham City Council. The cost of running the FCO in London and at its 221 posts overseas amounts to less than one-third of one per cent. (0.3 per cent.) of all Government expenditure, and less than 0.15 per cent. of UK GDP. The total FCO budget costs each man, woman and child in Britain only 5p a day.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what the annual running costs were of UK embassies in <i>(a)</i> the European Union and <i>(b)</i> the USA, in the last year for which figures are available.  [104130]<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="00110w01.html_para9">The British Government are strong supporters of the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in Kosovo (ICTY), as in other parts of the Former Yugoslavia. As part of KFOR, British forces have assisted the work of ICTY investigators, notably by providing a secure environment in which they can work. British service personnel were also involved, earlier this year, in debriefing Kosovar refugees, in Macedonia and elsewhere, and the information gained has been passed to the Tribunal.

<P>
<a name="00110w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The decision whether to grant planning permission for proposed new housing developments is, in the first instance, a matter for the local planning authority concerned. Applications shall be determined in accordance with the development plan for the area, unless material considerations indicate otherwise. In formulating their development plans local authorities must have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State. We expect to publish new national planning policy guidance on housing (PPG3), and final proposals for the new regional planning guidance for the South East (RPG9), soon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Brinton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many of the Bills published since the Queen's Speech were accompanied by a statement of their implications for the environment.  [104271]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 It is the Government's policy that environmental aspects should be considered fully alongside the economic and social considerations during the development or review of a policy. My Department stands ready to advise on appraisal and monitoring systems. But it is for individual Departments to set up their own systems to ensure that their policies take account of the environment and that, where necessary, environmental appraisals are carried out. The overall policy and its operation is monitored by the Green Ministers' Committee, which reports annually in July.
<P>

<a name="00110w01.html_para10">Since the Queen's Speech, the DETR has published two Bills, the Transport Bill and the Local Government Bill. The Transport Bill and a Regulatory, Environmental and Equal Treatment Appraisal were published on 1 December 1999.
<P>

<a name="00110w01.html_para11">The Local Government Bill provides a new discretionary power for local authorities to take steps which, in their view, promote the economic, social and environmental well-being of those who live, work in or visit their local area, in order to improve the quality of life locally. The remainder of the Bill addresses the way in which local authorities are organised and elected and carry out their business. In this case, no specific environmental impact statement has been published.

<a name="00110w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) has only just started to use private opticians. DVLA currently pays optometrists &#163;35 to undertake each visual field test, which, on current volumes of tests, will amount to an annual total of &#163;280,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1999, authorities will be required to report annually their performance against specified national performance indicators. Details were published on 23 December in "Best Value and Audit Commission Performance Indicators for 2000-2001". They include indicators on the representation of minority ethnic staff in the workforce and the proportion of women in senior management posts. There is no indicator in respect of the age breakdown of the workforce, but the indicators will be reviewed annually and updated in the light of consultation with the range of authority and customer interests.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many employees of his Department took early retirement packages, and at what total cost, in the financial year 1996-97.  [104098]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 In the financial year 1996-97, 462 employees of the Department of the Environment and the Department of Transport took early retirement. In addition, some 228 employees took early severance. It would not be possible to separate retirement and severance costs without disproportionate cost and effort, but the total costs of early retirements and severance in the year concerned was &#163;23,322,610. This includes ongoing costs of departures from previous years.

<a name="00110w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what assessment he has made of the requirements for match public funds from his Department for the EU Objective 1 regions of <i>(a)</i> Cornwall and Scilly, <i>(b)</i> Merseyside and <i>(c)</i> South Yorkshire for each of the seven years of the programme.  [104301]

<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 My Department will provide significant financial support for all three Objective 1 programmes through a number of funding mechanisms. These include the Single Regeneration Budget and New Deal for Communities, as well as mainstream funding made available to local authorities. Local partnerships can prioritise the use of these resources to fund projects jointly with the Structural Funds, thereby boosting their impact.

<P>

<a name="00110w02.html_para0">It is too early to estimate how much my Department's contribution is likely to be over the 2000-06 programme period. This will depend on the types of projects which local partnerships select for support over the programming period.

[104144]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 There are no plans to appoint such representatives to the Strategic Rail Authority. The Secretary of State has, however, consulted the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Executive about Welsh and Scottish representation on the SRA. It is not intended that the responsibilities of the SRA will extend to Northern Ireland.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 My Department has received a large number of representations in recent months from both interested organisations and members of the public, on a wide range of homelessness issues, and in particular on our recently published plans to tackle rough sleeping.
<P>

<a name="00110w02.html_para1">From its establishment in April 1999, the Rough Sleepers Unit consulted extensively with key partners as part of the development of its strategy, "Coming in from the Cold", which was published on 15 December 1999. Organisations that made representations during this process included other Government departments, local government, other statutory bodies including the Police and the National Health Service, key national and local voluntary organisations, the business community, faith leaders and rough sleepers themselves, as well as members of the general public.
<P>

<a name="00110w02.html_para2">Also, my Department has set up an official-level sounding board, which includes representatives from the Local Government Association, the Association of London Government, Shelter, the Chartered Institute of Housing, the National Housing Federation and other organisations with an interest in social housing, to discuss proposals for changes to policy on homelessness and the allocation of social housing. Our proposals are still at an early stage, but we intend to consult on them widely in due course.

<P>
<P>

<a name="00110w02.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Desmond Turner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how the figure of &#163;350 million for the partial sale of NATS was calculated; and what plans he has to write off the outstanding debts owed by NATS.  [104097]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The estimate of &#163;350 million in proceeds from the strategic partner in NATS is net of any debt restructuring and was calculated by our advisers in order to give Parliament a broad estimate of the possible proceeds from the proposed sale. The precise amount of the proceeds will be the subject of commercial negotiations with the strategic partner.
<P>

<a name="00110w02.html_para3">NATS loans from the NLF must be extinguished when the PPP is put in place so as to avoid any hidden subsidy to the PPP. This may be achieved by repayment, or by writing them off and replacing them with new commercial debt. Final decisions will be taken in consultation with the selected strategic partner when establishing an optimum capital structure for the company.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w02.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Representations, both for and against proposals, can be made at any time to the Local Government Commission (LGC) during the review process and to the Secretary of State after the publication of the Final Report and until an Order is made. It is vital for the integrity of democratic local government that the process of making local authority electoral arrangements should be, and be seen to be, fully independent. Therefore, it is the Government's policy that, unless there is compelling evidence available to it that the recommendations of the LGC may be flawed, it will accept them. However all representations received are fully considered before arriving at a final decision.

<P>
<a name="00110w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Households eligible for the New Homes Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES) who live in properties with solid walls will receive loft insulation and draught proofing under the scheme, to improve the energy efficiency of the building fabric.
<P>

<a name="00110w03.html_para0">With regard to the solid wall insulation, as I detailed in the answer I gave on Tuesday 19 October 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column 491W, this does not appear to be appropriate for the packages of improvements to be offered under the new HEES. Therefore external or internal wall insulation measures will not be available under the scheme.
<P>

<a name="00110w03.html_para1">Instead, the New HEES packages available for these solid wall properties include higher levels of heating improvements than those for cavity walled homes, so providing similar reductions in fuel costs for both types of property.

 Delivering efficient and modern public services is a key part of the Government's agenda for improving productivity. Greater efficiency is being sought therefore within the public sector to ensure that the most effective results are obtained from available resources. The Department's Public Service Agreement (PSA), set out in "Public Services for the Future", Cm 4181, includes a range of measures for taking this forward, both within the Department itself and in other public sector bodies.

 The letter concerned the rateable value to be prescribed for pumped-storage energy schemes as part of the current revaluation of non-domestic rates. There are no pumped-storage schemes in England. The values of the plants at Dinorwig and Ffestiniog, which were the subject of Edison Mission Energy's letter, will be prescribed by the National Assembly for Wales.

 Action by the Home Office is being taken forward as part of the Government's 10-year national anti-drugs strategy "Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain", published in April 1998.
<P>

<a name="00110w03.html_para14">The Home Office is contributing to the strategy on several fronts. The Department's Drugs Prevention Advisory Service (DPAS), which succeeded the Drug 



<P>
<P><I>10 Jan 2000 : Column: 11W</I><P>
Prevention Initiative on 1 April 1999, is actively promoting effective community-based drugs prevention and supporting the delivery of Aim 1 (helping young people resist drug misuse), and Aim 2 (protecting communities from drug-related anti-social and criminal behaviour) of the national strategy.
<P>

<a name="00110w03.html_para15">DPAS is the first Government drugs prevention organisation to cover the whole of England. It works closely with Drug Action Teams--the bodies charged with local delivery of the national strategy--to encourage and support the development of effective local prevention initiatives. DPAS also provides advice and support to community-based partnerships on how to address drug related problems within communities. In addition, it acts as a pressure point on other relevant initiatives and programmes such as community safety, crime reduction and community regeneration, to ensure that drug issues are included on those agendas.
<P>

<a name="00110w03.html_para16">The Home Office crime reduction strategy places a strong emphasis on breaking the link between drugs and crime. Many acquisitive crimes are connected to drug misuse. The crime reduction strategy has a particular focus on domestic burglary and vehicle crime. For example, funding is being made available to protect over two million homes in 500 high burglary areas over the next two years. Moreover, the Government introduced new legislation this month which provides for mandatory sentences of at least three years for third-time burglars. Targeted policing initiatives are also being adopted to tackle crimes like drug dealing in communities.
<P>

<a name="00110w03.html_para17">Other measures designed to break the link between drugs and crime include the piloting of Drug Treatment and Testing Orders under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998; the provision of &#163;20 million to pump prime the establishment of arrest referral schemes across England and Wales to lead drug misusing offenders into treatment; and proposals to extend drug testing across the criminal justice system.

<P>

<a name="00110w04.html_para0">That reply mentioned the work of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) to counter the illicit manufacture and sale of GHB, and it might be helpful to elaborate on this. In addition to investigating offences under the Medicines Act, the MCA has taken action on a number of fronts in recent months to reduce the supply of GHB. The Agency has issued an advertising alert to the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) and circulated briefing to all heads of police forces and all trading standards and environmental health offices. MCA officers have also targeted a number of sex shops and similar

<P>

<a name="00110w04.html_para1">The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) also has a key role to play. The NCIS Drugs Section works with the chemical industry, the Home Office and police forces to gather intelligence on the illicit manufacture of drugs. In the last year this intelligence led to the discovery of eight illicit drug laboratories producing amphetamine, ecstasy and GHB.

<a name="00110w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 There is currently little evidence of gamma hydroxy butyrate (GHB) being used to facilitate rape. Forensic Science Service analysis since March of last year of samples taken from 100 victims of sexual assault and rape where the use of drugs is suspected has identified GHB in four cases.
<P>

<a name="00110w04.html_para2">While the analysis has provided no direct linkage between GHB and the sexual offence, rape is clearly an extremely serious offence and it is important for the Government to have a clear understanding of the extent of the drug rape problem. With this in mind, the Home Office sponsored a Metropolitan police research initiative into drug assisted rape, which is due to be concluded in April 2000. Ministers will consider the findings and recommendations of this study.
<P>

<a name="00110w04.html_para3">Separately, a Home Office led review was set up at the beginning of 1999 to review the law on sex offences in England and Wales. As part of its considerations, the review is considering the law relating to consent, and circumstances where consent is not present. It is also considering whether the current offence of administering drugs to obtain or facilitate intercourse (section 4 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956) is still appropriate. The review expects to report its recommendations to Ministers in the spring, and we plan to publish a consultation paper shortly after this.

 The conduct of this and any other criminal investigation lies within the operational responsibility of the relevant Chief Officer of Police, in this case the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis.

<P>
<a name="00110w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I was minded to deport Konrad Kalejs on the ground that his presence in the United Kingdom was not conducive to the public good. I reached that decision because I was satisfied that reasonable grounds existed to believe that Kalejs was complicit in war crimes committed in Latvia between 1941 and 1944. In coming to that decision I took account of all the evidence available to me, including that which had emerged from investigations carried out by the Australian, American and Canadian authorities, as well as the Metropolitan Police War Crimes Unit, in the early 1990s.
<P>

<a name="00110w04.html_para11">My decision that reasonable grounds existed to believe that Kalejs was complicit in war crimes was reached where necessary on the balance of probabilities. I was aware that for the police to mount a successful prosecution in the courts they would have been required to produce evidence to a different and far higher standard of proof.

<UL>(2) how many asylum seekers whose appeals were refused in <i>(a)</i> 1998 and <i>(b)</i> 1999 have been deported; and what proportion of the total number of those whose appeals were refused this was in each year.  [104045]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 In 1998 a total of 25,300 asylum appeals were determined by Adjudicators of the Immigration Appellate Authority. Of this total 21,100 appeals (84 per cent.) were dismissed. Information for 1999 is not yet available.
<P>

<a name="00110w05.html_para0">The requested information on the number of asylum seekers whose appeals were refused and deported is available only at disproportionate cost through the examination of individual case records.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will place in the Library a copy of the Passport Agency document,"Blueprint for the Future".  [103960]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Yes. The Passport Agency's document "Blueprint for the Future" has been produced to inform its staff of its plans for the future as set out in the Agency's Corporate and Business Plans 1999-2002, and its separate Action Plan. Copies of these Plans were placed in the Library on 6 December, and copies of the Passport Agency's "Blueprint for the Future" have now been placed there as well.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will provide guidance to police forces about allowing officers facing disciplinary hearings the assistance, if requested, of a representative of the Black Police Association.  [103919]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him on 8 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 533-34W. The choice of representative at a discipline hearing is a matter for the officer concerned. It would be inappropriate for me to issue guidance suggesting who he or she should be.

 Records for the Home Office estate are not held centrally. My six central London headquarters buildings have between them one room for ethnic minority religious use, two rooms for mother and baby facilities and 11 rooms for smokers. Each building also has first aid facilities. These serve a total population of about 3,900 staff, including the United Kingdom Passport Agency, Police Information Technology Organisation and Her Majesty's Prison Service.

 I am fully aware of the concerns which have been expressed in respect of the operation of the English Table Tennis Association (ETTA) and the role of its Chairman. These issues have been investigated by Sport England and the National Audit Office. As a result, the ETTA has taken a number of steps, including changes to its rules, committee structure and constitution, in order to prevent the risk of conflicts of interest arising and of members gaining unfair commercial advantage. In particular, it has set up a trade committee, upon which the Chairman does not sit, to deal with any business in which the chairman might have a commercial interest. The ETTA is also on the "watch list" of Sport England's Management Audit Department and is therefore subject to regular review and monitoring. This has indicated that all of the required operational procedures are being fully implemented by the ETTA. Sport England is also satisfied, having investigated a number of specific complaints, that there has been no misuse of public funds in respect of the ETTA. However, in view of the concerns which have been expressed in the past about the ETTA, the Chairman of Sport England has, at my request, agreed to carry out a further review of the progress being made towards the original recommendations made to the ETTA by the National Audit Office and Sport England. I have asked my officials to discuss the review with Sport England's Management Audit Department and report back to me as soon as it has been undertaken.

<a name="00110w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The Comprehensive Spending Review last year resulted in a number of structural changes within the public bodies sponsored by DCMS, which will result in increased efficiency. At the same time, the Department took on a new, strategic role in its sectors, and a much higher profile in the regions, with dedicated staff in all Government regional offices. This was against the background of a running cost allocation which was flat over the three years of the financial settlement. Among specific initiatives designed to increase efficiency and effectiveness, we are rationalising our estate so that a greater proportion of staff are in one building; co-locating divisions to increase the capacity for sharing support services; and undertaking a number of reviews of our services as part of the Modernising Government agenda. We have established the Quality, Efficiency and Standards Team (Quest) in order to identify and spread good practice in administration across the Department's NDPBs.

My Department currently does only a limited amount of direct recruitment, but makes use of welcoming statements to encourage applications from under-represented groups. As part of the Department's commitment to provide a workplace free from discrimination, all staff receive equal opportunities awareness training and are encouraged to treat others with courtesy and respect. On 1 April 1999, 8 per cent. of the department's workforce declared themselves as being from an ethnic minority background. We will now be working closely with the Cabinet Office to widen the pool of potential recruits and increase interchange opportunities in order to increase the representation of ethnic minorities in DCMS.

 Axgro Foods Limited applied for a Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) grant on 25 November 1999.

 <i>[holding answer 16 December 1999]:</i> Sure Start areas are very much smaller than local authority areas. The majority of Sure Start areas do not correspond to electoral wards, though some do, with others covering a number of wards. We are in the process of mapping the Sure Start areas in a Geographical Information System which will permit a precise answer to this question.

<a name="00110w11.html_para1">There is no veto over publication of the findings and Ministers are informed of intentions to publish. Contractors are not required to incorporate Departmental amendments. The wording of DfEE research contracts was revised in October 1998 to make this point clearer to contractors.

 Drug education is a statutory requirement at all key stages of National Curriculum science.

 The Disability Discrimination Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against disabled people by treating them less favourably than people who are not disabled, or by failing to make reasonable adjustments when services are impossible or unreasonably difficult to use. Financial institutions have the same responsibilities under the Act as other providers of services to the public. The Code of Practice which we published on 29 June 1999 explains these duties and gives practical guidance on how to prevent discrimination against disabled people. The British Bankers' Association (BBA) has also published its own guidance--"implementing Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act: BBA guidance on banks' responsibilities to their customers from October 1999"--with examples specific to the banking sector. It has also published a leaflet for customers entitled "The New Disability Legislation: What You Can Expect from Your Bank".

Published figures on the performance of our schools and of the country as a whole reflect that by showing the progress of all pupils through the National Curriculum attainment levels.
<P>

<a name="00110w12.html_para0">The National Curriculum tests are designed to be accessible to the vast majority of children. With the range of special arrangements for assessment available to schools only a very small number of children are unable to participate in the tests. There is also a real danger that excluding disapplied pupils from the calculations could by itself lead to an undesirable increase in the number of children excluded from the National Curriculum and its assessment. Our policy is supported by the National Advisory Group on Special Educational Needs.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the Employment Service is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply direct to your questions about the Access to Work programme. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For the current financial year, we have allocated &#163;450,000 to marketing and promoting the full range of our services for disabled people and their employers. This includes Access to Work, although we do not reserve a specific amount within that total for Access to Work. We carefully consider advertising options but do not allocate specific amounts to advertising on radio, television, newspapers or journals and trade magazines. We are spending &#163;350,000 of the budget on national promotions and the rest is being spent to promote disability programmes and services at regional and local level.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our publicity strategy is to raise awareness of the whole range of support available to disabled people and their employers from our disability services. Thus we generally market these services collectively to give a coherent picture of the support available. We produce, for example, leaflets, audio tapes, videos, posters, advertisements and articles for publication in a range of general and specific disability journals. All such generic advertising includes information on the Access to Work programme. For example, in March 1999, we worked closely with the British Deaf Association to produce a British Sign Language video--Make it Work--about our programmes and services. We used three case studies in the video, two of which specifically promoted Access to Work. We have distributed the video to every Jobcentre and to 1,000 external organisations including clubs, organisations and collages for deaf and hearing impaired people.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The leaflets we produce are freely available from Jobcentres, Disability Service Teams and at marketing events, and we produce them in alternative formats. There are specific leaflets for disabled people and employers promoting Access to Work. Disability Employment Advisers use these leaflets on visits to employers to ensure they are aware of Access to Work.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We also promote our services, including Access to Work, at many national, regional and local marketing events. For example, we have recently held promotions at the Institute of Personnel and Development Conference and Exhibition, the Confederation of British Industry Conference, and the Access Ability, National Information Day. Access to Work was the central theme of the two employment workshops at the Access Ability event.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition to our own promotions, the Government's current "See the Person" campaign is designed to raise awareness of the positive contribution disabled people are able to make. The campaign refers directly to the support Access to Work can provide to those in work.</FONT></UL>

 We are making available &#163;390 million over three years to double the number of three-year-olds able to access a free early education place to 66 per cent. This year we are making available &#163;40 million to create around 48,000 new free places. This has been allocated to 57 local education authorities with the greatest social need. From April 2000, we will be providing a further &#163;100 million to increase the number of new places to 83,000. These funds will be distributed across all local education authorities, including Northumberland.

 Delivering efficient and modern public services is a key part of the Government's agenda for improving productivity, and improved administrative efficiency is a key means of ensuring the most effective results are obtained from departmental running costs. The Department's Public Service Agreement, which is available in the Library of the House within "Public Services for the Future: Modernisation, Reform, Accountability" (CM 4181), sets out its running costs provision for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 and the productivity measures that will enable it to increase the quantity and quality of its outputs over that period. Revised targets are being drawn up for a new Public Service Agreement and supporting Service Delivery Agreement that will be published after the completion of the 2000 Spending Review.

 The Department's policies are generally individual focused and would therefore respond to need wherever it exists. We are raising standards of education to equip young people with the skills and knowledge they need to be able to take up jobs; assisting unemployed young people to acquire employability skills and find work through the New Deals for unemployed claimants; and helping those on inactivity benefits get back into the labour market and from there into employment through other welfare to work programmes such as the New Deal for Lone Parents.
<P>

<a name="00110w12.html_para2">As well as these, the Government are delivering macroeconomic stability so there can be increasing employment opportunities for all; and making work pay through various tax and benefit reforms.

 From April 2001, we intend to introduce a substantially strengthened New Deal for long-term unemployed people aged 25 and over, which will provide high quality, job-focused opportunities, including job search help, training and work experience. The detail of these arrangements will be decided in light of the lessons learned from the current New Deal 25 plus pilots. We are also reviewing the support available in England under work-based learning for adults to ensure that we meet the aim set out in the White Paper, "Learning to Succeed", that there should be greater coherence with other support for unemployed people, once responsibility has transferred to the Employment Service in April 2001. A similar review is being undertaken in Wales.

 Irinotecan is a promising new agent for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer which is being considered for possible referral to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). Two large randomised trials recently reported in the Lancet have indicated that irinotecan can give a small but significant benefit when used as a second line treatment. The Medical Research Council, which receives its funding from the Department of Trade and Industry, has recently given the go ahead for a major randomised trial in advanced colorectal cancer which aims to clarify the advantages and disadvantages of irinotecan and oxaliplatin, another new agent. The trial will consider not only response and survival but also quality of life and cost-effectiveness. The first patients should be randomised into the trial before the end of the year.

 We are determined to make sure that the National Health Service tackles the problem of hospital acquired infection. A review of infection control arrangements in all acute NHS Trusts has recently been undertaken by Regional Epidemiologists which will be used to improve services locally as appropriate. The emphasis the Government places on infection control in the NHS is reflected in the National Priorities Guidance 1999-2000 to 2001-02. This sets out the need to ensure that appropriate arrangements for the control of infection are in place. Health Service Circular 1999-049 (Resistance to Antibiotics and other Antimicrobial Agents, issued in March 1999) also addresses the need to strengthen prevention and control of communicable disease and infection control processes. On 22 November the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), launched new risk management and organisational control standards for the NHS including standards for hospital infection control.

 Guidance on the need to refer urgent referrals within 24 hours was issued to primary care leads, health authorities, National Health Service trusts and local medical centres through regional leads in December 1998. This has been augmented by additional guidance and the issue of revised breast cancer referral guidelines sent to all general practitioners in September 1999. This has been supported by action at local and regional levels to establish clear referral criteria and referral pathways so that those patients being referred urgently under the two week standard can be identified quickly and referred appropriately. We will continue to monitor the proportion of urgent referrals received within and outside 24 hours and to work with the professions to enable the maximum number of women to benefit from this high standard of care.

 <i>[holding answer 16 December 1999]:</i> The Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) asked the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) to calculate radiation doses to the tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes of young people resident in the village of Seascale in Cumbria, who were aged 0 to 25 years. The doses calculated were for the period of time at which discharges of radioactive material from the Sellafield site were either at their highest (1975) or when the inhalation dose was at its highest (1955). However, even in the most pessimistic case in 1955, the total equivalent dose to the thoracic lymph nodes from natural background radiation is greater than that estimated from plutonium.

 <i>[holding answer 20 December 1999]:</i> The Crown has no general immunity from proceedings in respect of infringement of a patent. However the Patents Act 1977, sections 55 to 59, allow the use of patented inventions for the services of the Crown without the consent of the patent owner. If these provisions are relied on, compensation for loss of profit has to be paid.

<a name="00110w18.html_para3">The proportion of people living in working age workless households doubled between 1979 and 1997--this is the legacy we inherited and the challenge we face. It is a problem we are committed to overcome through our programme of welfare reform.

 There are no plans to unify the Department's computer systems with those of the Inland Revenue.

 There was only one minor incident across the whole range of the Department's 33 main computer systems, after the Millennium Date Change.

Two of the Department's 783 administrative support systems had problems, which have also been fixed. This outcome follows the Department's substantial work to prepare for this event.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what steps have been taken by the Government to promote personal provision of pensions.  [102960]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We published a Green Paper in December 1998, setting out our proposals for pension reform. Our proposals will help everyone build up a decent second pension. The reformed system will ensure that all those who can save for a second pension will be able to do so.
<P>

<a name="00110w19.html_para0">For people who have access to them, occupational pensions remain the best option; we have already implemented some of the measures we proposed to strengthen and support occupational pension schemes in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999. Further measures are in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill currently before Parliament.
<P>

<a name="00110w19.html_para1">The new stakeholder pensions will be a secure, flexible, and value for money way to help up to 5 million people who do not have access to an occupational pension and for whom personal pensions can be unsuitable to save for their retirement. Stakeholder Pensions will be designed to help those on middle incomes--around &#163;9,000-&#163;20,000 a year--but will benefit those on higher incomes as well. The legislation to put in place the basic framework for stakeholder pension schemes is included in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999. We are continuing to consult on key areas of detail which will be set out in secondary legislation and we expect to publish draft Regulations shortly.




<P>
<P><I>10 Jan 2000 : Column: 68W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00110w19.html_para2">We are reforming the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme through the introduction of the State Second Pension. This will give a dramatic boost to the pensions of low earners, carers and some long-term disabled people. Legislation is included in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill.
<P>

<a name="00110w19.html_para3">We are also improving the quality of general and personal information on pensions. We are working in partnership with employers and the pensions industry to provide annual combined pension forecasts of current and projected state and private pension rights. A combined statement will give individuals a clearer indication of what sort of retirement income they might expect and enable them to make informed decisions about the level of savings they need to make.
<P>

<a name="00110w19.html_para4">In June 1998, we also published a series of pensions information leaflets. These provide concise and accessible information in plain English about the pensions choices available to individuals. The leaflets relate to decisions individuals need to take at various life stages. The leaflets met the Plain English Campaign Crystal Mark standard and have been awarded the Money Management Council Quality Mark for providing clear and unbiased information on money matters. The leaflets have been promoted through marketing activity. The Financial Services Authority also provide more detailed information on certain financial issues, which complements the Departmental leaflets.

 114,400 awards of the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance stopped in 1997-98, and 129,900 in 1998-99. These figures are equivalent to around 7 per cent. of recipients. Awards stop in various circumstances, for example when recipients die, go to live abroad permanently, or experience a significant improvement in their ability to get around.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w19.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The qualifying criteria for the various benefits for sick and disabled people vary and may need to be assessed separately on different occasions. The development of an integrated medical assessment would be complex and there are no immediate plans to introduce such an assessment.
<P>

<a name="00110w19.html_para5">The issue of the quality of medical assessments in general is, however, taken very seriously. Standards relating to experience, qualifications and training are set out in the Benefits Agency's contract with the SEMA Group, which provides medical services. The work of all doctors is also subject to regular audit against nationally determined standards which are agreed by the Department's Chief Medical Adviser.

<P>

<a name="00110w20.html_para0">This Department has put a range of measures in place to encourage the employment of people with disabilities, using the Cabinet Office "Programme for Action to Achieve Equality of Opportunity in the Civil Service for Disabled People".

 While we have not received any representations on this issue, we have recently announced changes to the non-dependant deductions scheme. These changes were included in the annual benefit uprating package which was announced to the House on 9 November. From April 2000, non-dependant deductions for Council Tax Benefit will increase by 7 per cent., which is in line with average council tax increases. The income thresholds at which the level of deductions are set will, as is customary, rise by the ROSSI index (1.6 per cent.).

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will list each of the categories of family that will be worse off as a result of the child support measures contained in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill; if he will list in each case the number of <i>(a)</i> families and <i>(b)</i> children so affected; and if he will estimate the average loss for each group.  [104141]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w22.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The impact of the child support reforms will depend on a number of different factors, including the level of child support liability, whether this liability is being paid and whether the parent with care is on benefit. Over one million children will benefit from the reforms. However, in order to forecast which individual families are likely to be better or worse off as a result of the changes, we would need to establish the extent to which the non-resident parent is compliant now and estimate future compliance. We have not made such estimates; these could be provided only at disproportionate cost and we are not confident that the results would be reliable.
<P>

<a name="00110w22.html_para0">It is inevitable that there will be differences in liability between the current and the new schemes. Under the new scheme we will get more parents paying more of what is due for their children. Payments of maintenance are already fully ignored in Working Families Tax Credit. Parents with care on Income Support will see the benefit of maintenance for the first time. They will gain up to &#163;10 a week through the introduction of the new child maintenance premium. The payment of regular, reliable maintenance will also form a foundation on which parents with care can consider options for work.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what estimate he has made of the likely completion date of the computer system being prepared for the Child Support Agency; and if it is his policy not to implement the new maintenance formula contained in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill until that computer system is in place.  [104139]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w22.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We have always made clear that we intend to introduce the new child support system as soon as possible, but that will not be before the end of 2001 at the earliest. We are determined not to repeat the failures of the current system by introducing reforms too quickly or before new IT systems are ready.

 The information is contained in the following tables. It is based on the assumptions that the State Second Pension will be introduced in April 2002 and that it will move to a flat-rate scheme in 2006-07 (five years after Stakeholder Pension Schemes are introduced). Costings based on introduction of the State Second Pension in April 2003 and a move to a flat-rate scheme in 2008-09 are not available at this time.

<a name="00110w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 Stakeholder pensions are intended to fill the gap for the many people who can afford to save for their retirement but do not currently have a suitable means of doing so. Following passage of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999, which sets the framework for stakeholder schemes, and extensive consultation on the detailed arrangements, we have now made decisions in a number of key areas. I am placing in the Library the Government's response to the consultation. The paper, "Stakeholder Pensions--Outcome of the Consultation" is also available in the Vote Office. The main points are:

<a name="00110w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 Out of a total of 2,351 Commons written questions tabled to Defence Ministers during Session 1998-99, our database records that 198 were answered by means of a letter placed in the Library rather than by a substantive reply in the <i>Official Report</i>. The database did not capture such information prior to the 1998-99 Session, and consequently it could only be provided at disproportionate cost for previous sessions.

 HMS Brave entered extended readiness in April 1999. Since then, &#163;0.38 million has been spent in keeping her in this state.

(4) under what circumstances civilians are eligible for forces legal aid.  [102588]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w23.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 December 1999]:</i> Legal aid is available, from Service sources, for those who are to be tried by court-martial, who wish to appeal to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, who are to be tried by a standing civilian court (the equivalent of a magistrates court which sits outside the UK), or who are to be tried by a criminal court outside the UK for an off-duty offence.
<P>

<a name="00110w23.html_para8">The criteria that must be met by anyone applying for Service legal aid are that they must be subject to Service law (that is, are bound by one of the three single Service Discipline Acts), and assistance must be in the interests of justice. Individuals will be required to show that they have insufficient means to obtain assistance without help from public funds (and, in the case of an incident abroad, that the host country has no equivalent scheme for non-nationals). Depending on their personal means and commitments, individuals will be required to provide a personal contribution. The MOD scheme broadly mirrors the criteria applied by the civilian legal aid authorities in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="00110w23.html_para9">Those covered under the Service scheme are Service personnel in the UK and overseas, and attached civilians (including defence Agency personnel) and dependants abroad. However, there has been a long-standing policy that UK personnel employed abroad by a number of specified organisations, including the NAAFI, can make use of the Service legal aid scheme, subject to the funds being subsequently repaid. (It is a matter for the organisations concerned whether they or the individuals involved undertake the required reimbursement.) Civilian 



<P>
<P><I>10 Jan 2000 : Column: 84W</I><P>
contractors, whether engaged either in work in the UK or abroad, are not eligible for Service legal aid as they are not subject to Service law.
<P>

<a name="00110w23.html_para10">The sums available this year for Service legal aid are &#163;100,000 for the Royal Navy, &#163;770,000 for the Army and &#163;146,000 for the Royal Air Force.
<P>

<a name="00110w23.html_para11">The increase in Service legal aid as a result of the legislation proposed in the Armed Forces Discipline Bill will depend on the number and nature of cases handled.

<a name="00110w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 My Department continually monitors and assesses threats to UK interests, whether they are conventional in nature or "asymmetric". The analysis influences our defence policy and planning to ensure that British defence capability is well placed to respond to the threats and opportunities we face now and may face in the future. The subject of asymmetric warfare is so broad as to appear frequently in representations and debates on defence and security policy.

 I have today placed in the Library of the House a list showing all the non-Governmental organisations that have provided written responses to the DERA PPP consultation document. Some responses, for example from trade associations, represented a consolidated view from a number of organisations consulted as part of their own consultation process. Similarly, a number of organisations and individuals responded orally through participation in consultation events. For reasons of confidentiality, the list does not include the names of individuals who responded on a personal basis, either to the Ministry of Defence or through their Member of Parliament.

 Delivering efficient and modern public services is a key part of the Government's agenda for improving productivity. Greater efficiency is being sought within the public sector to ensure that the most effective results are obtained from available resources. The Ministry of Defence's (MOD) Public Service Agreement (PSA) sets out the objectives, key targets and resources for the MOD and the Armed Forces, and includes a range of measures to ensure that the budget allocated to defence purchases the maximum capability for the Armed Forces and fulfils the plans set out in the Strategic Defence Review.

Financial Year 1996-97 represented the final round of the Department's "Options for Change" review and most of the early leavers left as a consequence of the review. The total cost to the Ministry of Defence in Financial Year 1996-97 was &#163;61.181 million. This represents the cost of the initial and annual compensation, and any lump sum payments for retirements that took place in that year. The annual compensation payment for staff over 50 years of age at the point of leaving continues to be met by the MOD until individuals reach the minimum retirement age of 60 years.<P>

It has not been possible to reach an agreement to renew the right of way to the rifle range with one of the landowners. My Department is therefore considering options to resolve this difficulty. In the meantime, the rifle range is being accessed through a secondary entrance as a temporary measure.

 A World War 2 vintage No. 36 Mills bomb, common issue during that period, was discovered in the area of the Forth and Clyde Canal near Falkirk High School by pupils from the school on Wednesday 15 December 1999 following excavation work at the site. An Explosive Ordnance Disposal team from the Army was immediately called to the scene and successfully destroyed the device. There has been no recorded training with weapons previously in the vicinity of the school and it has not been possible to identify the reason for the grenade being there.

<a name="00110w25.html_para1">With respect to other arms and ammunition in the area, I can confirm that, wherever arms and ammunition are stored on an Army establishment, this is done in accordance with the appropriate regulations.

 The United Kingdom's minimum nuclear deterrent is consistent with international law.

Whether the use, or threatened use, of nuclear weapons in a particular case is lawful depends on all the circumstances. Nuclear weapons fall to be dealt with by reference to the same general principles as apply to conventional weapons.

<P>
<a name="00110w26.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Trident missiles on which our nuclear deterrent is based have been de-targeted since 1994. Our judgment of the minimum level of deterrence required is supported by comprehensive computer modelling which enables us to assess the effects of nuclear detonations. A number of factors are taken into account in this assessment. As Lord Robertson made clear to my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) on 4 February 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column 655W, these include the yield and design of the weapon used; the accuracy of the delivery system employed; the nature and construction of the target; the characteristics of the surrounding terrain; the height of the detonation; and geological and weather conditions. I am withholding information on UK nuclear warhead yield under Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, relating to defence, security and international relations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The existing scientific literature on the possible hazards of depleted uranium (DU) is extensive. In 1993, the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency's Radiation Protection Service, then the Defence Radiological Protection Service, published a summary report of its assessment of the radiological and chemical hazards of DU. The report explained that there are two types of hazard posted by the use of DU: a radiation hazard, although DU is a low specific activity material (as defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency); and a chemical toxicity hazard, which is similar to that posed by other heavy metals, such as lead.
<P>

<a name="00110w27.html_para2">A Ministry of Defence paper entitled "Testing for the presence of depleted uranium in UK veterans of the Gulf conflict: The Current Position" was published on 19 March 1999.

<P>

<a name="00110w27.html_para3">In December 1993, the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency commissioned the independent environmental consultants W. S. Atkins to conduct an environmental impact assessment of DU firings on Ministry of Defence ranges in the UK.

These conclusions were, and continue to be, sustained by comprehensive monitoring programmes at both sites.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w28.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 December 1999]:</i> Not all fish stocks have declined in the past few years. For example, the large western mackerel stock has increased since 1994, and the Norwegian spring-spawning herring has doubled in size over the same period and has also extended its distribution.
<P>

<a name="00110w28.html_para1">Most of the whitefish stocks however remain at or near historically low levels. This is associated with high levels of fishing mortality. In the North Sea, the recent assessments indicate some reduction of fishing mortality on roundfish, which will help to restore those stocks.
<P>

<a name="00110w28.html_para2">All fish stocks are subject to great variations in the numbers of young produced each year. This variation is caused by changes in the size of the mature adult stock and annual changes in the environment being more or less favourable to the survival of larval fish. So even though stocks may be at generally low levels good or bad recruitment of young fish will cause the stocks to increase or decrease over periods of a few years.
<P>

<a name="00110w28.html_para3">Against this background of variation, some sea areas have experienced a general warming. While this may be favourable for some stocks, such as sole, it has apparently adversely affected the production of young cod, especially in the North Sea and in the Irish Sea.

<a name="00110w28.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government's view is that the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Bill is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). There are overriding moral arguments in favour of a ban and a general public interest in removing this particular source of livelihood. This has to be balanced against the interests of those whose source of livelihood is being removed and the Bill respects the ECHR by provision of a two to three year winding-down period, compensation for certain categories of loss, and the reference of disputes on compensation to arbitration or the Lands Tribunal. In the Government's view, the balance struck between the demands of the general interest in this matter and the interests of the individuals directly affected is a fair one.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer when the draft Census Order for England and Wales will be laid before Parliament, if questions on religion, ethnic group and income are to be included in the proposed content of the Census; and if he will make a statement. [104428]<P>

<a name="00110w29.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Draft Order in Council providing for a Census to be taken in England and Wales on Sunday 29 April 2001 has today been laid before Parliament. This Order specifies the persons by whom and with respect to whom returns are to be made and the topics on which questions are to be asked.
<P>

<a name="00110w29.html_para0">The Government's proposals for the 2001 census were published in a White Paper (Cm 4253) in March this year. All the topics that were then proposed for England and Wales are included in the draft Order with the exception of religion. A change to the Census Act 1920 is necessary to permit a question on religion to be asked. A Bill to amend the Census Act to this effect was introduced in the House of Lords on 16 December 1999. If this is passed in time it is planned to include a question in the 2001 Census.
<P>

<a name="00110w29.html_para1">A question on ethnic group is proposed in the Draft Census Order. The ethnic group question was one of the main successes of the 1991 Census, and the question for the forthcoming census has since been extensively researched and tested, both to meet users' requirements for additional information about people of mixed origin and sub-groups within the "White" population, particularly the "Irish", and to be as acceptable as possible to respondents. The new response categories are to provide optimum comparability with information from the 1991 Census question while, at the same time, attempting to improve response to the question among the many different ethnic minority communities.
<P>

<a name="00110w29.html_para2">Consultation with users about requirements for information from the census has indicated that there is widespread support for the inclusion of an income question from key Government Departments, local government and others. But the strength of such requirements must be balanced against the possible public disquiet about the acceptability of such a question in a compulsory Census, the doubts about the reliability of the information collected, and the availability of possible alternative sources of the information. The Draft Order for England and Wales therefore does not include an income question.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00110w29.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Andy King: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) how many claims arising from the mis-selling of pensions are outstanding; and what assessment he has made of the timescale for their resolution;  [104314]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many claims arising from the mis-selling of pensions have been resolved to date;  [104315]
<P>
(3) how many people have been affected by the mis-selling of pensions in the last 10 years.  [104313]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="00110w29.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The regulators split the industry's work on the personal pension mis-selling review into two phases. During phase 1 firms were required to address the most urgent cases, where for example pensioners had died, or retired, or were close to retirement. Phase 2--which began in 1999--addresses less urgent cases, mostly younger people.
<P>

<a name="00110w29.html_para11">The mis-selling of personal pensions took place during the period April 1998-June 1994 and the statistics given in this answer cover the mis-selling over that period. It is not practical to provide figures for the period from January 1990. The people affected by personal pension mis-selling are those who were mis-sold a pension and who were subsequently entitled to redress.
<P>

<a name="00110w29.html_para12">The phase 1 review has led to offers of redress to 410,000 people. About 17,000 phase 1 cases are outstanding. This represents about 2 per cent. of all the cases included in the phase 1 review. These are typically difficult cases or cases which have only recently been identified as proper to phase 1. The Financial Services Authority closely monitors the firms responsible for these outstanding phase 1 cases.
<P>

<a name="00110w29.html_para13">The total population to be examined under phase 2 is in excess of 800,000. About 114,000 cases have already been dealt with, and offers of redress have been made in about 90,000 cases. About 700,000 further cases are likely to be dealt with during the rest of the phase 2 review. Not all of these investors will be entitled to redress. The timetable is for all phase 2 case reviews to be completed by June 2002.
<P>

<a name="00110w29.html_para14">It is too soon to say how many investors overall are likely to be offered redress under the two phases of the review.
