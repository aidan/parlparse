<a name="11107w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD&#151;formerly known as the New African Initiative) will require a broad international response, ranging from support to some of NEPAD's programmatic elements to action in the EU, OECD, UN and other international forums. No specific financial commitments have yet been made.

<a name="11107w01.html_para1">The Prime Minister has appointed Baroness Amos as his Personal Representative in developing a G8 Action Plan for Africa to be adopted at the 2002 G8 Summit in Canada. The first meeting of G8 Heads of State Personal Representatives was held in London on 17&#150;19 October. They agreed to consult widely with other development partners, with the private sector, civil society and international organisations. They have further meetings planned which will include dialogue with African partners. The elements in the Action Plan will be evolved in the context of these meetings.

 We are currently providing funding to support teachers' performance pay through special grants paid to local authorities. A requirement of special grants is that they are fully and properly audited. Auditors appointed by the local authority make certain that the funds are spent for the purposes for which they are paid. Local authorities are required to provide me with copies of these audits. The new special grant, providing &#163;250 million to support performance pay across the period April 2002 to 2004, will be subject to these same audit requirements.

 Yes, we shall. Earlier this year we consulted on reducing the requirements within both governor's annual reports and school prospectuses, and on the possibility of schools combining these two documents. Following that consultation, we are proceeding with streamlining the requirements and making it easier for schools that choose to do so to combine the two documents. We aim to amend the relevant regulations and send revised guidance to schools early in the new year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11107w03.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what the pension paid is to <i>(a)</i> a retired Gurkha and <i>(b)</i> a similar ranking British ex-service man, in money terms and as a percentage;  [13013]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make a statement on how pensions are paid to retired Gurkhas.  [13012]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11107w03.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Because of their different engagements and career structures, comparing Gurkha and British solider pensions in this way is particularly difficult. 87 per cent. of Gurkhas are discharged in Nepal after 15 years' service and receive an immediate pension. British soldiers discharged at this time would receive no pension until they reached the age of 60.
<P>

<a name="11107w03.html_para0">The only British and Gurkha rank likely to be discharged at the same point of service is a Warrant Officer Class 1 after 22 years. In this instance, a Gurkha receives an immediate annual pension of &#163;1,672, or 16 per cent. of the &#163;10,283 paid to comparable British ex-servicemen. The difference reflects the Tripartite Agreement between the Governments of the United Kingdom, Nepal and India, and the cost of living in Nepal, where all Gurkhas are discharged. In the Nepalese economy, Gurkha pensions now compare favourably with professional salaries.
<P>

<a name="11107w03.html_para1">The way in which Gurkha ex-service men receive their pensions depends upon the region in which they live. Those based to the main population centres in Nepal are able to receive their pension either directly into bank accounts or from one of the three Pension Paying Offices 



<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2001 : Column: 249W</I><P>
in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Itahari. These are manned on a full-time basis and the majority of ex-Gurkhas opt to receive their pension this way.
<P>

<a name="11107w03.html_para2">Nepal has poor communications, however, and we recognise that the arrangements above do not cater for residents of the more rural and remote areas. For this reason, Gurkha pensions are also paid quarterly, in cash, via Area Welfare Centres. There are 24 of these located throughout Nepal, but concentrated near the main ex-Gurkha populations centres where there are often no banking facilities. Nepal's topography, inclement weather and poor infrastructure, means that it is inevitable that some pensioners will still have to undertake long journeys in order to collect their pension. These difficulties are minimised as far as possible and, where necessary, special arrangements are put in place to enable pensions to be collected on behalf of the sick or infirm.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11107w03.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2001]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 6 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 130W. If Italy stands by the decision it took last month not to continue with the A400M programme at present, the total number of aircraft in the initial order will fall from 212 to 196.
<P>

<a name="11107w03.html_para3">The final price of the A400M aircraft has yet to be agreed with the contractor. While it is reasonable to assume that such a reduction in overall aircraft numbers will increase our contribution to programme costs, reductions achieved in other aspects of the price negotiation may counterbalance that increase. Accordingly, we do not expect to identify a discrete cost increase associated with Italian withdrawal, should that be confirmed in due course.

This publicity has included articles in their journals and circulars. All those identified as being incorrectly taxed, except a small number currently under investigation, have received a full refund with compensation. The Ministry of Defence has no plans to undertake further action on this matter.

 There are many circumstances in which an Inland Revenue officer may need to make inquiries about a taxpayer, some of whose affairs are dealt with by another office. For example, an officer dealing with a company's tax affairs may need information about individual directors. Or a formal inquiry into a tax return may be carried out at a different office from that which issued the return, depending on the availability of staff.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11107w06.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 In a formal inquiry into a tax return, an officer is statutorily entitled to ask for information which he requires in order to determine whether the return is incorrect and, if so, to what extent. Information about relatives may be relevant to that inquiry. For example, in a case where the business records are incomplete, the best way to measure the true level of income may be to estimate the taxpayer's expenditure. In that case, information about the cost of maintaining dependent relatives and their contribution to household expenses may be relevant, and may be legitimately required by the investigator.
<P>

<P>

 The sale of commemorative and collector coins in memory of Diana, Princess of Wales raised &#163;7,393,000 by 25 July 2001. This will be used to offset voted expenditure on projects put forward by the Diana Memorial committee. It was never intended to pay the proceeds into the Princess Diana Memorial Fund.
<P>

<a name="11107w06.html_para2">The main projects are: a playground in Kensington Gardens, opened in July 2000; a walkway running through London's Royal Parks&#151;Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Green Park and St. James' Park; a fountain in Hyde Park by the Serpentine, due to be built by summer 2003; and the establishment of eight Diana Nursing Teams, each led by paediatric nurses trained in palliative care, to work in the community providing support to children with life limiting conditions, and their carers, as an alternative to hospital based care.

<P>
<a name="11107w06.html_spnew5"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 A Royal Mint team was established in order to review the system for issuing and returning UK circulation commemorative crown coins. This was a result of growing concerns regarding the total volume of returns, a number of 25p (5 shilling) crowns mixed in with consignments of &#163;5 crowns, abuse of the current distribution system and to monitor any counterfeits.
<P>

<a name="11107w06.html_para4">In order for the Royal Mint to log and analyse the returns we agreed with the UK banks and the Post Office that for ease of handling, processing and payment, all commemorative crowns should be returned via the Post Office. So, the UK banks were advised to refer customers wishing to repatriate crowns to their nearest post office whereby they can exchange them for goods and services.
<P>

<a name="11107w06.html_para5">Despite this agreement we continue to receive a small number of these crowns from some banks however, we are trying to encourage them to channel all returns via the Post Office.

With some progress on the peace process and a gradual improvement in access for humanitarian agencies, we have this year substantially increased the level of support for humanitarian work.

<P>
<a name="11107w08.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government's policy, as set out in the White Paper "A New Future for Communications" is to complete the switchover to digital terrestrial television as soon as possible, and we believe that it is realistic to aim for the period 2006&#150;10. On 12 October, we issued a draft action plan, which is a technical, consultative document aimed at the key stakeholders who will need to work together to make progress towards switchover. The draft plan sets out the issues on which action needs to be taken, both by the Government and by the industry; to enable and encourage take up of digital television, to identify who should lead on those issues, and to set target dates for delivery. We intend to publish an agreed plan by the end of the year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11107w08.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> I do not expect the availability of analogue Channel 5 services to be increased because the priority is to use available spectrum for the development of digital terrestrial television (DTT). I understand, however, that these services are available in some areas of the High Peak constituency: coverage details can be found on Channel 5's website at: www.channel5.co.uk. <i>(b)</i> The BBC and ITC, who are responsible for the DTT transmission network, are considering, in consultation with Government and stakeholders, how to improve coverage of all DTT multiplexes across the UK and coverage information is available on the Digital Television Group website: www.dtg.org.uk. No date has been set for the provision of DTT throughout High Peak. <i>(c)</i> This is a commercial matter for the cable operators: I am not aware that any operator has plans to supply cable across the High Peak area.

<sup>(2)</sup> Our approach will be to ensure Government and industry understands and appraises the impact of current challenges, co-ordinate public sector and private sector responses to those challenges, and for the public sector to make a direct contribution where that is justified.<P>

<P>

<sup>(3)</sup> We will take this action in a new spirit of partnership between industry and Government. The industry will take the lead in modernising, improving quality and product development. Government will support where better regulation and co-ordination of public services is needed. Ministers will review in three months whether the current distribution of responsibilities supporting the joint programme is working well enough and will meet with industry again in six months to review the progress of the whole programme. All the initial action is to be taken within six months and further assignments then agreed at a further joint meeting with industry leaders. <P>

 I refer my hon Friend to the statement I made to the House on Wednesday 24 October in which I stated my belief that following the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning's confirmation of the IRA's unprecedented act of decommissioning, the Belfast agreement should now be implemented in its entirety and all the political institutions allowed to operate without impediment.

<P>
<a name="11107w10.html_spnew4"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The term "violent crime" covers offences against the person, sexual offences and robbery. During the year 2000&#150;01 a total of 24,323 violent crimes were recorded in Northern Ireland, an increase of 0.7 per cent. on 1999&#150;2000. Overall, violent crime accounted for 20.3 per cent. of all recorded offences during 2000&#150;01, an increase of 7.9 per cent. on the previous year. A rise in the number of robberies was the main reason for this increase, although on a positive front, there was an 11.8 per cent. decrease in recorded sexual offences. Actual figures for the current year are not yet available.
<P>

<a name="11107w10.html_para0">The Northern Ireland policing plan 2001&#150;02 contains nine objectives for policing. In particular, the specific target relating to the detection rate for violent crime has been increased to 65 per cent. from the 50 per cent. target set for 2000&#150;01. The Government are confident that the Chief Constable is doing everything possible within the resources available to him to reduce and deal with incidents of violent crime in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2001 : Column: 281W</I><P>
detailing the current position on prescription charges and national health service dental treatment for asylum seekers in February 2000. This explained that any asylum seeker who did not fall into one of the groups entitled to free dental treatment, for example those who are pregnant or aged under 18 (under 19 years if in full time education) would need to complete an HC1 claim form in order to receive a NHS charges certificate (HC2), but that arrangements were under review. From 1 April 2001 the national asylum support service would issue HC2 certificates on behalf of the Department to all the asylum seekers it supports. These arrangements are now in place, and HC2 certificates are issued where appropriate, along with the first support voucher. This has removed the need for separate HC1 claims.
<P>

<a name="11107w11.html_para0">Under current arrangements, health authorities are responsible for the dissemination of this information to dental practitioners.

 Yes. In adopting in 1999 the World Health Organisation charter on transport, environment and health the Government confirmed their commitment to making transport sustainable to health and the environment, and to striving to implement the measures in the charter's plan of action, especially those aimed at attaining its health targets.

 We allocate funding to health authorities on the basis of the relative needs of their populations.

 Circular health service guidance (94)27 has been an effective mechanism since 1994 for ensuring that thorough investigations are conducted into serious adverse incidents occurring in specialist mental health services. However, in the light of the Chief Medical Officer's report 'An Organisation with a Memory' and the implementation document 'Building a Safer NHS for Patients' published in April 2001, we are establishing a system for reporting, analysing and learning lessons from adverse incidents throughout the national health service. It is important that mental health services should be included in these arrangements.
<P>

<a name="11107w12.html_para0">The new system is currently being piloted and will be rolled out across the NHS from January 2002.

In future, all serious service failures or dysfunction will be subject to a full local review to establish what went wrong, to learn lessons and to take appropriate action.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11107w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The draft directive for mobile workers in the road transport sector is still subject to negotiation, so it would be very difficult to assess the likely impact of these proposals on levels of pay until the directive has been agreed. In any event, levels of pay for haulage drivers will remain a matter for negotiation between the employer and the employee.

<P>
<a name="11107w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In March 1998, the Department of Trade and Industry published a regulatory assessment covering the costs and benefits of working time legislation. The assessment covered all sectors of employment in the UK, including excluded sectors such as the road haulage industry. A copy of the assessment was deposited in the Libraries of the House.

 From our regular meetings with industry, we are fully aware of the problem that an eight-hour limit for night workers is likely to have on daytime congestion. That is one of the reasons why the Government support the 10-hour figure included in the council's common position.

 National Air Traffic Services (NATS) remains committed to investing in the New Scottish Centre (NSC) at Prestwick as part of its two-centre strategy. Following the downturn in demand for air travel arising from the events of 11 September, the Government have agreed to a proposal to delay construction of the NSC, though preparatory work on the building and system design will continue.

 London Transport is carrying out a thorough evaluation of the value for money of the bids for the London Underground PPPs, in line with the relevant guidance produced by HM Treasury and Treasury Taskforce, copies of which are already in the House Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11107w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government's plans for a publicly run, privately built tube will deliver around &#163;13 billion of investment to improve the underground's infrastructure over the next 15 years. The Secretary of State has made it clear that he will only be prepared for these plans to go ahead if he is content that they represent value for money.
<P>

<a name="11107w13.html_para2">London Underground is carrying out a thorough evaluation of all bids, assisted by its financial advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers and its engineering advisers Ove Arup. I understand that London Underground is also asking KPMG, its external auditor, to review the public sector comparators that London Underground has developed to guide its value for money evaluation.
<P>

<a name="11107w13.html_para3">In addition, Ernst & Young will be providing the Secretary of State with an independent opinion on London Underground's evaluation of the final PPP bids, focusing on the overall robustness of the value for money conclusions reached by London Underground and its advisers.

<a name="11107w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to him on 5 November 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 9W. The value for money evaluation of the London Underground PPPs will be placed in the House Library, but not until London Transport has concluded its negotiations with bidders. To publish the value for money evaluation any earlier would reveal London Transport's negotiating position and so undermine its ability to achieve best value.

 Fares for the London Underground are a matter for the Mayor. The value for money evaluation that London Underground is carrying out on PPP bids assumes that fares will do no more than keep pace with inflation whether tube improvements are financed under the PPPs or by direct Government borrowing.

 The Government will increase SSA provision for authorities collectively up to the aggregate 4.2 per cent. increase for 2002&#150;03 provided for in spending review 2000. To do more would mean unfairly limiting the increase in other parts of the environment, cultural and protective services SSA block. Of course, a local authority is able to increase spending on flood defence by more than this if it judges flood defence a high priority within its budget.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 31 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 682W, on European railways, which TSIs are now being drafted; what work his Department has done to contribute to the scoping of the TSI drafting; if the directive will require the upgrading of main line routes in the UK to meet continental gauges; and what representations his Department has received from the rail industry about this directive.  [12972]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11107w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Preparatory work has started on the first priority group of TSIs specified in article 23(1)(a) of the directive. This work is being led by the AEIF (the European Association for Railway Interoperability), which comprises representatives from the railway operating and manufacturing industries. The UK railway industry is well represented at all levels within AEIF. Member states' involvement in the TSIs at government level is through participation in the "Article 21 Committee" set up under the directive. This committee is responsible for approving the TSIs before they are adopted and can influence the contents of the TSIs throughout the drafting process.
<P>

<a name="11107w15.html_para2">We do not expect the TSIs to require the upgrading of UK main line routes to continental gauges. The directive provides for "specific cases" to be included in the TSIs to allow some existing national parameters, such as the loading gauge, to be retained in certain circumstances. We expect to seek appropriate specific cases in these respects. More generally, the directive provides for derogations from application of the TSIs in certain circumstances, including where their application would compromise the economic viability of the project and/or its compatibility with the existing rail system.
<P>

<a name="11107w15.html_para3">The rail industry has been consulted on the directive from its inception and has made wide-ranging representations on its scope and potential impact.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how many

<P>
<P>
<a name="11107w15.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The latest information on new house construction and its relationship to flood-risk areas was published in "Land use Change in England: No. 16", in July 2001. This showed that in 1998 about 135,000 new dwellings were constructed, of which about 14,500 (11 per cent. of the total) were within the indicative flood plain as shown on maps published by the Environment Agency in December 2000. Many of the new houses in flood-risk areas were constructed behind adequate flood defences. For example 37 per cent. of new houses in London were in flood-risk areas that are largely defended to a very high standard as a result of the Thames Barrier.
<P>

<a name="11107w15.html_para6">For the 10 years from 1989&#150;98, 9 per cent. of the land changing to residential use and 10 per cent. of the almost 1.4 million new dwellings built were within the indicative flood plains. This compares to the 12 per cent. of all land in England that is within the indicative flood plains.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11107w15.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 No such estimate can be made because of the wide range of factors affecting the future volume and location of house-building. However, we are continuing to monitor land-use change in relation to areas of flood-risk. Through the high-level targets published by the then Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1999, we are also monitoring the responses of the Environment Agency to consultations on planning applications and whether decisions were in line with or contrary to their views. My Department is currently examining with the Environment Agency how the implementation and effectiveness of the flood-risk related policies in the new planning policy guidance note 25 issued in July 2001 on "Development and flood risk" can best be secured.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement on demand for container port capacity in the United Kingdom.  [13518]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11107w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Our ports policy paper, "Modern Ports: A UK Policy", published last November, recognised a need to be better informed about developments in the UK port industry. The Department recently issued a discussion paper, "Recent developments and prospects at UK container ports", which notes that most industry forecasts point to an overall shortage of container movement capacity in the UK over the next 10 years. Market pressures are driving up the size and draught of container ships, which means that container facilities need to offer deep water with good tidal windows and ample manoeuvring room; there is only a limited number of sites capable of meeting these criteria. Market considerations, such as proximity to principal shipping lanes and markets, 



<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2001 : Column: 297W</I><P>
and other criteria such as transport access, including the availability of deep water concentrate demand in the south-east and east of England.
<P>

<a name="11107w16.html_para1">As indicated in "Modern Ports", the Government believe there are important national economic benefits in meeting the growth in demand. We recognise that this would require significant container port capacity increases in the south-east and east of England over the next few years. There are relatively few specific sites where such capacity can realistically be provided which meet the criteria previously noted. At the same time, we are well aware that some expansion proposals may have significant local environmental impacts and that these represent a challenge to which those proposing port development need to rise. Planning decisions will have to take due account of these considerations.
<P>

<a name="11107w16.html_para2">The discussion paper discusses recent trends and prospects for demand at container ports and how it might be met. Its purpose is not to discuss in detail all the issues which planning procedures have to address, but to promote a better understanding of the ports and shipping business, and of the demands which are now causing pressure on capacity. Copies of the paper are in the Library, and it is also available from my Department (EAMI Division, Zone 1/34, Great Minster House, 76 Marsham Street, London SWIP 4DR) and on the Department's website. A further consultation paper is planned discussing project appraisal criteria to be applied to port developments.

 Under the light lamb scheme introduced from September 2001, the Government are prepared to pay &#163;10 for the buying up of light lambs for which there is currently no export market because of the foot and mouth export ban. This could cost up to &#163;25 million in purchase costs but estimates of uptake are uncertain. The scheme will not operate in 2002 and we expect farmers to look into selling lambs into the food chain as their first priority.

<a name="11107w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Support for the sugar beet industry is governed by the European Union's common agricultural policy (CAP) regime for sugar. A new regime was agreed at the May Agriculture Council and runs for five years from 1 July 2001. This maintains support prices for sugar and sugar beet at previous levels, but ends support for the storage of sugar. The regime will be subject to review at the beginning of 2003 on the basis of a Commission report and any necessary proposals. The Government's view is that the EU support for sugar needs to be put on a more sustainable basis.

 The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) estimates that the spawning stock biomass of cod in the North sea will stand at 55,400 tonnes at the beginning of 2002, which ICES considers to be outside safe biological limits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11107w19.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many national insurance numbers have been issued; and what plans he has to review the procedures for issuing, cancelling and verifying NI numbers.  [8341]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11107w19.html_spnew7"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We regularly review data cleansing activities on the departmental central index (DCI) and are currently looking at issues relating to NINO security as a whole. This includes reviewing procedures and building on work already done to identify and further safeguard vulnerable accounts.
<P>

<a name="11107w19.html_para8">There are approximately 83 million national insurance numbers (NINOs) currently held on the DCI. Other than the 47 million NINOs used by UK residents over 16, this figure includes approximately 12.5 million child reference numbers for all children included on claims to child benefit, 13.5 million for people who are dead and whose numbers remain in order to allow surviving spouses to claim contributory benefit entitlement and 2 million for those in receipt of benefit abroad. The remaining estimated 8 million will include UK citizens who have migrated to other countries, short-term immigrants/ holiday workers and deceased persons where notification of death has not been received.




<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2001 : Column: 310W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11107w19.html_para9">Duplicate NINOs are 'cancelled' or removed from the DCI as and when they are identified. The cancellation of NINOs, other than those discovered to be duplicates or unused, is not carried out as it is considered that the removal of 'inactive' records opens a gateway to identity fraud. The retention of a deceased person's NINO is necessary to protect the inheritable rights of a surviving spouse to ensure they are awarded the correct rate of retirement pension.
<P>

<a name="11107w19.html_para10">The procedure for issuing NINOs has been tightened through the enhanced NINO allocation process which was introduced nationally from April 2001. This aligns the process for the allocation of both benefit inspired and employment inspired NINOs and ensures consistency of approach is maintained throughout the country, thereby securing the adult registration gateway. All adult applicants for a NINO are interviewed by dedicated staff who have received specific specialist training. Information given by the applicant in support of their application is corroborated by expert staff who also scrutinise documentation provided using specialist equipment. A more stringent internal checking regime ensures that a NINO application is valid and that the applicant does not already have a NINO.
<P>

<a name="11107w19.html_para11">We are currently examining new initiatives that address the issues around NINO security and propose to do more in the future to improve the procedures for managing NINOs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what considerations and costs are taken into account when determining the level of jobseeker's allowance.  [10575]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11107w20.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Jobseeker's allowance consists of both a contribution-based and an income-based element. The rates of jobseeker's allowance are intended to cover normal day-to-day living expenses and are reviewed annually using the Rossi index.
<P>

<a name="11107w20.html_para0">Entitlement to contribution-based jobseeker's allowance is not affected by the amount of capital a person has although part-time earnings and occupational or personal pensions are taken into account. When determining income-based jobseeker's allowance most forms of income a person or their partner have are taken into account. The amount of capital held can also affect the amount of benefit.

We are currently working with our estates and service partners, Land Securities Trillium, to implement a number of capital investment projects designed to improve energy efficiency throughout the estate. Further to this, the Department is in the process of developing an overarching environmental awareness campaign for staff, that will include energy efficiency good practice while at work and links will be promoted with the work of the Energy Savings Trust.

Local authorities now have powers to provide secure parking for motorcycles under the Road Traffic Regulations Act 1984 (as amended). The Vehicles (Crime) Act 2001 provides for statutory regulation of the motor salvage industry which will help prevent vehicles, including motorcycles, from being stolen to be broken up for spare parts or "rung" (ie taking on the identities of vehicles which have been written off in accidents).

<a name="11107w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 It can take on average three hours of a police officer's time to arrest and charge a person for possession of cannabis. There were 81,380 cannabis

possession offences in 1999. A police constable's basic salary cost in England and Wales falls within the range of &#163;12 to &#163;14 per hour, therefore the annual cost is in the region of &#163;2,929,680 to &#163;3,417,960.
<P>

<a name="11107w22.html_para0">In assessing the costs, it is important to remember that arrests for cannabis possession may be incidental to other police action.

 The Government are committed to ensuring that strong measures are in place to penalise people who traffic in human beings. We have signed the trafficking protocol to the United Nations convention on transnational organised crime, which requires the specific criminalisation of trafficking in human beings.
<P>

<a name="11107w22.html_para1">The Government are currently negotiating a framework decision, which is a binding European Union instrument and requires the criminalisation of trafficking in human beings for the purposes of exploiting their labour and services or for sexual exploitation. Under its provisions, the United Kingdom will be required to have implemented the instrument within two years of its adoption.
<P>

<a name="11107w22.html_para2">A decision will be made on how best to implement the UN and EU agreements after the EU framework decision has been adopted.

<P>

<a name="11107w22.html_para3">Last year we set up Project Reflex, a multi-agency task force chaired by the National Crime Squad, to co-ordinate anti-trafficking operations and develop the intelligence and strategic planning to underpin them. It is now well established and has resulted in some major successes involving partners overseas. The most recent has been Operation Franc in early June, which led to arrests in the United Kingdom, Belgium, France and Germany.

 No. The Government published their response to the report of the independent inquiry into the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 by the Police Foundation in February 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11107w22.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 There has been no change in Government policy on legalising or decriminalising illegal drugs. Our drugs laws deter experimentation, a point borne out by public opinion surveys. For example 30 per cent. of adults questioned by MORI for the Police Foundation inquiry cited illegality as the main reason for not taking drugs. Moreover, the findings of the 1998&#150;99 youth lifestyle survey revealed that 64 per cent. of respondents who had never taken cannabis had not done so because it is against the law.

<a name="11107w22.html_para8">The Home Secretary has asked the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to review the arguments for reclassifying cannabis from class B to class C. In giving evidence the Home Secretary said that he was not in favour of either legalisation or decriminalisation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he will publish guidance on the housing and care of ferrets and gerbils in breeding and supplying establishments designated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986; and if he will make a statement.  [13591]<P>

 I have today laid before Parliament a draft supplement to the code of practice for the housing and care of animals in designated breeding and supplying establishments. The draft sets standards for the housing and care of ferrets and gerbils in designated breeding and supply establishments, and is a consequence of the species concerned being added to the list in schedule 2 to the 1986 Act (animals which can only be obtained from designated sources). The draft has been produced and laid under section 21 of the Act and is subject to the negative resolution procedure. Copies have been placed in the Library.

 Information relating to the amount of land that is either registered or unregistered in Great Britain is not collected centrally. In England and Wales, land

registration is compulsory on sale and on most other transactions affecting unregistered land. Over 18 million titles are already registered out of an estimated 23 million. The Land Registration Bill currently before Parliament is expected to lead to a substantial increase in voluntary applications for first registration and in registration of leasehold interests. The Law Commission and HM Land Registry have recommended that ways in which all remaining land with unregistered title in England and Wales might be brought on to the register should be re-examined five years after the Bill is implemented. The Government are currently considering that recommendation.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, if she will make it her policy to make Islamic marriages undertaken by UK citizens abroad registerable in the UK upon the return home of either party to the marriage.  [12400]<P>

<a name="11107w24.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The recognition in the UK of a marriage which has taken place overseas can be determined only by a court. I understand, however, that generally such marriages would be recognised here as valid provided that they complied with the law of the country where they took place and the couple had the legal capacity to marry each other.
<P>

<a name="11107w24.html_para0">There is currently no provision in law for marriages which take place outside the UK to be registered in this country. But, under the Foreign Marriage Order 1970, certificates of marriage may be lodged with the Registrar General on receipt from the local consular office of non-Commonwealth countries. However, if the couple are already validly married to each other, there would be no need for the marriage to be registered again in this country.

 The general public will be able to view the 1901 census in two ways. First, online over the internet at www.census.pro.gov.uk. This innovation will greatly increase ease of access and is expected to

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many district judges (magistrates courts) sit in England and Wales, broken down by county; and what plans he has to increase this number.  [12386]<P>

<a name="11107w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The table shows where stipendiary magistrates (now district judges (magistrates courts)) are based, county by county. London includes the senior district judge and her deputy. A competition is under way to fill the following vacancies included in the figures&#151;two in London, one in Greater Manchester, one in Middlesex, one in Nottinghamshire, one in South Yorkshire and one in West Yorkshire. The Government are considering Lord Justice Auld's recommendations which may have an impact on the number of these appointments required.
