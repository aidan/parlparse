 Short money is given to Opposition parties to help them to carry out their parliamentary business. This can include research associated with Front-Bench duties, developing and communicating alternative policies to those of the Government and shadowing the Government&#146;s Front Bench. There is specific provision for meeting costs necessarily incurred in running the office of the Leader of the Opposition. Each Opposition party has to provide a certificate from an independent auditor each year to the effect that all the expenses claimed were in respect of the party&#146;s parliamentary business. No information is available to me about the number of staff employed by the Leader of the Opposition who are paid from Short money.</p>

 Figures for the effect on energy consumption within the UK by energy-saving measures for this particular period are not readily available. However, for the climate change programme review, we prepared estimates of the effects on carbon emissions for the household sector in the 1990s and separately for the present decade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_397"><a name="60719w0003.htm_para5"><a name="0607208000552">The Government estimate that energy efficiency improvements in the household sector in the 1990s would have contributed around 4.5 million tonnes of carbon (MtC) of emissions reductions, that is, some 12 per cent. of 1990 emissions. At the same time, growth in demand for underlying energy services&#151;warmer homes, hot water&#151;would have increased emissions by 11.5 MtC; the increase in the use of gas for generating electricity instead of coal in the 1990s, which reduced emissions from power stations, and so reduced the associated emissions from electricity use in homes, businesses, etc, would have decreased emissions by 8 MtC; and smaller factors, mainly fuel switching by householders and changes to external temperatures, would have contributed a further 1 MtC of reductions. The overall effect on emissions was a net reduction of around 2.5 MtC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_398"><a name="60719w0003.htm_para6"><a name="0607208000553">In the present decade, before the effects of policies are included, we estimate that background energy efficiency would save a further 4.5 MtC. Increasing demand for energy services, together with the effects of the other factors described earlier, means that the net overall reduction in this period would be approximately 0.3 MtC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_399"><a name="60719w0003.htm_para7"><a name="0607208000554">The estimated effect of all the energy efficiency policies for households set out in the new UK climate change programme 2006, is an additional reduction of 4.8 MtC by 2010. Most of these savings are expected to be delivered between 2005 and 2010, through tighter building regulations and further activity under the energy efficiency commitment.</p>

At present, every Government Department is under instructions to make efficiency savings. This generally involves a fundamental review of the work to be done, and a reprioritisation of our responsibilities and how we manage them. Consequently, the Environment Agency GIA was reduced this year by &#163;400,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="60719w0003.htm_para9"><a name="0607208000560">Of the &#163;5.8 million in GIA, &#163;600,000 is spent on compliance checking and enforcement of fish movements. A reduction in GIA therefore necessitated a reduction in funding for work in this area by &#163;150,000. If sales of rod licences are above target this year the agency may be able to make good part or all of this cut.</p>

 The UK's Cleaner Coal Technology programme started in 1999. Under this programme we have supported 48 collaborative R and D projects on advanced coal technologies through four calls to the value of &#163;13 million as well as a significant number of small R and D projects in collaboration with British Coal Utilisation Research Association for which some &#163;150,000 per year was allocated. In all 174 Cleaner Coal projects have been supported to date, with an additional &#163;3.5 million provided for collaborative Cleaner Coal Technology projects with the USA since then.

 There are three types of internally displaced people (IDPs) in eastern Burma. These are (with the latest available numbers, from October 2005): (i) people in temporary settlements in ceasefire  areas administered by ethnic nationalities (340,000);  (ii) villagers who have been evicted by the Burmese Government and moved into designated relocation sites (108,000); and (iii) civilians hiding from the Burmese Army in areas most affected by armed conflict (92,000).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_427"><a name="60719w0005.htm_para9"><a name="0607208000941">The recent military offensive against the Karen people has swelled the number of civilians hiding in conflict areas by at least 15,000. DFID's approach to providing emergency assistance to these IDPs has been to work through local community groups inside Burma. This is a complementary approach to the use of relief teams operating cross-border from Thailand, and it enables access to IDPs who would not be reached by any other means, and through a mechanism which is much less-well supported by other donors. The development of civil society within the country is also a fundamental step in a successful transition to democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_428"><a name="60719w0005.htm_para10"><a name="0607208000942">The number of IDPs that we can reach from inside the country is limited. Access is difficult, and the small local groups with whom we are working do not currently have the capacity to deliver greater volumes of emergency relief&#151;although we are working to strengthen their ability to do more. Those delivering assistance to IDPs cross-border from Thailand face similar challenges. Therefore, we recognise the importance of maintaining co-ordination with all donors (both those delivering assistance cross border, and those working inside the country) to ensure that together we manage to reach as many IDPs as possible. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_429"><a name="60719w0005.htm_para11"><a name="0607208000943">DFID also provides support to IDPs in temporary settlements in ceasefire areas in eastern Burma through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to which we provide &#163;500,000 a year, of which approximately 75 per cent. is attributable to work with displaced people in this area.</p>

This expressed grave concern at the attacks by military forces in violation of cease-fire agreements and called on the regime to end the systematic violations of human rights, including enforced displacement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_433"><a name="60719w0005.htm_para15"><a name="0607208000947">UN Security Council members last discussed the situation in Burma on 16 December under &#145;Any Other Business'. In this discussion, the UK highlighted the on-going human rights abuses, the detention of political prisoners, internal conflicts and the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases. Though there was no consensus to issue a presidential statement or other formal report, the discussions reflected the concern felt in many parts of the international community over the regime's failure to make progress towards democracy and to respect international human rights norms. At present there is no agreement within the Security Council, including among the permanent members, to add Burma to the Council's formal agenda, but the UK, through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, will continue to co-ordinate closely with the UN and partners in the Security Council and the region in considering how best to maintain pressure for positive change in Burma.</p>

 The UK is committed to the development of health services that respond to the broad health needs of the population, and palliative care clearly has a vital place in this. DFID support is largely directed at countries where the health spend is less than $10 per person per year and often far less. The public spend in the Congo is $2, in Ethiopia $1.50 and in Burundi $0.70. Clearly these countries are not able to deliver the range of services that they would wish and realistically are unlikely to invest significant public budgets in palliative care. We support countries to deliver their health programmes and the priority interventions defined in their national health plan. Increasingly we provide resources through various forms of flexible budget support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_436"><a name="60719w0006.htm_para2"><a name="0607208000954">DFID officials have met staff from the hospice community on a number of occasions, most recently during a public consultation on a revised DFID health strategy. Many committed groups lobby DFID to make greater efforts on what they see as neglected areas in the international health response. Recent communications have challenged DFID to do more on palliative care, cancer services, neglected tropical diseases, blindness, disability, malnutrition and non-communicable diseases. DFID accepts that palliative care services need to be better reflected in national health plans and budgets and that realistically support needs to be provided through home-based rather than institutional settings.</p>

 The Iraqi health care system faces enormous challenges which long pre-date the 2003 conflict. In the early 1980s, Iraq enjoyed some of the best health care in the Middle East. However, by 2000, international health indicators for Iraq were comparable with some of the poorest countries in Africa. Under-five mortality had increased from 50 per 1,000 in 1990 to 133 in 2001. One in four children under five were chronically malnourished. Hospitals, clinics and water and sanitation plants suffered from chronic lack of maintenance.</p>

<i> [holding answer 18 July 2006]:</i> We have a target for 2,500 schools to be providing a core offer of extended services by September 2006. This includes access to a varied menu of activities, parenting support, childcare 8am to 6pm, swift and easy referral to specialist services and wider community access. Currently, we have over 9,000 schools engaged with their local authority on the extended schools agenda with a representative split of primary and secondary schools. This is encouraging progress against our September target. We do not currently have data on the total number of schools operating extended hours broken down by borough or region. However, we do have data from a baseline survey of maintained schools published in September 2005. This survey showed that 61 per cent. of secondary schools and 40 per cent. of primary schools offer childcare or activities before school. The survey suggested that more schools offered activities after school hours&#151;a total of 87 per cent. of primary, and 95 per cent. of secondary schools. In future we will be able to draw on data from the school census, which will include information about the extended services that schools are providing.</p>

 The Government are investing over  &#163;1.5 billion (including lottery funding) in the five years to 2008 to implement the national school sport strategy. The Departments for Education and Skills and for Culture, Media and Sport share a public service agreement target to increase the percentage of five to 16-year-olds who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality physical education and school sport to 75 per cent. by 2006 and 85 per cent. by 2008. The long-term ambition&#151;by 2010&#151;is to offer all children four hours of sport. Spearheading action is the creation of a national network of sports colleges and school sport partnerships.</p>

Currently 80 per cent. of schools in England are within a school sport partnership and all schools will be by September 2006. The 2004/05 school sport survey found that 69 per cent. of pupils in schools within a partnership were spending at least two hours in a typical week on high quality physical education and sport, an 11 per cent. increase on 2003/04. The survey also found that partnership schools offer on average almost 15 different sports. Copies of the 2003/04 and 2004/05 survey reports have been placed in the House Library.</p>

 The Department for Employment and Learning (DEL) helps employers fill vacancies and assists jobseekers to find employment through a network of 35 Jobs and Benefits offices (JBOs) and JobCentres located in towns and cities throughout Northern Ireland.</p>

The process has recently been improved through the introduction of action plans for people who are ill, have a disability or are lone parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_477"><a name="60719w0009.htm_para8"><a name="0607208001467">The Department has been piloting the Pathways to Work initiative in three areas (Ballymoney, Lurgan and Magherafelt) since 3 October 2005 and in Newtownabbey, Enniskillen and Newry since April 2006. The initiative builds on existing provision and offers early, sustained support from specially trained personal advisers with the aim of helping IB recipients consider a return to work. The support package includes innovative health rehabilitation programmes with a work focus, to help clients understand and manage their health condition. New financial incentives include a &#163;40 a week return to work credit to help &#147;make work pay&#148; for those moving into a job paying less than &#163;15,000 per annum.</p>

The choice of pilot locations has taken account of the rural/urban mix and the potential impacts on the client group in rural areas. It is recognised that the costs of attending mandatory interviews are likely to be greater for those living in rural areas so travel costs are paid and interviews are arranged at a time to suit the client.</p>

The report covering the period 2006-09, which provides a range of housing statistics and analysis, was published in February 2006. A copy is available on its website at www.nihe.gov.uk and can be found under the Publications/Reports/ Housing Market Reviews. I will arrange to have a copy placed in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_490"><a name="60719w0010.htm_para9"><a name="0607208001591">The review indicates that since 1979 the Housing Executive has sold more than 110,000 dwellings to sitting tenants accounting for almost a quarter (24 per cent.) of the owner-occupied sector and 16 per cent. of the housing market as a whole. The 2001 House Condition Survey provided the first reliable estimate of what proportion of these had been resold on the open market. In March 2001, some 94,000 dwellings had been sold and approximately 18,000 (19 per cent.) of these had been resold on the open market: two thirds to new owner-occupiers and the remaining one third to private landlords, reflecting the fact that they generally provide a good source of high-quality affordable homes, particularly for first-time buyers and landlords who see them as a sound investment. Between 2000 and 2004 the annual house sales figure remained at over 5,000 but in 2004-05 the number of dwellings sold fell by 24 per cent. to 3,135. The reduction reflected the introduction of major revisions to the House Sales Scheme and it is envisaged that house sales will remain at between 2,500 and 3,000 over the next three year period. Annual research carried out by the University of Ulster in relation to sold Housing Executive dwellings confirms that they continue to perform well on the open market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_491"><a name="60719w0010.htm_para10"><a name="0607208001592">The co-ownership shared equity scheme remains the Department's main measure for providing assistance to first time buyers experiencing affordability problems.

success, Government increased their funding by &#163;23 million over the 3-year period to 2008 to provide almost &#163;39 million and this will help support around 2,400 applicants over this period. A series of changes to the scheme have also just been introduced to make it more accessible for people on lower incomes: the basis of calculation of the co-ownership rental charge will reduce from 3.5 per cent. to 2.75 per cent. As a result a typical co-ownership home buyer with a &#163;100,000 property on a 50:50 basis will see their monthly rental reduce from &#163;160 to &#163;126. The professional fees associated with buying a home through co-ownership are also being reduced from &#163;400 to &#163;250.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_492"><a name="60719w0010.htm_para11"><a name="0607208001593">Given the sharp increase in house prices, the value limits that apply to properties eligible for purchase through co-ownership have been reviewed. The limit for the greater Belfast and Derry city council areas has increased from &#163;115,000 to &#163;135,000 and from &#163;102,500 to &#163;115,000 elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_493"><a name="60719w0010.htm_para12"><a name="0607208001594">The Department has also been examining recent initiatives which were introduced to address affordability in the rest of the UK.

Clearly, we also have a strong interest in helping Colombia fight the illegal drugs trade, not least because an estimated 80 per cent. of the cocaine coming into Britain originates from Colombia. All the three major illegal armed groups in Colombia have been proven to be actively involved in the illegal drugs trade which fuels the internal armed conflict in the country, undermines political stability and contributes to human rights abuses. Furthermore, the vast international income from cocaine leads to extensive money laundering. Corruption and intimidation backed up by violence is rife in Colombia.</p>

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has identified child rights as one of its top three human rights priorities. One important focus for this work is addressing the issue of children affected by armed conflict, including the recruitment of children into armed forces and armed groups. The UK has supported the establishment of a UN monitoring and reporting mechanism on this issue and is actively involved in the UN Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict to ensure that action is taken to follow up reports from this mechanism. The UK welcomes the efforts of the UN Secretary-General&#146;s Special Representative on Children and Armed Conflict to advocate the rights of children affected by armed conflict.

of the numbers affected is complicated by the many ways in which children can be affected by conflict, for example as porters, messengers, spies or cooks, as well as active combatants. The UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children in Armed Conflict said in a report to the General Assembly in September 2005 that over 250,000 children continue to be exploited as child soldiers.

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has made no estimate of the number of children recruited by armed forces and armed groups in these countries. A number of studies exist in this area, including some by non-governmental organisations, as well as statistics on the numbers of children involved in disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programmes. The picture of the numbers affected is complicated by the many ways in which children can be affected by conflict, for example as porters, messengers, spies or cooks, as well as active combatants. One helpful source in this area is the Child Soldiers Global Report 2004, produced by the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers which provides estimates for the countries listed. This document is accessible most easily at the following website:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_531"><a name="60719w0013.htm_para12"><a name="0607208001888">Ministers and officials have made representations on this issue. For example, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Trade has raised our concerns on a number of issues in Burma including the recruitment of child soldiers with the Burmese ambassador in London, and in writing to the Burmese Foreign Minister. During 2005, officials were active in a series of EU d&#233;marches in countries where the use of child soldiers is a particular problem. D&#233;marches were conducted in Burundi, Colombia, C&#244;te d&#146;lvoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Nepal, Sudan and Uganda. The UK has also sought to ensure that disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programmes are sustainable and make appropriate provision for the particular needs of children. This has included specific assistance in a number of the countries listed, for example the Ministry of Defence&#146;s assistance in reforming recruiting practices in the Sierra Leone army.</p>

 It is a condition of their employment that members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children also have a legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive full-time education from the age of five years. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) therefore helps staff meet these potentially conflicting obligations in two circumstances:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_534"><a name="60719w0014.htm_para2"><a name="0607208001897">Children who accompany their parents on postings overseas are expected to use free state schooling if it is available locally and is of a suitable standard. At posts where no suitable schooling is available free-of-charge locally, the FCO refunds the cost of local school fees to enable children to receive the level of education to which they would be entitled in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_535"><a name="60719w0014.htm_para3"><a name="0607208001898">Staff are liable to move at regular intervals, every 12-48 months, often to locations where schools offering English language education are unavailable or inadequate. Providing continuity of education can therefore pose real problems, particularly during the important examination years. The FCO therefore provides an accountable allowance to enable children to board at school in the UK, while their parents remain subject to the worldwide mobility obligation.</p>

 As I explained in my answer to the hon. Member on 10 July 2006, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 1519-20W, the instructions sent to the UK delegation covered a range of options for possible votes on different draft resolutions or motions. Publication of instructions to Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) posts could be damaging to our international relations. It would not therefore be appropriate to place a copy in the Library of the House. The FCO consulted the Department of Health, which takes the lead on the issue, the Office of Science and Technology, as it then was, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Medical Research Council, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and the Royal Society. We lobbied other governments in capitals and in New York and received a range of views in response. These discussions were held in confidence. We do not have copies of oral representations received from others. The chief executive of the British Bioindustry Association wrote to my right hon. Friend the then Foreign Secretary on 12 October 2004, strongly supporting the UK position. Copies of this letter and my right hon. Friend&#146;s reply will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_291"><a name="0607208002073"><a name="60719w0015.htm_spnew5"><a name="0607208004481"><b>Mr. Hoon:</b>
 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) consults the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (PCGN) on issues concerning foreign geographical names. The PCGN is an interdepartmental body, whose principal function is to advise the Government on policies and procedures for the proper writing of geographical names for places and features outside the United Kingdom, excluding those of the Antarctic. The final decision on the appropriate name to use, however, rests with the lead section on geographical names within the FCO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_542"><a name="60719w0015.htm_para2"><a name="0607208002074">The policy for the application of geographical names is to follow the practice of the supreme administering authority of the country concerned. It is the FCO&#146;s policy to recognise changes of geographical name where these fall within the sovereign competence of a particular foreign government. For example, in India the name change from Madras to Chennai has been made according to due processes within the Government of India and requires appropriate acknowledgement within the FCO. The name Madras would therefore now be considered a former name for this city, in the same way that Salisbury is a former name for Harare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_543"><a name="60719w0015.htm_para3"><a name="0607208002075">However, there will be a number of occasions where a geographical name within the sovereign competence of a particular foreign government is already known in a traditional form in the English language and it would not be unusual for this form to be used within the FCO for ease of recognition. For example, the Burmese geographical name Yangon has long been known in the English language as Rangoon, and that form continues to be acceptable today. However, the use of English-language terms can also alter over time. This could be considered to have occurred in the case of Beijing, where the name Peking is today rarely encountered as the English-language name.</p>

 It was very disappointing that the UN Small Arms Review Conference failed to agree an outcome document, particularly as the UK had succeeded in agreeing a consensus text on the need for work at the national, regional and global levels to strengthen transfer controls. Fortunately, as the achievement of a consensus text indicates, all countries now recognise the need to address the issue of transfer controls within the UN Programme of Action. Over 100 states at the Review Conference expressed support for strengthening transfer controls. The UK will continue to work with all states to build support for agreement on common guidelines for small arms and light weapons transfers, building on the progress made at regional level in the past three years under the UK&#146;s Transfer Controls Initiative. The UK is also keen to work with Canada on its proposal for an informal meeting of states in 2007 focused on transfer controls.</p>

 The Department recognises the key role that effective pharmacotherapies, including substitute opiate prescribing and medications such as naltrexone to assist relapse prevention, may play in the management of opiate dependence. The Department published its evidence-based Clinical Guidelines, &#147;Drug misuse and dependence&#151;guidelines on clinical management&#148;, in 1999, on the advice of an independent expert group and in conjunction with relevant professional bodies. The 1999 Clinical Guidelines address the use of methadone, buprenorphine (more recently with a marketing authorisation for use as Subutex) and naltrexone. The guidelines discuss the relative effectiveness of buprenorphine and methadone, but as naltrexone is licensed only for use to support relapse prevention, no direct comparison is feasible with the opiate substitute methadone and buprenorphine. The guidelines do support the use of all these drugs as potentially effective opiate misuse treatments when used  <br>

This appraisal will evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these drugs as substitute opiates for the management of opiate misusers. The Department also asked at the same time for a similar technology appraisal for &#147;naltrexone as a treatment for relapse prevention&#148; for opiate misuse. This will include appraisal of its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Both these technology appraisals are scheduled for publication in March 2007.</p>

<i> [holding answer 5 July 2006]:</i> Combating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other health care associated infections (HCAIs), continues to be a priority for Government. A target to reduce the number of MRSA bloodstream infections by half by April 2008 is in place and each trust has its own target. The total number of these infections in 2004-05 was 7,212, compared with 7,684 in 2003-04. Figures for 2005-06 will be published later this month.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to the answer of 16 June 2006, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1558W, on the National Programme for Information Technology, what the total level of savings are which have been achieved by NHS organisations where national programme systems and services have been delivered ahead of time; and in which NHS organisations these savings were achieved.

 Comprehensive information of the kind requested is not collected centrally. However, the most obvious example of savings of the kind described is when new systems, paid for under the programme, have replaced systems that local national health service bodies have previously been paying for. Across the whole of the NHS, and over the 10-year life of the national programme, these savings will be very substantial. In the case of the local service provider contracts, local savings are expected to offset nearly half the local costs over the lives of the contracts; a saving of some &#163;2.5 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_596"><a name="60719w0018.htm_para7"><a name="0607208002293">In the case of picture archiving and communications (PACS) systems, local savings are expected fully to offset the local costs of &#163;684 million. Smaller savings are also expected in other areas, for example, where local NHS bodies use N3 or NHSmail to replace services for which they are currently paying. The business case for NHSmail estimated such savings at &#163;185 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_597"><a name="60719w0018.htm_para8"><a name="0607208002294">Further savings as a consequence of safety and organisational improvements will also be cash-releasing, and are highlighted in the recent National Audit Office report into the national programme.</p>

On 7 June 2006 we brought into force sections 25 and 26 of the Identity Cards Act 2006 which created new criminal offences of being in possession or control of false identity documents.

The maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment for an offence of possession with intent to use the document for establishing registrable facts about another person, such as name, address, date of birth and other personal details, and two years imprisonment for possession without reasonable excuse.

<p><a name="stpa_683"><a name="60719w0026.htm_para9"><a name="06072023000568">Soon after its introduction, the EPA2 system encountered technical problems, making the online application process less effective than desired. The IPS invoked contingency plans on 5 June and suspended the system, replacing it with EPA1, the earlier version of IPS&#146;s online application system, which is operating well. To ensure customers received the best possible service levels, IPS wrote to those customers who had applied through EPA2 and were still waiting, to recommend that they submit replacement applications and IPS has generally issued passports to these customers within a two days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_684"><a name="60719w0026.htm_para10"><a name="06072023000569">Approximately 18,000 applications were received via EPA2 and all are expected to have been processed by 14 July. The IPS has issued 6.6 million passports this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_685"><a name="60719w0026.htm_para11"><a name="06072023000570">The EPA1 system advises applicants to allow four weeks to receive their passport. However, on-line applications are included in the IPS operating target to turn round 99.5 per cent. of straightforward applications for the standard service within 10 working days once we receive the completed and signed application (which for an EPA1 case will have been prepopulated and sent to the applicant for completion.) The IPS annual report and accounts, expected to be published later this month, will show that this target was met for the financial year ended 31 March 2006.</p>
