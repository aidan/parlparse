As you are no doubt aware, the Strategic Defence Review announced a considerable commitment to the UK Shipbuilding Industry over the next 15-20 years; through major ship programmes, including the Future Aircraft Carrier, the Type 45 Destroyers and the Future Surface Combatant. These programmes provide a secure long-term platform for the UK Shipbuilding Industry to increase its efficiency and effectiveness.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your three questions (Nos 128709-128711) to the Secretary of State for Defence about the Nimrod MRA4 and Active Search Sonobuoy System. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked about the Department's plans for the incremental acquisition of new equipment onto the Nimrod MRA4. As this aircraft is still in development, it is too early for a comprehensive plan of future enhancements to be drawn up. Nevertheless the opportunities offered under the Smart Procurement Initiative, through incremental acquisition, will be actively pursued at the appropriate time. At present, there is one new system which is being progressed with the aim of enhancing the aircraft's capability, that is the SR(SA)903 Active Search Sonobuoy System (ASSS).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You also asked how ASSS will be capable of discriminating real submarine targets from false acoustic alarms. ASSS will use sophisticated software which will analyse the acoustic signature of the contacts picked up by the sonobuoy. These solution algorithms will be able to discriminate real from false targets.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Your final question asked how long the procurement of the ASSS will take. Subject to the project being approved next year, the plan will be to deliver an ASSS capability in line with the In-Service Date of the main Nimrod MRA4 programme (March 2005).</FONT></UL>

The company has indicated that to carry out the modification work elsewhere would require it to invest in the acquisition of new specialist tooling equipment and the transfer of technical expertise from Obendorf, and maintains that conducting the modification work there represents the lowest risk to the timescale and cost of the programme. Equally, early indications are that work on stripping and refurbishment of weapons prior to modification could most sensibly be done in the UK.

 The RAF Board of Inquiry determined that Flight Lieutenants Tapper and Cook were free from emotional stress, and were well rested and physically fit prior to commencing duty on 2 June 1994. A complete medical examination of their bodies was carried out after the crash by a team headed by a consultant forensic pathologist. This showed that both were in good health and had taken neither alcohol nor drugs. Nothing was found to suggest that an explosion or any noxious agent played any part in the accident. The Board of Inquiry concluded that the mental and physical state of Flight Lieutenants Tapper and Cook was most unlikely to have been a factor in the accident.

However, the Department of Health statistics show that 68,410 women aged 35 and over with bladder problems were admitted to NHS hospitals in England during the period 1998-99.

 For 2000-01, local education authorities have now accepted over 98 per cent. of the allocations offered to them through the Standards Fund. Most authorities accepted their allocations in full, including authorities that have below average standard spending assessments per pupil. The requirement for authorities to contribute to the Standards Fund was allowed for in the 5.4 per cent. increase in education Standard Spending Assessment. In addition, schools have received a share of the &#163;290 million funding increase announced in the budget to further drive up standards, and benefit from their share of the &#163;50 million extra in grant

<a name="00711w05.html_para2">The social class mix of the underlying population is taken directly from the 1991 Census. Over time this approach becomes less reliable, particularly at a disagreggated level and the social class groupings have therefore been aggregated.
<P>

<a name="00711w05.html_para3">Over the period shown, participation rates of young people by social class have fluctuated in line with overall participation. These overall trends in part reflect a large increase in the size of the age-group and the decision by some students to pull forward their year of entry to higher education from 1998 to 1997 in advance of the introduction of fees. Over the same period the proportion of young students who come from the lower social classes (IIIM, IV, V) has remained constant at around 27 per cent. and the proportion who come from the higher social classes (I, II, IIIN) has remained at around 73 per cent.

 I have had no discussions with the General Osteopathic Council (GOsC) on these matters. Under the Osteopaths Act 1993, the GOsC may formally recognise osteopathic qualifications for the purposes of statutory registration with the approval of the Privy Council. However, the Act does not require the GOsC to seek the approval of the Privy Council for any decision it makes not to recognise a qualification. I understand that the John Wernham College of Classical Osteopathy has been given leave to apply for a judicial review of GOsC's decision in its case.
<P>

<a name="00711w05.html_para4">The Department has been informed that some 75 students at the John Wernham College are likely to be affected by the GOsC's decision not to recognise its qualification. The college, and its validating body the North East Surrey College of Technology, are responsible for advising and assisting those students. The GOsC has no statutory duty to assist students in these circumstances but has requested that all schools of osteopathy applying to have their qualifications recognised prepare a contingency plan in the event that their applications are unsuccessful. It is now trying to assist the John Wernham College to activate its contingency plan.

 The House of Commons Refreshment Department does not compile any statistics on the quantity of organic food and drink purchased or sold through its catering operations. The Department is a member of the Soil Association and recognises the significant demand for organic produce. Last year the Department introduced, on a trial basis, an organic menu in the Members' Dining Room. While indisputably popular with its customers, the menu was reluctantly discontinued as a consequence of the inconsistent availability and quality of supply, and the high cost of such produce. The Department now pursues a policy of purchasing organic produce or ingredients wherever consistent availability and quality can be guaranteed by suppliers, and where it is judged that the price to be passed on to the Department's customers is affordable.

<P>
<P>

 From the latest information available, Bangladesh's debt sustainability ratios are below the minimum thresholds used by the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, which means that it would not qualify for debt relief.
<P>

<a name="00711w06.html_para0">For a country to receive HIPC debt relief, it requires not only unsustainable levels of debt, but also a commitment to poverty reduction and reform. In the case of Bangladesh, any consideration of debt relief would be likely to require further progress in areas such as public expenditure allocations on essential services for poor people, measures to improve the quality of public services, improving revenue administration, and a serious start on structural measures such as financial sector and public enterprise reform.
<P>

<a name="00711w06.html_para1">Our substantial aid programme to Bangladesh-- &#163;65 million in 1999-2000--focuses on promoting the reduction of poverty both directly and by addressing constraints on faster pro-poor growth and improved governance.

 I have regular discussions with the First Secretary about a range of topics including the prospects for inward investment to Wales.
<P>

<a name="00711w06.html_para2">Wales continues to do well in attracting inward investment, but cannot afford to be complacent in the face of increasingly severe competition. Every effort is being made to raise awareness of Wales and to improve the potential for investment. The National Assembly, Welsh Development Agency and others will continue to keep existing measures under review. I believe that this will place Wales in a good position to exploit all opportunities for securing future investment.

<a name="00711w07.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 There is a great deal of activity led by industrial interests and charities to which the Government's efforts are complementary. The Government support a range of activities to promote science and engineering to children and the general public. We also consider that it is important to do more than promote science and engineering, and takes steps to involve the public over major scientific issues and to increase the opportunities for dialogue. Except for some very specific activities, it is 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jul 2000 : Column: 470W</I><P>
not practicable to provide accurate total costings of promotional activities or to provide a breakdown for the cost of activities aimed at children.
<P>

<a name="00711w07.html_para4">My Department's largest investment is through the Science Budget grant-aided activities of the Research Councils, who all have science promotion as one of their responsibilities. Estimates of expenditure by the Research Councils are given in answer to the preceding question. The Royal Society also undertakes activities in this area some of which are grant-aided from the Science Budget at about &#163;1 million per annum, and supports among other things the activities of COPUS.
<P>

<a name="00711w07.html_para5">The Department also administers two main programmes. A general programme administered by the Office of Science and Technology (OST), provides core funding to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and funds the BA's co-ordination of National Science Week. It also provides additional support for the COPUS grants scheme, including its projects aimed specifically at promoting SET for women and ethnic minorities, and funds innovative projects aimed at bringing science to a wider audience through, for example, drama, art, and the Internet. In order to gain a better understanding of the public's attitudes to science, the OST also funded last year's 'Public Consultation on Developments in the Biosciences', and this year, in partnership with the Wellcome Trust, has undertaken a survey looking at public attitudes to science in the UK. The OST's budget for these activities in 1994-95 was &#163;1.0 million, and has since risen to an average of &#163;1.25 million per annum.

 DTI has made no assessment of electrometallurgical techniques to process spent nuclear fuels, nor have we commissioned consultants to do so. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, a non- departmental body reporting to DTI, recently considered pyrometallurgical processing (developed in the United States) as a potential technology for the future management of nuclear fuels at its Dounreay site. It concluded that the technology was not a practicable option for dealing with the non-metallic fuels at Dounreay, and that the waste products might not be acceptable in the UK without further treatment.

 According to my Department's National Lottery Awards Database, between the start of the Lottery (November 1994) and 30 April 1997, 24 Lottery awards, with a total value of &#163;3,419,980 were made in the Morecambe and Lunesdale constituency. From 1 May 1997 to 30 June 2000, the database indicates that 44 awards, with a total value of &#163;2,240,908 were made. I am today placing lists of these projects in the Libraries of the House.

 <i>[holding answer 6 July 2000]:</i> In the "Action Plan for Farming", &#163;26 million was allocated to the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme (PIRS) in its first year. As the outgoers element of the PIRS will operate using a sealed bid system, it is not possible to estimate how much of this initial &#163;26 million will be used on this part of the scheme. However, the aim of using a sealed bid system is to obtain the best value for money, with the expectation that a good proportion of the &#163;26 million, plus the additional funds for which bids have been made, can be available for the ongoers element.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many claimants over the last five years in <i>(a)</i> the United Kingdom, <i>(b)</i> Scotland and <i>(c)</i> South West Scotland District have had their Incapacity Benefit withdrawn after an all work test carried out by the Benefits Agency Medical Services; how many of these claimants requested a review; how many went to appeal; and how many of these (i) reviews and (ii) appeals resulted in benefit being re-instated.  [129498]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The information is not available in the format requested. Such information as is available is as follows.
<P>

<a name="00711w12.html_para1">Entitlement to Incapacity Benefit requires the claimant to provide evidence of incapacity. An initial award of benefit is made if there is acceptable medical evidence to support the claim. Subsequently, incapacity is assessed under the relevant medical test: during the first 28 weeks of incapacity, where the claimant has a recent work record, this is the own occupation test; after 28 weeks, or from the start of the claim where the claimant has not recently worked, it is the All Work Test (AWT) which was replaced from 3 April 2000 by the Personal Capability Assessment. If the relevant test is not satisfied, benefit is disallowed from that point. Incapacity is reassessed from time to time to check continuing entitlement.
<P>

<a name="00711w12.html_para2">Information on disallowances following the All Work Test is in table 1 (Great Britain) and table 2 (Scotland). The national data on benefit disallowances shown in table 1 are derived from a different source, and are collected over a different period from the available data for Scotland in table 2. The two tables are therefore not directly comparable. Disallowances include claimants who have failed to return the All Work Test questionnaire or attend for medical examination.
<P>

<a name="00711w12.html_para3">Data on appeals are in table 3. The time lag between disallowance, lodging and hearing an appeal means there is no direct relationship between decisions to disallow benefit and appeals made and heard in each year.
<P>

<a name="00711w12.html_para4">There has never been a requirement in Incapacity Benefit for a person who is dissatisfied with their decision to apply for a review. Since September 1999 a claimant may ask for an unfavourable decision to be reconsidered and revised within a one month time limit.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many non-resident parents who have not co-operated with the Child Support Agency have <i>(a)</i> been processed through Child Support Agency enforcement procedures, <i>(b)</i> been made to pay maintenance, <i>(c)</i> had arrest warrants issued against them and <i>(d)</i> been imprisoned.  [129249]<P>

 The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the Chief Executive, Mrs. Faith Boardman. She will write my the hon. Friend.
<P>

<a name="00711w12.html_para6"><i>Letter from Mike Isaac to Mr. Chris Ruane, dated 10 July 2000:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about enforcement action taken by the Child Support Agency. Mrs. Boardman is unavailable and therefore I am writing to you on her behalf.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The information that I have provided is applicable to England and Wales. Different arrangements apply to Scotland though the underlying principles are similar. The Government believes that 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>11 Jul 2000 : Column: 488W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>non-resident parents should pay maintenance for their children if they can afford to do so and we will continue to pursue non-resident parents who persistently seek to avoid their responsibilities.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency's policy is that, if necessary, it will use the powers given to it by Parliament to enforce payment of child maintenance. Where normal collection arrangements fail and arrears of child maintenance build up, the Agency will initiate enforcement action if the non-resident parent does not make an acceptable offer to pay. However, each case is considered on its merits and the Agency will take account of the likely effect of enforcement action on the welfare of any children involved.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The full range of powers available will be considered. Where an uncooperative non-resident parent is employed a deduction from earnings order can be imposed. This is an effective, value for money method of collecting maintenance and arrears without resorting to the court system. It is a criminal offence for an employer to fail to act on a deduction from earnings order. Where an employer does fail to act they may be prosecuted. During 1999-2000 the Agency prosecuted 5 such cases.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where a deduction from earnings order cannot be issued, e.g. the non-resident parent is self-employed, and no agreement can be reached to pay maintenance, a Liability Order is made. This means the debt is registered with the Magistrates Court and a County Court Judgement will then be considered making it difficult for a non-resident parent to obtain credit, mortgage, loans etc. During 1999-2000 Liability Orders were granted on 2,169 cases and County Court Judgements sought on 563 cases.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>By taking this action it is hoped that the non-resident parent will start to cooperate, however, if this proves ineffective, Bailiff action is taken to seize goods to the value of the debt or, alternatively, a Garnishee or Charging order is imposed. A Garnishee Order freezes the non-resident parent's bank account. A Charging order freezes the non-resident parent's property that could be sold, for example, a car or house that may be up for sale at the time of the order. During 1999-2000 the Agency applied for 130 Garnishee Orders, 69 Charging Orders and took Bailiff action on 1,916 cases.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The final sanction is committal to prison, although this does not discharge the debt. During 1999-2000 a total of 22 applications for committal to prison were made. Of these 18 were successful, 11 of which were suspended sentences.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>By making positive telephone or face to face contact with a non-resident parent early on in the assessment process the Agency aims to obtain full compliance and reduce the number of parents who refuse to cooperate. Non-resident parents are encouraged to make regular payments, preferably by direct debt, standing order or a deduction from earnings order.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government believes that child maintenance should not be seen as an optional expense to be paid or not as personal circumstances dictate. New legislation, which will support the Child Support Reforms means that maintenance assessments will be simpler to calculate and easier for both parents to understand. This should encourage more parents to co-operate. It will allow the Agency to use more of its resources to deal with those parents who refuse to pay their assessed liability. Additional penalties such as the removal of driving licences are also being considered, though the Agency's aim will remain to ensure the proper flow of maintenance without the use of penalties.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I hope this is helpful.</FONT></UL>

In the road haulage sector, we are committed to improving the efficiency of freight transport and logistic operations, and set out last year how we would achieve this in our Sustainable Distribution Strategy. The strategy sets out a wide range of measures, including, for instance, the dissemination of advice to hauliers through my Department's Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme about ways of reducing fuel costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Recommended procedures and protocols for monitoring ground and surface waters for evidence of contamination by leachate are set out in the Government's statutory guidance to the Environment Agency--Waste Management Papers 4 and 26. Operators of landfills must undertake such monitoring and report the results to the Agency on a regular basis. The Agency also undertakes its own monitoring as a check on operator performance. Extensive research has been conducted on landfill leachate and, although potentially polluting, it is not normally classed as toxic.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government have not made such assessments for individual sites. An assessment of the impact of an individual site is made when a development planning application is made.
<P>

<a name="00711w15.html_para2">The Government have published two relevant studies. "The Control of Noise at Surface Mineral Workings" was in 1990, and "The Environmental Effects of Traffic Associated with Minerals Working" in 1998. While they refer to surface mineral workings, the contents are applicable to landfilling. The Department issued in May 2000 a consultation draft of Mineral Planning Guidance Note 11, "Controlling and Mitigating the Environmental Effects of Minerals Extraction in England". This provides guidance on noise, with specific reference to the issue of waste disposal sites.

As we set out in "Tackling Congestion and Pollution", our first report under the 1998 Act, published in January, our targets and policies focus on improving the outcomes that matter to people, such as congestion, pollution and road safety, rather than national traffic volume figures.

These Inspectors also cover the rest of Lincolnshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. COMAH sites operated by BG Transco are inspected by a separate group of five Inspectors, also based at Sheffield, who inspect BG Transco sites throughout the north of England. Explosives sites subject to COMAH are inspected by three HM Explosives Inspectors who cover eastern and south east England.
<P>

<a name="00711w16.html_para1">All these Inspectors are able to call on the advice and assistance of other HSE inspectors to provide support on a range of specialist topics.
<P>

<a name="00711w16.html_para2">The enforcement of COMAH is undertaken by the Competent Authority (HSE and the Environment Agency). Therefore, Environment Agency Inspectors are also involved in the inspect of COMAH sites.

<a name="00711w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The question asks for data from 1974 to 2000. The Field Operations Directorate of HSE currently uses a computer data system introduced in 1996. The previous data system was in use from 1980 to 1995. The information requested is not kept in a format which allows the question to be answered. FOCUS is a dynamic record of clients and locations with which HSE has had recent and/or continuing contact. The following table gives the current number of open incumbent records categorised by role, e.g. employer, self-employed, sub-contractor etc.

 In December 1999, Freightliner Ltd. lodged an application with the Department's Freight Grants Unit for track access and freight facilities grants, to take effect on the expiry of the existing grant arrangements in May 2001. PricewaterhouseCoopers were appointed jointly by the Department and the shadow Strategic Rail Authority to advise on the application, and their report was received

 There are no such plans. The Health and Safety Commission is currently carrying out a review of the gas safety regime, and is likely to report to Ministers within the next few months with its conclusions and recommendations. One of the issues being examined in the review is whether the statutory registration scheme for gas installation businesses is still appropriate. The Commission has not yet formed a view on that question.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The report of the review is being published today. A copy is being placed in the House library.
<P>

<a name="00711w17.html_para1">The review has confirmed that ill-health retirement should be available to employees who are genuinely unable to remain in employment for health reasons. But it has found that the present levels of ill-health retirement in the public sector are higher than necessary and higher than in the private sector. Variations in rates between individual sectors, and between employers in the same sector, are also significant indicating that there is scope to bring rates down.
<P>

<a name="00711w17.html_para2">The review concluded that the rules and procedures governing the granting of ill-health retirements need to be tightened in a number of cases, and that action is needed to prevent its misuse and to expose the cost involved. It also concluded that many employers can help to reduce the number of such retirements by adopting best practice on workplace health.
<P>

<a name="00711w17.html_para3">The report sets out 36 recommendations for reducing the incidence of ill-health retirement across the public sector. Departments will draw up action plans for each sector implementing these recommendations. Targets will be set challenging individual employers with the highest rates to reduce these to match those of the best in their sector by 2005.

 When a company that is paying tax credits to one or more of its employees becomes insolvent, the Inland Revenue will pay the tax credits direct to the employee for the remainder of the tax credit award period. The system is designed to ensure that employees of the insolvent company continue to receive their tax credit payments on time.

 The next publication of crime statistics is due on July 18. As in January, an Annexe to the publication will give crime and detection figures for police Basic Command Units for six types of crime which are of particular public concern. But, for the first time, my Department will be publishing these crime figures in relation to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships. The partnership data will be published in 13 groups, or 'families', of partnerships. The families draw together areas with similar policing and crime reduction characteristics to assist comparison between the areas. There are 376 partnerships. The Home Office will today publish a Policing and Reducing Crime Unit Briefing Note to provide a description of how the family groups have been devised, which includes the list of the family groups. I have placed a copy of this briefing note in the Library.

 Kosovan Albanians who were evacuated to the United Kingdom on the Humanitarian Evacuation Programme between 25 April and 25 June 1999 or who were later evacuated on the medical evacuation programme were granted a maximum of 12 months leave to enter. They were eligible to claim social security benefits or to take employment during this period. They will continue to qualify for support (including accommodation) if they made an application for further exceptional leave before their original leave expired until 28 days after the decision to refuse their application. They are also eligible to work until an appeal has been dealt with. If they are granted further leave to remain they will be eligible for support during that extended period of leave.
<P>

<a name="00711w19.html_para0">The special grants we propose to pay to certain local authorities in England, towards expenditure incurred in 2000-01, are specified in Special Grant Report (No. 68) which was laid before the House on 6 July.

The arrangements which take effect between 24 July and 29 August will apply to all new asylum seekers in England and Wales who claim asylum on, or after, the relevant dates set out in the table (in-country applications in Scotland and Northern Ireland are already covered by the new arrangements). All asylum seekers who are currently being supported by local authority social services departments under the interim arrangements in Schedule 9 to the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 will continue to be so supported.
<P>

<a name="00711w19.html_para4">"Disbenefited cases" are those asylum seekers who, prior to 3 April 2000, were in receipt of social security benefits, but who on or after 25 September 2000 receive a first negative decision, who are thus no longer eligible for social security benefits, who go on to appeal and who continue to be eligible for support.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many asylum seekers have <i>(a)</i> been offered, <i>(b)</i> accepted and <i>(c)</i> refused an offer of accommodation by him under the support arrangements introduced on and after 1 April.  [130108]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The National Asylum Support Service began on 3 April 2000. The available information is that as at 3 July 2000 there had been 5,100 claims for support from asylum seekers. Not all claims for support will involve a request for accommodation. Of these claims, 2,190 were offered accommodation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the state of contract negotiations between the National Asylum Support Service and each of the regional consortiums.  [130113]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 As of 10 July, contracts have been exchanged with Scotland and the North-East. Negotiations with other consortia are ongoing and we hope that a number of areas will be signing up over the coming months. I am not prepared to give information about the current state of any of these negotiations, since to do so could harm the outcome of these negotiations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how may children of school age are <i>(a)</i> asylum seekers and <i>(b)</i> dependants of asylum seekers in the United Kingdom; how many of those children have been dispersed outside London and the South-East; and if he will make a statement.  [130109]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 In 1999, the United Kingdom received 3,349 applications for asylum from unaccompanied minors (aged under 18).

<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 London and the South-East have had to manage a disproportionate number of asylum seekers and there is a recognised need to disperse asylum seekers to suitable areas throughout the United Kingdom. National Asylum Support Service (NASS) has acquired some

<P><I>11 Jul 2000 : Column: 516W</I><P>
accommodation in Plymouth through the private sector who are contracted to provide various services, apart from accommodation. There is a "one stop shop" located in Plymouth. We are satisfied that adequate facilities and support infrastructure are available for asylum seekers in Plymouth and that there is no need to delay further placements.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w19.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Streeter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the negotiations to place asylum seekers in Plymouth and the extent to which he consulted the South West Consortium of local authorities.  [130119]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w19.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 We have made clear our intention to disperse asylum seekers throughout the United Kingdom. The placing of asylum seekers in Plymouth is part of that dispersal programme. As of 10 July, ten asylum seekers have been dispersed to Plymouth by the National Asylum Support Service. There is an established consultation process between NASS and the regional consortiums regarding dispersal and siting of cluster areas. NASS last wrote to the South West Consortium confirming that Plymouth remained a cluster area on 8 June. The consortium is also fully aware of the contractors within the area.
<P>

<a name="00711w19.html_para7">The Director of NASS has written to the Chief Executive of South Gloucestershire explaining the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of property in Plymouth and expressing regret that we were unable to consult in advance.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what arrangements have been made to put dispersed asylum seekers in contact with immigration and advisory services which offer free advice.  [129473]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w19.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Legal Services Commission provides funding, through contracts with quality-assured suppliers of legal services, for the provision of free legal advice and representation to those who are eligible. In addition, the voluntary sector is establishing "one stop shops" in each of the cluster areas where asylum seekers can obtain advice.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will supply immigration and advisory services that provide free advice with the names and addresses of dispersed asylum seekers.  [129472]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w19.html_spnew10"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 No. The routine disclosure of personal details of asylum seekers supported by the National Asylum Support Service to third parties would not be compatible with data protection legislation or our duty to confidentiality to asylum seekers.

<P><I>11 Jul 2000 : Column: 517W</I><P>
now 7369/1/00) is under discussion in the Europol Working Group. The Government's position is set out in an explanatory memorandum deposited with the scrutiny committees on 2 June, copies of which have been placed in the Library. We are negotiating the draft Recommendation on the basis that it is broadly acceptable. The Recommendation does not impose any obligations on the member states. Competent authorities in the United Kingdom would in general already adhere to the principles in the Recommendation in dealing with requests from Europol through the Europol National Unit. We consider that, while it will not always be appropriate for member states to inform Europol of the reasons for not agreeing to their request to conduct an investigation, it is good practice to do so wherever possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action he intends to take following the inquest into the death of Glen Howard; and if he will make a statement.  [129588]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service have now received a transcript of the inquest into the death of Glenn Howard. They will be reconsidering the case in light of all the evidence that was presented there and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specific details at this stage. However, the use of restraint tactics when dealing with mentally disordered persons is a matter which I understand the police are reviewing as part of the continual process of evaluating and improving training.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the Association of Chief Police Officers' decision to make its guidance on the use of CS spray available to interested parties; and if he will make a statement.  [129584]<P>

<a name="00711w20.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make it his policy that the planned research into the interaction of CS spray and anti- psychotic medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia will involve wide consultation with relevant service users, carers and voluntary organisations.  [129586]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 I am not aware of any research planned specifically on the interaction of CS spray and anti-psychotic medication, although the research we shall be carrying out at the recommendation of the Committee on Toxicity on the longer-term effects of CS spray may provide information on this subject.

<a name="00711w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 I agree with the Association of Chief Police Officer's (ACPO) recommendation that chief officers should consider drawing up local protocols with health authorities and social services departments on this matter.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w20.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Cox: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many police officers from the Metropolitan police left the service in the last 12 months; and what were the reasons given for leaving.  [129507]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Figures provided by the Metropolitan police show that in the 12 months from April 1999 to March 2000, 1,504 people ceased to serve as Metropolitan police officers. This equates to a turnover rate of 5.66 per cent.
<P>

<a name="00711w20.html_para4">Out of the total 554 officers retired on ordinary police pensions, 361 resigned, 285 were medically retired and 243 transferred to other forces. A further 61 officers left for other reasons, including dismissal and death in service.
<P>

<a name="00711w20.html_para5">I understand that concerns about quality of life and the costs associated with living in London have been reasons historically given by those resigning and transferring to other forces for their decisions. A new exit poll introduced by the Metropolitan police in April 2000 will give more detailed information for future years.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the average length of time was the Police Complaints Authority took to deal with complaints in the last 12 months; and what the PCA guidelines stipulate this should be.  [129464]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Police Complaints Authority (PCA) agreed targets for the completion of each stage of the complaints process in a joint statement of intent with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) in 1992. The PCA's performance against these targets is set out in its annual report.
<P>

<a name="00711w22.html_para0">In 1998-99, the last year for which figures are available, 63 per cent. of PCA supervised investigations were completed within the agreed target of 120 days. The PCA took an average of 47 days to complete its discipline review of completed investigations, against an agreed target of 28 days.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department under which European Union or Community instrument Her Majesty's Government <i>(a)</i> have agreed and <i>(b)</i> plan to agree the mutual recognition of court judgments among EU member states; if he will list each such document and when it (i) was published, (ii) was considered in Parliament and (iii) came into or is expected to come into force; and which bodies or persons the Government consulted before reaching such decisions.  [129753]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Action to follow up the conclusions of the Tampere European Council on mutual recognition of judicial decisions has not yet reached the stage of European Union or Community legislation. The French Presidency has however tabled a document in the Article 36 Committee, dated 26 June, (reference 9737/00) which outlines a programme of legislative measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters. The document has been deposited for scrutiny in both Houses. The Government intend to support work on the programme of measures, and will consult appropriate United Kingdom bodies including those concerned in implementing the proposals, before any legislation is adopted.

<P>
<a name="00711w22.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 14 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 626W, on immigration, if he will list those parts of European treaties coming into force subsequent to the passage of the Immigration Act 1971 which permit questioning, searching and detention on grounds of public policy through derogation from treaty provisions concerning freedom of movement and absence of internal frontiers within the European Union and Community.  [129754]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Under the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the European Union is subject to derogations on grounds of public policy, public security and public health. These limitations on the Treaty freedoms are allowed by Article 39(3) (as regards freedom of movement for workers), Article 46 (as regards 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jul 2000 : Column: 533W</I><P>
the right of establishment) and Article 55 (as regards the provision of services), and are also recognised by Article 18 (inserted by the Treaty on European Union).
<P>

<a name="00711w22.html_para1">The same limitations can be found in the secondary Community legislation on freedom of movement, including Directives 68/360/EEC, 73/148/EEC and 75/34/EEC. The use by member states of these derogations is subject to Directive 64/221/EEC on the co-ordination of special measures concerning the movement and residence of foreign nationals which are justified on the grounds of public policy, public security, or public health, extended by Directives 72/194/EEC and 75/35/EEC.
<P>

<a name="00711w22.html_para2">In order for Immigrations Officers to decide whether a person should be excluded on the grounds of public policy, public security or public health, Article 20(2)(e) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Order 1994 applies the powers to question, search and detain contained in Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 to EEA nationals.
<P>

<a name="00711w22.html_para3">In the case of the United Kingdom, the question of derogation from provision concerning the absence of internal frontiers within the EU does not arise, having regard to our special position on the maintenance of internal frontier controls.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO)/Local Government Association jointly issued a set of guidelines, "Missing from Care: Procedures and Practices in Caring for Missing Children" (1988), underlining the importance of close co-operation between police and social services when children go missing from care.
<P>

<a name="00711w22.html_para5">"Working Together to Safeguard Children" is a Department of Health document which has been prepared and issued jointly by the DOH, the Home Office and the Department of Education and Employment. It is addressed to those who work in the health and education services, the police, social services, the probation service, and those whose work brings them into contact with children and families. It is intended to provide a national framework within which agencies at a local level draw up and agree detailed ways of working together to promote children's welfare and to protect them from abuse and neglect and, in the most extreme cases, death.
<P>

<a name="00711w22.html_para6">Following publication of "Learning the Lessons--the Government's response to the Waterhouse Report", there is to be an inter-agency review of best practice in conducting complex abuse investigations. A Review Group is being established to take forward this work, bringing together representatives from the Home Office, Department of Health, Local Government Association, the Association of Directors of Social Services and the Association of Chief Police Officers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> the effectiveness and <i>(b)</i> the effect upon the haulage industry of the Carriers' Liability (Clandestine Entrants and Sale of Transporters) Regulations 2000.  [129797]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00711w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The civil penalty provisions of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 were introduced as recently as 3 April 2000. Provisional figures indicate that the number of illegal entrants detected in Kent since the introduction of the provisions has fallen by 25 per cent., and that the number detected nationally has fallen by about 22 per cent. Total penalties imposed up to 6 July 2000 amount to &#163;2,530,000.
<P>

<a name="00711w23.html_para0">There is now an obligation on lorry drivers to search their vehicles before they embark for the United Kingdom. A code of practice established in consultation with the industry protects drivers from the imposition of a civil penalty if they can show that they have complied with its terms.
