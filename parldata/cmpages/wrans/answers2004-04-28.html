<p><a name="40428w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 Between 1&nbsp;April 1999 and 31&nbsp;March 2004, some 1,135 formal complaints were submitted within the Army. As at 31&nbsp;March 2004, of the complaints submitted before 1&nbsp;April 2001, 18 cases are still unresolved.

<p><a name="40428w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 All complainants have the right to take their complaint, through a series of levels in the chain of command, to the Army Board (as the Defence Council). Officers have the further opportunity to petition the Crown.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w01.html_para1">
A relatively small number of redress cases remain unresolved after more than three years. This is usually because of the need to exchange detailed case papers with the complainant, prior to the redress being heard, or because the cases concern complex legal issues, which can take a considerable time to resolve. Additionally, if a complainant submits a case to an employment tribunal or civil court case it is normal practice for the Army to suspend its consideration until these bodies have reached a conclusion.

 In support of its strong and continuing commitment to meet its training needs in the most effective, efficient and economical manner, the Ministry of Defence has recently taken a major step in the Defence Training Rationalisation Programme by establishing six Defence Colleges for specialist skills training.

We are not aware of any delay in the payment of reservists&#039; basic military salary.

 Closure of the UK inshore bass fishery to commercial exploitation would have limited conservation benefits as the bass allowed to survive would simply become part of the winter offshore fishery. The International Council of Exploration of the Sea&#039;s assessment of bass stocks in EU waters in 2003 did not support such a closure, but recommended that fishing mortality should not be allowed to increase given the uncertainties in the assessment and the possible influence of climate change on the stock. This work also showed that landings in most inshore fisheries had remained buoyant.

<i>[holding answer 26&nbsp;April 2004]:</i> At present, such recycling capacity is extremely limited in the UK. There is a plant in the Midlands that recycles silver oxide batteries commonly used in watches and there are plans for a recycling plant in Scotland which would recycle Lithium-ion batteries, including the portable type. Currently, the Government are in discussions with stakeholders examining the possibility of setting up UK recycling capacity for zinc carbon and alkali manganese batteries, commonly found in portable radios and children&#039;s toys.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the implications of climate change for biodiversity in the United Kingdom and its surrounding waters over the next 50 years.  [165285]</p>








<p><a name="40428w04.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Department, along with the Devolved Administrations, statutory nature conservation agencies and non-governmental organisations, is contributing to an on-going research programme on the impacts of climate change on biodiversity in the UK and its surrounding waters. Results suggest that as climate changes, the distribution of species and the composition of habitats will change. With warmer temperatures, some northern species are likely to retreat, while southern species may be able to expand their ranges. At the same time, coastal habitats will be affected by rising sea levels. On land, movement of some species may be impeded by our fragmented landscapes, possibly leading to local extinctions. However, dispersal and movement of species within the marine environment is not hindered in this way and evidence from surveys of rocky shorelines shows that many species have already extended their range northwards over the past 20 to 30 years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w04.html_para4">
The key to understanding climate change impacts on biodiversity are long time series of data which enable the distinction of natural variability from local human impacts and longer term climatic trends. Within the UK Marine Monitoring Strategy we are making provisions for collection of time series data to enable better estimation of the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) if she will list the locations of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;land deemed by the relevant local authority to be in a condition causing or likely to cause (i) significant harm and (ii) pollution of controlled waters as defined by 78A(2) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;other contaminated land; what the size of each site is; what the nature of the contamination is in each case; and what steps (A) have been taken and (B) are planned to remedy any such contamination;  [165806]

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Apr 2004 : Column 1005W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>



<p>(3) if she will make a statement on steps <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;which have been taken and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;are being taken to tackle the problem of contaminated land.  [165808]</p>








<p><a name="40428w05.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 To help address the legacy of land contamination, the Government brought into force part IIA (&quot;contaminated land&quot;) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This placed local authorities under a statutory duty to inspect their areas to identify contaminated land as defined in the Act, and to secure its remediation, in accordance with the detailed provisions of the regime. They are required to take a strategic and prioritised approach to the duty of inspection. For certain sites, known as special sites, enforcement is by the Environment Agency. The regime came into effect in April 2000 in England and is described in DETR Circular 02/2000, &quot;Contaminated Land&quot;. In broad terms, the regime addresses unacceptable risk arising from land contamination in situations where other statutory regimes cannot be applied.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w05.html_para0">
The Department and the Environment Agency publish technical and other material to assist local authorities. Defra provides capital and revenue support to both LAs and the agency in connection with part IIA duties. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Apr 2004 : Column 1006W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
proposed updated guidance in connection with both planning and building control regimes, since these play a major part in addressing the legacy of land contamination. Urban regeneration initiatives, led by that Department, also help address land contamination, and tax incentives have been introduced.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w05.html_para1">
Progress is being made. The agency prepares periodic statutory reports on the state of contaminated land, the first of which was published in September 2002 and laid in the Library. As at 31&nbsp;March 2004, some 66 part IIA determinations had been recorded in England, as detailed in the following table. Some cases involve a number of determinations, and some involved both pollution of controlled waters and significant harm. The precise areas of individual sites, and planned measures, are not collected centrally, but size ranges are shown, together with the nature of the problem in each case.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w05.html_para2">
Under part IIA, remediation can be secured through voluntary action, in which case a remediation statement is produced, or through enforcement action, in which case a remediation notice is served on the appropriate persons. Details are placed on a public register kept by the authority. Research is under way to improve our knowledge of the progress being made outside the part IIA regime.

This exercise included fluoxetine, more commonly known under the trade name Prozac. A short, targeted monitoring programme was then set up for 12 pharmaceuticals. Fluoxetine was not included because no analytical method suitable for use on environmental samples existed and development of one would be difficult. The top ranked antidepressant was lofepramine and this was included in the monitoring survey. A method was not in existence and had to be developed. Lofepramine was not detected in any of the five sewage works effluents or receiving watercourses monitored. However, it does not necessarily follow that the same would be true for fluoxetine.

 The Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 gave powers to local authorities, allowing them to stop, search and seize vehicles suspected of fly-tipping. It also gave the Secretary of State the power to request fly-tipping data returns from waste collection authorities and the Environment Agency (the Agency). The national database, Flycapture, was launched on 5&nbsp;April 2004 for this purpose, and a notice in writing was issued to all waste collection authorities and the Agency.

<p><a name="40428w07.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 26&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> We have a series of actions programmed, as presented to the seventh meeting of the Hazardous Waste Forum, to ensure the smooth implementation of the Landfill and Hazardous Waste Directives, and, in particular, the ban on co-disposal. The impact of expected higher costs on disposal and treatment provides a greater incentive for waste minimisation at source, through source separation and segregation of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Future arisings of hazardous waste are therefore uncertain. In addition, higher costs of landfill will enable alternative treatments to be more economically viable, diverting hazardous waste from landfill. The Government and the Environment Agency are monitoring closely, through a range of measures, waste industry plans for the provision of treatment and disposal capacity, and the response of waste producers and will continue to do so. A number of possible response options exist, including those identified by the Forum, should these be necessary.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Apr 2004 : Column 1018W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Wednesday 31&nbsp;March 2004 and the Government position regarding the delay in publication was further clarified in a press release on 2&nbsp;April 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w07.html_para3">
During the consultation on the draft NAP, a number of issues were raised which Government wanted to take into account and consider in full. Some of these issues were complex and took considerable time to work through. It was therefore agreed to delay the submission of the NAP to the Commission by a few weeks to take account of the extra work.

The UK takes all EU responsibilities and deadlines seriously and is fully supportive of the EU ETS. We also have a duty to take full account of issues raised as a result of public consultation. We intend to submit the NAP to the Commission and publish it for further consultation by the end of April.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the incidence of oxygen-free zones in the oceans.  [165590]</p>








<p><a name="40428w07.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 A recent report by the United Nations Environment programme drew attention to a number of cases across the world where there are regular instances of oxygen deficiency, often caused by excessive inputs of nutrients from land based sources. This underlines the need for action to limit the input of nutrients, and the UK has supported the UNEP Global Plan of Action on land-based sources of pollution which is seeking to address this.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w07.html_para5">
There have been no cases of oxygen levels in UK coastal waters falling so low as a result of anthropogenic nutrient inputs as to be a cause for concern, e.g. through fish kills. Historically, there have been oxygen depletion problems affecting the passage of migratory fish in certain estuaries due to the direct discharge of sewage. The problems no longer exist due to the effective management of the discharges.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w07.html_para6">
There are some areas where nutrient levels are high as a result of anthropogenic nutrient inputs, and in a few cases this has resulted in undesirable changes to the water environment. We have taken action to reduce nutrient inputs in these cases, through improved treatment of sewage and through designating Nitrate Vulnerable Zones to control the use of fertilisers and slurry on farmland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w07.html_para7">
The Department is committed to take further action to address diffuse water pollution. Officials are undertaking a range of work to identify diffuse pollution problems and the best ways to tackle them across all activities and a formal consultation on a range of options to tackle water pollution from agriculture will be issued shortly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w07.html_para8">
In some places, for example systems with limited water exchange, it is natural for there to be areas where oxygen levels are low without anthropogenic nutrient input.

The Environment Agency and the Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) have recently commenced a research project to establish whether the actual use of agricultural pesticides, including insecticides, is causing unacceptable adverse effects on aquatic invertebrates and plants. The project will include intensive chemical and biological sampling of identified higher risk rivers and streams. This will provide field-based evidence on whether the way that plant protection products are currently approved and used is sufficiently protective of the aquatic environment.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what circumstances have led to an increase in use of the Thames Barrier; and whether this has been due to long-term changes in national phenomena.  [166014]</p>








<p><a name="40428w09.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Thames Barrier is closed to protect London from extreme high tidal waters generated by &#039;storm surge&#039; in the North Sea and to provide storage for extreme freshwater flows, which would threaten West London, and combinations of these phenomena.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w09.html_para6">
The Thames Barrier has been closed on 67 occasions in the last 10 years during the winter flood seasons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w09.html_para7">
Mean sea level and extreme tidal waters are expected to increase as the south east of England continues to fall relative to sea level. This was factored into the design of the barrier and closures for extreme high tides are within those expected when the barrier began operation. Closures due to extreme freshwater flows are harder to predict, but the winters of 2000&#150;01 and 2002&#150;03 were two of the wettest on record.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w09.html_para8">
It is too early to say whether these trends are anthropogenically driven or part of the natural variance. It is also possible that extreme freshwater flows have been affected by changes in the land use of the Thames catchment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w09.html_para9">
Sea level rise, tidal surge extremes, tidal propagation, wave driven storminess, freshwater flows and combinations of these phenomena are all expected to be affected by climate change. The uncertainty for the future flood regime is high and creates a challenge for the long term financial and environmental planning in the Thames Estuary.
</p>

The Environment Agency are aware of these challenges and are already two years into TE2100, a project that will deliver by 2008&#150;09 a flood risk management plan for the next 100 years.

 An independent review of the environmental and health effects of all waste management options for municipal solid waste and similar wastes is currently being prepared.

Emission standards, which seek to limit environmental and health impacts, apply to waste incinerators as they do to all energy from waste facilities, and are enforced by the Environment Agency. These are European wide discharge standards, which are equally applicable to old and new facilities. We are currently implementing the new Waste Incineration Directive (WID), which is an extremely tough directive that will further tighten the emissions standards in this country. The older generation of incinerators has now been replaced with newer, cleaner technology, and most municipal waste incinerators in this country already meet the new, tougher, standards.

 Hazardous waste is defined in the Hazardous Waste Directive as waste featuring on a list drawn up by the European Commission and which has one or more of the hazardous properties listed in Annex III to that Directive. Any other waste considered by a member state to display any of the properties listed in Annex III will also fall within this definition.

In England and Wales, hazardous waste is already defined in some legislation on the basis of the new European definition, for example, with respect to landfill.

 Much of the direct funding and assistance available through the Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) is directed at local authorities to help with the challenges of long-term progress in sustainable waste management, sufficient to meet the Article 5 targets of the EU Landfill Directive.

This would largely be spent through contracts with the private sector. Waste Private Finance Initiative (PFI) is a key part of this approach, and has been managed through WIP since 2003. Nine major waste PFI contracts have been let to private companies, and nine more local authorities have either had their proposals approved, or are in the process of applying for PFI credits.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are based on a 5&nbsp;per cent. sample at 31&nbsp;August each year (consistent with answers to your related questions 168152 and 168153).<br>

2. Figures are in thousands and rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>

3. Figures marked &quot;*&quot; are less than 500 and subject to a high degree of sampling variation.<br>

4. In the first two years of records, dates of birth for some recipients are not available.<br>

5. From November 2002, the methodology for producing these figures was changed to allow statistics to be published much sooner. This has resulted in a small increase in the reported caseload. This is because some cases which have actually terminated but have not yet been updated on the computer system are now included.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are consistent with outturn expenditure as published in the DWP benefit expenditure tables.<br>

2. Expenditure has been apportioned to age groups using age group data from the DLA Quarterly Statistical Enquiry which is based on a 5&nbsp;per cent. sample and therefore subject to a degree of sampling variation.<br>

3. In the first two years of records, dates of birth for some recipients are not available and this has resulted in some expenditure being grouped in the &#039;unknown&#039; age group.<br>

4. Figures are in 2004&#150;05 prices, calculated using the latest GDP deflator.<br>

5. Figures are rounded to the nearest million pounds.<br>

6. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

7. Figures for 2003&#150;04 are estimated outturn.<br>

2. Figures are in thousands and rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>

3. Figures marked &quot;*&quot; are less than 500 and subject to a high degree of sampling variation.<br>

4. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

5. From November 2002, the methodology for producing these figures was changed to allow statistics to be published much sooner. This has resulted in a small increase in the reported caseload. This is because some cases which have actually terminated but have not yet been updated on the computer system are now included.<br>

6. The &#039;Other&#039; category comprises of 25 conditions, including alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse has been listed separately, along with a breakdown of the conditions covered by the &#039;Other Mental Health Causes&#039; category to provide the equivalent breakdown to that provided in a related PQ, PQ 168151. PQ 168151 asks about mental illness which has been defined as psychosis, psychoneurosis, personality disorder or alcohol abuse<br>

Notes:<br>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) series.<br>

2. The data given are for 2002&#150;03, and are taken from the Family Resources Survey.<br>

3. Estimates are for Great Britain, and relate to both working-age and pensioner females.<br>

4. The estimates are based on sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that control for tenure, Council Tax band and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error, and to remaining variability in non-response, which is not corrected by the grossing regime.<br>

5. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household). Figures include the self-employed.<br>

6. Caution should be taken when interpreting results for gender groups using HBAI data. HBAI attempts to measure living standards as determined by household income; consequently both partners in a couple will appear at the same position in the income distribution.<br>

7. Ethnic categories published in HBAI 2002&#150;03 are more detailed; results in this answer have been aggregated because of the additional breakdown for gender.<br>

8. Figures for the &#039;Chinese, Mixed or Other&#039; group are based on a smaller sample and should only be used as a guide.<br>

 The UK Government are committed to assisting developing countries that export agricultural products, including cereals and animal fodder, through improving market access and reducing trade-distorting subsidies. DFID continues to work for a fair and equitable international trading system for all agricultural products. In particular, the 49 Least Developed Countries have unlimited duty free access to the EU market under the &#039;Everything But Arms&#039; agreement, except for rice, sugar and bananas, where limited arrangements apply until full liberalisation takes place. In addition, reforms to the EU&#039;s Common Agricultural Policy last June break the link between subsidy and production and hence reduce the damaging effect EU agricultural subsidies can have on developing countries&#039; producers.

In May 2002, the then Secretary of State for International Development raised the issues of coercive family planning programmes with her counterpart, and the Chinese authorities gave assurances that China was working towards relaxing the one-child policy. At that time Tibetans, as ethnic minorities, were allowed two children (rather than one) in urban areas, and there was legally no limit to the number of children herdsmen could have, although in practice many localities limited them to three.

<p><a name="40428w20.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 HIV/AIDS is a serious problem in Rwanda. Rwanda does not yet have the health infrastructure required to effectively deliver anti-retroviral therapy (ART) countrywide. But the Government have produced a comprehensive Strategic Framework for HIV/AIDS Control and all the major donors, including the Clinton Foundation, the Global Fund and the World Bank, who have committed to support it. This framework includes the progressive provision of ART to all who need it, through a strengthened network of health centres. Through a partnership between the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and five of the leading multinational pharmaceutical companies (including the Accelerating Access to HIV/AIDS Care, Treatment And Support Initiative), Rwanda is one of the countries that have reached agreement with manufacturers to significantly reduce drug prices in the context of its national HIV care and treatment plans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w20.html_para0">
The UK has committed &#163;25&nbsp;million through the International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa Programme (IPAA) to increase capacity in certain National HIV/AIDS Commissions, including Rwanda. DFID is currently considering whether we can build on this engagement, to ensure that Rwanda has the capacity to manage and direct the various programmes of support.

<a name="40428w20.html_para2">
I have had specific concern over the inequity in access to Anti-Retroviral Treatment between the defendants and the witnesses at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), which is considering crimes committed during the genocide. While defendants have access to health care including ART, witnesses generally do not. I wrote to the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, asking how the United Nations and the international community could work to resolve this inequity. The UN Secretary General replied, reporting that UNAIDS/WHO were identifying suitable health care providers, but seeking assistance from the UK to fund ART treatment for witnesses. I have responded positively and offered DFID assistance up to &#163;200,000 for health care (including ART) to be provided in Kigali for ICTR witnesses and others called by the tribunal.

<p><a name="40428w26.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Under EC law, the right of residence of certain categories of EU nationals (students, retired persons, and persons not falling within other categories under the EC residence directives) in a member state other than their member state of origin is dependent on their being able to support themselves. Where it is determined, on the facts and in accordance with the principles laid down in ECJ case-law, that persons in these categories are no longer able to support themselves they may be removed under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000/2326).

The draft Accession (Immigration and Worker Registration) Regulations 2004 thus ensure that a national of an Accession State (other than Cyprus or Malta) will only be able to reside in the United Kingdom while seeking work if he or she is self-sufficient.

<p><a name="40428w26.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 All employers in the United Kingdom are subject to the requirements of section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, the law on preventing illegal working. Any employer who is found to be employing an illegal worker and acting in contravention of their legal obligations under section 8 may face the possibility of a criminal charge and prosecution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w26.html_para5">
On 16&nbsp;March we announced changes, via secondary legislation, to strengthen the security of the document checks employers must carry out on prospective employees under section 8 to establish a statutory defence from prosecution.

<p>
<a name="40428w26.html_para6">
The changes will make it easier for compliant employers to ensure that their workforce can work in the UK, and for the Immigration Service to identify and prosecute the small minority of non-compliant employers who knowingly or negligently employ illegal workers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w26.html_para7">
The United Kingdom Immigration Service (UKIS) is responsible for monitoring and tackling illegal migrant working, and conducts regular enforcement and educational visits to employers on section 8. UKIS adopts an intelligence led approach to carrying out illegal working enforcement operations relating to gangmasters, as it does to employers in other sectors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w26.html_para8">
UKIS are fully involved in regional Operation Gangmaster and more generally have invested greater effort in illegal working enforcement activity, including where agricultural labour providers are concerned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w26.html_para9">
In terms of overall illegal working enforcement activity across all commercial sectors in the United Kingdom, there were 446 UKIS operations in 2003. In the first nine months of 2003, UKIS reported carrying out 16 operations specifically aimed at farms and packhouses where labour providers were involved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w26.html_para10">
By the beginning of 2004, UKIS had significantly increased activity in this area. In the four-month period from the beginning of November 2003 to the end of February 2004 UKIS reported carrying out 18 enforcement operations at farms and packhouses where labour providers were involved. These operations led to the removal of over a 100 immigration offenders. A further 11 operations involving labour providers are also scheduled or being planned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w26.html_para11">
Earlier this month, two major investigations involving the police supported by UKIS resulted in the conviction of gangmasters for very serious criminal offences. In March, six labour providers with the company Ultimate Source were convicted at Kings Lynn Crown court of various offences in connection with the supply of illegal workers. On 16&nbsp;March, the labour provider and his son were found guilty of charges including conspiracy to defraud and facilitating the entry of illegal immigrants into the UK. Both have been sentenced to seven years imprisonment.

Nevertheless, the potential for a rise in interest highlights the importance of full implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, both through postponing or abolishing the HIPC sunset clause to ensure that all eligible countries are able to benefit from debt relief, and through providing additional topping up relief wherever external factors&#151;such as a change in the interest environment&#151;have weakened a country&#039;s ability to service its debt, as was the case with Niger and Ethiopia recently.

 The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative is helping to provide a robust exit from unsustainable debt for the world&#039;s poorest countries, regardless of how that debt is accumulated. As part of this, the UK is calling for full topping-up to be provided when countries face exogenous shocks, in order to bring their debt ratios back to the agreed HIPC thresholds. The UK also supports consideration of extension of the Initiative so that countries yet to enter it are able to benefit from HIPC debt relief. A number of countries&#151;many of which are in the process of trying to exit conflict have yet to reach Decision Point and benefit from HIPC debt relief. This could deliver an extra US$30 billion in debt relief. HIPC debt relief is delivered through the Paris Club of official creditors.

<p><a name="40428w31.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40428w31.html_para0">
<i>Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin to Mr. Gregory Campbell, dated 26&nbsp;April 2004:</i>

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question about what plans he has to dual the A26 between Ballymoney and Coleraine; and what assessment he has made of recent figures on relevant traffic volumes. I have been asked to reply as these issues fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Roads Service currently has no plans to dual the A26 between Ballymoney and Coleraine. Information available from the Department for Transport in Great Britain concludes that a single carriageway trunk road will operate satisfactorily with traffic flows of up to 18,000 vehicles per day (vpd), with a maximum flow capacity of approximately 22,000 vpd. You will be aware from my letter dated 5&nbsp;April 2004, in response to your recent Parliamentary Question that traffic volumes for the A26 Ballymoney By-pass and the A26 Ballymoney to Coleraine fall below the 18,000 threshold.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">You will recall that during the preparation of the Major Works 10-Year Forward Planning Schedule (FPS), Roads Service wrote to all MPs, MEPs, MLAs and Councils, in October 2001, enclosing a list of road schemes that Roads Service intended to appraise for possible inclusion in the schedule. Priority was to be given to the Key Transport Corridors. Public representatives were asked to identiiy and justify any further schemes that they felt should be included in the list for appraisal.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">A scheme to dual the A26 from Glarryford to its A44 Ballycastle junction was included in the list however no reference was made to the dualling of the section between Ballymoney and Coleraine and no submissions in support of this scheme were received during this consultation exercise. Coleraine Borough Council did submit a request for the provision of additional overtaking opportunities on the A26 between the A44 Ballycastle junction and Coleraine and a scheme to provide these at three locations on the A26 between the junction with A44 and Ballymoney is included in the Emerging Regional Strategic Transport Network Transport Plan.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">I would reiterate the importance that Roads Service attaches to the A26 route, having designated it as a Key Transport Corridor within the Regional Development Strategy. Approximately &#163;1.2&nbsp;million has been spent over the past three years on the A26 between the A44 Ballycastle junction and Coleraine, introducing safety features including differential acceleration lanes, climbing lanes, speed limits, improved road markings and junction improvements. You will appreciate however, that public resources available for the roads programme are limited and that improvements must therefore be prioritised to ensure optimum value for money. Funding is finite and the number of worthwhile schemes competing for inclusion in the roads programme far exceeds the resources available to Roads Service for major schemes. It is, therefore, essential that we target the funding available on the most beneficial schemes for the country as a whole.</p>
</ul>
<p>





<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Apr 2004 : Column 1119W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Unfortunately, there are many major schemes with higher priority than the dualling of the A26 from Ballymoney to Coleraine, and it is anticipated that future improvements in the medium term are likely to include the provision of further overtaking opportunity schemes, such as climbing lanes or widened carriageway (2 + 1) schemes.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question (168192) about the state of Northern Ireland&#039;s water and sewage pipe infrastructure. I have been asked to reply as Chief Executive of the Water Service.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Water Service recently completed a comprehensive Asset Management Plan that identified the investment needs for all water and sewerage assets over a twenty year period. This required an assessment of the performance of the current assets and future performance requirements to meet more stringent and demanding statutory obligations and standards of service. The Plan concluded that some &#163;3 billion was required to improve the water and sewerage infrastructure over the 20 year period and approximately half of this was required to upgrade watermains and sewers.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The conclusion of the Asset Management Plan demonstrates that the overall condition of the water and sewerage infrastructure is not satisfactory. To address this Water Service is investing &#163;590&nbsp;million over the three year period to 2006 on water and sewage infrastructure as part of its programme to comply with EU directives, protect the environment and deliver customer service improvements. In addition, a substantial Public Private Partnership programme, involving a number of large wastewater and water treatment works valued at &#163;269&nbsp;million, is also being taken forward.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">A series of discrete watermain and sewerage networks rehabilitation studies are currently on-going to identify specific capital investment requirements to achieve compliance with EU directives and provide for existing and future demand for services. This approach will enable Water Service to target current and future capital investment on watermains and sewers to areas of greatest need, thereby attaining best value for money.</p>

If all billing authorities reduced their second homes discount to the minimum possible figure of 10&nbsp;per cent., we estimate that about &#163;65&nbsp;million could potentially be raised in England.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;The increase in the DEL resource budget in 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 compared to earlier years represents additional provisions for coal health claims. Part of the 2001&#150;02 increase resulted from change in the rate used for discounting liabilities from 6&nbsp;per cent. to 3.5&nbsp;per cent. From 2002&#150;03 these liabilities were reclassified as AME resource budget.<br>

2.&nbsp;The increase in the DEL resource budget from 2002&#150;03 represents increased spending on science as well as the regional development agencies. This trend continues into 2005&#150;06.<br>

3.&nbsp;The changes in the AME resource budget in 2001&#150;02, 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 mainly represent additional provisions for nuclear clean-up. Part of the 2001&#150;02 increase resulted from a change in the rate used for discounting liabilities from 6&nbsp;per cent. to 3.5&nbsp;per cent.<br>





4.&nbsp;Changes in provisions are, by their nature, unknown until they occur. Consequently the 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 AME resource budget figures are much lower.<br>

While the modelling used for the draft NAP indicated this approach would be equivalent to a 16.3 per cent. reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide over 1990 levels by 2010, the draft NAP indicated that emissions projections were continuing to be refined and the overall level of allowances to be included in the final NAP to be submitted to the Commission would be reviewed in the light of the latest projections.

<p><a name="40428w43.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The price of oil is just one of many factors that affects the level of business investment in the UK economy, and for most sectors is a less important factor than, for instance, the cost of capital or profitability. Moreover, although international oil prices have been relatively high over the last year, the fall in the value of the US dollar has helped the sterling oil price rise less steeply.

 Rights holders in the UK have a comprehensive range of civil remedies to pursue enforcement activity against businesses that make and use illegal copies of computer software. The EC Directive on enforcement of intellectual property rights will ensure that similar provision exists throughout the Community.

In this respect, the awareness-raising activity the Patent Office undertakes is valuable.
