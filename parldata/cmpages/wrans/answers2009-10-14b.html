 Foreign and Commonwealth Office Ministers expressed their concerns directly to the Indian government at the time the violence occurred in 2008. The Indian central government has since urged the state government of Orissa, who are responsible for law and order in the state under the Indian constitution, to prevent any further such incidents. It has also offered compensation and assistance to victims of communal violence in India, including in Orissa. The EU sent a fact-finding mission to Orissa in December 2008 (in which a member of our high commission participated). Our high commission subsequently discussed the findings of that visit with the Indian government in Delhi, and also raised the issue of minority rights in Orissa at the last EU-India Human Rights Dialogue meeting in February 2009.

 The supply of Tamifiu has been kept under review since the pandemic was declared and only very limited amounts have been available in the supply chain to fulfil private prescriptions. Bulk purchases by the United Kingdom and other Governments globally have meant that, to date, stocks available for supply against private prescriptions have been very limited. However, this situation is being kept under review and we are in regular touch with the manufacturer.</p>

 There are no plans to influence grant-giving policy in the way that is suggested. However, the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme makes grants equivalent to the VAT incurred in making repairs to places of worship that are listed buildings. Eligible works include repairs to bells, their ringing mechanisms and bell frames. Replacement of bells would only be considered under the scheme where they are damaged beyond economic repair. Another source of funding is the Heritage Lottery Fund that has awarded a total of &#163;12,148,814 to 237 projects that have involved the repair, conservation and restoration of church bells and bell-frames throughout the UK.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many households have been affected by the loss of ITV3 and ITV4 following the digital television re-tune of 30 September 2009; and who took the decision to remove ITV3 and ITV4 from the areas so affected. [292937]</p>

 We believe that up to 1 million households could have been affected by the loss of ITV3 and ITV4 after the digital television re-tune. In some cases the services will be restored at digital switchover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"><a name="91014w0007.htm_para0"><a name="09101517000873">The decision to move one ITV service was approved as part of The Television Multiplex Services (Reservation of Digital Capacity) Order 2008, which paved the way for new services, including up to four High Definition services, on Freeview. ITV plc decided which channel to move to meet this requirement. The company also decided for commercial reasons to move another ITV channel to make way for other future channel developments as part of the re-tune process.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what proportion of licence fee receipts has been used to facilitate digital switchover; what proportion of the digital switchover help scheme budget remains unspent; and if his Department will make an assessment of the merits of using money from that scheme to upgrade relay transmitters.

 &#163;803 million was set aside in the 2007-13 TV licence fee settlement to facilitate digital switchover. We expect there to be an under-spend on the &#163;603 million provided for the Digital Switchover Help Scheme but it is too early to estimate the level of under-spend with any precision. However, as set out in the Digital Britain White Paper, a number of ways the under-spend might be redeployed have been identified. These include contributing to the roll-out of universal broadband; the maintenance of plurality of news in the nations, locally and in the regions; and the roll out of Digital Audio Broadcasting. There are no plans to use the under-spend to increase the coverage of the three commercial digital terrestrial television multiplexes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_416"><a name="91014w0007.htm_para1"><a name="09101517000876">There is a licence requirement that the three Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) digital multiplexes, which carry the public service broadcasting channels, should reach 98.5 per cent. of UK households after Digital Switchover. Since the national re-tune, ITV3 and ITV4, which are not PSB channels, have been carried on commercial multiplexes where the licence post-Switchover requirement is that 90 per cent. of household coverage is achieved. Any decision to build out beyond 90 per cent. coverage would be a commercial decision for the multiplex operators.</p>

 The Television Multiplex Services (Reservation of Digital Capacity) Order 2008 required the transfer of one non-public service channel operated by Channel 3 license holders from a public service broadcasting (PSB) multiplex to a commercial multiplex. The aim of this measure was to facilitate the transfer of Five, a PSB channel, to a PSB multiplex in order to ensure universal coverage of Five , equivalent to the other public service channels at switchover, as well as further developments of the digital terrestrial television platform, including the introduction of high definition services.</p>

Over three years, the programme will enable 900,000 children and young people to take part in 10-week taster sessions in sports and aims to get 300,000 participants to join clubs and continue with sport beyond those sessions. Additionally, one of Sport England's strategic targets is to reduce the drop-off among 16 to 18-year-olds in nine key sports. This target will be measured by the Active People survey and is based on reducing the gap between 16 and 18 year old participation by 25 per cent. The national target is therefore to increase overall participation in the nine drop-off sports among 18-year-olds to 31 per cent.</p>

If this level of overall participation in the nine drop-off sports were maintained until the end of the current strategy period then the participation figures are expected to reach the target of 31 per cent.</p>

The analysis of mammal data from this annual survey is funded by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee as part of its surveillance programme. It provides an index of bag density for this species at a UK, country and regional scale and can be used to indicate what the population trend might be. The gamebag data for foxes over the last 10 years fluctuates, but the overall trend appears to be stable or slightly increasing.</p>

 The distribution of formula grant to local authorities in England takes account of the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the authority, together with its relative ability to raise council tax, expressed in terms of the council tax base. We then ensure that every authority receives at least a minimum percentage increase (the &#145;floor&#146;) year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. In order to pay for the cost of the floor, we scale back the increase in grant above the floor for other authorities.</p>

This is then increased annually by the Secretary of State&#146;s estimate of the average annual increase in the tax base for the authority between 10 October 2005 and 8 October 2007.</p>

<i> [holding answer 12 October 2009]: </i>Over &#163;720 million of the &#163;750 million within the Strategic Investment Fund has already been allocated, or is earmarked for specific projects and investments. The SIF is not a fund that is open directly to companies. It is a resource that the Government are using to increase investment through existing measures&#151;like collaborative Research and Development grants, Launch Investment for aerospace and regional Grants for Business Investment&#151;as well as new measures such as the UK Innovation Investment Fund. Our extra support for business is delivered through these measures, not directly from the SIF. Businesses do not therefore make applications for funding from the SIF, nor do they receive funding directly from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_514"><a name="91014w0018.htm_para13"><a name="09101537000578">We expect to spend about &#163;200 million of the SIF by the end of this current financial year. By way of example of the projects supported, in the area of business innovation, the Technology Strategy Board has used &#163;50 million of additional funding from the SIF to expand the scale of its ambition for a number of activities. For example, funding from the SIF, supplemented by its core funding, has been committed to projects funded under the &#163;25 million Low Carbon Vehicle demonstrator programme. Calls worth &#163;6 million for research have also recently opened in the area of &#145;Regenerative Medicine&#146;, &#145;High Value Manufacturing&#146; and &#145;Enabling Technologies for the Internet, Applications and Services&#146; utilising SIF funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_528"><a name="91014w0020.htm_para0"><a name="09101537000880">The revenue per pupil figures shown in the following table are taken from the new Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG). They are not comparable with those for the years 2004-05 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_529"><a name="91014w0020.htm_para1"><a name="09101537000881">The 2004-05 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_530"><a name="91014w0020.htm_para2"><a name="09101537000882">To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described above this does not represent the totality of &#145;education&#146; funding in that year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_531"><a name="91014w0020.htm_para3"><a name="09101537000883">The per pupil revenue funding figures for years 2005-06 (baseline) to 2008-09 for each London local authority are provided in the following table. As the DSG is a mechanism for distributing funding, a split between primary and secondary schools is not available.</p>

(50.3 Mt CO2) since 1990, and by 1.6 per cent. (9 Mt CO2) since 1997. CO2 is the main greenhouse gas, accounting for 85.3 per cent. of total UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2007.</p>
