 Based on soil carbon measurements carried out in England and Wales between 1978 and 2002, we estimate that on average 4.4 million tonnes of carbon has been lost from the top 15 cm of soil each year. The rate of loss in 2005 is likely to be at about the same level. The actual amounts will vary between soil types and land management practices, and recent evidence suggests that carbon is increasing in some soils. The cause of this loss, and whether carbon has been lost to the atmosphere or dissolved in water and incorporated in other sediments, or transported to lower depths, is not yet fully understood and Defra has therefore commissioned further research.

<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51018w02.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The UK Emissions Trading Scheme was launched in April 2002 and runs for five years. 31 Direct Participants (DPs) entered the Scheme by bidding annual, cumulative emissions reductions targets set against a 1998&#150;2000 baseline. At the start of the Scheme the participants committed to deliver 3.96 million tonnes CO <sub>2</sub>  equivalent (tCO <sub>2</sub> e) in emissions reductions by the end of the Scheme (2006). To date, DPs have exceeded targets, and the Scheme has delivered additional emissions reductions of 5.9million tonnes CO <sub>2</sub> e. In addition, six leading companies restated their commitment to the Scheme in November 2004 by offering an additional 8.9 million tCO <sub>2</sub> e emissions reductions.

In terms of the Scheme&#039;s annual progress, a reduction of 4.6 million tCO <sub>2</sub> e took place in 2002. Over the first two years (2002 and 2003) the Scheme delivered emissions reductions of almost 5.2 million tCO <sub>2</sub> e. Over the first three years (2002, 2003 and 2004), the Scheme delivered emissions reductions totalling 5.9 million tCO <sub>2</sub> e.

 Assessment of the possibility of cross-breeding (hybridisation) between a genetically modified (GM) plant and any wild relatives is a key aspect of the risk assessment carried out prior to any decision on the release or marketing of a GM plant. The capacity for cross-breeding (hybridisation) to occur between oilseed rape and a small number of sexually compatible wild species in the wild in Europe is well known and well documented. The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment has given advice on this matter. The likelihood of hybridisation occurring and the resulting impact on the environment of such events were part of the assessments for the types of oil seed rape currently approved in the European Union.

 Section 96 of the Police Act 1996 places a duty on police authorities to make arrangements for obtaining the views of people in the force area about matters concerning the policing of the area. The Act does not specify that this duty should be fulfilled through the establishment of Police Community Consultative Groups which have no formal status in statute. The White Paper &#039;Building Communities, Beating Crime&#151;A better police service for the 21stcentury&#039; sets out the Government&#039;s proposals for the police and their partners to engage more effectively with local communities. Moving beyond reliance on public meetings as a sole form of engagement is a key aim of the Government&#039;s reforms.

<a name="stpa_56">For council tax, it is usual to quote the average Band D figure for a 2-adult household when making comparisons over time. Average business rate figures are not routinely quoted, however, given the very wide variations in the rateable value of each property, and hence in the average rate bill.

 The First Secretary of State does not examine each decision in terms of national policy. It is the responsibility of the Minerals Planning Authorities to consider and determine each application on its merits, within the context provided by national, regional and local planning policies, including guidance contained in MPG3. If, following a refusal of planning permission, an applicant feels that policies have not been complied with, without good reason, an appeal may be lodged and will be considered by an independent planning inspector.

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="51018w09.html_spnew6"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 On 5 October the Government made representations to the Secretary of the Panel which will hold an examination into the draft Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS) for the North East of England. It indicated that since policy 45 on opencast coal applied a double test of environmental acceptability and a requirement to yield local community benefits, it conflicted with Minerals Planning Guidance note 3. The representation indicated the Government&#039;s view that a case has not been made for this departure from national policy and a regionally specific policy was therefore not justified in the RSS. The examination in public into the draft RSS, which is due to be held in spring next year, will provide an opportunity for the discussion and testing of matters selected by the panel following their consideration of all the representations made.

<p><a name="st_87"><a name="51018w09.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 No. The allocation of money to local authorities for 2005&#150;06 was announced through the local government finance settlement in February and will not be affected by increased take-up of small business rate relief. On the basis of research conducted before the relief scheme came into effect, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects that the amount of relief paid by local authorities on a national basis will be balanced by an amount raised from those businesses not eligible for the relief. However, if the actual total differs from these estimates, the Secretary of State has the power to adjust the small business non-domestic rating multiplier to address any imbalance.

 Sugar accounted for about 7.5 per cent. of Swaziland&#039;s exports in 2003, about a third of which went to the European Union (EU). Changes to the EU regime, with exports to the EU at a lower price, could lead to a reduction in export earnings since the EU offers a higher price for Swaziland&#039;s sugar than other markets.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51018w15.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_105">Recent research indicates, however, that if Swaziland implements planned reforms of its sugar industry and secures unlimited access to the EU market through the proposed Southern African Development Community (SADC) Economic Partnership Agreement, then there should be positive impact on production levels, export earnings and employment. This is in contrast to the possible negative impact in most other African, Caribbean and Pacific Countries (ACP) Sugar Protocol countries. If Swaziland does not secure unlimited access then industry revenue and export earnings would fall from present levels.

 We understand that Rwanda has not granted asylum to Laurent Nkunda.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51018w19.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_131">This is achieved in three ways. Firstly, through UK-based professional training of African officers. Secondly, through four permanently deployed teams training Africans for Peace Support operations, including specific pre-deployment training. These teams are the British Peace Support Team in Kenya, the British Peace Support Team in South Africa, the British Defence Assistance Team in Nigeria, the British Military Assistance and Advisory Team in Ghana and the UK element of the International Military and Advisory Team in Sierra Leone. Thirdly, through our direct support to international training centres in Africa. Examples are the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre in Ghana, the Peace Support Training Centre in Kenya, the Tactical Peace Support Training Centre in Bloemfontein, South Africa and the Jaji Peacekeeping Training Wing in Nigeria. Helping to build such training centres as well as training the trainers has a major multiplier effect.

 I first became aware in early summer 2005 of reports suggesting that military equipment originating in Iran may have been used against British soldiers in Southern Iraq. New types of explosive devices are being used&#151;not just against British Forces, but elsewhere in Iraq&#151;and the nature of those devices suggests a connection with Lebanese Hezbollah, which is supported by Iran. We cannot, however be certain of this at the present time, and while we continue to investigate the matter, we will continue to stress to the Iranian authorities the need for non-interference in the internal affairs of Iraq.

 Any request from a Member of Parliament to visit a Defence establishment is considered on a case by case basis, taking into account the circumstances of the request. These include, for instance, the timing of the visit, practical issues, the effect on operations and security considerations. Members are not required to hold a security clearance when visiting departmental sites; however, the principle of the need to know applies to the protection of, and access to, defence sites and other sensitive Government assets. Visits are at the discretion of Ministers and, where possible, Members are afforded briefings up to the level of RESTRICTED when visiting MOD establishments. This is a facility MOD Ministers have provided to allow MPs a greater insight into defence issues and to allow them better to serve their constituents.

 Information is not available in the requested format. Revenue allocations are made to primary care trusts (PCTs) based on the relative needs of their populations. It is for PCTs to determine how to use the funding allocated to them to commission services to meet the health care needs of their local populations including mental health services. In the financial year in which the national service framework for mental health was published, 1999&#150;2000, reported gross expenditure on mental health services as part of the hospital and community health services (HCHS) budget was &#163;4,067 million. A further &#163;696 million was spent as part of the personal social services (PSS) budget. By 2003&#150;04, HCHS expenditure on mental health had risen to &#163;5,088 million and PSS expenditure to &#163;944 million. These figures are in 2003&#150;04 prices and they do not include spending on people with mental health problems seen solely in primary care.

 The Department is continuing to implement the national mental health workforce strategy (2004) in order to increase the numbers of staff working in mental health settings and develop their skills further.

<a name="51018w24.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_157">The national service framework for mental health (1999) and the mental health policy implementation guide on adult acute inpatient care (2002) requires a flexible range of appropriate therapeutic and recreational resources and activities to be available in mental health in-patient settings. The latter requires the creation and maintenance of a therapeutic activity milieu to include evening and weekend activities and opportunities both on and off the ward which may include educational, social, daily living, artistic, recreational and leisure activities. The national minimum standards for general adult services in psychiatric intensive care units and low secure environments (2002) requires all patients to have access to fresh air and secure external space and space for regular exercise with appropriate supervision.

<sup>(14)</sup>The cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) for the years 1997 to 2000, and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) for2001 onwards. The codes used are listed:<br>

Malignant neoplasm of trachea, bronchus and lung&#151;ICD-9 162; ICD-10 C33-C34;<br>

<sup>(15)</sup>Figures are based on deaths occurring in each calendar year.<br>

<sup>(16)</sup>The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 means that data for lung cancer are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. The data should therefore be interpreted with caution. The effect of the change in classification in 2001 on deaths from cancer by site is described in an article published in August 2004.<sup>(17)</sup> <br>

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what percentage of the UK workforce was accounted for by the manufacturing sector in each year since 1996; and if he will make a statement.  [18552]</p>








<p><a name="st_263"><a name="51018w27.html_spnew1"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 Since 1996 the number of workforce jobs has increased by over 2.5 million or 9.2 per cent. These gains have been achieved despite a fall in manufacturing jobs over this period of over 1 million, which accounted for 16 per cent. of total jobs in 1996 and 11.2 per cent. in 2005. The decline in the manufacturing workforce is more than balanced by rises in other sectors. Falling manufacturing employment is a common feature across all advanced economies, with the share of manufacturing employment falling in all G7 countries since 1996 with the exception only of Canada.

The recent rise in births reflects a rise in fertility rates since 2001 but it is not known yet whether this is the start of a sustained rise.

 It is open to local authorities and schools to use whichever strategy they feel appropriate to meet the learning needs of a child with dyslexia. The Department commissioned research, published in 2002, into the effectiveness of intervention schemes for children with literacy difficulties. The research included a number of schemes which make reference to children with dyslexia including Reading Intervention (formerly Cumbria Reading with Phonology Project). The successful interventions readily available to schools were 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Oct 2005 : Column 930W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="stpa_201">The Department has asked Jim Rose, former HMI Director of Inspection at Ofsted, to undertake a review to advise on best practice in teaching early reading, including the role played by synthetic phonics, and the range of provision necessary to support children who have fallen behind in literacy to catch up with their peers. This advice will inform our work to renew the National Literacy Framework for Teaching to ensure that it reflects the most recent and relevant research and evidence for all learners. The review will also inform the work of the new Early Development and Learning Framework which, together with the renewed Literacy Framework, will help ensure that there is a coherent progression path in early literacy for all learners.

 The Department ceased sending publications automatically to schools in England on a phased basis between April and December 2004. The service to Northamptonshire was discontinued in October 2004. Our detailed research showed that a significant number of schools wanted greater freedom to choose the publications they wanted, when they wanted them and to be able to order paper copies in the multiples they require. We have given schools this choice by introducing an online ordering system and fortnightly email service, notifying schools of new and important publications. This puts schools in control of what they receive and when they receive it.

 The exam regulators&#039; code of practice requires that candidates&#039; work should be marked by trained examiners with appropriate subject experience. The regulatory authorities have never specified a teaching experience requirement for examiners and markers, although the awarding bodies may set a requirement when they recruit staff. The awarding bodies responsible for GCSE and A level qualifications have assured the regulators that they followed the code of practice during the 2005 summer exam series. No data is available on the total number of markers who were not current or former teachers, though the number is believed to be very small, and any such markers would have received appropriate training and have their performance monitored. Through the exams modernisation programme, a significant number of new examiners have been recruited over the last year, tackling shortages of examiners in almost all subjects.

<i>[holding answer 13 October 2005]:</i> The Department offers incentives to schools to achieve excellence in a range of ways. Participation in the specialist schools programme rewards schools for reaching and maintaining rigorous standards. This year we have offered additional opportunities for high-performing specialist schools to take on leading roles. Other examples of how schools are recognised for their excellence include the National Healthy School Programme, which recognises schools that meet standards in four key areas supporting children&#039;s health and learning, and Artsmark, which recognises, promotes and disseminates good practice in arts education provision. The value added indicator in the Achievement and Attainment tables is also an important way of recognising the progress that pupils have made between key stages.

 The Government&#039;s vision for all schools to provide a core offer of extended services is a challenging one and our success will depend upon 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Oct 2005 : Column 934W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
effective partnerships with the private and voluntary sectors. The National Remodelling Team, through its cultural change programme, is encouraging schools and local authorities to work with existing and new providers in the voluntary and private sectors and is offering support to help them do so. This close working will provide a clear understanding of the role of such organisations in providing extended services at the local and national level. The monitoring strategy we are developing with the NRT will also look at the involvement of the private and voluntary sector in developing extended services.

<p><a name="st_304"><a name="51018w32.html_spnew2"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 In March 2005 the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced a &#163;115 million Boost for Modern Foreign Languages&quot;, providing support for language teaching and learning for this and the next 2 years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51018w32.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_204">For primary schools the funding will provide continuing support for initial and existing teacher training as well as training for support staff. To date we have trained 1,200 new primary teachers with a specialism in languages. Next month we will publish in hard copy and online our Key Stage 2 Framework for Languages, which sets out learning objectives for the four years of Key Stage 2. It will be supported by training, guidance and a planning tool.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Oct 2005 : Column 935W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51018w32.html_para1">
The funding will support new approaches for teaching and learning for 11&#150;18 year olds, including alternative qualifications and vocational options at Key Stage 4 which will provide more flexibility for pupils in their studies. We have expanded the list of qualifications that count towards performance table scores to include more language qualifications.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51018w32.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_205">The funding will also allow language colleges to extend the role they play in supporting local primary and secondary schools in delivering language programmes. Last month the new languages recognition scheme, the Languages Ladder, became available nationally. The scheme can be used by learners of all ages and is available in eight languages. The scheme differs from existing approaches to assessment in that there are separate qualifications in each language for reading, writing, listening and speaking. To date more than 250 centres&#151;including Local Authorities and Specialist Language Colleges&#151;have registered to take part in the scheme.

<p><a name="st_305"><a name="51018w32.html_spnew3"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The decision to make languages at Key Stage 4 an entitlement subject from September 2004 was taken following national consultation on the 14&#150;19 &#039;extending opportunities, raising standards&#039; Green Paper in 2002. Since that date, no further research has been commissioned by the Department. However, research undertaken by CILT&#151;The National Centre for Languages in 2004 showed that 30 per cent. of state schools maintained languages as a compulsory subject at age 14, in addition to the 224 Specialist Language Colleges where languages are a compulsory subject.

 Qualifications relating to food preparation and cooking are developed in response to employers needs, and at this point most employers do not want nutrition as a mandatory element, although such a unit is currently available as an option. However, our recent work on improving school meals has shown that it is essential that all school catering staff have the training they need to be able to provide healthy meals for school children. That is why we worked with People 1st (the Sector Skills Council for the hospitality industry) and the Food Standards Agency to develop a level 1 vocationally related qualification in providing a healthier school meals service. The aim of the VRQ is to give school cooks and caterers the basic knowledge and skills to deliver a healthier meals service. It has been specifically designed for staff involved in the preparation and service of school meals. It will enable school caterers to improve pupil nutritional intake from all food provided by the school meals service and know how to market and promote healthier choices to pupils.

 Devolved formula capital is allocated by national formula to all maintained schools in England so that they can invest in their local priorities.

By 2007&#150;08, these amounts increase to &#163;34,000 and &#163;113,000 respectively. Guidance on this funding allows schools to roll over this funding for up to three years to enable larger projects to be funded. I do not intend to extend this roll-over period. We should not deliver money too far ahead of use. Where schools have priority needs which exceed their three year allocations, they should approach their local authority for additional funding from the capital of over &#163;2 billion each year which we provide. In these times of high construction inflation, investment should be made as early as possible. This will also mean that children will benefit as early as possible from the investment.

<a name="stpa_234">The high pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 strain virus has been confirmed in both Turkey and Romania and all imports of poultry, poultry meat and products into the EU from Turkey and Romania have ceased. The EU agreed on 14 October that measures should be taken to reduce the risk of avian influenza being transmitted from wild birds to poultry and to ensure their early detection systems are effective. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) is considering with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) what further action may be necessary to implement these requirements.

<a name="stpa_235">DARD has put in place a range of precautionary measures to address the risk of avian influenza entering Northern Ireland and to stop it spreading. Advice regarding biosecurity has recently been re-issued to the poultry industry and is available on the DARD website. An avian influenza survey is being carried out this autumn for the third year in succession on certain types of poultry, and wild bird surveillance is also being

<a name="stpa_236">There is close co-operation between relevant Departments to ensure a joined-up approach to the threat of avian influenza including in respect of the implications for public health. Officials are also working closely with their counterparts from the Department of Agriculture and Food in the Republic of Ireland in relation to avian influenza, which is of mutual interest in the context of the island of Ireland.

<a name="stpa_237">DARD has a contingency plan in place, which has been approved by the EU, to ensure that any outbreak of avian influenza is dealt with quickly and effectively. This plan is continually being reviewed and updated, and has been tested on two occasions in recent weeks.

1.MRSA patient episodes &#039;(MRSA PE) is defined as the total number of patients from whom blood cultureset(s) collected during the quarter grew MRS A. If repeat specimens were collected from a single patient, and the patient was considered to have had two episodes of bacteraemia, then they should be counted as two patients. As an arbitrary measure, if positive blood culture sets are collected more than 14 days apart, they should be considered as reflecting different episodes.<br>

2.Please note that it is not possible to state how many of these patients with MRS A positive blood cultures acquired their infection in hospital. Some will have been acquired in hospital but others will have acquired infection before admission to hospital, either in the community, or in another healthcare institution.<br>

3.Reports of patient episodes from a Trust may relate to patients who became infected in, and were reported by, another Trust. Patients whose infections were acquired in one hospital, and were subsequently transferred to another hospital, either within the same Trust or to another Trust, may have been counted more than once.<br>

4.Many confounding factors will influence numbers within Trusts. For instance, Trusts with different clinical mixes and specialties will have different numbers of patients at high risk of MRSA infections. For example, a hospital with a specialised renal unit would treat high numbers of patients who are at increased risk of infection and re-infection.<br>

 The fee that is payable to the magistrates court upon lodging an appeal, under schedule 6 of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980, is &#163;23.50 inclusive. I do not believe that this is prohibitively high. Occasionally, additional costs may be awarded against an appellant at the magistrate&#039;s discretion if an appeal is considered vexatious or frivolous. The advice of the Magistrates Association and the Justices Clerks Society is that the awarding of costs for a licensing appeal should be an exception and not a rule. We would therefore not expect residents who are appealing to be penalised.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will take steps to ensure that residents appealing the award of a late licence to a nearby establishment under the Licensing Act 2003 will not incur legal costs if their appeal is lost.  [19067]</p>








<p><a name="st_410"><a name="51018w43.html_spnew9"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 A resident wishing to appeal against the decision to grant an extension under the Licensing Act 2003 has to pay a procedural fee of &#163;23.50 in total. This is the usual payment required by the courts to cover costs incurred issuing and delivering a summons of complaint.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51018w43.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_255">The awarding of costs is a matter for the courts. The advice of the Magistrates Association and the Justices Clerks Society is that the awarding of costs for a licensing appeal should be an exception and not a rule. I would therefore not expect residents who are appealing to be penalised.

<p><a name="st_411"><a name="51018w43.html_spnew10"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 The Guidance issued by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, to licensing authorities, under section 182 of the Licensing Act 2003, makes it clear that the cumulative impact of licensed premises on the promotion of the licensing objectives is a proper matter for a licensing authority to consider in developing its licensing policy statement. The guidance sets out how the licensing authority can consider adopting a special policy on cumulative impact. It also states that the effect of such a policy is to create a rebuttable presumption that applications for new premises licences or club premises certificates or material variations (which could include longer opening hours) will normally be refused, if relevant representations to that effect are received. The onus would be on the applicant to demonstrate that the operation of the premises involved will not add to the cumulative impact already being experienced.

 Information on the number of objections there have been from local residents to applications for premises licences or variations under the Licensing Act 2003 is not held centrally but can be obtained from local authority licensing authorities. From our latest survey of a sample of licensing authorities we estimate that a quarter of applications to vary, or new premises licence applications, have attracted representations from local residents.

 Information on the number of licensing appeals that have been heard by magistrates courts under the Licensing Act 2003 is not held centrally but can be obtained from local magistrates courts or from licensing authorities. The transitional period under the 2003 Act is only part way through and it is too early to know exactly how many cases will go to appeal. However, from our latest survey of a sample of licensing authorities, the initial evidence is that the vast majority of applications are being resolved at hearings or earlier.
