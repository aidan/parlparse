To ask the President of the Council what plans she has to set up a unit to co-ordinate contacts between the business sector and Government Departments.  [122225]

<P>
<a name="00511w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 Following discussions with the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, I have set up a new Business Co-ordination unit within my Department. It will work with the DTI and Treasury to co-ordinate contacts across other Government Departments with the business community.
<P>

<a name="00511w01.html_para0">The Government have always been committed to maintaining good channels of communication between themselves and the business community, and this unit will make further contributions to that work.
<P>

<a name="00511w01.html_para1">I have been asked to take on this role by the Prime Minister because of my role as cross-Government spokesperson and my experience of leading initiatives which cut across the whole of Whitehall. I will be working closely with my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00511w01.html_wqn1"><B> Barbara Follett: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what was the overall level of sickness absence in the Civil Service in 1998.  [122148]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00511w01.html_spnew1"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 The report 'Analysis of Sickness Absence in the Civil Service 1998' prepared for my Department by BMI Health Services Ltd. shows that when the same methodology as in previous years was applied the average level of sickness absence was 9.8 days per staff year. This compares with a figure of 10.1 days for 1997. Calculated on the basis of absence per person, the figure for the Civil Service was 8.4 days. The report contains a comprehensive analysis of the 1998 figures.
<P>

<a name="00511w01.html_para2">In tandem with the preparation of that report, Departments and agencies have separately been undertaking audits of their monitoring systems as recommended in the July 1998 report 'Managing Attendance in the Public Sector'. In some cases these audits have revealed an element of under recording. The BMI report also contains figures reworked to reflect the audit findings, and these show that the average figure 



<P>
<P><I>11 May 2000 : Column: 434W</I><P>
for sickness absence in 1998 was 10.3 days per staff year. These revised figures came too late and in insufficient detail for them to be taken into account in the report's data analysis.
<P>

<a name="00511w01.html_para3">My Department is continuing to work with other Departments and agencies as they take forward their plans to reduce sickness absence. Overall the Civil Service has been targeted to reduce sickness absence by 20 per cent. for 2001 and 30 per cent. for 2003 against the 1998 baseline.
<P>

<a name="00511w01.html_para4">I have placed copies of the BMI report in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00511w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Immigration Service at Gatwick is at present looking at accommodation in the Horley/Crawley area in order to improve its capability in handling asylum and other casework. Dealing with asylum claims is one of the Immigration Service's top priorities. A central unit in the Gatwick area is being considered, but as yet no firm decisions have been made.

 Our policy is to help to establish an integrated, sustainable freight distribution system, both to support economic growth and to bring social and environmental benefits. The Strategic Rail Authority, already operating in shadow form, will have a duty to promote rail freight. In the three years beginning April 1997 we have provided &#163;81 million in grants to move freight from road to rail or inland waterways. We have issued guidance to local authorities to facilitate more use of rail for freight, and our forthcoming 10 year Transport Plan will set out the Government's longer term strategy.

 The Inland Revenue is responsible for enforcing the national minimum wage. If any worker believes they are not being paid what they are entitled to under the law they simply have to phone the minimum wage helpline on 0845 6000 678 to make a complaint about underpayment. All complaints, including third party tip-offs, are followed up.
<P>

<a name="00511w02.html_para1">The Government recognise that it is vital for workers to be aware of their entitlements under the law. Around &#163;5 million was spent on advertising the minimum wage at the time of its introduction last year. A smaller campaign in the autumn targeted certain ethnic groups where awareness was still relatively low. There will be further paid publicity spanning the periods when the youth rate and main rate are increased on 1 June and 1 October respectively.

 The Government are contributing &#163;480 million toward the cost of equipping the whole national network of post offices with an automated on-line IT platform. This investment in the automation project is substantial and is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the future of the Post Office network. Nearly 40,000 counter positions in over 18,000 offices will be equipped with the modern computer system. Automation will attract new customers and services to the Post Office, replacing traditional business progressively eroded by changing customer demands and habits, which, in turn, will contribute to strengthening the long-term viability of the network.

 We are committed to ensuring a fair tax system. It is clearly unfair that someone using a personal service company and carrying out the job of an employee has been able to enjoy a big tax and NICs advantage over other employees. Avoidance through service companies placed a burden on other tax and NIC payers and damaged the UK's competitiveness.

<a name="00511w05.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 My predecessor announced in March 1998 that we would undertake a study into options for the storage of decommissioned nuclear-powered submarines. The initial phase of our study has been completed. We have concluded that while afloat storage would remain a safe option, if suitable alternative venues could be identified, land storage offers the best overall solution in the long term. Further work will now be undertaken to determine which land storage option should be adopted. I expect this further work to take up to three years to complete.
<P>

<a name="00511w05.html_para0">The purpose of the next phase will be to determine which land storage solution should be adopted. This work will be taken forward in conjunction with industry, who will be invited to submit their proposals, with a view to entering into a Public/Private arrangement. As part of the process, we will further develop one land storage option, the removal and storage of the intact reactor compartment and the recycling of the remainder of the submarine, as a basis for comparison with industry proposals. We have not identified specific land store sites, but would expect these to emerge from the proposals we receive from industry. No decision will be taken on the most suitable storage option, or on a site, until we have completed the next phase of the study, which will include full and open consultation. As part of this process, environmental impact assessments will be undertaken for each storage option taken forward.
<P>

<a name="00511w05.html_para1">We are providing oral briefings to interested parties and the media, and material is also available on the MOD website. In addition, we are inviting written comments as a means of shaping and informing our further work and plan to consult widely during the next phase of the study.
<P>

<a name="00511w05.html_para2">Separately, and in parallel, we have received an unsolicited commercial proposal from Babcock Rosyth Defence Limited, the owners of Rosyth Royal Dockyard, to dismantle the reactor compartment of one decommissioned nuclear submarine, HMS Renown, and store the components. This would be an alternative to the traditional nuclear decommissioning work planned to start at Rosyth later this year and would not lead to any overall increase in the radioactive waste already held there. The intermediate level waste from Renown would be held

<P>

<a name="00511w05.html_para3">The Babcock proposals will be taken forward in two stages and I have agreed that the first, which will involve feasibility and planning work only, may proceed. There will be no question of moving to the second, implementation, stage of the proposal until and unless we and the relevant regulatory authorities are entirely satisfied. In these circumstances I will make a further announcement.
<P>

<a name="00511w05.html_para4">During this second stage, we will work with Babcock to produce an environmental impact assessment, which will involve public consultation. In addition, the company will have to satisfy the nuclear safety and environmental requirements of the independent regulators, including the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency before the dismantling work can begin. The company will be briefing local interest groups and the media tomorrow.
<P>

<a name="00511w05.html_para5">In all of the above, safety remains of paramount importance and we will work to the same standards that apply to civil nuclear industry.

<P>
<a name="00511w05.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The White Paper, "Defence Diversification: Getting the most out of defence technology", does not restrict the remit of the DDA technology diversification managers to supporting only small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In its first year of operation the DDA has successfully assisted companies of all sizes. However, from an operational perspective the agency has to prioritise allocation of its resources and has tended to concentrate effort on SMEs. These companies, while contributing to UK's wealth and creating jobs, have less resources of their own than larger companies to access and thus benefit from DERA's technology.

<a name="00511w05.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 My Department has recorded 144 claims for compensation from British Nuclear Test veterans. As there is no evidence of excess illness or mortality among British Nuclear Test veterans as a group which could be linked to their participation in the nuclear tests, no compensation claims from them have been settled. In any event, prior to May 1987, Service personnel were prevented from pursuing claims for compensation from the Ministry of Defence by section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947. The repeal of section 10 by the Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act 1987 was not made retrospective and claims arising from injury or illness caused before the repeal are barred by law.

<P>
<a name="00511w05.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The New Zealand Government have not, to our knowledge, paid compensation to servicemen who participated in nuclear test programmes. However, we are aware that as a result of a New Zealand Inquiry into the health status of veterans' children, published last year, a programme of assistance to test veterans and their families, funded by their Government, was recommended. Such assistance was to take the form of case management, family counselling and genetic counselling where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="00511w05.html_para6">In addition, the New Zealand Government announced on 29 April 2000 the grants of NZ$200,000 (about &#163;60,000) to the New Zealand Nuclear Test Veterans Association, a one-time payment to assist the purposes of the Association, including further research and initiatives which provide support to the veterans and their families.

 No. UK Service personnel deployed on UN operations continue to receive UK pay. However, UK Service personnel serving under UN auspices are entitled to UN personal allowances. Personnel serving in formed units received the UN Daily Allowance of $1.26 per day and a Rest and Recreation Allowance of $10.50 per day, for up to seven days leave. Troops serving as UN monitors receive a separate UN allowance of about $120.00 per day for the first 30 days of duty and about $90.00 per day thereafter, because they are responsible for finding their own food and accommodation. These rates are set in US dollars and are paid to UK personnel either in US dollars, pounds sterling or local currency depending on circumstances.

 We want to help the new reforming administration in Indonesia strengthen democratic control of the security forces. The attachment of a senior British police officer to our Embassy in Jakarta starting on 1 June, is a first step in our efforts to help bring this about. We are consulting others about appropriate international support for security sector reform in Indonesia.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00511w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I have recently received the Review Team's report on the first stage of the Quinquennial Review. The report, which follows extensive internal and external consultation, analyses the performance of the Northern Ireland Prison Service since it became an Agency in April 1995, including how it is perceived by the various bodies and interests affected by the services that it provides--including its own staff. It also considers the services likely to be needed in future and the organisational options for delivering them.
<P>

<a name="00511w07.html_para18">It is clear from the report (a copy of which I am placing in the Library of each House) that the Prison Service has made considerable progress, in uniquely difficult circumstances, over the past five years. The report recommends unequivocally that Agency status should be retained as the most appropriate way of delivering custodial services in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="00511w07.html_para19">I have accepted that recommendation and have asked the Review Team to embark on the second stage of the review, examining how the effectiveness and efficiency with which the Prison Service delivers its services and functions can be further improved in the future. The culmination of this final stage of the review will be the publication in the Summer of a new Framework Document for the Northern Ireland Prison Service.

 In 1997, the United Kingdom National Screening Committee recommended against introducing population screening for prostate cancer using the prostate-specific antigen test. In the context of a national screening programme, the NSC concluded that the limited accuracy of the test could have led to a positive result for those without the disease. Follow-up procedures could have caused considerable unnecessary harm to healthy individuals.
<P>

 Registrations per head of population in Northamptonshire show that 54 per cent. are registered with General Dental Service dentists. This is 6 per cent. higher than the national average.

Positive steps have already been taken to address this problem. NHS dentists in the Northamptonshire Health Authority have received &#163;45,000 in Investing in Dentistry grants. This has gone towards establishing brand new practices that have already begun to register additional patients.

Nominations have, however, been accepted from the newly formed British Osteopathic Association and the General Osteopathic Council itself.

 <i>[holding answer 9 May 2000]:</i> The prevention and treatment of asthma are high priority topics within the Department's research programmes. The Department's Policy Research Programme has been funding for some years a programme of research on the public health aspects of asthma, aimed at providing a clearer scientific understanding of the causes of asthma and hence how it might be prevented. One of the major strands of research within this programme relates to studies on the effects of outdoor air pollution on patients with asthma. This work is currently funded until the end of the year, but it has been agreed to extend this contract for a further period and consideration is now being given to continuing the programme for a further five years.

 <i>[holding answer 10 May 2000]:</i> Health Service Circular 1999/178 issued to National Health Service trusts, primary care groups, and others in August 1999, among other things drew attention to the resources available to health professionals when dealing with the care of patients suffering from all forms of CJD. The CJD Support Network, in collaboration with the Association of Directors of Social Services, has published good practice guidelines for social services professionals who care for variant CJD patients. In addition, we will shortly be publishing some new guidance intended for healthcare professionals. It will mention the importance of having a named 'key worker' in place after any diagnosis of CJD, whose role will be to co-ordinate all professional care. The National CJD Surveillance Unit, funded directly by the Department, also employs a care co-ordinator, to act as a source of advice and expertise to health care professionals.

<a name="00511w09.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 May 2000]:</i> The cost of caring for a patient suffering from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) varies considerably from case to case, but is generally considered to be in line with the cost of caring for a wide range of other terminally and chronically ill patients.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps he is taking to ensure that general practitioners are aware of the presenting symptoms of new variant CJD.  [121138]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00511w09.html_spnew6"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 May 2000]:</i> The initial symptoms of variant CJD can be similar to much more common illnesses, and it is therefore difficult to diagnose the disease in its early stages. General practitioners presented with neurological or psychiatric symptoms in a patient would, however, be expected to refer such patients as necessary in the normal way to appropriate specialists, including neurologists. The National CJD Surveillance Unit, funded directly by the Department, keeps in regular touch with neurologists about CJD issues and has circulated to them details of those symptoms which would suggest that a case should be referred to the Unit for further investigation. In addition, the Unit disseminates information about variant CJD through the medical literature.

<a name="00511w09.html_spnew7"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Calman/Hine report published in 1995 emphasised the importance of the integration of the work of cancer units with a cancer centre. Each cancer unit should have in place arrangements for non-surgical input (medical and clinical oncologists) into services. Local arrangements will depend on cancer site specialisation by the oncologist and the cancer unit, but sufficient time must be available in the cancer unit to guarantee a firm commitment to those local oncology services. Consequently individual clinicians may work in more than one trust.
<P>

<a name="00511w09.html_para9">Results from the medical workforce census for England show that at 30 September 1999 there were <i>(a)</i> 700 clinical oncologists employed by 80 National Health Service trusts and <i>(b)</i> 380 medical oncologists employed by 70 NHS trusts.

 The Calman/Hine report, "A Policy Framework for Cancer Care Services", recommended that networks of care should be developed encompassing primary care, cancer units and cancer centres. The report provided a broad framework for the development of cancer units and cancer centres, but it did not set explicit standards for their development. Early implementation of the Calman/Hine recommendations reflected the different starting points across the country and allowed an evaluation of services to fit local needs.

 Patients in England with severe Parkinson's disease are usually under the care of neurologists. If, in their neurologist's opinion, neurosurgery may improve their disease then they can refer to specialist neurosurgical centres dealing with Parkinson's disease.

<a name="00511w10.html_para24">Implant surgery for Parkinson's disease is complex and highly specialist and relatively new. It should be noted that the relative merits of implants in Parkinson's disease compared to drugs or more conventional surgery have not been thoroughly tested as yet. There are therefore sound reasons for limiting the number of centres where this service can be accessed until such time as its effectiveness is fully established.

<P>

<a name="00511w10.html_para27">Waiting time statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and waiting times for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment at a given point in time and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the waiting time as the difference between the admission and the decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.

 It is the European Commission which monitors the tendering of public contracts in the European Union. Where appropriate, the Commission enforces compliance through proceedings against the member state in the European Court of Justice. Firms harmed by a breach of EC law can also seek remedies under national review systems which member states are required to establish. The Department of Trade and Industry's "Action Single Market" can assist UK firms who meet problems in other member states.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00511w11.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 There is no specific procedure for demutualisation laid down in insurance legislation. In practice, a mutual life insurer proposing to demutualise normally transfers its insurance business to a proprietary company. Such a transfer of business requires court approval under the procedure in Schedule 2C to the Insurance Companies Act 1982. An independent actuary's report on the terms of the scheme is considered by the court. Anyone, including policyholders, with an interest can be heard by the court, as the regulator. If demutualisation is achieved, there is no statutory role for the Government Actuary in the process, but the regulator decides whether to make representations to the court or take any other action after appropriate actuarial advice. One important factor which is addressed is the safeguarding of policyholders' reasonable expectations.

The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your recent questions on dependent children and the marital status of heads of families. I am replying in the Director's absence.
<BR>
Estimates of marital status and family composition are available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) household datasets, which are available for the spring and autumn quarters of each year. The latest available LFS estimates of dependent children and the marital status of heads of family units are for the autumn (September to November) quarter of 1999 and are given in the tables attached.

The first table gives non-seasonally adjusted LFS estimates of dependent children by the marital status of the head of family unit, the second gives estimate of families with dependent children, again by the marital status of the head of family unit.

The attached table shows data from the General Household Survey. The GHS is a continuous, multi-purpose survey based on a random sample of the general population resident in private households in Great Britain. It has been carried out by the Social Survey Division of ONS since 1971, and is commissioned by a number of Government Departments and is widely used for policy and planning purposes.
<BR>
Interviewing took place during the period April 1998 to March 1999. Interviewers collected information from 15,853 adults aged 16 and over in 8,636 households.

<BR>
The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your recent question about the economic status of women with young children. I am replying in the Director's absence.
<BR>
Estimates of economic status are available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) which is the major ONS source of labour market data 



<P>
<P><I>11 May 2000 : Column: 472W</I><P>
on individuals. The table attached gives non-seasonally adjusted LFS estimates of the economic status of women of working age (16-59 years) with young children in the winter (December to February) quarter of 1999-2000.
<BR>
People aged 16 or over are classed as in employment by the LFS if they have done at least one hour of paid work (as an employee or self-employed) in the week prior to their LFS interview or if they are temporarily away from their current job. People who do unpaid work in a family business and people on Government-supported training and employment programmes are also included according to the International Labour Organisation convention.
<BR>
Classification by whether a person works full or part-time is based on the respondent's own assessment.
<BR>
The measure of unemployment derived from the LFS is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). It counts as unemployed people who are a) without a paid job, b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained.




<P>
<P><I>11 May 2000 : Column: 473W</I><P>

<BR>
People aged 16 or over are classed as economically inactive by the LFS if they are not in employment and do not satisfy the criteria for ILO unemployment. This includes those who want a job but who 



<P>
<P><I>11 May 2000 : Column: 474W</I><P>
have not been seeking work in the last 4 weeks, those who are seeking work but are not available to start and those who do not want a job (for example, students not working or seeking work).

(9) There is no such thing as an 'official exchange rate'. Exchange rates vary during the day and depending on what time you measure them will influence any average rate calculated. The Bank of England measures representative exchange rates in the London interbank market every day at around 4pm. These rates are the spot middle market rates i.e. The difference between the bid rate (what a bank will sell currency to you at) and the offer rate (what bank will buy a currency from you at) for spot) i.e. Today-but may settle in two to seven days time).<P>

The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your recent question on Gross Domestic Product (GDP). I am replying in the Director's absence.
<BR>
The most recently published data for annual GDP was released on the 27th of March 2000. GDP at current market prices for 1999 was &#163;889,874 million, an increase of 5.0% on the previous year.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the effect is on the maximum pension contributions eligible for tax relief for <i>(a)</i> the employer and <i>(b)</i> the employee if a pay increase is (i) compulsorily staged by the employer and (ii) voluntarily foregone by the employee.  [121369]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00511w12.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 May 2000]:</i> In broad terms, tax relievable pension contributions that an employee may pay are based on a percentage of taxable earnings received for a year of assessment.
<P>

<a name="00511w12.html_para4">The treatment of employer contributions depends on the type of pension scheme. With tax approved occupational pension schemes, the employer's contributions are set by the scheme actuary according to the level of benefits promised by the scheme. For a personal pension scheme, total contributions by the employee and employer combined must not exceed an age-related percentage of the employee's taxable earnings for the year.

<P>
<a name="00511w13.html_spnew4"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor welcomes the Report on Contact between Children and Violent Parents from the Children Act Sub-Committee of the Advisory Board on Family Law. He agreed to make the report available in draft to the Court of Appeal so that it could consider the proposed guidelines in four appeals on this subject which were heard in March and on which judgment has been reserved. Once judgment in those cases has been given, the Lord Chancellor will consider with the President of the Family Division what further action may be necessary. The Family Court Welfare Service is currently the responsibility of the Home Office but I understand that induction for family court welfare officers addresses the issue of domestic violence. As part of the development of the new Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS), which will fall within the responsibility of the Lord Chancellor's Department, current training arrangements are being
