 The design and timing of the auction is a matter for Ofcom. Ofcom has consulted on this recently, proposing a 95% coverage obligation on one of the licences and are considering the responses calling for changes to their proposals. Ofcom is aiming to carry out an auction in the first half of 2012. If there is any legal challenge to the auction then that would be made to Ofcom. Given the benefits to the economy and to citizens and consumers, it is in the national interest that this spectrum is released as soon as possible. We would not welcome any further delay to the release of this spectrum. We would hope that any organisation that might consider legal action recognises the importance of carrying out the auction as soon as possible.</p>

 On <i>(a)</i>, nothing was spent on new furniture. In terms of <i>(b)</i> and <i>(c)</i>, in May 2010, on the change of Government, it was apparent that Gwydyr House, a grade 2* listed building, was in need of a significant amount of work to make it structurally sound. A large office on the ground floor was unusable and most of the staff who had previously occupied the room had been temporarily evacuated to another building,  <br/>

            <p style="margin-bottom:30px;">as the room was occupied by acro props that were supporting a first floor office. The acro props had been installed following advice from a structural engineer that the condition of the building was unsafe, and work was subsequently carried out over the summer of 2010 to complete all the structural repairs, including the installation of steel beams to stabilise the floor that was at risk of collapse. Work also took place to address various health and safety and DDA compliance issues within Gwydyr House. Work was carried out after consultation with English Heritage, given the listed status of the building. The overall cost was £185,000. Some redecoration was necessary as a consequence of the structural and other remedial work but it is not possible to separate out those costs as the redecoration was an integral part of much wider projects.</p>

               <a name="11070755000174"> It would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual cases. The Government's policy on disclosure in criminal proceedings is that investigators, prosecutors and defendants should adhere rigorously to the requirements of the disclosure laws (notably the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, as amended, and its accompanying codes of practice), upon which fair and efficient trials are founded. In January 2011, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) announced that it would carry out a review of the work conducted by the National Domestic Extremism Units. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (‘IPCC’) is carrying-out a separate independent investigation into disclosure issues around a number of specific cases. The Director of Public Prosecutions has also commissioned a separate independent review of the CPS decisions on a specific case. The Government will consider very carefully any recommendations which may emerge from these reviews for changes to the disclosure laws.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (the Commission) has jurisdiction to make a maintenance calculation and collect child support maintenance only when the parent with care, the non-resident parent and the qualifying child are all habitually resident in the UK. Habitual residence is a legal concept which means more than simply 'where you live'. A person can habitually reside in more than one country or in none. Habitual residence can continue during an absence from UK.</p>

            <a name="11070755000551"> 
            <p class="tabletext">The Commission retains the power to pursue a non-resident parent who moves overseas, including those that live in the Irish Republic, for ongoing maintenance payments, but only where the non-resident is regarded as being habitually resident in the UK. The criteria for establishing jurisdiction when a non-resident parent leaves the United Kingdom is described at Section 44 of the Child Support Act 1991. There is no distinction made between an EU state and a non-EU state.</p>

            <a name="11070755000552"> 
            <p class="tabletext">If the non-resident parent ceases to be habitually resident, the Commission can no longer seek ongoing maintenance. We can only enforce child maintenance arrears directly if the non-resident parent holds assets within the UK, such as savings or property, which would fall within the jurisdiction of the UK courts. Since 3 August 2009, the Commission has had the power to make deductions from current or savings accounts held within the UK without the consent of the non-resident parent.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">The Commission may take action to prevent the non-resident parent disposing of his assets, from which the Commission could recover the arrears. The Commission may apply to the High Court (England and Wales) or the Court of Session (Scotland) if a non-resident parent has arrears of child support; and have disposed of, or is about to dispose of, assets with the intention of avoiding child support.</p>

            <a name="11070755000554"> 
            <p class="tabletext">From 18 June 2011, the Commission will have some ability under the new European legislation EC EU 04/2009 to enforce certain arrears of maintenance that accrued while both parents were resident in the UK where the non-resident parent now resides in another jurisdiction within the European Union (except Denmark). It can also assist parents with care in the process of obtaining a court order for ongoing maintenance which can then be enforced via an application to the Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders (REMO) unit at the Office of the Official Solicitor and Public Trustee. The new European legislation also allows the Commission to make enquiries about assets a non-resident parent may own in another E.U member state (except Denmark) for the purposes of enforcing child maintenance arrears owed in the UK.</p>

 The benefit cap will mean that people on benefit will face choices about housing costs similar to those faced by people in work. But it will not necessarily mean that they will need to move from their home. Even within the limits of this cap, households will still be able to receive significant amounts of financial assistance from state welfare payments and if a member of the household moves into work and becomes eligible for working tax credit they will be exempt from the impacts of the cap.</p>

 The UK state pension is payable world-wide but is only up-rated abroad where there is a legal requirement or reciprocal agreement to do so. A well known court case challenging the UK's position was heard by the European Court of Human Rights' Grand Chamber in September 2009 and the Court's judgment of March 2010 was in the UK's favour. We continue to take our obligations under the terms of the European Convention on Human Rights seriously and are satisfied that we are complying.

 Our provisional timetable states that from October 2013 all new applications for out-of-work support will be treated as claims to universal credit. No new jobseeker's allowance, employment and support allowance, income support and housing benefit claims will be accepted. New claims for tax credits will continue to be accepted until April 2014. Detailed planning is still at an early stage, and the timetable and sequence for transition may change as a result.</p>

Any changes to the regulatory framework, including changes to the role and function of HEFCE and OFFA, as defined by these acts is likely to require primary legislation and secondary legislation. Over the summer we will consult on a new regulatory framework, which will set out clear and demanding conditions for an organisation to be recognised as a provider of higher education in England. As part of this consultation we will consider changes to the process and criteria for obtaining university title and taught degree-awarding powers. We are currently consulting on the potential introduction of an early repayment mechanism for student loans. Depending on the outcome of this consultation we may need to introduce primary and/or secondary legislation.</p>

 Reg Bailey published the report of his independent review of the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood, ‘Letting Children be Children’, on 6 June. In their response, made to Parliament as a written ministerial statement on 7 June 2011, <i>Official Report</i>, column 8WS, the Government made clear that they accepted and welcomed Mr Bailey's analysis and the thrust of all the recommendations he has made, which will reduce the pressure on children to grow up too fast. The Government's policy on implementation of these recommendations was also set out in the written ministerial statement.</p>

We have simplified health and safety requirements covering activities that take place on or off school premises, including school trips, so that it is easier for schools to engage their pupils in activities outside the classroom.</p>

We deliberately set out to inspect a greater proportion of previously satisfactory or inadequate schools each year and a smaller proportion of previously good or outstanding schools. The sample of schools inspected is therefore skewed and means that comparisons between years should be treated with caution as some differences are due to the very different sample of schools inspected during the different periods.</p>

This led to a skew in the sample of schools inspected and means that comparisons between years should be treated with caution as some differences are due to the different sample of schools inspected during the different periods.</p>

 A thematic review of young people's careers guidance will be helpful in establishing a baseline for future policy development once the new arrangements for careers guidance are implemented.

 The Government support the European Semester as an important development in the EU's overall surveillance framework. The treaty sets out (article 121) that member states shall regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern and shall co-ordinate them within the Council. However, under the terms of the UK's protocol to the treaty, the United Kingdom only has to “endeavour to avoid” excessive government deficits; all other member states are obliged to “avoid” them.

 Government Procurement Cards are a useful tool in helping Government to transact in the purchase of low cost goods and services and are particularly helpful in supporting our use of SMEs. They enable purchasers to streamline ordering processes, for example removing the need to raise a purchase order, and ensure Government meet their prompt payment initiatives.</p>

We are now working with each of the card providers to provide a consistent method of reporting government procurement card spend data for transactions above £500 in value, so this is available for publication on/via departmental websites, from the end of September 2011.</p>

 The following tables show the information requested for all hospital build schemes with a capital value of £25 million or over (at 1999-2000 prices). The Department does not routinely collect 2010-11 cost estimates for all capital schemes so 2010-11 prices have been estimated for each scheme by uprating the real terms figures using the Treasury's Gross Domestic Product deflator series (published on their website and which we use for such exercises).</p>

 “The Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2011/12” sets out that, to improve outcomes from radiotherapy treatment for cancer patients, commissioners should develop local plans to ensure that access rates to radiotherapy and the use of advanced radiotherapy techniques, such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT), are appropriate for their populations. The National Cancer Action Team has been working with providers to support the development of IMRT services and, at this time, 20 of the 28 cancer networks have at least one provider offering IMRT.</p>

Historic costs for the previous capability are not a good guide as it is impossible to know how NATO would have used such a capability if it had been available and offered, whether alongside or instead of the British aircraft currently contributing to the operation.

 The Ministry of Defence's renegotiation programme was initiated to support the strategic defence and security review, through contract termination, re-scoping or deferral. Over 500 contracts across 100 programmes are estimated to be affected and the Ministry of Defence is examining over 300 of these in the first instance. We expect the process of renegotiation to take around 18 months, with the initial focus being on those contracts which will deliver the highest savings in 2011-12. We have already renegotiated around 30 contracts with BAE Systems and Rolls Royce relating to the Nimrod and Harrier programmes.</p>

 The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft programme is making good progress and remains within its approved performance, cost and time boundaries. The first two aircraft, Airbus A330-200, converted to military specification are currently undergoing flight testing.

 As I made clear in my statement to the House on 13 January 2011, <i>Official Report</i>, column 22WS, no solution will be imposed by the Government on fire and rescue authorities in making decisions on the future of their control services. I am aware that a number of fire and rescue authorities have plans to outsource their control services to another authority or consortium, thereby improving efficiency and resilience. I welcome this increased collaboration. However, fire and rescue authorities are the experts in running control services and do not require guidance from central Government on this.</p>

 The Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Cabinet Office are currently considering what Government resources will be committed to the review of the Japanese response to the Fukushima emergency, including possible engagement with independent experts. This review was recommended by the Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations in his interim report on the implications for the UK nuclear industry of the Fukushima incident (the ‘Weightman Report’).

The NEPLG is a national forum, which brings together organisations with an interest in off-site planning for an emergency at civil nuclear sites, including licensed site operators, and representatives from local authorities and the emergency services. Under its terms of reference, the group agrees improvements in planning, procedure and organisation which might form a framework of advice to nuclear operators, the emergency services and those other organisations that may be involved in the response to a nuclear emergency.</p>

Key multilateral partners such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development, The Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Programme, but also the European Commission and its Humanitarian Department provide significant support to smallholders. Almost half of the programmes in our 27 bilateral focus countries prioritise support to smallholders. Our Africa regional programme also supports marketing and trade for African smallholders.</p>

 It is crucial that we work with others to address stigma, discrimination and the exclusion of key populations. These are barriers which hamper people from accessing life saving prevention and treatment. The coalition Government work to address these barriers through our bilateral and multilateral support to combat tuberculosis (TB). For example, in advance of its 11th funding round, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), which is the largest single provider of international funds to fight TB, issued guidance on taking a rights based approach to the design of TB programmes. It also recommends that countries specifically consider activities and programmes to reduce stigma and discrimination in their TB proposals.</p>

 Significant progress has been made since 1995, with 41 million patients successfully treated under DOTS resulting in 6 million lives saved. Globally, rates of incidence, prevalence and mortality are declining. Incidence rates are falling slowly by 1% a year, following a peak at 140 cases per 100,000 population (2004). Mortality rates have fallen by one third since 1990, and prevalence rates are also in decline.

In support of this objective, and to help to drive progress towards zero HIV infections and deaths by 2015, scaling-up access to tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, treatment care and support is a strategic priority in the coalition Government's recently launched ‘Towards zero infections: The UK's position paper on HIV in the developing world’.</p>

 The contribution of new drugs and technologies on the levels of tuberculosis (TB) in developing countries could be significant, but there are limitations. While most TB patients can be cured with present drug regimens, the 2050 elimination target is far more likely to be achieved with a combination of improved diagnostics, drugs and vaccines that can detect and treat both latent TB infection and active disease. Recent modelling for the WHO has suggested that a combination of a neonatal pre-exposure TB vaccine, a two-month treatment regimen effective against drug-susceptible and resistant strains of TB, and a novel point-of-care diagnostic test could potentially reduce the incidence of TB by 71%. There are however questions remaining about the effect of these in high HIV prevalent areas.</p>

 It is crucial that we work with others to address stigma, discrimination and the exclusion of key populations. These are barriers which hamper people from accessing life saving prevention and treatment. The coalition Government work to address these barriers through our bilateral and multilateral support to combat tuberculosis (TB). For example, in advance of its 11th funding round, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), which is the largest single provider of international funds to fight TB, issued guidance on taking a rights based approach to the design of TB programmes. It also recommends that countries specifically consider activities and programmes to reduce stigma and discrimination in their TB proposals.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) is supporting a number of product development partnerships to encourage industrial development of new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines for tuberculosis. This includes support to the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), the Global Alliance for TB Drugs; and the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation. These initiatives are making progress. For instance, FIND has helped develop a new diagnostic for rapid detection of TB (‘GenXpert’). This may help shorten the time to diagnosis and cut transmission, thus preventing new cases in future. FIND are also working on how they can adapt these tools for use in more peripheral settings.</p>

 It is crucial that we work with others to address stigma, discrimination and the exclusion of key populations. These are barriers which hamper people from accessing life saving prevention and treatment. The coalition Government work to address these barriers through our bilateral and multilateral support to combat tuberculosis (TB). For example, in advance of its 11th funding round, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), which is the largest single provider of international funds to fight TB, issued guidance on taking a rights based approach to the design of TB programmes. It also recommends that countries specifically consider activities and programmes to reduce stigma and discrimination in their TB proposals.</p>

 We estimate that around 10 million people in the Horn of Africa are currently in need of emergency relief. About half of those are in Ethiopia, and the other half split between Kenya and Somalia. A large proportion of those in need are women and children. Nutritional surveys in southern and south eastern parts of the region indicate prevailing rates of malnutrition above emergency thresholds. The situation in the Somali refugee camps is especially concerning. Acute child malnutrition among new arrivals to camps in Kenya and Ethiopia is running at 33-40%, more than double emergency levels.</p>
