 Snow clearance and toll reductions during extreme weather are a matter for the Humber Bridge Board. The Board has informed me that the extreme weather conditions on 28 November, made it impractical to ensure the road surface of the Humber Bridge was entirely free of snow. The bridge was, however, passable throughout this period although local police forces imposed their own restrictions on some roads giving access to the bridge.</p>

 Controls on pesticides work at a number of levels, initially by identifying the hazard potential, then by assessing and managing risk. Under European legislation, pesticide active substances are first evaluated at community level. A key part of this process is an assessment of the risks to bees. If an active substance meets the EU safety requirements then products containing that active substance can be authorised at member state level, taking into account that country's individual agronomic, climatic and dietary requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_455"><a name="110118w0002.htm_para13"><a name="11011867002930">In the UK, pesticide products can only be sold or used after they have been authorised. As part of this process, the Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD) of the Health and Safety Executive (the Government body responsible for regulating pesticides) undertakes an assessment of the toxicity of each product and the ways in which spray operators, the public or environment (in particular honey bees) may be exposed. The purpose being to ensure that the use of the product poses no unacceptable risks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_456"><a name="110118w0002.htm_para14"><a name="11011867002931">The controls extend to the use of products and CRD routinely restricts the way products can be used (e.g. specifying dose rates, timing and place of application) to ensure protection of human health and the environment. Users are also legally obliged to take all reasonable precautions to protect the health of human beings, creatures and plants. Advice on how this can be done is set out in a statutory "Code of Practice for Using Plant Protection Products" which, amongst other things, contains guidance on minimising the exposure of bees to pesticides.</p>

Future expenditure must be well targeted, delivering measurable outputs that offer real value for money and societal benefits that the market place cannot provide. It should tackle the key objectives of encouraging a competitive, sustainable EU agriculture sector, reducing reliance on subsidies and focusing resources on the provision of environmental public goods. This must be underpinned by further simplification of the CAP and reduction of regulatory burdens.</p>

1. The costs shown represent the direct staff costs within Jobcentre Plus associated with Social Fund activity. The basis for allocating management, support costs and head office costs has changed over this period and it would be disproportionately costly to attempt to include all of these costs on a comparable basis.<br>
2. The costs cover the direct staff administration costs of Budgeting and Crisis Loans including face to face interviews, Community Care Grants, Funeral Payments and Sure Start Maternity Grants, reviews and appeals and exclude Winter Fuel payments. Debt Management activity is carried out by a Shared Service function on behalf of Jobcentre Plus. Activity specific to Social Fund Debt is not separately identified from the wider debt recovery costs.<br>
3. The increase in cost mainly reflects increased volumes of Crisis Loans.<br>
4. In 2009-10 face to face interviews were introduced where an individual made a third or subsequent request for a Crisis Loan within a rolling 12 month period. The aim of these interviews is to:<br>
Help ensure that the Fund is not being mis-used. Evidence suggests that on being invited to interview, significant numbers of applicants either terminate the telephone call or fail to attend the appointment.<br>
Help sign-post genuine needy customers for independent money advice so that they can receive help with matters such as budgeting.<br>

A supersession is where the customer raises questions about entitlement to DLA/AA e.g. there has been a change of circumstances and they require more help with personal care or getting about.  2. A Secretary of State Supersession (SofS) is undertaken when information is received that raises questions about a customer's entitlement to DLA or AA.  3. Maintenance is where the customer reports a change of personal circumstances such as a change of address or bank account etc.  4. The Average Actual Clearance Time (AACT) target measures the average number of days we take to process changes of circumstances. The purpose of the target is to make sure that our customers' changes of circumstances are processed in a reasonable length of time.  5. The AACT is calculated by dividing the total number of days taken to clear cases by the total number of cases cleared. <i> Example:</i> Total number of working days taken to clear cases is 150; total number of cases cleared is 50. Therefore the average clearance time is 150/50 = 3.  <i> Source:</i>  Department for Work and Pensions-PDCS Management Information Statistics.<br>

 The Church of England has a long history of delivering youth work and currently provides activities outside church for over 439,900 children and young people. At a local level, the church has seen extensive growth in the number of churches employing youth workers in recent years and the establishment of some key projects, often with the financial support of local authorities.</p>

 Figures held centrally by the Ministry Division of the Archbishop's Council show that in the period 2005-10 the division's candidate's panel dealt with 14 former Roman Catholic priests seeking ordination in the Church of England, of whom 11 were accepted for ministry. As there is discretion at diocesan level over the requirements for acceptance into ministry, not all cases are centrally recorded, meaning the national figure is likely to be higher. There are, however, no pensions implications for the Church Commissioners who are responsible only for clergy pensions earned for service in the Church of England before 1998.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development to what use the UK's contribution from the Environmental Transformation Fund to the World Bank's Climate Investment Funds has been put; what proportion of the contribution was in the form of loans; and whether any conditions were placed on the contribution. [34620]</p>

<p><a name="st_276"><a name="11011884000435"><a name="110118w0002.htm_spnew57"><a name="11011884000505"><b>Mr Andrew Mitchell:</b>
 The Climate Investment Funds (CIFs) are not World Bank funds, but rather are managed by an equal number of developing and developed countries. The World Bank acts as trustee and, alongside other multilateral development banks, is one of the agencies recipient countries may choose to implement their national programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_514"><a name="110118w0002.htm_para72"><a name="11011884000436">The UK's Â£735 million contribution to the CIFs is helping 45 developing countries to pilot transformational investments in clean technology, sustainable management of forests, increased access to renewable energy, and climate resilient development. For example, the CIFs are expected to install over 12.5GW of renewable energy-enough for the equivalent of nearly 16 million households-and increase crop yields for 440,000 people in Bangladesh through improved water management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_515"><a name="110118w0002.htm_para73"><a name="11011884000437">The money provided to the Environmental Transformation Fund under the 2007 comprehensive spending review was a capital grant contribution. The UK's contribution to the CIFs is then used to make loans on highly concessional terms, with a small proportion available as grants. Once loans are repaid to the CIFs, they can be reinvested in further programmes to help other developing countries tackle climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_516"><a name="110118w0002.htm_para74"><a name="11011884000438">As a first mover in the development of the CIFs, the UK's contribution of Â£735 million has leveraged over five times this amount ($6.4 billion) from other donors, much of this in the form of grants. These donor pledges are, in turn, leveraging further funds from the multilateral development banks and the private sector. For example, for every Â£1 of finance for clean technology we have agreed to spend, another Â£8 is being mobilised from other sources.</p>

 Health Technical Memorandum (HTM) 01-05 was produced with extensive input from dentists, and an expert multi-disciplinary working group. The group included public health experts, scientists and engineers with specialist knowledge of instrument decontamination, including protein removal. The HTM proposes a progressive approach to improving quality and ensuring effective risk reduction for patients and staff. We are confident that the validation processes used were exhaustive and fit for purpose. Drafts of the guidance were shared with an expert steering group and the British Dental Association. Comments from the peer review were considered and changes made where appropriate.

 The Department has issued guidance to the profession in Health Technical Memorandum (HTM) 01-05: "Decontamination in primary care dental practices", a copy of which has been placed in the Library. This describes both essential quality requirements that all practices need to have in place as well as best practice requirements that all practices should aspire to reach. The Department, with the Infection Prevention Society has issued a self-assessment audit tool to help practices assess their own level of compliance against the guidelines. A CD ROM version of the audit tool will also be distributed to practices very shortly.</p>

 We are advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), which has responsibility for policy on food safety, that general food law places the onus on food businesses to ensure that all of their ingredients and products are safe and compliant with any relevant legislation. In light of the recent dioxin contamination incident originating in Germany, the FSA has taken the opportunity to remind food businesses again of their obligations with regard to food safety. Nevertheless, while they must meet these obligations, the actual sourcing of raw materials is a commercial matter for the businesses themselves.</p>

 In our White Paper "Healthy Lives, Healthy People: Our strategy for public health in England", published on 30 November 2010, we set our ambition for the future of public health. Core features are the establishment of a new body, Public Health England, as part of the Department, and the return to local government of public health leadership and responsibility. There will be ring-fenced public health funding from within the national health service budget. A copy of the White Paper has already been placed in the Library.</p>

For sexual health, we propose that local authorities will be responsible for commissioning comprehensive open-access sexual health services using funds from the ring-fenced public health budget. These arrangements will also cover sexual health services for young people.</p>

1. The Department does not collect data in respect of individual hospitals. Therefore, it is not possible to provide the information requested in respect of the Conquest Hospital, which is part of the East Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust.<br>
2. The above table contains figures for spend on non-NHS staff. 'Non-NHS staff' denotes staff who do not have a permanent contract of employment with the national health service, such as agency staff. Locum and bank staff are not included as these are included within the NHS staff category in the financial returns, and are not separately identifiable from the data.<br>
3. The Department does not collect information exactly in the format requested. For 'nurses', the closest equivalent information is held under the category 'Nursing, midwifery and health visiting staff'. For 'doctors', the closest equivalent is 'Medical staff' and for 'office staff' the closest equivalent is 'Administrative and clerical staff'.<br>
4. Hastings and Rother PCT was established in 2006-07 following the merger of its two predecessor PCTs-Bexhill and Rother PCT and Hastings and St Leonards PCT. The figures provided for 2005-06 are therefore the sum of the two predecessor PCTs.<br>
5. The financial returns are a means for the NHS to provide planning and costing information to the Department, and these provide a more detailed breakdown of individual expenditure lines reported in the audited summarisation schedules. The financial returns data are not themselves audited, but are instead validated by reference to the audited summarisation schedules from which the NHS summarised accounts are prepared. There are a number of factors which may distort the figures and they may contain errors and omissions at an individual level (mainly as a result of classification errors) which are not material at the national level.<br>

1. Work force census figures are not available for individual hospitals. Therefore, it is not possible to provide the information requested in respect of the Conquest Hospital, which is part of the East Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust.<br>
2. Data Quality: The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level, figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>

 HM Treasury consider ex-gratia payments to be a form of special payment. HM Treasury's definition includes personal injury claims that are settled out of court. Information about local ex-gratia payments made by the national health service to patients to avoid litigation is not held centrally. Local NHS bodies record 'losses and special payments' in their consolidated accounts and these will include all ex-gratia payments, not just those paid to patients or to avoid litigation.</p>

As the NHSLA settles the vast majority of its claims this way, they fall under HM Treasury's definition of ex-gratia. Data provided by the NHSLA will cover payments to patients, although some will be made to families/dependants, employees and visitors.</p>

<i> Data Quality:</i><br>
The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>
<i> Monthly data:</i><br>
As from 21 July 2010 The NHS Information Centre has published experimental, provisional monthly NHS work force data. As expected with provisional, experimental statistics, some figures may be revised from month to month as issues are uncovered and resolved. The monthly work force data are not directly comparable with the annual work force census; they only include those staff on the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) (i.e. the do not include primary care staff or bank staff), they also include locum doctors (not counted in the annual census). There are also new methods of presenting data (headcount methodology is different and there is now a role count).

 Shale gas exploitation in other countries suggests that the impact on global warming from the extraction and use of this resource can sometimes be higher than that of conventional gas, because of increased drilling density and well site operations. This impact is expected to vary more between individual shale gas exploitation operations than it does between individual conventional gas fields, making it relatively location dependent.</p>

will be eligible for loans for their tuition costs provided: they are personally eligible in terms of residency; they do not already hold a qualification which is at an equivalent or higher level to the qualification for which they now intend to study; they are studying on a course which is designated for support. These criteria match those for full time studies. The further criterion for part-time students is that they should be studying at an intensity rate which is at least one-quarter of an equivalent full-time course. Currently 60,000 part-time students receive tuition grants. Under our proposals we estimate 175,000 part-timers may be eligible for loans. No eligible part-time students will have to pay for their tuition costs up front and they will not have to begin repaying until they are earning at least Â£21,000, the same repayment threshold as we propose for full-time students.</p>

<i> [holding answer 14 December 2010]:</i><i> </i>We do not make any estimate of the number or proportion of students who may be eligible, on the basis of household income, for the education maintenance allowance (EMA) at the level of individual schools or colleges. Nationally, we estimate that 679,000 young people may take-up EMA in the academic year 2010/11, and around 45% of 16 to 18-year-olds in full time further education in England currently receive EMA. Young people attending Higher Education are not eligible for EMA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_651"><a name="110118w0004.htm_para76"><a name="1101197000123">The EMA scheme will close at the end of the 2010/11 academic year and no new applications will be processed from 1 January 2011. It will be replaced, from September 2011, with an enhanced discretionary learner support fund which will be managed by schools, colleges and training providers. This will enable them to target support at those young people that they assess as having real need of it to stay in education after 16. We are working with schools, colleges, training organisations and their representatives to develop the details underpinning the new scheme.</p>

 Reasons for absence are collected within the school census, however only broad categories are used and therefore the Department will not know the number of pupils that were absent specifically due to the recent protest against tuition fees. Information on pupil absence is collected a term in arrears, therefore data for the autumn term 2010 will not be collected until the spring school census in 2011.</p>
