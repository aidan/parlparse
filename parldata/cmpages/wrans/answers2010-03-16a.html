 Section 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (as amended) requires all local authorities to exercise their functions with due regard to their likely effect on crime and disorder. The prevention of crime and the enhancement of community safety, including that of small retailers and traders, are therefore matters that a local planning authority should consider when exercising its functions under the Town and Country Planning legislation. All police forces have specialist crime prevention design advisors who can provide architects, developers and planners with advice on using design to help minimise risk of crime for the whole community.</p>

 The British Crime Survey (BCS) is carried out in respondents' own homes. It is recognised that respondents may not wish to disclose being victim of domestic abuse in a face-to-face interview, especially if the abuser is present at the time of interview. For that reason, the BCS includes a self-completion module on domestic abuse in which respondents may answer questions in private. It is likely that there remains a degree of under-reporting of the level of such abuse but trends will be unaffected as this methodology has been applied consistently over time. The Home Office also commissions ad-hoc social research projects to explore the nature of domestic violence and also to inform the development and evaluation of policy and practice as and when is required.</p>

1. Figures shown relate to March each year, and are a snapshot of the median wait of patients waiting at the end of each period. The latest data available are for January 2010, and this figure shows the median wait of those still waiting at the end of that month of 5.0 weeks. March 2010 data will be published on 30 April 2010<br>
2. It should be noted that median waits in the winter months historically tend to be higher than other months. We would therefore expect the median at March 2010 to be lower than five weeks as shown in January 2010.<br>

 My right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have discussed Burma with their Chinese counterparts. In recent weeks officials have discussed our broad concerns about the impact of large-scale construction projects on the human rights of the local population. We have not raised the specific issue of the construction of dams on the Irrawaddy River, but are following developments closely and with increasing concern. Our embassy in Rangoon is also supporting work to assess the social and environmental impact of these projects</p>

Logica subcontracted elements of the project out (for example, to XM for design, to Alterian for the content management system, to Verizon for hosting). The amount Logica paid subcontractors for the design work is commercially protected and not known to the FCO.</p>

 Jews are one of three religious minorities, alongside Christians and Zoroastrians, which are constitutionally permitted to practise their religious faith in Iran. In reality however, they cannot hold positions in the judiciary, police and security forces, limiting the role they are permitted to play in public life. Although Jews have enjoyed a relative degree of freedom to practise their religion, including the use of Hebrew for religious instruction, they face various limitations on their rights to travel and to communicate with Jewish communities outside Iran, especially in Israel.</p>

The Government have raised concerns over the treatment of Iran's religious minorities on many occasions with the Iranian authorities, calling on the Iranian authorities to uphold their international legal undertakings to safeguard religious freedom and to stop discrimination and persecution on the grounds of religion.</p>

 The supplier obligation (now termed the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target) has been set over three year cycles precisely to allow Government to reflect on its successes and to evolve the scheme so that it only pulls through the most energy efficient products with the most potential to provide for household sector carbon emissions reductions. The measures eligible for each phase are subject to full public consultation. The consultation on the April 2011 to December 2012 extension of the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target, concluding on 14 March 2010, does though specifically ask whether Government should introduce up front sunset clauses for products when they reach a certain level of market penetration.</p>

 An independent assessment is commissioned at the end of each three year phase of the Supplier Obligation (now termed the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target), building on the cost-benefit assessment undertaken and published at the launch of each scheme. Independent analysis of the three year supplier obligation scheme ending March 2008 showed it to have been extremely cost effective in delivery-that for every £1 added onto GB household bills to pay for the obligation, benefits equate to an average saving of £9 per household bill over the lifetime of the measures. Equally, the present supplier obligation, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target, is believed to be highly cost-effective, with expected annual benefits (net of costs) of around £649 million for the lifetime of the measures, with around £228 benefits per tonne of carbon dioxide saved in the traded sector and £153 benefits per tonne of CO2 saved in the non-traded sector.</p>

Our first three carbon budgets legally bind the UK to a cut in greenhouse gases of 34 per cent. by 2018-22 against a 1990 baseline. In 2009, the UK's Low Carbon Transition Plan set out the long-term vision for climate change and energy and showing how we will meet the carbon budgets set out in the Climate Change Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_584"><a name="100316w0018.htm_para5"><a name="10031689000529">In March 2010 the Government's household energy management strategy-Warm Homes, Greener Homes-set out plans for meeting the target of a reduction of 29 per cent. in (non-traded) carbon emissions in the household sector. The strategy will make it easier for people to take action, removing the deterrent of upfront costs by, for example, paving the way for 'pay as you save' energy efficiency loans.</p>

2. The SSAC is the UK advisory body on social security and related matters, such as links with the labour market and wider social welfare issues. It performs a mandatory scrutiny of most proposals for making the regulations on those issues. Thus, much of the Department for Work and Pensions' policy and legislative proposals-including the progressing of the welfare reform agenda-comes before the Committee.<br>
3. The significant increase in non-staffing costs in 2008-09 mainly reflects the Committee's decision, in the light of rising workloads, to deploy Members and external researchers more intensively to augment the work carried out by the SSAC Secretariat in that year. It also reflects the Committee's costs in undertaking a public appointment exercise in 2008-09; no such exercise took place in the previous year.<br>

 There has been no assessment made of the effect of the ending of prescribed rating on the work of the Valuation Office Agency.

 The Legal Services Commission (LSC), like all other public bodies, must work within a fixed budget. However, the LSC is responsive to increased demand for services at local level within that budget. Last year, the LSC increased the number of cases funded of initial civil advice and assistance in areas like debt and housing to over one million in response to the economic downturn-a record amount. The LSC also allocated cases in areas where clients had previously found services hard to access. The LSC will continue to maintain this flexible approach where there is evidence of both need and demand for additional services.</p>

 Suspended sentence orders were introduced in April 2005 to provide the courts with a tougher and more flexible suspended sentence as an alternative to immediate custody, where appropriate. It provides for the court both to suspend the custodial sentence and also to impose community requirements such as curfew, community payback and drug rehabilitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_670"><a name="100316w0026.htm_para15"><a name="100316100001146">The Government do not issue guidance to magistrates or judges on sentencing. The issuing of guidance is a matter for the Sentencing Guidelines Council. Breach of a suspended sentence order is governed by schedule 12 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Essentially, where an offender breaches a suspended sentence by failing to comply with a community requirement or by committing a further offence the presumption is that the suspended sentence will be activated, unless the court finds it would be unjust to do so. If it activates the suspended sentence the court can set a shorter term for the offender to serve if it wishes. If the court finds that it would be unjust to activate the suspended sentence it can keep the sentence suspended but amend the order to make the community requirements more onerous, or to extend the supervision or operational periods.</p>

<sup>(3)</sup> EMDA: Data are unavailable for 2004/05 as this is prior to the introduction of the nationally agreed Tasking Framework.<br>

<sup>(5)</sup> NWDA: Prior to 2007/08, the number of social enterprises assisted was not recorded separately on the tasking framework. Data provided for 2007/08 and 2008/09 are the combined outputs of NWDA and Business Link NW. BL NW was established in April 2007.<br>

<sup>(8)</sup> SWRDA: The South West RDA supports the regional social enterprise network, and the numbers recorded relate to the regional social enterprise network and to the support provided through BL providers. The South West RDA does not collect data on individual social enterprises supported. Contracts with our current BL providers started in 2007, so data for BL assisted businesses is not available before this.<br>
<sup>(9)</sup> YF: Figures provided before 2008/09 do not include beneficiary data from BL as this predates the current BL provider. The figures provided for 2008/09 have not compared beneficiary data collected by BL and YF separately as this would incur disproportionate cost.<br>
