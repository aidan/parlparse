To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on what basis the annual increase in ex-service pension rates are calculated; and if he will list the increases awarded in each of the last 10 years.  [82574]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Starting rates of pension for newly-retired ex-Service personnel are linked to pay and increase each time there is a pay award. The pensions of people who have already retired are uprated annually in line with the Retail Price Index (RPI). The mechanism was set in the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 and the Social Security Pensions Act 1975. The increase is determined by the movement of prices between September and September and is paid the following April. The last 10 years rates of increase are as follows:

<a name="90504w01.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Mackinlay: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence in what circumstances and for what reasons ex-servicemen, of the same rank and length of service, receive different rates of pensions under the Armed Forces Pensions Scheme.  [82577]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Pension rates are directly linked to pay, and new starting rates of pensions are set each time there is a pay award. All those who retire will therefore have a different level of pension than those with the same rank and length of service who retire in a different pay year. After pensions are awarded they are uprated annually in line with the retail price index (RPI). Unless, therefore, military pay increases precisely in line with the RPI, the difference in pensions between two pay years will be permanent.

<P>
<a name="90504w01.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the moorland map of England drawn up by the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service can be used, in its present form, by the Countryside Agency in compiling its draft access maps of open countryside.  [82153]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales will be responsible for producing maps showing land to which the statutory right will apply. In considering how best to do this, the agencies will be assessing the suitability of a range of sources of information, including the Moorland Map of England, and will be consulting the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency, along with other organisations.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w01.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how long it took the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service to map the moorland areas of England; and how much the exercise cost.  [82154]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w01.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The production of the Moorland Map of England was undertaken between May 1992 and March 1993, and required ten staff years of resources. The estimated overall cost was &#163;603,000. The programme was preceded by a pilot project during 1991, involving the Scottish and Welsh agriculture departments, at an estimated cost to ADAS of about &#163;30,000. The Moorland Map shows only moorland lying within the Less Favoured Areas.

<P>
<a name="90504w01.htm_wqn9"><B> Mr. Ruane: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) how many incidents involving ships clearing out their ballast tanks there have been in <i>(a)</i> British waters and <i>(b)</i> Liverpool Bay in each year over the past 10 years; and how many prosecutions have resulted;  [82170]
<P>
<UL>(2) what action he is taking to prevent ships from clearing out their ballast tanks in British waters.  [82173]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w01.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Existing legislation imposes strict controls on the discharge of oily ballast water, which are enforced by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency surveillance aircraft and other means. From 1 August 1999 the NW European waters will be designated a Special Area under International Convention, and all discharges of oil cargo contamination in ballast water will be strictly prohibited. This designated Special Area will include the North Sea and its approaches, the English Channel and its approaches, the Irish Sea and its approaches, the Celtic Sea and the North East Atlantic immediately to the West of Ireland.
<P>

<a name="90504w01.htm_para1">There is no requirement for ships to record the take-on or discharge of sea ballast water and there have been no prosecutions resulting from ships clearing out their ballast tanks. The United Kingdom is actively participating in work at the International Maritime Organisation to 



<P>
<P><I>4 May 1999 : Column: 300</I><P>
develop measures to minimise the introduction of unwanted aquatic organisms in ballast water. Pending the outcome of this work, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency has published guidance which urges owners to comply with IMO's "Guidelines for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast water to Minimise the Transfer of Harmful Aquatic Organisms and Pathogens".
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w01.htm_wqn10"><B> Mr. Ruane: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what percentage of British ports have facilities for treating ballast from ships.  [82174]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w01.htm_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 All ports are required to provide waste reception facilities which are adequate to receive the waste from ships normally using the port. However the discharge of clean ballast water is not controlled by legislation and it is not generally regarded as harmful, unless it has been contaminated by cargo on board an oil tanker. In these circumstances it is then strictly controlled by oil pollution regulations. Some oil terminals do have a local requirement that all ballast from tankers are discharged ashore and their reception facilities may include treatment to remove oil cargo residue. There are no facilities in the UK which are expressly designed for the treatment of clean ballast water.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the cost implications involved in ensuring that traffic lights within the UK are Year 2000 compliant.  [82256]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 There is no estimate of the cost implications involved in ensuring the Year 2000 compliance of traffic lights. Most are on local roads for which local highway authorities are responsible and costs are not available centrally. However, most of the equipment used at traffic lights has to have Statutory Type Approval, for which the Highways Agency are responsible. They have a budget of approximately &#163;200,000 to establish the compliance of equipment in use and results are being made available to all highway authorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many miles of old hedgerow were removed in each of the last five years prior to the enactment of the Hedgerow Regulations 1997; and how many miles have been removed since its enactment, broken down by county in each case.

<a name="90504w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The last survey into changes in countryside hedgerows in England and Wales covered the years 1990 to 1993. This estimated that on average some 3,600 km of hedgerow were lost due to outright removal each year. A survey of hedgerow stock will be undertaken as part of Countryside Survey 2000. This will provide a basis for analysing changes which have occurred since the earlier survey.

<P>
<a name="90504w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Sewerage undertakers have powers to control and reduce discharges of fat and oil into sewers. If they consider the discharge constitutes trade effluent, their consent is required in accordance with the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991. The consent may set conditions and require the elimination or diminution of any specified constituent of the trade effluent before it enters the sewer. Such a discharge without the undertaker's agreement is a criminal offence.
<P>

<a name="90504w02.htm_para3">If the sewerage undertaker does not classify the discharge as trade effluent, it is still an offence under section 111 of the 1991 Act for a person to empty into a public sewer, or any drain or sewer connecting with a public sewer, any matter which is likely to injure the sewer or drain, to interfere with the free flow of its contents or to affect prejudicially the treatment and disposal of its contents. Any person who is found guilty of an offence is liable to a fine or imprisonment. I consider these statutory controls are sufficient to deal with and reduce the problem of fat and oil entering the sewers.

<P>

<a name="90504w02.htm_para4"><i>(b)</i> After careful consideration, the view was taken that no environmental appraisal for the Government's Greater London Authority proposals was necessary. This was because the proposal's impact would be upon the governance structures of London and, as such, would have no environmental impact.
<P>

<a name="90504w02.htm_para5">However, promoting the objective of sustainable development will be an explicit and fundamental consideration for the Greater London Authority. The Greater London Authority's principal purposes are promoting economic development and wealth creation in London, promoting social development in London and promoting the improvement of the environment in London. The Authority's general purpose is conferred to enable it to further one or more of those purposes. In exercising the general power to do anything which it considers necessary to further any one or more of these purposes, it will be required to have regard to the effect its actions would have on the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom. And where it does exercise its general power, it is required to do so in a way which is best calculated to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w03.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Peter Atkinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received calling for a motorway link between the north east of England and the M1 motorway; and if he will make a statement.  [82631]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w03.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Representations have been made over many years calling for the North East to be connected by a motorway link to a national motorway network.
<P>

<a name="90504w03.htm_para0">Most recently, as part of the Government's Road Review, a number of representations were received identifying certain points and areas for action, including the need to offset the region's peripherality by better transport links, particularly in terms of providing a motorway connecting to the south.
<P>

<a name="90504w03.htm_para1">Due account was taken of all views expressed in pulling together the targeted programme of improvements and the series of proposed studies as set out in "A New Deal for Trunk Roads in England" published in July 1998. These include a study of the non-motorway section of the A1 between Bramham and Barton.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his letter of 16 July 1998 (MR/PSO/8216/98), what progress he has made towards electronic publishing of carbon dioxide figures.  [81910]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w03.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Estimated UK emissions of carbon dioxide and other air pollutants for 1970-96 are available from the National Air Quality Archive on the Internet at the following address: (http: // www.environment.detr.gov.uk / airq / aqinfo.htm). The DTI also publish carbon dioxide emissions on their site (http://www.dti.gov.uk/epa). Later this month my department will be releasing 1997 emission estimates for all the main air pollutants and DTI will be releasing provisional 1998 emissions estimates for carbon dioxide.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 19 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>451</i>, what further proposals on the Clean Development Mechanism he has submitted to the UN Framework Convention.  [81937]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w03.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The EU submitted a first proposal on the modalities and procedures for the clean development mechanism to the Secretariat of the UN framework Convention on Climate Change on 2 March. This served as an input to the UNFCCC technical workshop on the

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he last met representatives of <i>(a)</i> the Road Haulage Association and <i>(b)</i> the Freight Transport Association; what plans he has to meet them in the future; and what proposals he has put to each organisation regarding the impact of increased duty and excise charges.  [82777]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w03.htm_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Ministers have frequent contact with representatives of the Road Haulage Association (RHA) and the Freight Transport Association (FTA) most recently. On 26 April my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister attended and addressed the FTA Annual Dinner. On 27 April I had an informal meeting with David Green, Director General and Lawrence Christersen, President of the FTA together with other FTA representatives. I also had an informal meeting at the House of Commons with Steve Norris, Director General of the RHA and with a number of individual road hauliers. Both the FTA and the RHA were represented at the inaugural meeting of the Road Haulage Forum on 8 April. I will be attending the RHA's Annual Dinner or 11 May, and I expect to continue to meet representatives of both Associations frequently.
<P>

<a name="90504w03.htm_para2">I have put no proposals to them regarding the impact of increased duty and excise charges. Tax matters are the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Road Haulage Forum's main task is to establish the facts on the competitiveness of the industry but it will also be looking at a range of other issues.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w03.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Secretary of State is waiting for further information from the Local Authority before he can begin to consider the application. I shall write and let the right hon. Gentleman know the Secretary of State's decision.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what procedures must be followed by a local authority seeking to close, on a permanent basis, a section of the public highway in connection with development.  [82672]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w03.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 Section 247 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, enables a developer to seek the stopping up or diversion of a highway to enable a development which has planning permission to proceed. A similar procedure exists under section 248 of the Act for side roads, and under S249 a local highway authority can apply to pedestrianise a road. All stopping up orders are subject to an objection procedure. Where there are 



<P>
<P><I>4 May 1999 : Column: 306</I><P>
unwithdrawn objections, the Secretary of State will usually call for a public inquiry to be held before deciding whether the order should be made or not.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w03.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Alan Williams: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what costs were incurred by the Government in relation to the Royal Train in 1998-99; how many times it was used for official Government business; and at what cost on each occasion.  [83078]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w03.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 The cost of the Royal Train is met as part of the Grant-in-aid which is the annual funding provided by the Department to meet the cost of official royal travel by air and rail. Figures for the use of the Royal train during 1998-99 (which include both a fixed and variable cost element) are currently being finalised but it is estimated that the total cost will be about &#163;825,000. This represents a decrease of 29 per cent. on 1997-98 and 56 per cent. since the Grant-in-aid was established two years ago.
<P>

<a name="90504w03.htm_para3">The Train was used once for official Government business during 1998-99--for a function hosted by Mrs. Blair for the wives of the G8 Heads of Government on 16 May 1998. The &#163;11,382 variable cost of the use of the Train, plus a &#163;4,250 contribution to fixed costs, was met by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals London Transport has for publishing information about tenders for bus services in London.  [83339]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w03.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 London Transport Buses has recently reviewed its policy in this area and I welcome its decision to expand its disclosure of tender results. LTB intends to publish new information on the London Transport Web site and will also make hard copy versions available on request.
<P>

<a name="90504w03.htm_para4">The relevant information will be the number of tenders, the successful bidder, the value of the selected bid and the range, and the cost per scheduled mile. In addition to basic information about the route and service, LTB will also publish information about any alternative service options which were considered.

 The Government apply statutory controls to minimise the spread of rhizomania, including a prohibition on the growing of beet on any fields where the disease has been found. Controls are applied to certain types of products brought into the UK, such as seed potatoes, to minimise the risk of further introductions of the disease. These arrangements are applied in accordance with the United Kingdom's status as a 'protected zone' for rhizomania under the EC plant health regime. The Government will be seeking an EC decision to continue the protected zone, which under existing legislation is due to expire on 1 November 1999.

 The Government are reviewing all approvals of organophosphate and carbamate compounds used in pesticides approved by the Pesticides Safety Directorate and the Health and Safety Executive under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985. The company concerned has chosen not to provide the data necessary to support two products containing diazinon. 



<P>
<P><I>4 May 1999 : Column: 310</I><P>
Approvals for these products have therefore been withdrawn. Companies that have indicated that they will support other organophosphate pesticides now have five months to submit complete data packages for the review.
<P>

<a name="90504w04.htm_para2">A similar review of veterinary medicines, including those with an organophosphorus compound as an active ingredient was conducted in the early 1990s and companies produced full data packages for sheep dips and other veterinary medicines, the active ingredient of which is diazinon. In cases where the data packages satisfied the statutory requirements, products continued to be authorised.

 Under the Hedgerows Regulations 1997, offences in respect of hedgerows may be prosecuted by the police (through the Crown Prosecution Service) local authorities or indeed any private person. Whilst the police may investigate these offences, normal practice is for local planning authorities to take responsibility for such matters.

<P>

 The inquiry into expenses arose from concerns about the circumstances during which a complaint was made by a member of the public following an incident which occurred in Leicester in May 1997, although the complaint itself did not relate to expenses. Matters arising from some statements made during the course of media interviews have been the subject of internal inquiries by the force and did not arise from a complaint by an individual.

<P>
<a name="90504w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Home Office and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) has recently issued good practice guidance on dealing with unauthorised camping by travellers. Operational guidelines on the use of police powers to remove trespassers under section 61 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 are issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and are currently under review. I have made clear to ACPO that I expect police powers to be used at an early stage where necessary, particularly where traveller encampments are associated with problems of crime, disorder or disruption to the local community. The use of police powers in individual cases is an operational decision for the senior police officer present at the scene. The 1994 Act also provides powers to local authorities to remove trespassers, and civil action for repossession may be taken by landowners.
<P>

<a name="90504w05.htm_para0">In addition, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 requires local authorities and the police to develop Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships, comprising the police, local authority, probation, health and other local agencies, which work in partnership to identify and resolve issues of crime and disorder in their area and to work to reduce it. These partnerships are relevant where criminal activity or disorder arise from unauthorised encampments.
<P>

<a name="90504w05.htm_para1">The Home Office and DETR are currently holding a number of regional seminars to encourage the police and local authorities to work effectively together to deal with the problems that can be caused by unauthorised encampments.

 Short-term prisoners benefit from the range of services available to all prisoners. On drugs issues, these include detoxification, advice and treatment. As part of the Prison Service drug strategy, all prisoners will benefit from improvements in the quality and availability of drug services, including improved links with community agencies to ensure continuity of treatment on release. This aspect is of particular importance to short-term prisoners whose length of stay in prison often means that they cannot benefit from the more long-term intensive drug treatment programmes.

 Medway Secure Training Centre's main contacts are with home area supervising officers. The arrangements appear generally to be working well.

<P>

<a name="90504w05.htm_para4">Occasionally, supervising officers from distant areas cannot attend initial assessment meetings, which need to be held at short notice just after sentence. As more STCs come into operation--two more are due this year--the better geographical spread should reduce this problem.

<P>
<a name="90504w07.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Secretary of State last met with the Decommissioning Commission on 22 March, the Prime Minister met them on 30 March and I met them on 22 April. The Commission also meets regularly and frequently with both Governments at official level. The Commission continues its discussions with representatives of the various groups and parties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w07.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning is funded jointly by the British and Irish Governments. The total expenditure associated with the Commission shared by both Governments, up to 31 March 1999, was IR &#163;1,905,830.57. The British Government's share of this was STG &#163;803,379.46.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w07.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 The pay increases effective from 1 April 1999 in respect of hospital medical and dental staff employed in the Health and Personal Social Services and covered by the Pay Review Bodies were included in April salaries. However, the salary increases recommended by the Review Body for Nurses and Midwives and Professions Allied to Medicine and Related Grades of Staff who are employed by or in the Health and Personal Social Services in Northern Ireland were not.




<P>
<P><I>4 May 1999 : Column: 322</I><P>

Staff employed in the Health and Personal Social Services in Northern Ireland are not subject to the terms and conditions of service negotiated nationally. However, national terms and conditions are replicated, on a parity basis to apply to staff employed in the HPSS.
<P>

<a name="90504w07.htm_para0">The recommendations of the Review Body on Doctors and Dentists' Remuneration were agreed with the professions locally and issued to employers on 15 March for implementation. The recommended increase was included in April salaries.
<P>

<a name="90504w07.htm_para1">The national Whitley agreements in respect of Nurses and Midwives and Professions Allied to Medicine and Related Grades of Staff were not issued until 8 April 1999 which did not allow sufficient time for a parity agreement to be reached for similar staff employed in the HPSS. Parity agreements are being promulgated and will be issued as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="90504w07.htm_para2">The pay increases for Nurses and Midwives and PAMs staff will apply from 1 April and arrears will be paid where appropriate.

[82503]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w07.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Merlyn Rees, signed a Requisition Order on 25 June 1974 to take possession of land belonging to Crossmaglen Rangers GAA Club under powers conferred by the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973 



<P>
<P><I>4 May 1999 : Column: 323</I><P>
for the purpose of extending the then existing joint RUC and Army Base. The Requisition Order conveys the right to build or do any other necessary works on the land. The existing Base is sited mainly on land owned by the Police Authority for Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="90504w07.htm_para3">A portion of this requisitioned land which was outside the perimeter wall of the extended Base was handed back to the GAA Club in April 1995.
<P>

<a name="90504w07.htm_para4">A further small strip of land belonging to the Club was requisitioned in May 1991 to create a 3 metre stand-off zone between the rear perimeter wall of the Base and the Club's newly built Social Club. This area was de-requisitioned in April 1995.
<P>

<a name="90504w07.htm_para5">On return of the area still held under requisition none of the functions currently carried out at or from these barracks will be discontinued or transferred to other sites. They will be carried out from the reduced base.
<P>

<a name="90504w07.htm_para6">Work to clear the site has commenced and will be completed as soon as possible. On completion of the restoration work, the land will be handed back to the GAA Club.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will estimate the number of businesses which could be incorporated as limited liability partnerships.  [82934]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w08.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 It is impossible to give an estimate. Provided they met the statutory requirements eventually set out in any legislation to allow for limited liability partnerships (LLPs), any business could incorporate as an LLP.
<P>

<a name="90504w08.htm_para0">It is more helpful to consider how many businesses might be interested in LLP status, given that the vehicle will be voluntary and businesses will need to take a commercial decision about whether it is appropriate for them. The majority of interest is expected to come from those firms already operating as partnerships, though it may also be of interest to new businesses.




<P>
<P><I>4 May 1999 : Column: 326</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90504w08.htm_para1">At present there are approximately 600,000 partnerships in the UK. These encompass the full spectrum of business and industry and only a minority are likely to seek to become LLPs. Public consultation on a draft Bill and regulations has so far revealed little or no interest from the retail, manufacturing, catering and health sectors. LLPs are therefore likely to be attractive primarily to professionals such as lawyers, actuaries, accountants, and those in the construction industry (including surveyors, architects and engineers). How attractive the vehicle proves in practice would depend on the statutory requirements which are made of it, and whether the structure is considered to be appropriate. However, if one assumes, for example, that 15 per cent. would eventually choose to become LLPs this would suggest a total of 90,000. This is, though, a best guess, and cannot be quoted with any authority.
<P>

<a name="90504w08.htm_para2">Although it is impossible to calculate the speed of take-up of LLPs, we expect that it would take a number of years before a figure of 90,000 LLPs was reached.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the implications of the declaration of the Association of Caribbean States concerning the transhipment of radioactive wastes and nuclear materials through the Caribbean for plans to send by sea nuclear materials from Sellafield to Japan.  [82850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w08.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Government are aware of the declaration. All shipments by sea of nuclear materials are undertaken fully in compliance with all relevant international standards, regulations and recommendations relating to the transport by sea of hazardous cargoes and nuclear materials. Compliance with these standards and regulations, which are developed within, and regularly reviewed by, the International Maritime Organisation and the International Atomic Energy Agency, ensures that the risk to health, safety and the environment posed by the transport of nuclear materials is negligible. The right of innocent passage is a fundamental 



<P>
<P><I>4 May 1999 : Column: 327</I><P>
principle of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Ships operating in compliance with the Convention, and with all applicable international regulations, retain that fundamental right.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the preferred route to be used to transport by sea nuclear materials from Sellafield to Japan, indicating the criteria used in selecting the preferred routes.  [82852]<P>
<P>
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 28 April 1999]:</i> The Youth Sports Unit is a part of my team of advisers in DCMS. It does not have an identity separate from Government or publish its own recommendations or reports. Its remit is to work closely with other Government Departments, Sport England (the Sports Councils) and other providers to ensure that youth sport and play maintains a high profile and features in other Government Departments' policies.
<P>

<a name="90504w08.htm_para5">The Unit works closely with the Department for Education and Employment on PE in the National Curriculum as well as feeding into initiatives such as Surestart and childcare issues. The Unit liaises with the Department of Health on initiatives to encourage physical activity amongst young people, and officials sat on the Home Office inter departmental working group on Preventing Unsuitable People from Working with Children and Abuse of Trust (PUWCAT). The Unit works to ensure that Sport England has policies that reflect the Government's aim to encourage more young people to participate in sport. It also works alongside Sport England's young people team representing the department on steering groups on schemes such as Sporting Ambassadors, a new Activity Award for primary schools and Sportsmark.
<P>

<a name="90504w08.htm_para6">The Unit is represented on the Departmental Policy Action Team (PAT10) Arts and Sport, which has been asked to report on best practice in using arts, sport and leisure to engage people in poor neighbourhoods, on how to maximise the impact on poor neighbourhoods of Government spending and policies on arts, sport and leisure, and to draw up an action plan with targets to maximise the impact of arts, sport and leisure policies in contributing to neighbourhood regeneration and increasing local participation. It has also contributed to work on the forthcoming sports strategy paper, which will promote participation in sport by children and young people.
<P>

<a name="90504w08.htm_para7">The Unit is currently considering the responses from the play field to the recent children's play consultation exercise asking about The focus of future centrally funded play services. They were also involved in the Lottery play leaflet issued in May last year and the recent New Opportunities Fund initiatives.

 We are working to complete the assisted areas map review as soon as possible. The Welsh Office is fully involved alongside other Departments to seek the best possible outcome for Great Britain. This is the key objective, rather than an early announcement. As the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), said in an Adjournment debate on 26 April 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 124, we do not expect an announcement before mid-June.

 The modern apprenticeship programme is one of the main planks in our agenda for improving skills in Wales. Latest figures indicate that Wales has, at over 7 per cent., a proportionately higher than population share of the total of modern apprentices in training in England and Wales. It is our aim to increase the numbers in training from the current 9,100 to 14,000 by the year 2002.

<a name="90504w12.htm_para2">Receipts of Stamp Duty Reserve Tax under the Budget proposals to replace the current Stamp Duty regime will depend on the future volume of trading in units of unit trusts and in OEIC shares. The new system is designed to be more straightforward to administer and to pave the way for electronic trading of units, while maintaining a broadly consistent approach between dealings in units and dealings in shares. Total tax liabilities under the new system should be broadly similar to the overall net liabilities that would arise from applying the principles underlying the current rules--under which Stamp Duty is charged on surrenders to trust managers and refunds made to avoid a double charge when, as a consequence, the units are cancelled and corresponding amounts of the trust's underlying assets are sold.

 The purpose of private pension schemes is to provide an income throughout their members' retirement. So pension schemes that cannot themselves guarantee payment of lifetime pensions provide this security by buying annuities.

 Information on the risks and benefits of the Pill are given in the information provided to doctors and patients by pharmaceutical companies, the Family Planning Association and the Contraceptive Education Service. Millions of women around the world use oral contraception and there is abundant evidence that taking the Pill appropriately poses less risk to healthy women than pregnancy itself.

 The Department has made no formal assessment. However, information on elective and emergency caesarean section deliveries by Health Authority and individual hospitals is set out for the first time in the statistical bulletin "NHS Maternity Statistics, England: 1989/90 to 1994-95". This information has strengthened the local audit process. A copy of the bulletin is available in the Library. On the role of midwives, we know from Changing Childbirth pilot project reports that there has been a significant change in midwives' working patterns in both hospitals and the community to ensure that women receive continuity of care in their preferred environment whenever possible.

 The Department has issued no such press releases. In terms of guidance in this area, the Department has issued a joint Health Service/Local Authority Circular to the National Health Service and local government on the introduction of Health Improvement Programmes (HImPs). HImPs provide the framework for health authorities to bring together all local players to assess local health needs, identify what needs to be done to address national and local priorities and agree how each can contribute. Through this process, health authorities will develop comprehensive local programmes to tackle the wider determinants of ill health, of which cold and damp housing is one.

<a name="90504w16.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 In order to qualify for Incapacity Benefit a person must satisfy a test of incapacity for work, either for their own occupation, (in some cases, and in the shorter term), or under the All Work Test. This does not mean that people who satisfy the All Work Test are unable to do any work at all; it simply establishes that their incapacity is such that it would be unreasonable to expect them to seek work as a condition for getting benefit. In practice, many people who satisfy the All Work Test may be able to do some work if they have the right help and support. Survey evidence shows that around two million disabled people already work and over one million more would like to do so.
<P>

<a name="90504w16.htm_para5">Measures in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill replace the All Work Test with the Personal Capability Assessment (PAC).

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Figures are based on a 1 per cent. sample up to and including May 1993 and a 5 per cent. sample thereafter.<P>

2. Figures for 1992-93 onwards are based on an average of payments and numbers of claimants in the inquiry week using an average of the four quarters of the financial year.<P>

3. Figures prior to this are based on numbers and average amounts paid in May of each year.<P>

4. Figures have been rounded to the nearest thousand, and the estimated annual expenditure is rounded to the nearest million pounds.<P>

5. Prior to November 1995 figures on amounts of Income Support Mortgage Interest paid to claimants were published in the Quarterly Statistical Enquiry. From November 1995 onwards these have been replaced by figures on housing costs payable to claimants with mortgage interest payments. This change is due to alterations in Income Support rules and provides a more accurate reflection of the help actually provided to claimants under the housing cost rules. From 1992-93 onwards the estimates that have been used for this answer have been based on amounts of housing requirements payable to claimants with mortgage interest payments, and will include amounts for ground rent and other miscellaneous housing costs, although the majority of the amount is paid for mortgage interest. Figures prior to 1992-93 are not directly comparable with data after this date for this reason.<P>

6. Income Support figures exclude the unemployed from October 1996, as Income Support for the unemployed was replaced by Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) from this point.<P>

7. The February 1998 quarterly figure used in the annual 1997-98 JSA figure includes nil mortgage cases (i.e. cases with housing requirements only).<P>

8. JSA estimated expenditure for 1996-97 represents a 6 month estimate from the introduction of income-based JSA, the 1997-98 is an annual estimate.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90504w17.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The All Work Test determines entitlement to all benefits which depend on incapacity for work, including Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disablement Allowance and Income Support paid on the basis of incapacity.
<P>

<a name="90504w17.htm_para0">The test does not assess the condition itself but focuses on the effects of the condition on the person's ability to carry out a range of work related activities such as walking, lifting and carrying, vision and so on. Factors such as pain, fatigue and stress in carrying out the activities are taken into consideration. The test is satisfied when a set threshold of incapacity is reached.
<P>

<a name="90504w17.htm_para1">Some people with specified severe conditions or disabilities (such as blindness) are automatically treated as "incapable of work" and are exempted from taking the all work test. Some people with angina may satisfy one of the conditions for exemption defined in legislation as a progressive impairment of cardio-respiratory function which severely and persistently limits effort tolerance. In some cases the adjudication officer will decide, in the light of medical advice, that the written evidence shows that the test is satisfied. Other claimants will need to undergo a medical examination in order to assess the level of their incapacity.
<P>

<a name="90504w17.htm_para2">There are no separate criteria used by appeal tribunals.

 The Department for Education and Employment, through the Treasury Solicitor's Department, predominately uses junior counsel when it is necessary to instruct counsel to provide legal advice or to conduct legal proceedings.
<P>

<a name="90504w18.htm_para3">In civil cases, the two First Treasury Counsel are both junior counsel and they will advise and represent the government without a Queen's Counsel in many of its important cases. In addition, the Attorney-General maintains four panels of junior Counsel whom the Department for Education and Employment, as other departments, is expected to use for the majority of its civil litigation. The approval of the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General is required before a Queen's Counsel can be instructed to appear for any government department in civil litigation.
<P>

<a name="90504w18.htm_para4">In determining the level of counsel to use, the Department will consider the individual circumstances of each case. It will take into account, inter alia, the importance and sensitivity of the case, the complexity of the law, the weight and complexity of the evidence, and the degree of experience and expertise required before deciding whether to instruct Queen's Counsel or junior counsel.
<P>

<a name="90504w18.htm_para5">The Department for Education and Employment instructed three Queen's Counsel in 1996-97, seven in 1997-98 and two in 1998-99. The total cost of instructing Queen's Counsel for each of the last three years was &#163;9,212.00 in 1996-97, &#163;14,617.00 in 1997-98 and &#163;2,878.75 in 1998-99.

<a name="90504w19.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Campbell-Savours: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make an order under sections 496 and 497 of the Education Act 1996 requiring Nelson Thomlinson school of Wigton,, pursuant to section 411 of the Education Act 1996, to admit a pupil whose name has been communicated to the Minister by the hon. Member for Workington.  [82630]<P>

<a name="90504w19.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is minded to make a direction to require the governors of Nelson Thomlinson School to admit the child concerned and his position is unchanged despite the additional representations which have been submitted by the governing body in support of their case for refusing

admission. Nevertheless, before my right hon. Friend reaches a final decision on whether to use his powers to make a direction, he has asked the local education authority to arrange a meeting at the earliest opportunity between the parents and governors to try to reconcile the differences which have led to the child being refused admission. My right hon. Friend considers that the interest of the child would be served best if this could be achieved. In that event, he expects the child to be admitted to the school shortly. If, however, reconciliation cannot be achieved, and the child is still not admitted, my right hon. Friend will reach a speedy decision on whether to issue a direction to the governing body. I will be writing to my hon. Friend again to inform him of the outcome.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has to improve the performance of the private sector-led units of delivery under the New Deal programme; and if he will make a statement.  [82737]<P>

 The Employment Service is developing a comprehensive strategy for the continuous improvement of the New Deal throughout Great Britain, including those Units of Delivery led by the private sector. That is based on comparisons between Units of Delivery against a set of Core Performance Measures.
