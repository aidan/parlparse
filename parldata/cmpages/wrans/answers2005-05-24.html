<a name="50524w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Alpacas</h3>


<p><a name="50524w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will seek to introduce a legislative change which will define alpacas as livestock.  [184]</p>




<p><a name="50524w01.html_spnew0"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 I have no plans to introduce a legislative change which will include alpacas to be defined as livestock.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50524w01.html_para0">
I am unsure of the context of the question but there is some existing legislation which may be relevant to this issue. For example, the Agriculture Act 1947 provides that &#039;livestock includes any creature kept for the production of food, wool, skins or fur, or for the purpose of its use in the farming of land&#039;. Alpacas could conceivably fall within this definition. Also, the Department issued guidance last year that, for the purposes of the Zoo Licensing Act 1981, alpacas should be considered to be &#039;domesticated&#039; rather than &#039;wild&#039; animals.

<a name="50524w01.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Antibiotics</h3>


<p><a name="50524w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has had made of the impact on human health of the use of antibiotics on farms; and if she will make a statement.  [692]</p>




<p><a name="50524w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 There is increasing scientific support for the view that the increase in antimicrobial resistance affecting human health is primarily the result of the use of antibiotics in human rather than veterinary medicines.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50524w01.html_para1">
Nonetheless, we take this issue very seriously and in June 2000, published a cross-Government strategy to address the issue. In 1999 the Defra Antimicrobial Resistance Co-ordination (DARC) Group was established. Details of the work of this group, together with other information about antimicrobials and links to related websites, are available on the VMD website (www.vmd.gov.uk). We recognise that veterinary medicines, including antimicrobials, are required to ensure healthy food animals in the UK, but we believe that their use should not replace good farm management and animal husbandry systems. We believe that antimicrobials should be used responsibly in food animal production and have issued guidelines in the Code of Practice on the Responsible Use of Animal Medicines on the Farm, produced by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD). We also support the industry&#039;s Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture Alliance (RUMA), which has also published responsible use guidelines for antimicrobials that have 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 May 2005 : Column 44W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
been adopted by assurance schemes for the five major food-producing species. Also, as a precautionary measure, the use of antimicrobial growth promoters in the EU will be banned from 1 January 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50524w01.html_para2">
The VMD annually collates and publishes figures on the UK sales of all veterinary antimicrobials. These are likely to reflect usage of antimicrobials in animals. The figures illustrate that, whilst sales of some groups of antimicrobials have increased, others have decreased or remained relatively constant over time. The VMD, in collaboration with the Department of Health, has prepared and published a list of all antimicrobial therapeutic ingredients authorised for use in animals and humans. This illustrates that many antibiotic substances used in human medicine are not used in animals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50524w01.html_para3">
A number of research projects designed to provide scientific data to inform further consideration of relevant issues are also underway. These range from investigating the mechanism of antimicrobial resistance transfer in organisms, to investigating the husbandry factors on farms which might lead to reduced antimicrobial usage, thereby reducing the potential for the development of antimicrobial resistance. Details of these projects can be found on the VMD website.

<p><a name="50524w01.html_wqn2"><b> John Mann: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she plans to publish her response to the consultation on vehicles on bridleways and footpaths.  [147]</p>




<p><a name="50524w01.html_spnew2"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 In response to the consultation paper on the use of mechanically propelled vehicles on rights of way, &#039;The Government&#039;s framework for action&#039; was published on 20 January, which set out a commitment to legislate and provide new guidance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50524w01.html_para4">
The legislative commitment is being delivered through Part 6 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill, which was introduced to the House on 19 May.
</p>


<p>

A comprehensive revision of the departmental publication &#039;Making the Best of Byways&#039; and a new enforcement guidance document will be published this summer.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she expects to make a decision on the exchange of land from common land to access land at Brockeridge Farm, Twyning, Gloucestershire; and if she will make a statement.  [690]</p>




<p><a name="50524w01.html_spnew3"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The application for an Order of Exchange, made under section 147 of the Inclosure Act 1845, in relation to land at Brockeridge Common, Twyning, Gloucestershire was received by the Department on 2 September 2004. On 17 September officials wrote to the solicitors acting for the applicants seeking further information. A reply was received on 23 May 2005 and the documentation is being scrutinised. The procedures 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 May 2005 : Column 45W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
are complex and applications can take some time to determine, so I am not in a position to say if, or when, an Order might be made. The outcome will depend on the Secretary of State being satisfied that the exchange is fair to the parties involved, and its terms just and reasonable.

Subject to these standards, the contents of individual school meals is a matter for either school governing bodies or local education authorities, depending on whether or not funding has been delegated to schools. DfES has published Healthy School Lunch guidance in which the Secretary of State strongly recommends that the value of a free school meal should be set to enable eligible children to have a standard two course lunch and drink. Schools are strongly encouraged to provide drinking water free of charge. Pupils entitled to free school meals cannot substitute other school food such as breakfast or break-time snacks for food served at lunchtime.

<p><a name="50524w03.html_spnew2"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The impact on UK businesses of increases in gas and energy prices will depend on a variety of factors, including how much gas or energy a particular company uses, the degree of their exposure to spot and forward prices and the duration of high prices. It will also be affected by the energy prices paid by their competitors. A further sector-specific issue is whether they are in a competitive market where international trade sets the price or in a sector where prices are determined more locally and rising energy costs could be passed on.

<p>
<a name="50524w03.html_para2">
Despite recent rises, UK gas and electricity prices for industrial users in 2004 were lower in real terms than they were in 1994. In January 2005, UK gas and electricity prices for small, medium and large energy

There is anecdotal evidence that, for very large users of gas, gas prices in the UK are above those on the Continent. The Department is in discussion with the Energy Intensive Users Group and other industrial stakeholders to develop ideas for improving the operation of the forward market and to identify ways users can mitigate the effects of high forward gas prices. On 16 May the DTI held a seminar with major users to discuss forward gas prices and we are planning a further similar seminar with smaller users. We have undertaken research into the operation of the forward gas market.

 The declarations attached to the Agreement between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco on the participation of Morocco in the EU operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has no effect on the liability of UK personnel serving in the Balkans.

[548]</p>




<p><a name="50524w05.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 While Bevin Boys were called up and allotted National Service Registration Numbers, they were not enlisted or conscripted into HM Armed Forces. They remained civilians, mobilised to perform essential works. This being so, any illness or disablement suffered as a consequence would not have arisen as a direct result of enemy action and therefore would not fall for consideration as a war injury under the war pension scheme.

The main causes of food poisoning are often unknown, as food poisoning is a diagnosis based on clinical suspicion rather than laboratory confirmation. Notified cases of food poisoning are not considered to be a reliable indicator of food-borne disease due to considerable under-reporting.

The HPA has estimated that, in 2000, there may have been as many as 1.3 million cases of food-borne disease acquired in England and Wales, of which around 370,000 consulted a doctor. In that year, only 86,528 cases of food poisoning were notified.

 This information is not collected directly as it is not possible to identify individual patients affected by air pollution. The link between air pollution and hospital admissions is derived from statistical correlations between daily air pollution levels and routine daily statistics on total respiratory hospital admissions. The national health service costs given as follows should be regarded only as rough estimates based on average figures.

The Department&#039;s committee on the medical effects of air pollutants (COMEAP) estimated in 1998 <sup>1</sup>  that there were 10,500 respiratory hospital admissions (additional or brought forward) per year due to PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub>  (PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub>  refers to the mass of particles less than 10 pm in diameter per cubic metre of air) in urban areas of Great Britain. The equivalent estimate for sulphur dioxide (SO <sub>2</sub> ) was 3,500 respiratory hospital admissions.

Assuming that two thirds of the PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub>  2 and the vast majority of SO <sub>2</sub>  in urban areas is due directly or indirectly to fuel emissions from transport or from industry, as a rough estimate it can be assumed that up to around 10,500 respiratory hospital admissions in urban areas of Great Britain may be related to emissions from fuel products.

<a name="50524w10.html_para12">
The Department&#039;s ad-hoc group on the economic appraisal of the health effects of air pollution estimated in 1999 that the average cost of an emergency respiratory hospital admission was around &#163;1,400. This gives a rough estimate of NHS costs due to emissions from fuel products of up to &#163;14.7 million (&#163;17.3 million in 2004 prices). This is an upper bound assuming that all

Before April 2003 there was no separate, specific budget set for expenditure on immigration and asylum matters. Basic advice and representation before the Immigration Appellate Authorities was included within the overall budget for controlled work and representation in the courts for judicial reviews and appeals was included within the budget for licensed work generally. From 1 April 2003, in cooperation with the Home Office, we set up a single asylum fund (SAF) to improve overall control of immigration spend. The Legal Services Commission&#039;s allocations from SAF budgets for 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 were &#163;186 million and &#163;143.2 million respectively.

No judge may hear a case involving rape or a serious sexual offence in the first instance without first having received appropriate JSB training, and the designated course for this is the Serious Sexual Offences Seminar (SSOS). Those authorised will be called to continuation training every three years from the date of their first attendance. SSOS is currently designed to cater for both those newly authorised and those receiving continuation training on the basis that a strong element of the training is in the sharing of experiences in general discussions, and in particular during the syndicate work for sentencing and practical problems. However, the question as to whether there should be separate seminars for those attending for the first time, and those receiving continuation training, is kept under review.

<p>
<a name="50524w14.html_para1">
The seminar is currently a residential two-day (over three) event and past programmes have included talks on the following:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">(1) research into public attitudes to sexual offending and the views of complainants and victims on the way in which sexual offences proceedings are handled.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">(2) The policies and practices of the police and Crown Prosecution Service in handling serious sexual offences.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">(3) Issues of evidential and procedural law and practice which bear on the conduct of trials in such cases.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">(4) Sentencing issues and the assessment and treatment of sexual offenders in the community and in prison. Also included in the programme is a series of discussions, in small groups, of trial and sentencing issues.</p>

In addition, judges of every rank, including the High Court and the Court of Appeal, who exercise the criminal jurisdiction, also received some training on the provisions of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 as part of a programme of training on the Criminal Justice Reforms that ran between January and March 2005.
