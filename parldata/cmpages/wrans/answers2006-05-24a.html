evaluations for some 25,000 staff in total. It was acknowledged at the
start that this would be a complex exercise that would take a
considerable amount of time. It was therefore agreed that the effective
date of any re-grading would be 1 January 1995 so that no member of
staff would be disadvantaged by having to wait for the evaluation of
their post.</p><p><a name="06052547000374">Classroom

Thomas:</b> The UK Government believe that the question of
patenting of plants and animals should be carefully considered by
developing countries. The UK Government also strongly believe that the
flexibilities contained in the Trade Related aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement, Article 27.3(b), are important and
should be used. The TRIPs agreement indeed allows the World Trade
Organisation (WTO) members to exclude plant varieties from
patentability. However, the WTO members are required to provide for
plant varieties protection either by patents or by an effective sui
generis system or by any combination thereof. The TRIPS agreement also
makes clear that WTO members have to provide patents for inventions
involving microbiological and non-biological processes, which would
include genetic modification
technology.</p><p><a name="06052547000700">The UK
Government agree that sui generis systems for protecting plant
varieties may be a more suitable option for many developing
countries.</p><p><a name="06052547000701">There are a
certain number of issues to consider when restricting the application
of patenting in agricultural biotechnology. The interpretation of the
TRIPS provisions is one of them, as there is no agreed international
legal definition of &#147;micro-organism&#148;. We believe that it
is legitimate for the WTO member states to make a reasonable definition
of &#147;micro-organism&#148; for themselves. The UK Government are
also of the view that developing countries could consider in sui
generis systems the use of exceptions to exclusive rights for research
and plant breeding purpose, as well as to enable farmers to save and
plant back seed, including the possibility of informal exchange and
sale.</p><p><a name="06052547000702">The UK
Government are supporting the rapid implementation of the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) International Treaty on
Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA), which came
into force in 2004. The ITPGRFA has the objective to facilitate access
to genetic resources, and recognises the contribution of farmers in
conserving, improving and making these resources available. It also
covers the question of farmer&#146;s rights. DFID supported the
International Plant Genetic Research Institute (IPGRI) in advising the
FAO on development of the ITPGRFA.</p><p><a name="06052547000703">DFID has funded analytical work
that takes these issues into consideration. DFID provided support to 
<br><notus-date day="24" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>24 May 2006 : Column 1783W</b><br>the Secretariat of the independent UK Commission on Intellectual
Property Rights, which reported in September 2002 and provided a
breakthrough analysis of the implications of intellectual property
protection for development. DFID has since provided funding for a
UNCTAD&#151;International Centre for Trade and Sustainable
Development joint project on intellectual property in Geneva, as well
as work carried out by the Quaker United Nations Office in Geneva.
These projects have produced highly valued analytical papers, technical
dialogues and research cooperation projects with regional institutions,
covering agricultural and plant variety patent
protection.</p><p><a name="06052547000704">DFID has
not provided any direct technical assistance or capacity building
support to developing countries to help them define restrictions to the
application of patenting in agricultural biotechnology in a manner
consistent with the TRIPS Agreement. DFID&#146;s development
assistance is recipient driven, and countries are defining their own
development priorities. Should interested developing countries
formulate future requests for assistance in these issues, DFID will
consider how to answer such needs. Specialised international and
national intellectual property agencies or offices are technically
better placed to provide such assistance and the UK Patent Office has
provided training and assistance to developing countries and less
developed countries when
requested.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052547000055">State

Thomas:</b> DFID recognises the importance of traditional
knowledge to communities, and especially poor farmers, in developing
countries and to ensure their rights to, and benefits from this
knowledge are protected. DFID has taken a number of steps to help
achieve this.</p><p><a name="06052547000737">In
relation to DFID funded research, all our contracts specify that the
retention of intellectual property rights (IPR) should be freely
available for non-commercial use by any organisation or individual.
This ensures DFID research outputs cannot be captured in patents, and
that traditional knowledge is
protected.</p><p><a name="06052547000738">DFID has
directly commissioned work on traditional knowledge. This included a
survey on IPR and sustainable human development in 2000. This review
investigated the suitability of IPR regimes for protecting traditional
knowledge and concluded that patents are generally unsuitable, but that
other IPR regimes required further
investigation.</p><p><a name="06052547000739">In
2003, DFID produced a briefing on TRIPS (the Trade Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights Agreement) and development. This
investigated how IPR regimes could take greater account of developing
country interests, and raised the concern that TRIPS does not cover
traditional knowledge. We are working with the World Intellectual
Property Organisation (WIPO) on this. This issue was again recognised
by the Commission for Africa which my right hon. Friend, the Secretary
of State for International Development was a member. The
Commission&#146;s Report stated that developed countries should

Research Institute (IFPRI) is conducting ethnobotanical research to
identify where and how genetic diversity in crops is found and valued.
The International Plant Genetic Research Institute (IPGRI) has
developed an Indigenous Knowledge Journal to help empower knowledge
holders. Under this farmers document their knowledge on a topic on
audio tape, or any media, in their own language which can then be
listed in scientific
journals.</p><p><a name="06052547000741">At the
national level DFID has supported a range of initiatives on traditional

partnership with the Government to explore opportunities for supporting
traditional forest management systems where communities directly
benefit from their traditional
knowledge.</p><p><a name="06052547000742">We
supported the IPGRI in advising the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO) on development of the International Treaty on Plant
Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. DFID has not yet carried
out any studies to assess the effectiveness of the Treaty as it only
recently came into force in June
2004.</p><p><a name="06052547000743">Alongside the
Treaty the Global Crop Diversity Trust was established and this will
set up gene banks to preserve existing plant material. The issue of the
diversity in animal genetic resources is under discussion including the
possibility of a new Treaty. DFID is financing studies on this to help
inform discussion in the
FAO.</p><p><a name="06052547000744">We have funded
dialogues on traditional knowledge, for example through a joint project
with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
and the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development
(ICTSD). This project contributed to enhancing developing
countries&#146; engagement in World Trade Organisation (WTO) and WIPO
discussions.</p><p><a name="06052547000745">DFID has
supported the work of the 2002 Commission on Intellectual Property

recently published Green Paper; A new deal for welfare: Empowering
people to work sets out proposals for piloting new initiatives to help
local partners work together to improve economic regeneration through
skills, employment and
health.</p><p><a name="06052547000876">Each local
area will be asked to develop a consortium comprising local partners
with a shared interest in working together to raise local employment
rates and improve the local economy. This may include local
authorities, employers, learning and skills councils, regional
development agencies, primary care trusts and Jobcentre Plus. The key
aim of this initiative will be to provide a solution that offers the
maximum degree of local flexibility, so that local areas can provide
local solutions to local problems.</p>

The above includes those old-scheme cases with a Full Maintenance
Assessment, and those new-scheme cases with either a Full Maintenance
Calculation, or a Default Maintenance Decision. Old-scheme cases with a
punitive Interim Maintenance Assessment are excluded from this analysis
in line with the Agency&#146;s case compliance target definition, as
are new-scheme cases being processed clerically. 2. Cases are
classed as compliant if they are currently open, and have been charged
and paid money via the collection service (either regular maintenance
and/or arrears) over the preceding quarter. 3. Volumes are
rounded to the nearest thousand and percentages to nearest whole
percent. 4. Robust data from the new IT system (CS2) covering
the period March 2003-March 2004 is not currently available, and is
under development. Data prior to November 1995 is not currently
available.<br></td></tr></table><br>

For certain groups of female personnel, data on exits on marriage or

The term premature voluntary release (PVR) has been changed to
voluntary outflow (VO) although the methodology remains the
same.<br>4. For this
purpose, VO is defined as all applications and exits from trained
personnel which are generated by the individual before their time
expiry.<br>5. Females who
leave on pregnancy grounds are included in both VO applications and
exits wherever possible. It should be noted that since August 1990,
female personnel who are pregnant are no longer required to leave the
services, but have an option of either leaving or returning to work
after maternity leave. All applications are counted according to the
date received in MOD.<br>6.
Due to the rounding methods used, totals may not always equal the sum

been rounded to the nearest multiple of 20 to prevent systematic

are causally linked to the 1990-91 Gulf Conflict but that Gulf War
Syndrome does not exist as a &#145;discrete pathological
entity&#146;, or in other words as a recognised disease. A written
statement was published on 24 November 2005, <i> Official Report</i>,
columns 128-29WS, setting out our position on this issue. We do not
hold figures for those claiming &#145;Gulf War Syndrome&#146; but
since the PAT decision the umbrella term has been applied in six

figures, as at the end of December 2005, show that about 3,025 veterans

receipt of a war disablement pension for any condition for which an
award would be payable. In addition, at that date, 2,515 such veterans
had received a gratuity for disablement assessed at under 20 per cent.
There will be some overlap between those figures, as some individuals
will have received first a gratuity and then a pension. The figures
include awards for both Gulf-related and non-Gulf-related injuries or
illnesses, as our records do not distinguish the origin of the
disablement (including awards where Gulf War Syndrome is appropriate as
an umbrella term). The claimants are former members of the armed
forces. Serving members of the armed forces are not covered by the War
Pension Scheme but they and MOD) civilians are covered by other
occupational
schemes.</p><p><a name="06052547001878">In addition,

requires a range of animal by-products and substances derived from them
(including tallow), to be disposed of as waste. Where the method of
disposal is incineration or co-incineration (i.e. use as a fuel), the

incineration directive (WID). Installations may burn tallow provided
they comply with these

Ofwat has assessed water company performance against leakage targets
that balance the needs of customers and the environment. This approach
has resulted in a reduction in leakage of around 29 per cent. since
1994-95.</p><p><a name="06052547001986">In 2001,
following Thames Water's failure to meet their leakage targets, Ofwat
suspended the company's leakage targets in favour of an action plan to
improve its leakage monitoring and control activities. Thames Water is
also required to provide quarterly reports on progress with its agreed
leakage reduction plan. The aim is to restore leakage to its target
level and achieve adequate security of
supplies.</p><p><a name="06052547001987">The company
is now carrying out 60 per cent. more repairs than two years ago, and a
major upgrade of its water distribution network in London is under way.

2010. In 2004-05 Thames Water reduced its overall leakage for the first

determine the exact implications of an appreciation of the Chinese

the Chinese renminbi against the US dollar could result in an
appreciation, depreciation or no change against UK sterling. However,
the sterling effective exchange rate has been relatively stable in
recent years. Since the introduction of the euro in 1999, the
volatility of sterling's effective exchange rate has been under half
that of the euro and around a third that of the US dollar. At the same

Flint:</b> The National programme is already the focus of
regular and routine audit, scrutiny and review. It has been subject
from its inception to the Office of Government Commerce Gateway
process. Gateway reviews have been, and continue to be, undertaken at
each of the standard stages throughout the development of every
component project within the programme, and of its cluster-based
deployment activity from initiation through to live running. A similar
annual and ongoing programme of audit reviews has been, and continues
to be, carried out by the Department's internal
auditors.</p><p><a name="06052547003524">A
National Audit Office (NAO) value for money study into choice at the
point of referral, which reported in January 2005, involved close
scrutiny of the work of the national programme and specifically the
choose and book programme. The report on a further NAO value for money
study into wider aspects of the programme has yet to be published, and
this has included an independent review of programme management
capability.</p><p><a name="06052547003525">In
addition, the programme's own quality management function undertakes a
broad range of reviews and audits of specific aspects of programme,
cluster and supplier activity on an ongoing
basis.</p><p><a name="06052547003526">A
number of independent reviews have been commissioned under contract,
including one commissioned from McKinsey to inform the approach before
the start of the programme, and from other suppliers to establish the
value for the national health service and taxpayer achieved through the
contracts and to examine specific aspects such as disaster recovery.
Ongoing review is also encouraged by transparent discussion with key
stakeholder groups including the British Medical Association and
through consultation initiated by the care record development
board.</p><p><a name="06052547003527">We
remain confident that the technical architecture of the national
programme is appropriate and will enable benefits to be delivered for
patients, and value for money for the taxpayer, without further
independent scrutiny.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052547000232">Neonatal Units

issued by the Department in 2001 following on from the cross-government
zero tolerance campaign introduced in 2000, to tackle violence in the
NHS. The guidance highlighted that the withholding of NHS treatment
from violent and abusive patients will always be a last resort, but
should be an option available to managers and staff working in all NHS
trusts, with certain exemptions including those requiring urgent
medical treatment or under the age of 16. The guidance made explicit
that all NHS trusts develop local policies on withholding treatment
from violent and abusive patients in consultation with independent
legal advice on the terms and application of such a policy; and trusts
must also have in place clear defensible policies and procedures
outlining the circumstances where the withholding of treatment is

completed for the study suggested that a &#145;revenue
