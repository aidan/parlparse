 The new rules for the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme 2011-12 were announced in March 2011. Under the new scheme, the available budget will be divided into quarterly budgets and then shared pro-rata between all claims received. Obviously we hope that the budget will cover the full rate of VAT for all claimants but, if it doesn't, an apportionment will be made and this will be announced on the Listed Places of Worship website. The first payments in this financial year are due to be made at the end of the second quarter.</p>

I will not be in a position to confirm whether claims can be paid in full until all claims for the first quarter of the year have been submitted and processed. The rate of payment will be published on the Listed Places of Worship website once this process is complete.</p>

 Open data can be transformative for public services, practitioners and users. We have already seen this in the health context where death rates in coronary artery surgery, for example, have fallen as a result of public reporting of outcomes. We have committed to release a wealth of new data on other public services which we hope will increase accountability and performance.</p>

 Responsibility for the regulations governing the licensing of charitable collections rests with the Cabinet Office. The Charities Act 2006 licensing provisions have not been implemented and will be considered as part of the review of the Charities Act 2006, due to begin later this year. Once the review has made its recommendations I will discuss them with ministerial colleagues. We want to make it easier for legitimate charities to fundraise responsibly, whilst deterring bogus collectors and preventing nuisance for members of the public. Local authorities, trading standards, and the police already have a range of powers to tackle bogus or unlicensed collections and nuisance.</p>

 To support the Government's mandate to centralise the procurement of common goods and services, the Efficiency and Reform Group in the Cabinet Office undertook an analysis of procurement spend for the 2009-10 financial year. It reviewed spend for specific procurement categories across central Government departments, in order to determine if it could be centralised. We will continue to review spend by Departments in categories that are centralised, in order to ensure the optimum supply strategy is in place for central Government.</p>

 On 1 November 2010 the Government reiterated their policy of paying 80% of undisputed invoices within five days and ensuring that prime contractors paid tier two suppliers within 30 days through use of a contract condition. On 19 July I made further announcements to improve payment performance. These included a requirement for Departments to actively contract manage the performance of prime contractors, the Crown Representatives encouraging key suppliers to pay more quickly than in 30 days and encouraging suppliers to report issues of late payment to Cabinet Office's Mystery Shopper service. Departments are not required to publish payment data on a central repository, though some Departments choose to publish performance on departmental websites.</p>

 The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) does not have reliable figures for this. Compensation for victims of violent crime is based on the injuries people sustain not the particular crimes of which they were a victim. The injuries for which CICA can compensate, and therefore provide reliable figures for, are set out in the Tariff of Injuries in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2008, but the Tariff does not contain any injuries specific to dog attacks.</p>

 The closure of Latchmere House prison will result in the loss of 79 staff posts. All staff are being offered alternative employment at other prisons or young offender institutions within the Greater London region or elsewhere. Five staff who were eligible to do so have decided to leave the Prison Service and formally retire. In line with the Service's procedures for redeployment and prison closures, staff have been offered suitable alternative employment at a location within approximately 60 minutes travelling distance of their home. Any additional travelling costs incurred by the change of location are met by the Service for a limited period to ease the process of transition.</p>

 Useable operational capacity is the sum of all establishments’ operational capacity, as set out in the following table, less 2,000 places. This is known as the operating margin and reflects the constraints imposed by the need to provide separate accommodation for different classes of prisoner i.e. by sex, age, security category, conviction status, single cell risk assessment and also due to geographical distribution.</p>

 The following table shows the number of prisoners serving determinate sentences for sex offences who were discharged from prison in 2008, 2009 and 2010 by type of discharging prison. Prisons are classified according to their predominant function. Security categories A, B, C, and D relate to categories of adult male prisoner and do not directly relate to individual establishments. So, for example, an establishment categorised as security category B may hold offenders of all categories up to, but not above, B. Female prisoners and young offenders are not categorised in this way. Cluster prisons have been shown separately because they hold a wide range of security categories and cannot be easily simplified as a single category of prison.</p>

 Useable operational capacity is the sum of all establishments' operational capacity, as set out in the table provided, less 2,000 places. This is known as the operating margin and reflects the constraints imposed by the need to provide separate accommodation tor different classes of prisoner i.e. by sex, age, security category, conviction status, single cell risk assessment and also due to geographical distribution.</p>

               <i>R</i>
               <i>eport</i>, column 188W. Operation Safeguard is required when the size or distribution of the prison population is such that it can no longer be managed within the available capacity.</p>

               <a name="11090879000215"> Pressures in managing the population arise from a number of factors. These include the size of particular demographic sections of the prison population and capacity available to accommodate those segments, the geographic distribution of population between regions and NOMS ability to transfer prisoners to maximise the use of space, and whether there are any sudden local increases in population or losses of accommodation.</p>

For both of these offences the mandatory minimum is three years. Table 1 includes details of cautions, absolute discharges and conditional discharges for the first of these offences. Table 2 shows the number of third time domestic burglary offenders, by type of sentence in England and Wales from 2006 to 2010 (including absolute discharges and conditional discharges).

                     <sup>(1)</sup> Offences under Firearms Act 1968 of: Possessing or distributing prohibited weapons or ammunition, or Possessing or distributing firearm disguised as other object.
<sup>(2)</sup> The mandatory minimum sentence is only applicable for offences that occurred on or after 26 January 2004.
<sup>(3)</sup> Mandatory minimum for persons aged 16 or 17 at time of offence and for offences taking place after 26 January 2004 is 3 years. Not all of those in this age bracket would have been eligible for the mandatory minimum as they may have been under 16 at the time of the offence; it is the age at the point of sentence that is recorded on the court proceedings database
<sup>(4)</sup> Mandatory minimum for persons aged over 18 at time of offence and for offences taking place after 26 January 2004 is 5 years. Not all of those in this age bracket would have been eligible for the mandatory minimum as they may have been under 18 at the time of the offence; it is the age at the point of sentence that is recorded on courts proceedings database.
<sup>(5)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(6)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.
<sup>(7)</sup> Excludes data for Cardiff magistrates court for April, July and August 2008.
<sup>(8)</sup> Includes Fines, Community Sentences, Suspended Sentences and other sentences.
<sup>(9)</sup> The cautions statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When an offender has been cautioned for two or more offences at the same time the principal offence is the more serious offence. From 1 June 2000 the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 came into force nationally and removed the use of cautions for persons under 18 and replaced them with reprimands and warnings. These figures have been included in the totals.

We have raised the subject with them regularly, to ensure that weapons are secured and the situation closely monitored. The NTC has achieved much in tackling security across Libya in recent weeks, by establishing clear command and control structures and ensuring safekeeping of weapons. This remains a priority for the Government and we will continue to raise with the NTC and discuss ways we can support their efforts to counter proliferation.</p>

 The Government are committed to reducing net migration to the United Kingdom. This requires action across all immigration routes of entry. Against that background, the consultation document ‘Employment-Related Settlement, Tier 5 and Overseas Domestic Workers’, published on 9 June, sets out proposed changes to Tier 5. This includes a proposal to cap leave across the Tier 5 Temporary Worker route, which includes Government Authorised Exchange schemes, of which the Medical Training Initiative is one. The purpose of the consultation is to invite views on this proposal. The consultation closes on 9 September. A decision on the way forward will be assessed in the light of responses to the consultation, including those from the Royal Colleges.</p>

 In response to necessary reductions in central Government funding, every police force should be driving through efficiencies and rooting out wasteful spending in order to maintain or improve services while providing them at lower cost. The Government are playing their part by reducing central direction, getting rid of needless bureaucracy, cutting out wasted time and money in IT, and making sure police forces make the most of their vast purchasing power by buying together.</p>

An allocation of £20.8 million for FirstBuy in London was announced on 20 June 2011.

From 2012-13 an additional £350 will be payable for each affordable home. This unringfenced funding will ensure that the benefits of housing growth are visible to the communities affected.

 Analysis undertaken for the renewable heat incentive (RHI) impact assessment (published March 2011) suggests a contribution of around 5 TWh of renewable heat from biomass combined heat and power (CHP) by 2020 based on a 2.5p/kWh tariff (equating to around 9% of 58 TWh). However, actual uptake is uncertain. Our estimates will be subject to further analysis and updated in the light of the proposals in the forthcoming consultation on the banding review of the renewables obligation.</p>

The NPS for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5) specifically covers the impacts of overhead lines as well as the undergrounding of lines that National Grid will need to consider when preparing an application for development consent.</p>

 From late 2012 the Green Deal will be available to British households and businesses. While there are no Government plans for a national roll-out, the type of partnership arrangements that underpin London's RE:NEW programme is certainly an approach we envisage will be relevant under the Green Deal. Furthermore, under the Home Energy Conservation Act we will encourage local authorities to work together and with the private sector to deliver energy efficiency improvements.</p>

 The Government are sympathetic to the plight of many off-grid energy consumers who were hit hard by high prices and supply issues last winter. We are keen that the reasons for this are thoroughly investigated which is why I wrote to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in January to ask it to bring forward its competition and consumer study into off-grid energy. The OFT has launched its market study into the off-grid energy market on 15 March and will publish its findings in October 2011. The market study will provide an independent assessment of the off-grid market and establish what further action may be necessary to ensure it works properly.</p>

Government are working to ensure 600,000 of the poorest pensioners receive a £120 discount on their electricity bill this year, ensuring eligible households off the gas grid will benefit. Other groups such as low income families and those with long-term illnesses and disabilities may also receive this discount; they may also receive assistance under transitional arrangements from the previous voluntary agreement.

 Analysis undertaken for the Renewable heat incentive (RHI) impact assessment (published March 2011) suggests around £7 million of spending on biomass combined heat and power (CHP) in 2014 based on a 2.5p/kWh tariff. Our modelling assumes that biomass CHP projects will only come forward above 1,000 kilowatt thermal and are incentivised by the renewables obligation until 2013 and by the RHI between 2014-20. However, actual uptake is uncertain so some smaller projects may nevertheless come forward under the RHI. Our estimates will be subject to further analysis and updated in the light of the proposals in the forthcoming consultation on the banding review of the renewables obligation.</p>

 Payments may be paid to Service personnel, and Ministry of Defence (MOD) civilian employees appointed overseas, to allow their children to achieve a stable education. These are made via Continuity of Education Allowance (CEA) for Service personnel, and School Allowance (SA) for civilians. Limits apply in respect of the amount that can be claimed and all claims are subject to a parental minimum contribution of 10%. Changes to the regulations governing CEA came into effect on 1 April 2011. Amounts payable were not reduced, but changes to the eligibility rules and the governance of claims will reduce the Department's spend. These changes are expected to have an impact in Financial Year 2011-20.</p>

 Eligibility for a staff car is currently dependent upon the nature of the duties of an appointment, and it is the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence (MOD)'s top level budget holders to identify and justify which appointments have such eligibility. For officers and civil servants holding equivalent military rank, eligibility is generally linked to command status, but certain officers holding key staff appointments may also be eligible. This policy applies across the MOD and its agencies, including the trading funds, and their chief executives.</p>

 The Department's Management Information indicates that since October 2010, around 7,300 incapacity benefits claimants in Scotland have been through the work capability assessment part of the incapacity benefits reassessment process. This includes those involved in the incapacity benefits reassessment trial, and those assessed face-to-face, cases assessed on paper scrutiny and therefore not requiring a face-to-face work capability assessment, and those that have had a recommendation based on their non-compliance with the assessment process.</p>

 The Secretary of State had a meeting on the 13 July with representatives of the Grameen Scotland Foundation at which a proposal to introduce the ‘UK Enterprise from Welfare Transition Scheme’ to help people into self-employment was discussed. Part of the proposal was to waive or disregard micro finance and the income generated during participation on the scheme across the current benefit system for the first two years of participation.</p>

We have therefore introduced the new enterprise allowance (NEA). The NEA provides mentoring and financial support in the form of a weekly allowance and small loan.</p>

 The Welfare Reform White Paper sets out that the Department for Work and Pensions will be responsible for organising the delivery of universal credit. It also states that we will continue to pay housing benefit to working age customers until we can migrate them successfully on to universal credit, currently expected to be by October 2017. We are working on the precise details of how the transition will work, and the effects on housing benefits staff. This approach will ensure an orderly transition and that we have people with relevant skills and experience to support claimants both in work and out of work, as they migrate to the new credit.</p>

 The estimate of numbers lifted out of poverty as a result of universal credit are based on an assessment of the impact of universal credit using DWP's Policy Simulation Model. This model uses data from the 2008-09 Family Resources Survey (FRS) and uprates incomes and demographics to the relevant year using projections from the Office for Budget Responsibility. The model is able to assess entitlement to universal credit, because of the wide range of personal characteristics reported to the FRS by respondents.</p>

 Individuals who are diagnosed with a progressive disease, where death is a likely consequence of that disease and where this is reasonably expected within six months, will be treated as having limited capability for work and limited capability for work related activity. At any point in the incapacity benefits reassessment process, where there is sufficient evidence that an individual is terminally ill as defined, they will placed in the support group and no further related information requested. However, cases are dealt with on a case by case basis, dependant on available evidence, and so a guarantee cannot be provided that an ESA50 will not be sent to the claimant in every case where insufficient information is available.</p>

If an air ambulance responded to four or more of these patients per year, it could be seen as cost effective in terms of quality adjusted life years.</p>

Therefore the large number of non-blunt trauma cases attended by air ambulances currently reduces cost effectiveness overall.</p>

 The Cancer Drugs Fund was launched on 1 April 2011. Over three years, the fund is providing £200 million a year to help thousands of cancer patients access the drugs their clinicians believe will help them. As an interim measure, an additional £50 million was made available to strategic health authorities (SHAs) in 2010-11 to support improved access to cancer drugs. Since October 2010, this funding has so far helped over 5,000 cancer patients in England to access the cancer drugs their clinicians recommended.</p>

 For value for money savings realised through procurement activity recorded in 2009-10 and 2010-11, the Department has used a methodology based on guidance issued to Departments by the Office of Government Commerce (OGC).

Details of those savings methodologies can be obtained from the Government Procurement Service and the Central Office of Information direct.</p>

 The Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) estimated, on the basis of 2008 data, that particulate air pollution (measured as PM2.5) had an effect on the mortality of the United Kingdom population equivalent to 29,000 deaths in 2008. However, the Committee considered it very unlikely that this represents the total number of individuals affected. Instead it speculated that, given that much of the effect of air pollution on mortality is linked to cardiovascular deaths, then PM2.5s acting together with other factors, may have made some smaller contribution to the earlier deaths of up to 200,000 people.</p>

The guidance reflects the Cabinet Office data handling review in 2008. A number of letters have also been issued by the NHS chief executive, which make clear that patient-identifiable and other personal data must only be held on encrypted mobile devices and laptops and such information should not be e-mailed in an unencrypted form.

 The UK Government have been pressing the Government of Kenya throughout 2011 on the need to allocate more space for refugee camps, working closely with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The Minister for Internal Security recently confirmed that they would open Ifo II camp in Dadaab, which is expected to be occupied by approximately 40,000 refugees. However, with nearly 1,300 people, including children, arriving from Somalia on a daily basis, the process of decongesting the Dadaab camps needs to be accelerated. I raised these points with the Kenyan Prime Minister and the Minister for Internal Security during my visit to Kenya in July. The UK is also providing a substantial package of financial support through UN agencies, to assist new refugees in the Dadaab camps.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) does not allocate funds on the basis of an organisation's business profile. Partners are chosen on a case by case basis to ensure maximum value for money. For planning purposes DFID allocates money by priority pillars. The pillars are wealth creation, governance and security, climate change and global partnerships, as well as DFID funding in support of the Millennium Development Goals (education, health, water and sanitation and humanitarian assistance).</p>

 UK aid will improve farmers' access to markets through the construction and maintenance of over 500 kms of feeder roads, as part of a joint programme with the World Bank, USAID and EU. A trade facilitation programme will establish a customs service and lower the cost of cross-border trade. Further programmes are being developed to promote private sector development, including by addressing corruption and providing incentives to firms to create market opportunities for poorer people. The Department for International Development (DFID) is also helping the Government of South Sudan to improve economic management and investment decisions.</p>

The UK's aid programme in South Sudan will focus on enabling poor people, particularly girls and women, to benefit from more equitable and sustainable services; increased employment and livelihood opportunities—supported by private sector investment; greater security; more accountable and efficient government; and less corruption. DFID is aiming for extensive results including: 1 million people having enough food to eat; 240,000 more children completing primary school; 750,000 people to be treated for or prevented from getting malaria; 4 million people receiving life-saving healthcare and nutrition; 12 million textbooks printed and distributed to almost 2 million children; and increased private sector investment and trade by reducing cross border transport costs up by 15%.</p>

The Department for International Development (DFID) is currently providing £3 million of de-mining assistance to allow those displaced by the conflict to return to their home areas. The high commission also meets with other donors in country, including multilateral organisations to which the UK makes a contribution.</p>

 It is widely recognised (e.g. the 2004 Graham Review) that market failures exist in small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) debt markets, where information needed by lenders to make judgments on individual loan applications may be expensive, or difficult to obtain. Although advances in credit assessment techniques may have helped to overcome these difficulties, barriers resulting from a lack of information may still be faced by certain types of business, in particular those that lack an established track record.</p>

               <a name="11090882000271"> This Department is aware that some businesses can encounter difficulties when accessing bank finance due to a lack of financial track record, or collateral. For instance, the SME Finance Monitor (July 2011) reported that, for SMEs whose borrowing requests were declined, the main reason given was lack of credit history or a poor credit history.</p>

These funds were established using money from the Single Programme and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). In many regions, including the north-west, European funds were used to leverage private sector investment into the VCLF. Across England almost £0.5 billion (RDA funds, ERDF and private investment) has been committed to VCLFs investing in SMEs up to the end of 2015. Of this, £185 million has been committed to the North West Fund. It is expected that 40% of the North West Fund will be invested in Merseyside.</p>

 The Hargreaves review of intellectual property and growth was charged in its terms of reference with a number of aims, including investigating what are the benefits of “fair use” exceptions to copyright and how these might be achieved in the UK. The review concluded that a broad legal mechanism similar to US fair use would not be practical within the EU framework, but that there is a need for more flexibility in order to meet new opportunities. Therefore the review recommended that the UK should make more use of the freedoms available within the EU framework, including permitting consumers to make private copies of copyright works in order to use them within fair and reasonable limits.</p>

The Government have no intention of prejudicing the fundamental role of copyright in providing appropriate incentives for the creation of valuable works, on which much value for the UK depends. We nonetheless believe the review is right to identify activities that copyright currently over-regulates unnecessarily to the detriment of the UK, and we will propose a substantial opening up of the UK's copyright exceptions regime, as set out in our response to the review. The Government will also press at EU level for a wider set of exceptions to secure further flexibilities without prejudicing appropriate incentives for creation of works.</p>

 If the goods or technology to be exported are specified on a UK or EU control list, or if the exporter has been informed that non-listed items may be intended for a weapons of mass destruction (WMD)-related end-use or a military end-use in an embargoed destination (such as Iran), the items can only be exported under a valid licence issued by the Export Control Organisation (ECO). If the exporter is aware that non-listed items may be intended for a WMD-related end-use or a military end-use in an embargoed destination they must notify the ECO before exporting the items and the ECO will determine whether or not an export licence is required. If the exporter has grounds for suspecting a WMD-related end-use they must not export the items unless they have made all reasonable inquiries as to their actual end-use and satisfied themselves that they will not be used for WMD-related purposes. A breach of any of the above requirements is a criminal offence. The Government offers an advice service regarding whether an export requires a licence or not, and strongly advises that any exporter who is unsure on this point should use this service.</p>

 No assessment has been made as small and medium-sized enterprises can bid directly to the Regional Growth Fund (RGF) either on their own or they may come together to submit a package of projects which make a coherent whole but which individually would not meet the minimum bidding threshold of £1 million. Furthermore, four out of the 50 successful bids to Round 1 were conditionally allocated funding for small and medium enterprise support schemes. RGF funding for these four schemes totals £175 million, which was almost 40% of all the funds allocated (£450 million) in Round 1.</p>

 The National Drug Treatment Monitoring System (NDTMS) collects information on the number of young people in specialist substance misuse services in England. In 2009-10, there were 480 young people under 18 in treatment who had opiates as their main problem drug and, of these, 294 received pharmacological interventions. NDTMS does not distinguish between opiate substitute drugs (such as methadone or buprenorphine), other prescribed drugs (such as Ritalin for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), or what they are prescribed for (in this context it could include prescribing for detoxification, stabilisation and symptomatic relief of substance misuse). Information on the doses prescribed is not recorded within NDTMS nor held centrally.</p>

               <a name="1109091000076"> Young people's substance misuse is markedly different to that of adults. Young people tend to have shorter histories of substance use and have used lower levels of drugs for shorter periods. They are therefore much less likely to be physically dependent. 2% of young people in treatment in 2009-10 had heroin or crack cocaine as their primary problem substance.</p>

               <a name="1109091000077"> Substitute prescribing for under-18s is therefore rare, and it is expected that if young people are receiving substitute prescribing, it should normally be as part of a reduction or detoxification programme. Most substance misuse interventions for young people focus on psychosocial counselling-based therapies aimed at achieving abstinence.</p>

               <a name="1109091000078"> This is supported by NDTMS figures, which show that of the 294 young people with opiate problems receiving pharmacological interventions in 2009/10, 78 were continuously receiving these interventions a year later. This suggests that of the total 23,528 young people receiving interventions for substance misuse, 0.3% were prescribed methadone or other substitute opioids on a maintenance basis.</p>

Therefore the YPLA does not hold data about the number of young people that are expected to benefit from the bursary scheme in each local authority area. We expect that in many cases providers will want to agree a consistent approach across an area, taking account of the needs and circumstances of young people locally.</p>

 In addition to the 900 responses to the call of evidence for Mr Darren Henley's review of music education in 2010, the Department for Education received between January and July this year almost 400 items of correspondence from people concerned about music education.

In addition to announcing a funding settlement for music education of £82.5 million for 2011-12, the Government pledged to eliminate historical discrepancies in funding. Moving to a more transparent funding formula has resulted in some local authorities receiving an increase in funding, while we have guaranteed that no local authority would lose more than 10% of its funding compared to 2010-11. The majority of the funding for 2011-12 will go to the front line to deliver music education.</p>

1. Price Base: Real terms at 2010-11 prices, based on GDP deflators as at 29 June 2011.
2. Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of Standard Spending Assessment/Education Formula Spending (EFS) settlements and exclude the pensions transfer to EFS and YPLA.
3. Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfE Departmental Expenditure Limits relevant to pupils aged three to 19 and exclude Education Maintenance Allowances (EMAs) and grants not allocated at LEA level.
4. Where responsibility for funding a school has transferred from an authority, related funding no longer appears in the series.
5. The pupil numbers used to convert £ million figures to £ per pupil are those underlying the SSA/EFS settlement calculations plus PLASC three-year-old maintained pupils and estimated three to four-year-olds funded through state support in maintained and other educational institutions where these are not included in the SSA pupil numbers.
6. Rounding: Total figures are rounded to the nearest £0.1 million, per pupil figures are rounded to the nearest £10.

This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable. An alternative time series is currently under development.</p>

 The special educational needs (SEN) and disability Green Paper, “Support and aspiration”, set out a strong strategic role for local authorities in England acting as the champions of vulnerable children, including those with SEN, and their families. The three core features of this role will be: working with local partners, such as Health and Wellbeing Boards, to plan strategically for services to meet the needs of local communities; commissioning high quality provision for disabled children and those with SEN; and enabling families to make informed choices and exercise greater control over services, by, for example, setting out a local offer of provision for these children.</p>

In the move from SEN statements to Education, Health and Care Plans parents will retain the right to request a mainstream education for their children if that is what they want and local authorities will still be under a conditional duty to send those children to mainstream schools and those schools will be under a duty, or obligation in the case of academies, to admit the child.</p>
