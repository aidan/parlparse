To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list by constituency the railway stations and railway lines in Shropshire which have been <i>(a)</i> closed and <i>(b)</i> opened (i) between 1979 to 1997 and (ii) since May 1997.  [118540]

<P>
<a name="00414w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 This information is not held in the form requested. However, I am aware that Telford Central station was opened in 1985, and that New Hadley station was closed in the same year. A freight only line from Shrewsbury Sutton Bridge to Abbey Foregate was closed in the late 1980s. The Rail Regulator has not given consent to closure of any passenger services or stations in Shropshire since the provisions of the Railway Act in 1993 came into force.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the number of households that will be taken out of fuel poverty by Government schemes in each of the next 15 years; and what estimate he has made of the cost of such schemes in each of the next 15 years.

<P>
<a name="00414w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 A key programme is the New Home Energy Efficiency Scheme, which with a budget of &#163;260 million over the next two years, is currently expected to take 460,000 households out of fuel poverty. The impact of other policies on the number of fuel poor households is less clear.
<P>

<a name="00414w01.html_para0">We estimate the number of households in fuel poverty is currently about 4.5 million, and that at current rates of the HEES programme the great majority should be removed from fuel poverty within a decade.

<BR>
Porous asphalt was introduced by the Highways Agency for use on trunk roads in 1993. At that time it was the only option available for providing a quieter road surface but was not suitable for use in all situations. Further development resulted in alternatives including proprietary quiet, thin surfacings, and in 1998, 'whisper' concrete. These two materials offer many of the advantages of porous asphalt with few of its drawbacks, not least its high cost. This has meant that porous asphalt has been little used.
<BR>
The new quiet surfacings are now being used widely by the Highways Agency both for surfacing new roads and for maintaining existing roads. Their performance is very effective and in use they can often be mistaken for porous asphalt being quiet, and reducing spray in wet weather.
<BR>
If it would be helpful, John Williams our road surfacings specialist, would be pleased to discuss both porous asphalt and other road surfacings in current use with you. His telephone number is 020 7921 4635.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00414w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for what reason road maintenance work was permitted along the Victoria Embankment on the morning of 6 April; what assessment was made of its impact on <i>(a)</i> road congestion and <i>(b)</i> access for emergency services; what assessment was made of the option of carrying out the work at night; and if he will make a statement.  [118650]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00414w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Westminster City Council is the highway authority for Victoria Embankment. I understand that, on the morning of 6 April, contractors working for Westminster City Council took down a lamp column at the junction of Northumberland Avenue and Victoria Embankment. This was required in connection with Hungerford Bridge works, but had become urgent because the lamp column appeared to be unsafe. The works involved a lorry parked across the junction and the erection of traffic cones in Northumberland Avenue and on the eastbound carriageway of Victoria Embankment.
<P>

<a name="00414w01.html_para3">Works of this type in the carriageway are not usually subjected to formal analysis of their effects on congestion or emergency access unless complete closure of the road is required.
<P>

<a name="00414w01.html_para4">Westminster City Council have advised me that it is their policy to carry out works during the working day to avoid the environmental problems caused by working at night and weekends although planned work is avoided at peak hours on traffic sensitive routes.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00414w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 At the end of December 1999, 1,026 trading ships were managed from the United Kingdom. Of these ships, 4.5 million deadweight tonnes were UK-owned and 29.5 million deadweight tonnes non-UK-owned.

(2) Records of concessionary television licences issued moved from a wholly manual system to a computerised system in 1996. This change highlighted the inaccuracy of the earlier system and is thought to account for much of the fall between 1994-95 and 1995-96. <P>

<a name="00414w01.html_para5">A full ten-year record of the number of concessionary licences issued would require manual extraction of information from paper records in the initial years. No records are kept of the number of concessionary licences withdrawn, nor can such information be extracted from existing data, as it is not possible to distinguish between withdrawal of the concession and other reasons for non-renewal.

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office does not have any jurisdiction to investigate these crimes.

We have, however, made it very clear to the Turkish authorities the importance we attach to bringing the killers to justice. The Chief of Police in Istanbul called on the British Consul-General on 8 April to update him on the investigation. He has undertaken to continue to update our consular staff on a regular basis. Consular staff in London will keep the families informed of developments.

Evidence from clinical trials of safety, quality and efficacy of a medicine is part of the information that is assessed by the MCA in coming to a decision about whether a product should be licensed for marketing in the United Kingdom.

 No changes have been made to the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit scheme with regard to asbestos-related diseases specifically since May 1997.

<P><I>14 Apr 2000 : Column: 303W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00414w05.html_para0">In April 1997 considerable changes were made to these provisions following advice and recommendations from the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council set out in their report "Asbestos Related Diseases" (Cm 3467). These changes were beneficial to claimants and introduced wide occupational coverage in respect of mesothelioma and removed the 90 day waiting period that operates for other diseases and accidents within this benefit scheme. Changes were also made with regard to diffuse pleural thickening, ensuring that benefit could be paid if the thickening affected one lung only, where previously both lungs had to be affected.
<P>

<a name="00414w05.html_para1">Since May 1997 the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, whose role is to provide expert independent advice, has continued to carefully monitor developments in this field as it does with regard to all occupational diseases.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what administrative obstacles exist to basing the annual uprating of benefits on the retail prices index for the previous December.  [117590]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00414w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Using the RPI for the previous December, which would not be published until mid-January, would seriously disrupt the uprating process. Current arrangement, which base the uprating on September's RPI, published in mid-October, allow for the preparation of the uprating schedule and for the uprating review itself to be completed by the end of November. At the end of November a computer scan is run to identify and uprate pension cases. The scan is required at this time to ensure that order books (which cover 20 weeks) containing foils that pass the uprating date are issued with the correct amounts. Processes for uprating other Social Security benefits are similar.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security for what reasons interrupted spells as a hospital in-patient are linked for the purpose of assessing reductions in the rates of benefit which are payable.  [118912]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00414w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Rules about the payment of benefits in NHS hospitals have been part of the Social Security system for over 50 years. Where the NHS provides free maintenance and care in hospital, benefits for the same purpose are not paid in full indefinitely.
<P>

<a name="00414w05.html_para2">The rule which links together interrupted spells as a hospital in-patient is based on the premise that people whose stay in hospital follows this pattern will, in general, have some home savings during the period that they are being maintained and cared for free of charge in hospital. They are therefore treated in the same way as people whose stay in hospital is continuous. For periods when the person is at home, full benefit is restored.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to his answer of 30 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 269W, what is the reason for the difference between the cited average saving of &#163;13,000 per year per local authority from the non-redirection of benefit post, and the figures given by his Department in the supplementary memorandum submitted to the Committee of Public Accounts, Session 1998-99, HC643-i, Appendix 2.

<P>
<a name="00414w05.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The figures quoted in the supplementary memorandum to the Committee for Public Accounts was based on a pilot of the Royal Mail "do not redirect" scheme which was carried out over a four week period in 1997 in two local authorities. Benefit savings directly attributable to "do not redirect" for around &#163;200,000 were recorded during the pilot. However, our latest estimate which is based on a telephone survey of a much larger sample of local authorities and involving a number of assumptions is that the average local authority will achieve savings of around &#163;13,000 per year by operating this initiative.

the introduction of a number of other anti-fraud initiatives between the pilot and full introduction of the scheme in February 1999 identifying, preventing and deterring fraud which would otherwise have been identified by "do not redirect"; and
<P>

the possibility that the pilot which was carried out over a short period of time and involved only two local authorities may have identified an unrepresentative number of fraudulent cases which has not been reflected in live running by a much larger group of authorities.

<a name="00414w05.html_para5">We would expect the number of fraudulent cases identified and therefore the amount of savings achieved as a direct result of this initiative to continue to reduce as publicity increases and its deterrent effect becomes stronger.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will list the local authorities that are not using the Royal Mail 'do not redirect' service to counter housing benefit fraud.  [118392]
<P>

<P>
<a name="00414w05.html_spnew7"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Royal Mail have advised that as at 3 April, the 272 local authorities listed had implemented in full the Royal Mail 'do not redirect' service. Of the remaining 137 authorities, a number are preparing to implement the service and some are operating their own local arrangements. It would be inaccurate therefore to describe such authorities as not operation 'do not redirect'.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The current capital rules for the income related benefits were introduced in 1988. The lower and upper limits have applied to the same client groups since introduction, apart from an increase in limits in respect of people living in Residential Care and Nursing Homes which was introduced in April 1996.<P>

2. The capital limits are kept under regular review but are not increased annually. There are no immediate plans to increase capital limits for disabled people.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security for what reason the April state pension increase is determined by reference to the preceding September's RPI; and if he will list the RPI rates for <i>(a)</i> September and <i>(b)</i> April in each year since September 1994.  [118768]

 September's RPI has been used as a base for uprating since April 1987. Using the September index, which is published in the middle of October, allows time for the preparation of the uprating schedule and the review process before operational implementation begins at the end of November with a computer sweep of the Retirement Pension caseload. The operational timetable is designed so that those renewal order books which cover pre and post April periods can be issued with the correct rates of benefit. Order books, which generally cover a period of 20 weeks, start to be issued with the new rates of benefit in mid-December.
