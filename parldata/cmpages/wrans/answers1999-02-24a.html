<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Ms Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what decisions he has taken on the findings of the review into the efficiency of the Office for National Statistics.  [73284]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Having considered the findings of the efficiency review of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and met with the trade unions to discuss their reactions, I have decided to accept the recommendations made by the efficiency review Steering Group.
<P>

<a name="90224w01.htm_para0">The findings of the review indicate that there is scope within ONS to achieve efficiency savings rising to around &#163;20 million per year. The achievement of such savings, which will be reinvested within ONS, will enable the Office to focus resources and management attention on improving the range and quality of the statistical information it produces. I have asked Dr. Tim Holt, the Director of ONS, to prepare and implement a programme of action designed to deliver these savings, in consultation with ONS staff and trade unions.
<P>

<a name="90224w01.htm_para1">I am today publishing a copy of the full report which was commissioned from the consultants KPMG by the review Steering Group. The recommendations made by the Steering Group draw on many of the KPMG proposals, but they do not include them all. In particular, the potential savings identified as a result of the outsourcing of data collection and processing are not part of the package of efficiency savings which the Steering Group recommended.
<P>

<a name="90224w01.htm_para2">I have also today accepted proposals from Dr. Holt to strengthen the senior management structure of ONS. This will involve the establishment of a restructured ONS Management Board comprising the Director of ONS and four other members: a Director of Economic Statistics, a Director of Social Statistics, a Director of Quality Assurance and Methodology, and Director of Finance and Corporate Services. This final post will be advertised externally, with business and commercial experience a key requirement.
<P>

<a name="90224w01.htm_para3">These changes to the management structure of ONS reflect the importance which the Government attach to implementing this programme of work. Ensuring the quality of ONS outputs is a key part of the Government's commitment to enhance the integrity of official statistics.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Chancellor has had frequent discussions with representatives from business since May 1998, many of whom have been members of the engineering profession. The Chancellor has focused particularly on the UK's productivity record and how business and Government can work together to improve it. Investment by business, including the engineering sector, has featured as one of the key areas for improvement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I have now considered the Registrar General's options paper on access to civil registration records. It is proposed that a limited amount of prior consultation with stakeholders should be undertaken over the next few months. The outcome of this consultation will be taken into account when the proposals for reform arising from the Civil Registration review are published in the summer.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the additional costs to local authorities of having Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty within their boundaries; and if he will make a statement.  [72598]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w01.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 No central assessment of additional costs has been made. However, a study undertaken last year for the Countryside Commission, the Government's statutory advisors on landscape protection, suggested that some &#163;4.8m may be spent annually by local authorities in England on the core costs of the management and protection of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs). The same study suggested that a further &#163;9.5m may be spent annually on local authority countryside management services within AONBs.
<P>

<a name="90224w01.htm_para4">The Countryside Commission has provided advice to the Government on various aspects of the care of protected landscapes. We are considering the recommendations very carefully, together with all the other information available, before taking any final decisions. There are some complex issues involved but we hope to be able to announce some conclusions soon.




<P>

<a name="90224w01.htm_para9">Analysis of licence-holding by age band, for males and females separately, led to the published forecast that total licence-holding would increase from 67 per cent. to 73 per cent. of the adult population over a ten year period (1996-2006). This increase is one of the factors underlying the predicted growth in car ownership within the 1997 National Road Traffic Forecasts.
<P>

<a name="90224w01.htm_para10">The forecasts are in the process of being revised in the light of the measures announced in the Integrated Transport White Paper. More detailed modelling of the impact of increasing licence-holding is one of the options under consideration.

 Our recent Roads Review was conducted against the high levels of predicted traffic growth forecast. Forecasts of the effects of schemes were an important part of the Review, but we did not follow a "predict and provide" approach. We have moved away from exclusive reliance on road building by looking at other, more sustainable ways of tackling traffic problems, finding ways of making better use of the existing trunk road network along with a smaller, targeted programme of improvement schemes where these have been proved to be necessary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w03.htm_wqn0"><B> Lorna Fitzsimons: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the safety of concrete flues in dwellings.  [73567]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w03.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I have been made aware of concerns about the safety of certain flue liners, which are intended for use in chimneys serving appliances burning solid fuel. They are made of concrete, although those solely comprising kiln-burnt aggregate, pumice and cement (other than products used to facilitate manufacture) are not known to give rise to any problems.
<P>

<a name="90224w03.htm_para0">Despite these concerns, the two principal housing warranty providers have reported no change in the frequency of claims relating to defective chimneys and my Department is unaware of any marked change in the frequency of soot fires requiring chimney reconstruction.





<P>

<a name="90224w03.htm_para1">However, a number of chemical analyses and performance tests of thermal insulation, thermal shock resistance and gas tightness of concrete flue components have been carried out independently by flue component manufacturers and by building control enforcement bodies over the last few months attempting to prove or disprove the adequacy of certain manufacturers' components. These tests have so far proved inconclusive. Nevertheless they have shown that building control enforcement bodies and warranty providers may have grounds for concern, and that further investigation would be prudent.
<P>

<a name="90224w03.htm_para2">My Department has already asked the expert technical committee within the British Standards Institution (BSI) to consider how the issues being raised impact on existing British Standards and prospective harmonised European Standards (ENs). These ENs will eventually become the performance criteria for compliance with the Construction Products Regulations which ensure that products are sufficiently safe to be placed on the market. The BSI Committee have also been asked for their opinion on the standards of performance presently referred to in the relevant Approved Document to the Building Regulations and whether these can be improved. I have asked the Committee to consider these matters swiftly and impartially and I look forward to their response with interest.
<P>

<a name="90224w03.htm_para3">My Department has also listened to the collective views of manufacturers, importers, building control bodies and housing warranty providers. There appears to be insufficient evidence at present to warrant advising householders to take any additional care in the ways that they use their fireplaces and that for the time being there is only the possibility that some chimneys lined with concrete may need attention to ensure satisfactory service life. However these uncertainties cannot be allowed to continue.
<P>

<a name="90224w03.htm_para4">I have therefore decided that the issues being raised should be explored by way of an expert risk assessment, and my Department is now proceeding to engage a suitable contractor. The aims of this study will be to establish how many dwellings already built or under construction have chimneys with potentially risky concrete components, to establish the nature of the risks to householders, to collect together and appraise the results of the tests on flue components carried out by the various parties, to seek national expert technical opinion on the ways that the risks to householders can be resolved into quantifiable flue component performance standards, to evaluate to what extent, if any, the possible problems raised are real, and to provide advice on possible remedial measures.
<P>

<a name="90224w03.htm_para5">At the same time I have asked my Department in conjunction with the Building Regulations Advisory Committee to consider with builders, building control professionals, warranty providers, the Building Research Establishment and others what amendments it might be necessary to make to Part J of the Building Regulations and the supporting Approved Document to address these issues more directly for the future.
<P>

<a name="90224w03.htm_para6">I shall make a further announcement as soon as I can.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w03.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The Gulf veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) was established in 1993 to provide as full a diagnosis as possible to UK veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict who are concerned about their health. So far, just under 3,000 Gulf veterans have been referred to the MAP, which continues to offer patients an appointment within six weeks of their referral. Fewer than 40 patients are currently waiting to be seen by the MAP for the first time.
<P>

<a name="90224w03.htm_para8">A paper describing the clinical findings from the first 1,000 patients examined at the MAP was published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> on 30 January. A copy of the paper is available in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="90224w03.htm_para9">A full audit of the MAP, covering patient care and the service provided by the Programme, is currently under way. The results of this will be published in due course.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w03.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Several air defence exercises are conducted in central Europe each year. The major annual air defence exercise held in the region is the NATO exercise Central Enterprise. In 1997 Exercise Central Enterprise took place from 9-20 June. RAF participants comprised Tornado GR1, Harrier GR7 and VC10 aircraft, and flew a total of 18 sorties per day. The exercise offered a number of valuable training opportunities, particularly in the area of operations involving other NATO Nations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w03.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Due to the deployment to Bosnia of a unit scheduled to take part in the armoured battlegroup exercises in Canada, only five armoured battlegroup exercises were carried out between 1 April 1997 and 31 March 1998. The cost of these five exercises was &#163;73.46 million.

<P>
<a name="90224w05.htm_wqn2"><B> Mrs. McKenna: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is the outcome of his review of the possible employment of women in submarines and in mine clearance diving.  [73578]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w05.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 We are committed to equality of opportunity in the Armed Forces. In the course of the Strategic Defence Review we examined the opportunities for maximising opportunity for women in each of the Services provided that this would not damage combat effectiveness. The results of this work were set out in the report on the Strategic Defence Review (Cmd 2999), in which we also announced our intention to review the exclusion of women from service in submarines and Royal Navy mine clearance.
<P>

<a name="90224w05.htm_para0">We have now completed our review of these matters and concluded that we should maintain our policy of excluding women from service in submarines and mine clearance diving for medical reasons.
<P>

<a name="90224w05.htm_para1">In reaching this conclusion I considered all the evidence very carefully and looked hard for options which might enable us to open service in submarines to women despite the medical risks involved. I was not able, however, to put to one side the MOD's statutory duty of care under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974.
<P>

<a name="90224w05.htm_para2">All RN submarines currently in service may remain submerged for up to 90 days for operational reasons. In the course of such deployments, contaminants build up in the internal atmosphere. Although there is careful 



<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 1999 : Column: 301</I><P>
control of the materials allowed aboard and atmospheric filtration, the build up of contaminants such as carbon dioxide in this closed environment cannot be prevented. Such an atmosphere is not harmful to adults, but medical studies by the Institute of Naval Medicine show that for some contaminants the levels exceed those considered safe to the foetus of a pregnant woman, and therefore also place the woman's health at risk. In other cases there is insufficient data available to recommend with confidence maximum exposure limits which would prevent harm to the foetus and the woman.
<P>

<a name="90224w05.htm_para3">A woman, in at least the first days after conception, may not be aware that she is pregnant. If she were serving in a submarine there is, therefore, the small possibility that she might unknowingly expose here unborn child to levels on contamination above those considered safe. Even if some women were prepared to accept the risks and volunteer to serve in submarines the MOD could not compromise its duty of care by allowing them to do so.
<P>

<a name="90224w05.htm_para4">In the specialised area of mine clearance diving, (where there are far fewer posts involved), there are also substantial medical risks to an unborn child and, therefore, the mother, caused in this case by the very high pressures to which these divers are subjected. As far as women who are not pregnant are concerned, the medical risks are less well understood, but there may be a risk to a woman during menstruation. I have accepted the medical advice that women should, therefore, be excluded from working as Mine Clearance Divers at least until more definitive medical advice is available.
<P>

<a name="90224w05.htm_para5">The Government and the Armed Forces are determined that the widest possible employment opportunities should be available to women in the Armed Forces. The position on service in submarines and mine diving clearance will, therefore, be kept under review.

 The Ministry of Defence does not have an alternative assumptions budget. Alternative assumptions are part of the department's Long Term Costing (LTC) process and provide the mechanism by which possible changes to the core Defence programme can be costed and assessed.
<P>

<a name="90224w05.htm_para6">The LTC represents projections which inform internal advice to Ministers on the affordability of the defence programme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w05.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The UK's current 540lb and 1000lb bombs are ballistic weapons deliverable either guided or unguided. The accuracy with which they can be delivered depends on many variables including the aiming system used by the delivery aircraft, the speed, dive angle, height and range from the target at release from the aircraft and type of attack profile. The weather conditions may also be a significant factor.
<P>

<a name="90224w05.htm_para7">The possibility of an upgrade programme is currently being examined. No decisions have, however, yet been taken.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w06.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Land Registry maintains and develops authoritative and effective land information systems for England and Wales. It was established as a separate government department in 1862, became an Executive Agency in 1990 and a Government Trading Fund in 1993. It is required by statute to cover all expenditure from its fee income and makes no call on moneys voted by Parliament. The Land Registry has joined with private sector and other government organisations to develop a National Land Information Service. This has led to an innovative conveyancing pilot, based in Bristol, which is effectively a one-stop conveyancing shop, reducing overall transaction times when buying a house. In November 1998 the pilot won a British Computer Society award which recognises excellence in computing.
<P>

<a name="90224w06.htm_para2">The Land Registry has also recently won an award from the Society for Computers and the Law for its on-line Direct Access Service. In January, the Land Registry became one of only 18 organisations in the United Kingdom to be awarded a third Charter Mark.

<a name="90224w06.htm_para3">Agendas for Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Councils, which are determined by the Presidency of the day, are nearly always finalised only very shortly before Council meetings themselves. The agenda for the JHA Council on 12 March is still in draft form, and is very likely to undergo substantial further revision. Current indications are that major items are likely to be Europol, questions relating to the transition from the Maastricht to the Amsterdam Treaty with regard to Conventions, and preparation of a meeting with central and eastern European countries and Cyprus, which will take place in the afternoon.
<P>

<a name="90224w06.htm_para4">An annotated agenda will be sent to the Select Committee on European Scrutiny in the normal way, as soon as possible.

 I regret I am unable to provide the statistical information requested as it is not readily available in the form requested. Collation of the information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w07.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Coleman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many applications for European Economic Area residents' permits were <i>(a)</i> granted and <i>(b)</i> refused for each month in the years from 1995 to 1998; and how many such applications are currently outstanding.  [70719]<P>
<P>
<P>

 Monthly figures for grants and refusals of residence permits from January 1996 to August 1998 are listed in the table. A total figure for 1995 has been included as the monthly figures for that year are not readily available. The number of applications outstanding (as at October 1998) was 5,500.

 Agendas for Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Councils, which are determined by the Presidency of the day, are nearly always finalised only very shortly before Council meetings themselves. The agenda for the JHA Council on 12 March is still in draft form, and is very likely to undergo substantial further revision. Current indications are that major items are likely to be Europol, questions relating to the transition from the Maastricht to the Amsterdam Treaty with regard to Conventions, and preparation of a meeting with central and eastern European countries and Cyprus, which will take place in the afternoon.

<P>
<a name="90224w08.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 For a number of years, it has been the practice of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate not to pursue enforcement action against people who have children under 18 living with them who have spent 10 years or more in this country, save in very exceptional circumstances.

<a name="90224w08.htm_para0">We have concluded that 10 years is too long a period. Children who have been in this country for several years will be reasonably settled here and may, therefore, find it

difficult to adjust to life abroad. In future, the enforced removal or deportation will not normally be appropriate where there are minor dependent children in the family who have been living in the United Kingdom continuously for 7 or more years. In most cases, the ties established by children over this period will outweigh other considerations and it is right and fair that the family should be allowed to stay here. However, each case will continue to be considered on its individual merits.

<a name="90224w08.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Police funding allocations are determined by a needs-based formula. The formula to be applied in 2000-2001 will take into account the changes to the boundaries of the Essex Police. The allocation of resources thereafter within the force area is a matter for the Chief Constable.

 Development of Government policy takes place with close co-operation between the Departments concerned. This can be through formal arrangements, such as those established between the Home Office, Lord Chancellor's Department and the Law Officers' Department, or via Ministerial or Official Groups or Working Parties. Less formally, they can be

<P><I>24 Feb 1999 : Column: 312</I><P>
through close consultation with experts in the relevant areas and with those affected by the proposed measures, normally against a background of regular in-house or specially commissioned research. The Home Office works closely with the Cabinet Office or other Government Departments on the crime implications of policy developments.
<P>

<a name="90224w08.htm_para5">Our determination is that the implications for crime and disorder of any new measures are properly taken into account. This commitment is reflected in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Section 17(1) requires local and police authorities to exercise their functions with due regard to the likely effect on preventing crime and disorder.
<P>

<a name="90224w08.htm_para6">Greater emphasis is now being given to building up our knowledge of policies that work in tackling crime. The Crime Reduction Programme, supported by &#163;250 million from the Comprehensive Spending Review, is based on systematic evidence of what is effective in reducing crime and tackling its causes, not just dealing with its effects. All the parts of the Crime Reduction Programme will be independently evaluated to assess their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in reducing crime and improving the operation of the criminal justice system. Those parts which are successful will form the basis of future mainstream programmes and those which are not will be dropped.

<a name="90224w09.htm_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Export Control Organisation's computer databases have been interrogated and the following results were obtained. Between 2 May 1997 and 8 February 1999, 779 applications for Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs) covering the export of goods subject to export control by being listed in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, the so-called Military List, were withdrawn by the applicants. The total value of the goods as stated on these applications was &#163;399 million. In the same period, 11 applications for Open Individual Export Licences (OIELs) covering such exports were withdrawn. There is generally no cumulative limit to the quantity or value of exports permitted under OIELs, so no corresponding figure for the aggregate value can be determined.
<P>

 Most of the public electricity suppliers charge in the region of &#163;200 to &#163;400 for a standard domestic connection.

<a name="90224w10.htm_para1">Under UK competition law, in the first instance it is the responsibility of the Director General of Fair Trading (DGFT) to investigate allegations of anti-competitive behaviour. The market for DVDs is still young and the DGFT will be monitoring its development. To date he has seen no evidence of price cartels or any other anti-competitive behaviour. If the right hon.

 United Nations and other international observers monitoring the trials process in Sierra Leone have indicated that fair trials have been held under difficult circumstances.

<a name="90224w10.htm_spnew13"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 ECOMOG have not invaded Sierra Leone; their forces were invited by the Government of Sierra Leone to assist in the restoration of peace and security. There has been significant damage to property during the current conflict. The most serious damage was caused in January, when rebel forces entered Freetown, and indulged in wanton destruction of property. The eastern areas of the city have suffered particularly: up to eighty per cent. of property has been reported as destroyed or damaged.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w10.htm_spnew14"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We have not given any bilateral support to the Nigerian military, as they are subject to the EU Common position on Nigeria which bans military co-operation. ECOMOG in Sierra Leone comprises Nigerian, Ghanaian, Guinean and Malian contingents. We have provided it with practical support to enable it to protect the legitimate Government and people of Sierra Leone from rebel violence. We have provided &#163;3 million worth of practical logistic support; this includes &#163;1 million worth of vehicles and communications equipment, as well as emergency medical supplies for the people of Sierra Leone. On 19 January, the Foreign Secretary announced a further &#163;1 million of logistic support for ECOMOG and humanitarian assistance. We have also funded the recent airlift of the Ghanaian contingent to ECOMOG.

 We continue to provide strong political and practical support to the democratically elected Government of Sierra Leone. Since the restoration of President Kabbah's legitimate Government in March 1998, we have committed over &#163;20 million for rehabilitation and reconstruction following the military junta, of which &#163;11 million has been spent. We have provided further humanitarian assistance to the people of Sierra Leone this year in response to the deterioration in the security situation.

However, it also condemned the destruction of private property and the accompanying violence by demonstrators, as with the excessive reaction of the police. It also called for greater transparency and respect for the law in the allocation of public lands in Kenya, including the Karura Forest, something which our High Commissioner regularly raises with President Moi and senior Government Ministers.

 The Pierhead Building is a unique and attractive building right at the heart of Cardiff Bay which stands next to the site for the new Assembly building. It provides a powerful visual link for the Assembly with the industrial and maritime heritage of Wales. Originally it has been thought that it could be used as the office accommodation for the First Secretary and Cabinet. After careful consideration I concluded that their offices should be in the same building as the offices of Assembly Members which will be located in Crickhowell House along with the temporary Chamber and committee rooms. This will encourage the Cabinet members and Assembly Members--and their staff--in working together as part of a single team.

<a name="90224w12.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 I have made arrangements for an order to be laid before Parliament tomorrow requiring the 2 Public Electricity Suppliers (ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro- Electric) in Scotland to make arrangements to secure 150MW DNC of new renewable electricity generating capacity from a range of renewable sources. There has been an excellent response by bidders to the tender invitation for SRO3. This represents a considerable success for our policy of creating an initial market within each of the most promising renewable technologies by encouraging strong competition between various projects. This has allowed me to set a larger order than previously envisaged when SRO3 was announced in December 1997.
<P>

<a name="90224w12.htm_para4">I am particularly pleased to report that bid prices for SRO3 have been once again reduced, with bids for large wind projects especially low. The cheapest bid was a remarkable 1.89 pence per unit generated making large wind projects by far the cheapest renewable technology 



<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 1999 : Column: 326</I><P>
available under the order. I have, therefore, decided that large wind projects should make up a sizeable part of the order. A specific band for small wind projects is being introduced for the first time under SRO3. The aim is to encourage small, locally based companies and communities to get involved in electricity generation.
<P>

<a name="90224w12.htm_para5">The prices tendered for biomass projects were relatively high compared with wind and waste to energy projects. I have, however, taken account of the wider benefits to agriculture and forestry and to the environment of such projects, and the need to enable the technology to establish itself in Scotland. For this reason, I have decided to allocate almost 9 per cent. of the order to this technology.
<P>

<a name="90224w12.htm_para6">A band for wave power was proposed in SRO3 for the first time. Wave technology is very much at a formative stage and I am keen to help the technology gain a foothold in Scotland. I am pleased to report that bid prices were lower than expected and I have, therefore, decided to allocate a small part of the order to wave projects.
<P>

<a name="90224w12.htm_para7">I have also decided to include a sizeable number of waste to energy projects and a small number of hydro electric projects in the order.
<P>

<a name="90224w12.htm_para8">There are significant benefits stemming from the encouragement of renewable energy. These include a contribution to the Government's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target agreed following the December 1998 Kyoto conference. By making an order for a total of 150MW we are taking a considerable step towards meeting Government's new and strong drive for renewable generating capacity, while also promoting the renewable industry in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="90224w12.htm_para9">We are aware of concerns about the possible effects on the environment and landscape of the development of renewable energy projects and expect developers to give particular care and attention to these sensitive issues. Successful developers will need to obtain planning permission for their projects if they have not already done so; award of a contract as a result of the Order does not confer any special advantage in the planning process and approval must be sought in the usual way.
<P>

<a name="90224w12.htm_para10">I have made the order after considering carefully the advice of the Director General of Electricity Supply and after consulting the 2 Scottish Public Electricity Suppliers.

disqualified from being MSPs. The Order will be subject to affirmative resolution procedure in both Houses before being put to Her Majesty in Council.
<P>

<a name="90224w12.htm_para11">In making these proposals, we have adopted broadly the same approach to disqualification as is applied in the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, so following well established and well understood precedents.

<P>

<a name="90224w12.htm_para12">Not all those office holders disqualified from being an MP will also be disqualified from being an MSP as we have adapted the disqualification to the circumstances of the Scottish Parliament. This Order will be for the first elections; it will be for the Parliament to consider the scope of the disqualification for subsequent elections.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w13.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Russell Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement about the outcome of the first stage of the policy and financial reviews of the Scottish Consultative Council on the curriculum and the Scottish Council for Educational Technology.  [73540]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w13.htm_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The 'prior options' studies of the Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum (SCCC) and the Scottish Council for Educational Technology (SCET) began in December 1997. These studies raised issues of sufficient importance that a consultation document seeking comments on options for the future of both bodies was issued in October 1998. Responses were received from over 80 organisations and individuals.
<P>

<a name="90224w13.htm_para0">The outcome of the consultation was unanimously in favour of integrating the development of curriculum and ICT materials and there was a majority view that advice on the curriculum and ICT should be located in one body.
<P>

<a name="90224w13.htm_para1">I have concluded that there is a continuing need for independent advice and the development of materials relating to both the curriculum and ICT. I have agreed, in principle, that the best way of achieving that is the merger of SCCC and SCET.
<P>

<a name="90224w13.htm_para2">I am therefore setting up a Merger Action Group to develop a detailed plan for the merger to be presented to the Scottish Executive by 15 September this year. The membership of the Action Group will be drawn from both bodies and will include others from the education sector. It will be chaired by a senior member of HM Inspectorate of Schools. From 1 July 1999 this will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.

 The payment rates currently in operation for the Organic Aid Scheme in Scotland are as follows. Consideration is being given to the options for enhancing the OAS in Scotland. From 1 July 1999 this will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.

 Applications for Marketing Authorisations for all veterinary medicinal products including synthetic pyrethroids must satisfy statutory criteria for safety, quality and efficacy.

<P>

<a name="90224w14.htm_para0">Synthetic pyrethroids used as pesticides are similarly subject to strict statutory control.

No approval is given to pesticides that pose any unacceptable risk to human beings, non-target species or the wider environment. All approved pesticides are subject to review and, if appropriate, approvals can be restricted or revoked entirely. Given the above statutory regulatory system no studies on the safety of synthetic pyrethroids have been commissioned by the Department.

 The inhumane slaughter of farmed animals has long been contrary to the law in the United Kingdom.

<a name="90224w15.htm_para4">In addition, the Better Regulation Task Force is currently reviewing the role of regulation in relation to productivity, the operation of fit person regimes, the applicability of self-regulation, and law on anti-discrimination and enforcement practice. The productivity review was first announced in the pre-Budget Statement of 3 November 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 681-702.

 We are working with others to help business to understand and comply with regulations and to ensure constructive and consistent enforcement. We aim to make the regulatory system more transparent, accessible and helpful. The Access Business group of departmental Ministers, local government and business is looking at a number of issues, including Direct Access Government, which provides business and the self-employed with 24-hour access to regulatory guidance and forms via the Internet.
<P>

<a name="90224w15.htm_para6">The Enforcement Concordat sets out for businesses, and society in general, what they can expect of enforcers. Enforcers will give to business clear explanations of what they need to do and by when, opportunities to resolve differences before enforcement action is taken (unless immediate action is required), and an explanation of their rights of appeal. There are now 88 local authorities in England and Wales and 19 in Scotland who have signed up to the Concordat.

<a name="90224w15.htm_para7">My Department has actively promoted the setting up of local business partnerships between business and enforcement communities. These are designed to maximise regulatory understanding and compliance at least burden.

 Failure by a Member State to enforce adequate Community legislation is itself a breach of Community law. As such, it is primarily a matter for the European Commission. Where the UK becomes aware of such a breach, we can draw it to the attention of the Commission. Direct action by the UK can be taken by the UK pursuant to Article 170 TEC.

Every Department will be required to publish an account (in their Departmental Reports in March this year) of their regulatory activity with examples of how they have improved the quality and effectiveness of regulation through the application of the Task Force's principles.

 Future levels of funding available to school sixth forms and Further Education (FE) sector colleges, including sixth form colleges, for their 16-19 students will reflect the outcome of the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review and local authorities' decisions on the level of spending they devote to schools from their overall spending settlement. The differential between school and FE sector unit funding is eased by the relaxation of the required efficiency gain in the FE sector in 1999-2000 as announced in December following the Comprehensive Spending Review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what proportion of those leaving the New Deal for 18 to 24-year-olds for a destination other than unsubsidised employment up to the most recent date for which information is available are now claiming welfare benefits; and at what cost.  [71641]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w16.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The information on numbers leaving New Deal to claim benefits is contained in the Department for Education and Employment Statistical First Release. This release, prepared by the Government Statistical Service, was placed in the Library on 28 January. The latest set of figures will be placed in the Library on 25 February. It is not possible to give the cost of the benefits as it is not known how long those concerned will remain on them.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on his policy towards the provision of school transport to Roman Catholic schools for children in rural areas.  [72700]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w16.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Local Education Authorities must by law have regard to the wishes of Roman Catholic parents for their children to attend Roman Catholic schools, including in rural areas. Where a school is beyond the statutory walking distance, but is not the nearest suitable school, authorities have discretion whether to provide free transport. In exercising that discretion they must consider each request seriously. The Department is monitoring carefully the provision of denominational transport in local education authorities in England.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w16.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 We have increased Cumbria's education SSA for 1999-2000 by well over &#163;9 million which should help raise standards. My right hon. Friend has received a large number of representations from Cumbria schools welcoming the education SSA increase, but criticising Cumbria County Council's budget plans. We expect all Local Education Authorities, including Cumbria, to use all of the education SSA increase to support education services, especially schools.
<P>
<P>

<P>
<a name="90224w16.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 In 1999-2000 the additional funding for early education for three-year-olds has been distributed between the fifty authorities with the highest levels of social need assessed by the Government's Index of Local Deprivation augmented by measures of low birth weight and births to teenage mothers. Funding will be distributed across all authorities from April 2000.

 Current arrangements for schools' connection to and use of the Internet at reduced cost were brokered by Oftel and allow for schools to benefit from access to the Internet for a fixed annual fee through a BT ISDN2 connection between 9am and 6pm or for unlimited access through an equivalent cable connection.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has met the BT Chairman for discussion on a range of issues.

<a name="90224w16.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Department published last year the results of a survey of ICT in provision in schools which indicated that 17 per cent. of primary schools and 83 per cent. of secondary schools were connected to the Internet by March 1998. This is in comparison to the previous year's survey (published in 1997) which indicated that 5 per cent. of primary schools and 47 per cent. of secondary schools were connected to the Internet at the time. Subsequent annual surveys will indicate the change in growth of schools with such connections. The Government are committed to ensuring that all schools are connected to the Internet by 2002.

 We recognise that staff shortages, particularly in nursing, are a major concern for National Health Service employers seeking to deliver high quality patient care. Many of the problems stem from the decision, made under the previous Administration, to cut the number of training places. This year, 16,873 student nurses are expected to start training--the highest figure for six years.

 We have agreed the best, real terms pay rise for nurses for 10 years, backed with a &#163;100 million allocation from the Modernisation Fund. On 1 February, a high profile, multi-media nurse recruitment campaign was launched. This builds on the &#163;50 million package which was announced last September to expand part-time training places, target enrolled nurses to retrain and return to the National Health Service (2,700 over the next three years) and widen access to training and support existing NHS staff to become qualified nurses (200 staff this year and 1,000 in the following three years). In addition, an extra &#163;4 million was allocated in 1998-99 specifically to support "return to practice" initiatives on getting former nurses back to the NHS.

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 1999]:</i> Under the present system it is for health authorities and general practitioners to plan the services for people in their care, taking into account the needs of the local population and the priorities set for the use of available resources. The move to new commissioning arrangements will bring about improvements in services for people with conditions like multiple sclerosis. Longer term agreements, reflecting dialogue between clinicians and focusing on health improvement will increase the emphasis on programmes of care that cross the traditional boundaries to meet patient's needs best.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w19.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Diesel engines are a major source of particles, particularly in urban areas and especially when air quality is poor. Particles have serious effects on health. The Report on the "Quantification of Health Effects of Air Pollution in the United Kingdom" published in 1998 by the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) estimated that up to 8,100 people who are already very ill have their deaths brought forward each year in urban Great Britain as a result of exposure to particles and that they are also responsible for up to 10,500 admissions to hospital for respiratory conditions. A proportion of these will be the result of exposure to particles from motor vehicles and from diesel. The measures set out in the review of the United Kingdom National Air Quality Strategy published last month, including the agreement in Europe for tighter limits on vehicle emissions and improved fuel quality under the Auto Oil programme, will lead to reductions in levels of particles in the UK.

<a name="90224w19.htm_para0">The relative merits of petrol-driven cars and light vehicles over diesel equivalents in urban areas was discussed at a meeting of COMEAP on 19 February and a full statement on this subject will be issued by the Committee shortly. In arriving at a conclusion, the Committee was unable to take account of the indirect effects of vehicle-generated air pollutants on health, such as climate change; it is also based on current knowledge and recognises that future technological improvements may mean the position will need to be reassessed at some future date. Nevertheless, it concluded that because of the damage to health from particles, at the present time petrol vehicles would be preferred to diesel where the majority of a vehicles' journeys take place in urban areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w19.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what assessment his Department has made of the alleged linkage of L-tryptophan to Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome;  [72702]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome sufferers there are in the UK; and if he will estimate the number who contracted it from L-tryptophan;  [72686]
<P>
(3) what information he has collated on genetically modified L-tryptophan.  [72685]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90224w19.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 There is no system of mandatory notification in the United Kingdom of cases of Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome (EMS) and no central register. Cases of EMS are thought to occur only in association with exposure to L-tryptophan. There were 11 possible cases reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines by 1991, and there have been 7 possible cases subsequent to the reintroduction of Optimax in 1994, although a causal relationship for these cases has not been established. Several of the cases do not meet the internationally agreed definition of Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome. It is not known how many of these patients continue to have symptoms: several of the patients recovered completely after stopping their medicine.
<P>

<a name="90224w19.htm_para2">EMS was first recognised as a condition in late-1989. There was extensive investigation into the association between EMS and L-tryptophan by the Medicines Control Agency at that time and the issue was considered in detail by the Committee on Safety of Medicines. It is considered likely that the reported cases of EMS were caused by an impurity or contaminant in L-tryptophan made by a single manufacturer in Japan.
<P>

<a name="90224w19.htm_para3">The assessment then and subsequently included review of the worldwide published literature, examination of data submitted by the manufacturers of L-tryptophan and involved liaison with other regulatory authorities in Europe and the USA. In addition, there has been continuing evaluation of individual cases of adverse reactions reported in the United Kingdom under the Yellow Card scheme and via a monitoring scheme operated by the Marketing Authorisation Holder.
<P>

<a name="90224w19.htm_para4">L-tryptophan is a simple chemical which cannot be modified genetically. As for all medicines made using biotechnology methods, all the steps taken in the manufacturing process are carefully controlled and have to comply with the specifications stipulated in the marketing authorisation (licence) for the product. All the relevant information is made available by the manufacturers and assessed by the Medicines Control Agency at the time of submission of an application for marketing authorisation and may be subject to ongoing site inspections.

 Hospital episode statistics record diagnostic information for those people admitted to hospital. Information is recorded using the international classification of diseases (ICD10). There is no category in this classification for "chronic illnesses".

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment his Department has made of the claims that SV40 virus is linked to Mesothelioma; and what estimates his Department has made of the future number of Mesothelioma sufferers.  [72710]<P>

<P>
<a name="90224w20.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 This matter has been carefully considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the Government's independent expert advisory committee. Concern about the possible impact of Simian Virus 40 on the human population was raised in the early 1960s. SV40 was found in some inactivated polio vaccines produced in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Since the discovery of SV40 in 1960 it has been stipulated that all viruses in addition to poliovirus in inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), should be inactivated. When live oral polio vaccine (OPV) became available in 1962, it also had to be free of all known viruses (other than the three polio viruses the vaccine protects against). All the relevant samples of OPV in the UK repository, going back to 1966, have been checked by the National Institute for Biological 



<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 1999 : Column: 356</I><P>
Standards and Control and no infectious SV40 virus was detected. Currently used vaccines are rigorously checked to ensure their safety and efficacy and are free of SV40.
<P>

<a name="90224w20.htm_para0">Although SV40 has been isolated from some human tumours, there is no evidence that SV40 virus is causing the tumours. Research studies in people who received SV40 contaminated IPV have found no increase in cancers when compared with people who did not receive contaminated IPV. The JCVI agreed with the conclusions of these studies.
<P>

<a name="90224w20.htm_para1">Professor Julian Peto and colleagues have recently completed epidemiological research which was published in the <i>British Journal of Cancer</i> this year. They estimated that the number of men dying from mesothelioma in Western Europe will almost double over the next 20 years from 5,000 in 1998 to about 9,000 in 2018. For Britain, the predicted annual deaths from mesothelioma in years 2015-19 is 1,750, almost twice the current rate. This is around 6 per cent. of the current 30,000 lung cancer deaths annually. Mesothelioma rates are a quantitative indicator of the population's past exposure--mainly occupational--to asbestos.
