To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will estimate the cost to business of the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002; and if he will make a statement.  [88065]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The total costs of the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002 to business are estimated, over a 50-year period, at #1.5 billion. These future costs are discounted in present values under standard government accounting conventions. The regulations will help to prevent some 4,700 people dying from asbestos-related diseases from future exposure to asbestos in commercial buildings. This is equivalent to total benefits exceeding #3.0 billion. Full details of costs and benefits are contained in the Regulatory Impact Assessment available in the Library.

<a name="30107w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Heald: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to his answer of 27 November 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 316W, on the adviser discretion fund, how many persons have received payments from the fund; how many payments have been made <i>(a)</i> in total and <i>(b)</i> broken down by month; how many persons have received <i>(i)</i> more than one payment, (ii) more than two payments and (iii) more than three payments from the fund; what the value is of payments from the fund, (A) in total and (B) broken down by month; what the average payment from the fund to date is; if he will list the types of goods and services purchased from the funds, indicating how many payments have been used to purchase each type of goods and service; if he will place in the Library a summary of the records referred to in his answer; and if he will make a statement.  [88511]<P>

<P>
<a name="30107w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The adviser discretion fund was introduced to give personal advisers more flexibility in the help they can offer their New Deal clients. Over 71,200 people have moved into work after receiving help from the fund. We are building on this success by extending access to the fund to people who have been claiming benefits for six months or more.
<P>

<a name="30107w01.html_para0">Information on the number and value of awards made through the adviser discretion fund since its introduction in July 2001 is in the table.

 The purchase cost of PCs installed in the Department of Work and Pensions up to 30 November 2002, including the associated software and network costs, is #156.7 million. Installation costs, again up to 30 November 2002, amount to #58.5million.

<a name="30107w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend has had no discussions with the Health and Safety Executive regarding fairground safety since the death of Stacey Rowe in 2000. The Secretary of Sate for Work and Pensions assumed responsibility for the Health and Safety commission and the Health and Safety Executive on 24 July 2002. However, meetings were held on 10 and 26 July 2001 between HSE and my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead), the Minister with health and safety responsibilities at the time.

<a name="30107w01.html_para10">However, discussions between the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and members of the SGGB and NAFLIC on fairground safety take place on a regular basis.

<a name="30107w01.html_para11">In addition, both trade associations are full members of the Fairgrounds and Amusement Parks Joint Advisory Committee (FJAC), which comprises members of the trade associations and others involved in the fairground industry together with representatives from the Health and Safety Executive.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what percentage of mains gas pipes Transco agreed to replace by 1 January 2003; and what percentage of this work had been achieved by 1 December.  [87483]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 This required replacement of mains gas pipes, as part of the medium pressure ductile iron replacement programme, was 0.86 per cent. of the total mains gas pipes by 1 January 2003. As at 1 December, Transco was on target to achieve 1 per cent., thus exceeding their original target. Actual performance is at a level of 116 per cent. against original projections.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the terms were of the agreement between Transco and the Health and Safety Executive for the replacement of metal gas pipes; and if Transco has met the time scale for replacement agreed with the Health and Safety Executive.  [87486]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 I am informed by the Health and Safety Executive that Transco's mains replacement work is governed by a five-year programme which commenced in January 2001 for iron mains within 30 metres of property. This programme was agreed following discussions with Transco and Ofgem. At the end of this five-year period, Transco should be replacing mains so that the remaining mains within 30 metres of buildings should be replaced within the following 25 years.
<P>

<a name="30107w01.html_para13">Implementation of this programme is in the very early stages. HSE is carefully monitoring Transco's progress and evidence suggests the company is meeting current targets.

 The UK's climate change programme sets out the policies and measures in each sector of the economy that the Government have put in place or have planned to meet and move beyond its Kyoto Protocol target. On current projections, greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture&#151;mainly methane from enteric fermentation in livestock and nitrous oxide from agricultural soils&#151;will be an estimated 14 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. This is mainly due to reductions in cattle numbers from yield improvements, and reductions in synthetic fertiliser usage&#151;although, because emissions in other sectors are also falling, agriculture's share of total UK emissions is expected to remain at the present level of around 7.5 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30107w03.html_para3">Action that the UK Government and the devolved Administrations are taking to reduce emissions from agriculture includes encouragement of biomass including renewable energy crops, application of the climate change levy to agricultural businesses (with some discounts for energy intensive horticultural businesses), agri-environment schemes and set-aside.

Energy efficiency measures are an integral means of meeting these targets, several of which have their own targets as follows.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Fuel Poverty Strategy has a PSA target to reach 600,000 low income householders between 2001 and 2004. There are various measures in place that will help deliver this including the Warm Front Scheme and the Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC). The EEC's will result in a reduction in carbon emissions of an estimated 400,000 tonnes a year by 2005.

Combined Heat and Power (CHP) has a 2010 target of at least 10,000 megawatts of installed Good Quality CHP capacity. Government consulted on a draft CHP Strategy to 2010 earlier this year setting out the measures thought sufficient for the target to be met.

All Government Departments have an interim target to contribute to the target of a 1 per cent. per annum on-going reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from Government Estate buildings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government strongly supports reform of the CAP sugar regime, particularly in view of the increasing access for developing countries already agreed as part of the Everything But Arms initiative. The Council of Ministers is committed to a further review of the regime next year and we will be pressing for early decisions to allow for orderly adaptation to these more liberal trading arrangements, which will make the regime unsustainable in its present form. We also want the future regime to take account of the wider CAP Mid Term Review process on which negotiations are currently taking place.
<P>

<a name="30107w04.html_para0">With regard to the dairy regime, there have already been some moves towards reform under Agenda 2000&#151;a 15 per cent. cut in support prices phased in from 2005 to 2007, with direct aid as compensation. However, this still leaves dairy support prices well above world levels, distorting both internal and external markets, and resulting in a continuing need for milk quotas (a

<P>

<a name="30107w04.html_para1">The UK and other like-minded member states managed to secure a mid-term review of the milk quota system as part of the Agenda 2000 Agreement, under which Commission was charged with writing a report 'with a view to letting the current quota arrangements run out after 2006'. One of the four options in the report, which the Commission published in July, is for quota abolition in 2008.
<P>

<a name="30107w04.html_para2">We are now calling upon the Commission to come forward with a legislative proposal based on this option, which is the only one to fully meet thecommitments set out in the Agenda 2000 Agreement. In order to bring support prices closer to world levels, in preparation for quota abolition, we would favour bringing the Agenda 2000 price cuts forward to 2004, deepening them, and phasing them over four years, to 2007&#150;08.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 December 2002]:</i> The consumer cost of the CAP can be estimated by considering the difference between UK prices and world prices on agricultural food products purchased by consumers. In 2000, the latest year for which UK figures 



<P>
<P><I>7 Jan 2003 : Column 15W</I><P>
are available, we estimate that the CAP cost UK consumers around #3.5 billion through higher prices. In the same year the UK taxpayer contribution to the CAP was approximately #3 billion.
<P>

<a name="30107w04.html_para3">The UK population in 2000 was 59.8 million, implying that the average cost of the CAP of #6.5 billion in total equates to just over #2 per person per week, or #8 to #9 pounds a week for a notional family of four.
<P>

<a name="30107w04.html_para4">The following table shows an approximate breakdown of consumer support between agricultural commodities. These estimates have, in the main, been compiled using the methodology utilised by the OECD to produce their estimates of the consumer support estimate. It should be noted that the aggregate estimates will be more robust than estimates for the individual commodities. It is particularly difficult to determine the appropriate gap between UK and world prices for products whose specification varies, such as fruit and vegetables, or pigs, eggs and poultry. Although there is no significant internal regime governing the production of pigs, eggs and poultry, the EU has import tariffs in place, leading to increased costs for consumers.

<a name="30107w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In the 12 months ending June 2002, 20,000 claimants received less than #500 each in total direct grants and subsidies under the common agricultural policy in England. The payment of direct grants and subsidies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland was the responsibility of the devolved Authorities in that period. In addition, 35,000 claimants throughout the UK each received payments of less than #500 in total as part of the market support measures of the CAP, for which traders as well as farmers are eligible. The figures exclude any compensation received for animals slaughtered during the FMD crisis for reasons of disease control or animal health. We are unable to identify the total payments received by any individual or business making applications using more than one name.

 There are no statutory rules which require airlines to inform passengers of the restrictions on import of meat and other animal products. However, the European Commission Decision on controls on personal imports of animal products requires member states, from 1 January 2003, to ensure that the rules are brought to the attention of travellers by display of information at ports and airports and by making arrangements with international passenger transport operators, which we are doing.

 The effect of the Thomsen European Court of Justice judgment is now clear in that it means non-producing quota holders will no longer be able to lease out their milk quota indefinitely, which will mean that they will have to sell it, resume production, or otherwise face its confiscation. We have been discussing with the European Commission how, and to what timescale, we take forward implementation of this new interpretation in the UK and will make an announcement on next steps as soon as possible.

 Defra provides funding to local authorities for coast protection capital works that meet technical, economic and environmental criteria and achieve an appropriate priority score. However responsibility for deciding which projects to promote and their timing rests with the local authorities, in this case Lancaster city council.
<P>

<a name="30107w06.html_para0">I understand that the proposed works will have a significant effect on the Morecambe Bay special protection area and candidate special area of conservation. For such a scheme to proceed and in the absence of alternative options the council will be obliged to provide compensatory measures in accordance with the requirements of the Conservation (Natural Habitats etc) Regulations 1994 (as amended). I understand that the council are investigating options for compensatory measures as a matter of urgency, prior to submitting their application for funding to Defra.

<P>
<a name="30107w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We have, for a number of years, funded research directly or indirectly related to the welfare of the sow and her piglets, from farrowing to weaning. A key issue emerging is that changes in farrowing systems to improve sow welfare can lead to an increase in the death rate of the piglets. As a result, we are not yet able unreservedly to recommend free-farrowing systems for widespread commercial adoption.
<P>

<a name="30107w07.html_para0">Our research, and that of others, continues. Our aim is to reach a position where it is possible to avoid the close-confinement of all sows.

<P>
<a name="30107w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr Meacher  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 19 December 2002]</i>: The UK's emissions reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol is to reduce its emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases to 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels over the commitment period 2008&#150;12. Carbon dioxide, which is the most important greenhouse gas, is one of the six gases in the basket and although the UK does not have a specific carbon dioxide emissions reduction target under the Protocol, the Government and the devolved administrations have set themselves a domestic goal of a 20 per cent. reduction in the UK's carbon dioxide emissions below 1990 levels by 2010. The policies and measures set out in the UK Climate Change Programme (CCP) therefore focus mainly on reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

 The Government have made a commitment under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to conserve genetic resources for food and agriculture in the UK. The UK National Co-ordinator for Farm Animal Genetic Resources (FAnGR) in Defra has responsibility for co-ordinating the activities of NGOs, breed societies, research institutes and Government to ensure that appropriate action is being taken to save breeds at risk and to avoid duplication of effort. Defra is in the process of publishing a UK country report on FAnGR which makes several recommendations on the conservation and utilisation of the UK's breeds at risk, including the creation of a national steering committee to oversee a national action plan for the maintenance of our native breeds. (See Defra website for a copy of the final draft of the report, www.defraweb.science.publications.)

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps are being taken to increase recycling rates from <i>(a)</i> household and <i>(b)</i> business and industry waste.  [87131]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Waste Strategy 2000 set a national target of recycling or composting at least 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005, 30 per cent. by 2010 and 33 per cent. by 2015. To underpin these targets, we set statutory performance standards for recycling for all local authorities in England. Authorities are required, on average, to double recycling by 2003&#150;04 and triple it by 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="30107w07.html_para2">However, we do not expect local authorities to do this alone. The Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services (EPCS) spending block, which includes waste management, will be increased by #671 million by 2005&#150;06. An additional #355 million of future PFI credits for waste projects over the same period have also been provided. The National Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund of #140 million has distributed funds to a wide variety of schemes aimed at increasing household recycling rates.
<P>

<a name="30107w07.html_para3">We have taken steps to ensure an increase in the amount of commercial and industrial waste recycled. Base line figures given for 1998&#150;99 placed the rate of recycling for industrial and commercial waste at 37 per cent. This compares with the figure of 9 per cent. for household waste at the same time. In order to encourage businesses to further reduce waste and to put to better use any waste that is produced the Government have set the target to reduce by 2005 the amount of industrial and commercial waste sent to landfill to 85 per cent. of that landfilled in 1998. Producer responsibility is

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what proposals she has to develop a market for recycled plastic; and if she will make a statement.  [87343]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government established the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to promote more sustainable waste management by working to create more stable and efficient markets for recycled materials and products, and through tackling the barriers to increased reuse and recycling.
<P>

<a name="30107w07.html_para4">WRAP has identified plastics as a priority area in its business plan to 2003&#150;04. WRAP'S priorities in this area include marketing existing recycled plastic products and removing discriminatory standards. One of WRAP'S aims is to achieve a 20,000 tonne increase in the mixed plastics processing for industrial products by 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="30107w07.html_para5">Another source of investment into markets for recycled plastic is PRN and PERN revenue raised from businesses which are obligated to recover and recycle packaging waste under the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended).
<P>

<a name="30107w07.html_para6">The revenue accredited reprocessors receive for PRNs and PERNs is invested in three principal areas: collection capacity, end use markets and reprocessing capacity. In 2001, just over 10 per cent. of the #70 million PRN and PERN revenue was invested in end use markets. In particular, PRN and PERN revenue for plastic in 2001 was #8,591,128 of which #1,194,532 was spent on developing end use markets and #36,140 has been allocated for future investment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what schemes exist to recycle <i>(a)</i> Christmas trees and <i>(b)</i> Christmas wrapping paper; what incentives exist to encourage such recycling; and what guidance Government Departments and non-departmental public bodies have been given under the Government sustainability initiatives to recycle such trees and paper.  [87583]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr Meacher: </B> 
 DEFRA does not run schemes or provide specific guidance to Government bodies or others on the recycling of Christmas wrapping paper and Christmas trees. However, I am aware that some local authorities report the number of Christmas trees they recycle to the environmental charity EnCams. Figures for 2002 show that nearly two million trees were recycled by the authorities in England and Wales that reported their performance. We would expect those authorities that carry out collection and recycling of waste paper would recycle Christmas wrapping paper along with the rest of the waste paper they collect.
<P>

<a name="30107w07.html_para7">While there is no special provision made for the recycling of Christmas wrapping paper and Christmas trees, we have provided significant additional funding to local authorities to increase the proportion of waste that they recycle through the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services (EPCS) spending block, which 



<P>
<P><I>7 Jan 2003 : Column 28W</I><P>
includes waste management services, through Private Finance Initiative funding for waste and through the Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund.
<P>

<a name="30107w07.html_para8">The New Opportunities Fund will also distribute #38.75 million to expand community sector waste reuse, recycling and composting in England and #3.25 million for similar schemes in Wales.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government distributes money for refuse collection through the environmental protective and cultural services standard spending assessment (EPCS SSA) which covers a wide range of services including waste. SR2002 announced an increase in EPCS of #671 million by 2005&#150;06. This is on top of the #1.1 billion announced in SR2000.
<P>

<a name="30107w07.html_para9">The Government do not specify how funds distributed via EPCS SSA should be spent. It is for each local authority to decide how much of its funding it allocates to any particular area. The information requested is therefore not available.

 The conservation management of breeds at risk, especially those that are numerically rare such as the Suffolk Punch, is carried out by non-Governmental organisations such as the Rare Breeds Survival Trust and breed societies. There is no need for Government intervention at the present time because of the ongoing conservation plan.

 The Defra maintained UK National Database of Farm Animal Genetic Resources shows that the most recent survey of the Suffolk Horse breed (known locally as the Suffolk Punch) was in 1997 when the number of mares stood at 69.

 Eaga Partnership is the Scheme Manager appointed to administer the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme&#151;now marketed as Warm Front&#151;in three of the four 'lot' areas of England: London and the South East; the North East and North West; and the South West and West Midlands. All answers that follow relate only to the area managed by Eaga Partnership.
<P>

<a name="30107w08.html_para1">In the last financial year Eaga Partnership Ltd. received over 236,000 eligible referrals. At 29 November 14,538 surveys were outstanding. In addition, 49,768 households were awaiting completion of at least one of their recommended measures.
<P>

<a name="30107w08.html_para2">Snagging is not a requirement of the contract with Eaga Partnership, however the Scheme does require quality installation checks on all gas central heating systems and a proportion of insulation works. If remedial work is required, following the quality inspection, the installers are contracted to undertake that work within 28 days of being contacted by Eaga Partnership Ltd.
<P>

<a name="30107w08.html_para3">The waiting time for completion of works can be extended by a number of factors. These include the shortage of central heating installers, awaiting landlord permission, changes to measures specified and the installation of gas to properties. The average waiting time for completion of heating work is 72 working days and for insulation 51 working days from the time of survey. The longest wait for completion of a job was 345 working days. The longest period of work currently awaiting completion is 521 working days. These delays came about through a combination of factors including the skills shortage and the development of equipment to meet the requirements of the scheme.

<P>

<a name="30107w10.html_para19">The report recommends that in future all charities should have to demonstrate public benefit. Part of the report considers what happens now with those charities that charge fees which serve to exclude large sections of the population in terms of their having to make provision for wider access for those who would be excluded because of the fees. The report cites the example of independent schools.

<a name="30107w10.html_para20">At present there is no systematic programme in place to check the public character of charities. The report recommends that an on-going review programme run by the Charity Commission should check the public character of such organisations. It is proposed that the Commission would identify charities likely to charge high fees (such as independent schools), and undertake a rolling programme to check that provision was made for wider access. This programme will be designed to minimise red tape and will not focus on any particular sector. Short returns will be issued which ask charities what they do in terms of widening access, such as making provision for sharing facilities. It is envisaged that for the majority of cases no further inquiry will be necessary beyond the initial return.

Indicator data will be averaged over three years to provide further stability and predictability in future Formula Spending Shares. Authorities will be able to use this data&#151;together with local knowledge about pupil numbers and indicators&#151;to form a good estimate of what their EFSS might be in those years. That will in turn allow them to provide schools with indicative budgets for the next three years.

 The volunteer reserves are a capable, integrated and usable part of the armed forces.

Additional measures are being put in place as a result of the Strategic Defence Review New Chapter to enhance the capability of the armed forces in general, and reserves in particular, to provide assistance in civil contingencies. These include the establishment of some 700 new Territorial Army posts, principally to give the regional command structure the capacity to sustain 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week working, and to provide a headquarters component for the 14 new Civil Contingency Reaction Forces.

 Terrorism in the United Kingdom is criminal activity. The police and the Home Office consequently have responsibility for preventing and responding to the threat.

Rural .Affairs or the Department of Health. Other Departments and Agencies provide support as appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30107w14.html_para0">The armed forces may be called upon to provide support, from available resources, using specific military skills. The extent of assistance would, of course, be dependent on many factors, and in particular, the precise nature and scale of the incident. Most elements of the armed forces are, however, trained to operate in an environment where chemical or biological agents have been released, and they could, if necessary, provide support to the civil authorities using standard armed forces NBC equipment.

 No specific training has been given to the Territorial Army to deal with major terrorist incidents. Additional training for volunteer reserves for operations in support of civil contingencies (including terrorist attacks) was one of the New Chapter decisions announced on 31 October 2002.

 The armed forces are not responsible for dealing with a chemical or biological attack in the United Kingdom.

 The primary responsibility for dealing with the consequences of a chemical or biological terrorist incident in the United Kingdom rests with Civil Departments.

These mechanisms were outlined in a joint memorandum by the Home Office, Ministry of Defence and Cabinet Office to the Defence Select Committee on 22 May 2002 (House of Commons 518-II page Ev258, dated 24 July 2002).

 A procurement initiation is in train to provide 2 (National Communications) Signal Brigade with AIRWAVE equipment compatible with communications being procured by the police and other emergency services. This will provide the regional chain of command and deployed force elements with communications to support all operations undertaken in response to requests for assistance from the civil authorities. An interim solution is being put in place now to provide an improved mobile network capability in advance of the introduction into service of AIRWAVE.

 I assume the hon. Member is referring to the outcome of the Defence Training Review (DTR), which was announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence on 27 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 545W. Work is now complete on over a third of the DTR recommendations. Key achievements have included the formation of the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom on 1 April 2002 and, more recently, the establishment of the Director General Training and Education organisation to provide the central policy focus for defence individual training and education. The programme to rationalise a number of specialist training streams, about which my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces last updated the House on 25 November 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 2WS, is also proceeding as planned. Implementation of the remaining DTR recommendations is continuing.

 The Ministry of Defence is not aware of any trials in respect of blast-cleaning techniques on warship hulls since July 1996.
<P>

 The Ministry of Defence had a meeting with Mr. Farrow at the Defence Procurement Agency in Bristol on 25 November 2002. The Ministry of Defence fully explained its position in relation to Mr. Farrow's UK patent 2344348 in respect of alleged infringement activities at Portsmouth dockyard. The Ministry of Defence considered that the activities at Portsmouth did not infringe that patent.
<P>

<a name="30107w14.html_para2">At the meeting Mr. Farrow raised further allegations concerning another patent and activities at other dockyards. The Ministry of Defence undertook to investigate the further allegations. It was made clear that the investigation would take some weeks, and would cover alleged patent infringement and validity issues. It will also consider possible contractual responsibilities in the matter. Mr. Farrow is aware that these investigations are on-going.

<a name="30107w14.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Following an approach from Mr. Farrow concerning alleged use of his patents, the Ministry of Defence has undertaken to investigate the cleaning techniques in use in naval dockyards. The Ministry of Defence indicated that this investigation would take some weeks and is well under way. The outcome is expected early in the new year.
<P>

<a name="30107w14.html_para3">Techniques relating to blast cleaning of ships are well known and used extensively. Mr. Farrow has proposed particular parameters for use in such systems and it is the alleged use of the particular parameters that is the subject of the investigation.

 The Ministry of Defence deals with every wind energy proposal individually and each one is given a full and thorough appraisal by at least seven separate Technical Advisors, each with their own specialism including Radar, Low Flying, Communication Links and Met Office Radar.

 The Government will not be making a contribution towards the Hague Conference Supplementary Budget XLVIII (2002&#150;2003). The Hague Conference Supplementary Budget came into being last year XLVII (2001&#150;2002) when member states of the Hague Conference were invited to make a voluntary contribution towards the additional funding needed to reinforce the administration, monitoring and support for existing conventions, particularly the Children's Conventions. Last year XLVII (2001- 2002) the UK was in a position to make a voluntary contribution to the Supplementary Budget and arranged for contributions of Euro30,600.42 (England and Wales) and Euro1,601.28 (Northern Ireland) to be made over and above the standard UK contribution of Euro110,290.62. After the Netherlands the UK was the leading donor of supplemental payments during that year.

<a name="30107w15.html_para2">The Hague Conference carried forward the Supplementary Budget into year XLVIII (2002&#150;2003). Again this was based on voluntary payments since the budget had not been submitted to the Council for approval. The expected UK budgetary contribution of #117,580.65 was paid in full in early August but this year we are not in a position to make any additional voluntary payment.
<P>

<a name="30107w15.html_para3">The Government supports strongly the work of the Hague Conference and the expansion of its activities.

 As my earlier statement on the events of 31 August to 4 December 2002 indicated, the only contact between Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) officials involved in the case and ministerial staff was the request for, and provision of, a factual account for Ministers of where the case stood by officials in the IND Removals Process Team. The acknowledgement in response to this asked for further updates as appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30107w16.html_para1">The IND Removals Process Team was alerted to media interest in the case by the Home Office Press Office who requested information to enable them to respond to enquiries from the media.
<P>

<a name="30107w16.html_para2">The Removals Process Team contacted the Chief Immigration Officer at Luton Airport to obtain the necessary information. In the second such conversation, on 3 December, the Chief Immigration Officer indicated that for the reasons given in the statement of events, i.e. that with the application for judicial review refused there was no reason to delay removal, he intended to set removal directions for the first available flight on or after 6 December.

 Responsibility for pay, outside of the senior civil service, is delegated to Departments and agencies. What bonuses are paid to these staff is therefore a matter for individual Departments and agencies. This Information is not held centrally.
The new pay and performance management arrangements for the senior civil service are designed to reward and provide incentives for high performance. Under these arrangements all Departments awarded non-consolidated bonuses to their top performers.
Performance bonuses totalling #6 million were paid to those who contributed most to their Department's objectives. Bonuses were paid to around 55 per cent. of senior civil service staff.

 The Department's consistent line is that we have every confidence in the independent studies carried out by the National Radiological Protection Board and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund that showed veterans' participation in the nuclear test programme has not had a detectable effect on their expectation of life, or on their risk of developing cancer or other fatal diseases. Consequently no compensation has been paid to British nuclear test veterans.

 The Navy Star Programme provides key IS support to RN vessels. A common IT infrastructure is being progressively deployed across the fleet. With the exception of two vessels, the programme will be complete by 2005. The rate of deployment is constrained by the availability of suitable fitting opportunities. All ship's staff have access to the system, which supports a comprehensive range of administrative and operational support applications, as well as standard OA facilities. An e-mail capability provides connectivity to shore users, including families and friends for welfare purposes. The system is refreshed on a cycle of upgrades to sustain and improve capability.
<P>

<a name="30107w21.html_para6">A significant number of Royal Navy Command Support Systems, used for the planning and execution of maritime and amphibious operations, have been deployed operationally (39 ships and 10 shore units). An incremental rollout programme delivers regular capability enhancements. The most recent of these enhancements has been to upgrade the hardware in 2001 and 2002 to provide the latest commercial off-the-shelf systems, giving better performance and reliability. Software has also recently been improved with the release of Version 7 software.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I represented the United Kingdom at the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 16&#150;20 December 2002. The Scottish Minister for Environment and Rural Development and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State with responsibility for Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland also attended.
<P>

<a name="30107w21.html_para9">The Council, after lengthy negotiation, reached conclusions by qualified majority on the linked matters of Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform, urgent measures to bring about the recovery of cod stocks and the setting of total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas for 2003.
<P>

<a name="30107w21.html_para10">On CFP reform, the Council's conclusions were embodied in three new regulations, one addressing the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fishing resources and redefining the basic framework of the CFP, one permitting an emergency Community measure for scrapping fishing vessels, and one amending the provisions concerning Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector. Key features, including some points which the UK fought hard to secure, are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>renewal for a further 10 years of the regime confining access to the 6 to 12 mile zones to fishing vessels which have traditionally fished there;
<P>
<BR>
renewal of the Shetland Box pending a Commission review during 2003 of all such access restrictions to determine whether their continued application is justified in conservation terms;
<P>
<BR>
retention of the principle of relative stability for allocating fishing opportunities among member states on the basis of historical fishing patterns, explicitly including the Hague Preference arrangements which can provide additional fishing opportunities to the UK and Ireland when TACs fall below determined trigger levels;
<P>
<BR>
confirmation, in relation to the access which Spain, Portugal and Finland gain to the North Sea from 1 January 2003 under their Treaties of Accession, that there has been no adjustment to allocations of regulated stocks in favour of these member states, which may fish only for unregulated stocks. There is also a commitment to monitor any consequential impact on regulated stocks;
<P>
<BR>
commitment to a multi-annual approach to stock management based on recovery plans, involving effort limitation where necessary, for stocks which are outside safe biological limits, and management plans for other stocks. Recovery plans will be developed during 2003 for southern hake, sole in the Western Channel and Bay of Biscay, Rockall haddock, and nephrops in the Cantabrian Sea and off the Iberian peninsula;
<P>
<BR>
provision to establish Regional Advisory Councils to improve the participation of fishermen and other stakeholders in the process of managing fisheries;
the ending of public aid for the building of fishing vessels at the end of 2004. In the meantime such aid will be restricted to member states who have met national limits on fleet capacity and to vessels under 400 GT. Entry of vessels to the fleet will have to be balanced by the removal of tonnage without aid, in accordance with an entry/exit ratio. Where a vessel of 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>7 Jan 2003 : Column 82W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>over 100 gross tonnes built with grant aid enters the fleet, vessels equivalent to 135 per cent. of its tonnage must be removed;
<P>
<BR>
aid for modernising fishing vessels will be available only for vessels that are at least five-years-old to improve safety, product quality or working conditions, to switch to more selective fishing techniques, or to equip vessels with Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS);
an increase in the maximum rate of EU scrapping grant was agreed, to help member states achieve the decommissioning of vessels whose fishing effort has to be reduced by 25 per cent. or more under the terms of a recovery plan;
<P>
<BR>
aid for the permanent transfer of EU vessels to third countries will cease at the end of 2004 and be subjected to conditions in the meantime;
<P>
<BR>
a range of improvements will be made to the coherence of enforcement and control arrangements and the imposition of sanctions, with the Commission taking a stronger monitoring and co-ordinating role and VMS being extended to vessels over 18 metres from 1 January 2004 and to vessels over 15 metres from 1 January 2005.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30107w21.html_para11">On TACs and quotas, the Council started by examining a Commission proposal whose central element was severe cuts, equating to an 80 per cent. reduction in fishing mortality, in the TACs for the cod stocks for which scientists recommended a fishing moratorium, together with the species (haddock and whiting) most closely associated with them, as well as substantial TAC cuts for other associated species. A solution was negotiated under which higher TACs than proposed by the Commission were adopted alongside an emergency recovery measure for cod based on a much simplified approach which the Commission brought forward in the course of the Council.
<P>

<a name="30107w21.html_para12">The recovery measure is incorporated as Annex XVII to the Regulation setting TACs and quotas for 2003, and will control effort from 1 February 2003 by limiting days which may be spent at sea by vessels which catch cod in the North Sea, West of Scotland and Skaggerak and Kattegat. Vessels under 10 metres in length are not subject to these controls. Different limitations (expressed as numbers of days absent from port per calendar month) are set according to the type of gear carried. Hence some vessels (eg pelagic trawlers) fall outside the scheme altogether, while nephrops vessels will be allowed 25 days per month. The number of days to be allowed for whitefish demersal trawlers was absolutely critical for the UK, given the unacceptable and devastating effect the Commission's opening suggestion of seven days per calendar month would have had on our industry. The eventual outcome was that we secured a commitment that under the terms of the various conditions attached to the limitations in the EU measure, UK whitefish demersal trawlers would be allowed a total of 15 days absent from port per month.
<P>

<a name="30107w21.html_para13">The measure allows for some flexibility to move days between months and between vessels. The operational details for these new arrangements will be worked up urgently, in close consultation with the industry. The Council and Commission envisage that, with this emergency measure in place, a more sophisticated regime will be developed for implementation from 1 July 2003, based on proposals to be brought forward by the Commission by 15 February and agreed by the Council by the end of March.




<P>
<P><I>7 Jan 2003 : Column 83W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30107w21.html_para14">On this basis, the Council set TACs and quotas for 2003 which broadly maintain 2002 levels for pelagic stocks and nephrops but significantly reduce TACs for key whitefish species such as cod, haddock, whiting and anglerfish. Reductions of the order of 50 per cent. in the TACs for these latter species in the North Sea and West of Scotland represent a considerable gain in fishing opportunities compared with the Commission's original proposals, whilst significantly enhancing the prospects for the recovery of these stocks in the long term. The closure to sandeel fishing of the area off the north east British coast, as applied for the last three years, is renewed for 2003. For Irish Sea stocks, it was agreed that the 2002 cod recovery arrangements, which include a springtime closure of part of the Irish Sea, should continue for 2003 with reduced TACS for such stocks as cod, haddock and whiting.
<P>

<a name="30107w21.html_para15">The Council agreed a re-allocation of existing Spanish structural funds to provide financial support to Spanish fishermen and mussel and oyster growers affected by the Prestige oil spill.

He explained that he considered this to be necessary to eliminate any legal uncertainty concerning the applicability of some of the measures to the activities of Spanish and Portuguese vessels, following the expiry on 31 December 2002 of the transitional period foreseen in the 1985 Act of Accession. No decisions were reached on this proposal, which will be examined by the Council in coming months.

<a name="30107w21.html_para18">The Council reached unanimous political agreement on measures to update food hygiene rules applying to products of animal origin. It also reached political agreement by qualified majority on measures to update EU rules on the use of additives in animal feed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to her answer of 10 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 193W, on fisheries, if she will calculate the total average number of days at sea multiplied by the total number of kilowatts of engine power for vessels in the under 10 metres sector capturing and landing cod in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, Sea Areas <i>(a)</i> North Sea, <i>(b)</i> Irish Sea, <i>(c)</i> West of Scotland, Waters and <i>(d)</i> Area VIId.

<P>
<a name="30107w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Vessels in the under 10 metre sector of the UK fishing fleet are not obliged to submit European Community logbook declarations covering their fishing trips. These submissions are required in order for accurate days at sea information to be available for individual vessels. As such the raw data required to calculate the information requested is not available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if the Government will provide flood insurance cover for those homes unprotected to the minimum standard of the Association of British Insurers from 2007.  [87778] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Association of British Insurers have stated that they will review the situation with Government on a regular basis. Insurance matters are for the Treasury, but there appear to be no grounds for Government intervention as insurance for flood risk is available to by far the majority of those properties situated on the floodplain. People must remember that the insurance industry is a competitive one and they may benefit from 'shopping around'.
<P>

<a name="30107w22.html_para2">The nature of the risk in undefended areas means that insurers cannot guarantee to maintain cover, but will examine the risks on a case by case basis, use their best efforts to continue to provide cover and will work with the owners of domestic properties and small businesses which they currently insure to see what action could be taken by the property owner, the Environment Agency and the local authority, which might make the property

<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Defra provides grant to local operating authorities for flood defence capital works that meet certain criteria. However responsibility for deciding which projects to promote and their timing rests with the operating authorities.
<P>

<a name="30107w22.html_para3">The information requested is not readily available from all operating authorities. The Environment Agency advise that they are not aware of any specific proposals, following the autumn 2000 floods, to buy properties in the floodplain and remove them as the solution to flooding.
<P>

<a name="30107w22.html_para4">However, some flood protection schemes involve property acquisition to allow defences to be built, and in some areas where effective flood alleviation is difficult then the long term solution may be relocation outside the flood risk area as buildings reach the end of their useful life.

 Government Departments and agencies of Government Departments are bound by the rules of Government accounting. In accordance with long established Government policy, compensation is not payable for delays in payment due to industrial action. Payment of compensation for delays in payment not due to industrial action are considered on their merits, provided that the payees own conduct has not contributed to the delay.
<P>

<a name="30107w22.html_para5">In keeping with this policy the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) will be making compensation payments, subject to a de minimus level of #50 per producer, to those producers who have experienced delays beyond the regulatory deadline of 30 June 2002, in receiving their 2001 scheme year bovine balance payments, as a result of failure by either the RPA or the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS). Details are on the RPA website.

 Details of the total number of quota holders for each year 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02, and of those, the presumed number of non-producing quota holders (NPQHs), are contained in the table.
<P>

<a name="30107w23.html_para0">The 'quota holders' figure for each year in the table is the number of permanent quota holders at the end of the quota year. It is considered that the most representative figures on NPQHs, prior to 1999, are the number of quota holders who have leased out a high proportion of their quota in any given year. The figures given in the last three columns in the table are thus for the number of permanent quota holders who leased out the percentages of their quota shown, and might therefore be assumed to be NPQHs. The corresponding figures for 2002&#150;03 will not be known until after the end of the quota year.

<a name="30107w23.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The UN Secretary General's report covered many aspects of the problems of children affected by armed conflict, including their direct involvement. The most effective way to reduce the impact of armed conflict on children, their families and communities, is to prevent, reduce and resolve armed conflicts. My Department is working with other Government Departments to intensify UK efforts to resolve conflict. In relation to children affected by armed conflict, my Department is supporting UNICEF through a multi-year capacity-building project to increase its ability to work with all concerned to decrease the impact of armed conflict on children and to support the disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation of child soldiers. We have also been supporting the work of the Secretary General's special representative on children and armed conflict. UNICEF's work on establishing national immunisation days (NIDs), mentioned in the report, is also supported by my Department.

 Precise information on the extent of humanitarian needs remains incomplete. Large numbers of people, particularly among immigrant communities but also Ivorian citizens and refugees, have been displaced due to the conflict. There are real humanitarian needs and the situation could deteriorate quickly with scope for further conflict. In December, as an initial response to immediate needs, we released 2,000 tents, 30,000 blankets and 200 rolls of plastic sheeting from our emergency relief stockpile to boost UNHCR's regional stockpile in Accra, Ghana; also contributed towards an urgent airlift of UNHCR relief items to Liberia. I have also recently approved a contribution of #1 million towards appeals from agencies working in Cote d'lvoire. We continue to monitor the humanitarian situation and are working closely with others in the international community to try to bring about a swift and peaceful resolution to the conflict.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w24.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 There has been a trend towards reintroduction of sorghum in southern Mozambique to promote resilience to drought. However, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) recently held a meeting that concluded that sorghum is not an ideal alternative to maize in southern Mozambique.
<P>

<a name="30107w24.html_para1">Though sorghum resists drought a little bit better than maize, it is not a drought resistant crop, it is very labour intensive, has a long growing period and has high demands on soil fertility and moisture. Maize has also tended to experience steady market prices and an unlimited demand on the market as an export crop for Europe.
<P>

<a name="30107w24.html_para2">The FAO meeting concluded that the best solution for southern Africa would be to identify patches with the right conditions for either maize or sorghum, and that the success of the introduction of any new crop will depend on the prevailing economic and marketing prospects.

 Catherine Bertini's report, and the subsequent UN Humanitarian Plan of Action, stimulated a very useful debate in the international community on how best to respond to the growing humanitarian crisis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. I agreed in October 2002 an additional #5 million DFID contribution to help meet most urgent needs of the Palestinian people. Total projected expenditure for support to Palestinians for this financial year is now #32 million. This comprises #15 million bilaterally and #17 million through UNRWA.

 We are providing support for a number of emergency programmes, including non-salary budgetary support, trauma counselling, special educational needs and UNRWA's emergency appeals. This year, out of estimated bilateral expenditure of #15 million, we anticipate that about #8 million will be for 'emergency' programmes. In addition, we have contributed #7 million to UNRWA's emergency appeal for 2002.

 UNRWA's needs are urgent, and it is critical to ensure that it receives consistent and predictable levels of support. The UK is UNRWA's second largest bilateral donor. In addition to our funding for UNRWA's regular budget&#151;#42 million over the last three years&#151;we have contributed over #20 million for UNRWA's emergency appeals in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w24.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Fuel supplies have been erratic in Zimbabwe for the last three years. The problem is a direct consequence of economic mismanagement. Foreign exchange to pay for fuel is very scarce, yet it is still sold at controlled prices that do not cover costs.
<P>

<a name="30107w24.html_para3">Larger organisations such as the UN and International NGOs, and other Government missions including DFID, have contracted to purchase fuel direct from importers at world-market rates and pay in foreign currency. The WFP has buffer stocks, some of which are in the rural areas and their feeding programmes are not likely to be seriously disrupted.
<P>

<a name="30107w24.html_para4">Smaller organisations that rely on the commercial transport industry to distribute their food have been harder hit. However, these too are becoming more adept in covering short-term fuel problems, either through building up a reserve when fuel is available, or pre-positioning food supplies in rural areas. DFID's feeding partner organisations all pre-positioned food in the rural areas for the Christmas and new year period, and food distribution has continued.
<P>

<a name="30107w24.html_para5">The short-term impact of fuel shortages has therefore been minimal to date.

The UK has provided #38 million of assistance in response to the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe since September 2001.

 This is a matter in the first instance for Wychavon district council as the local planning authority. I understand that a planning application has been made by SUSTRANS for a cycle track along a section of the Gloucestershire and Warwickshire railway line which also extends into Cotswold district. This is for the authorities to determine and it would not be appropriate for Ministers to become involved in this local matter.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w25.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We have had several discussions with the Community Transport Association and the Association of Transport Co-ordinating Officers about the regulations affecting community transport.
<P>

<a name="30107w25.html_para7">Regulations were brought forward in England, with effect from 1 May 2002, to extend the Bus Service Operators Grant (formerly Fuel Duty Rebate) to a wider range of community transport services. I understand that the National Assembly for Wales has introduced similar provisions with effect from 14 August 2002.
<P>

<a name="30107w25.html_para8">In addition we have recently consulted on proposals (affecting both England and Wales) to facilitate the registration of flexibly routed bus services, which should increase the scope for community operators (among others) to register such services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w25.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The provisions governing the exemption from vehicle excise duty for vehicles used by or on behalf of disabled people are set out in schedule 2 of the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994. Paragraph 20 of the schedule states that a vehicle used for the carriage of disabled people by a body recognised by the Secretary of State is exempt from vehicle excise duty. In practise this means that the body should be registered with the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee.
<P>

<a name="30107w25.html_para9">However, section 15(2) of the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act states that where a vehicle is used in a way which would render it liable to taxation at a higher rate, the higher rate is payable. This means that where a vehicle is used for both disabled and able-bodied people, vehicle excise duty is payable at the normal rate applicable to that vehicle.

I have been asked by the Transport Minister, David Jamieson, to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about noise levels on the M20 Motorway between Junctions 8 and 9.
<BR>
Regrettably, we no longer have the detailed records that were available at the public inquiry, which was held in 1986. The standard methodology used predicts noise levels based on the predicted volume of traffic together with other local factors.
<BR>
The factor not taken into account at that time was the effect of the concrete surface and the significance of this emerged as soon as traffic began to use it. We have tried to prevent the problem occurring elsewhere and mitigation, in the form of noise insulation and financial compensation, was made available to those adversely affected by this section of M20.
<BR>
The effects of the concrete surface on the M20 have been investigated along with 16 other roads built with this type of surface since 1988 and the Highways Agency is committed to resurfacing all of these as part of the Government's 10 Year Plan.

 The Directions and Guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority, first issued by the Secretary of State on 11 April, state that the Authority should seek to promote the personal security of passengers travelling by rail. It should promote improved personal security at stations by encouraging accreditation under the Secure Stations Scheme and the Secured Car Park Scheme. It should also work with appropriate bodies to improve personal security on pedestrian routes to stations.

 The London Borough of Newham was the first local authority to take on devolved powers to clamp and impound unlicensed vehicles in partnership with DVLA.
<P>

<a name="30107w27.html_para1">During the 12 months of the pilot scheme 2,000 vehicles were wheelclamped. Half of these vehicles were released upon payment with the result that these vehicles are now correctly registered.
<P>

<a name="30107w27.html_para2">Surveys undertaken by Newham council before and at the end of the pilot scheme showed the level of evasion had reduced by 15per cent., the result of additional and visible enforcement in the borough.

<P>
<a name="30107w27.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Sandy-Bedford rail link and the Bedford-Milton Keynes canal link are possible schemes that have been considered within the London-South Midlands multi-modal study. The consultants are expected to report next month and will include an assessment of the impact on CO2 levels for the preferred strategy across the study area as a whole. The three regional planning bodies whose areas the study relates to will then consider the recommendations of the study and pass their advice to Ministers. We would expect to announce our decisions on the study recommendations in the spring or summer of this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment has been made of the effectiveness of speed cameras in reducing <i>(a)</i> speed and <i>(b)</i> accidents.  [88552]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w27.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Speed enforcement cameras have proved to be highly effective at reducing speeding and crashes when placed at sites or along routes with a history of speed related crashes. In the first year of the safety camera pilot scheme the number of those killed and seriously injured has been reduced on average by 47 per cent. at camera sites. A full two year report of the cost recovery system for the eight pilot areas in the safety camera scheme will be published shortly, and will be made available in the Library.

<P>
<a name="30107w27.html_wqn10"><B> Mrs. Calton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of how many speeding motorists have <i>(a)</i> been caught as a result of speed cameras and <i>(b)</i> caused accidents by sudden reduction of speed on approaching speed cameras in the last three years.  [88553]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w27.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> The most recent year for which data are available is 2000. In 2000 733,500 drivers were either prosecuted or fined for speeding as a result of detection by camera in England and Wales. In 1999 and 1998 the numbers were respectively 498,600 and 403,800.
<P>

<a name="30107w27.html_para3"><i>(b)</i> There is no evidence that accidents are caused by motorists suddenly reducing speed at camera locations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w27.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Guidelines on camera deployment are contained in Circular Roads 1/93 that was subject to the normal consultation process. Where areas net off, additional guidelines and rules are in place. These have been approved by Ministers in consultation with the Safety Camera Project Board consisting of representatives of relevant Government Departments, the police and local authorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many residents near and adjacent to speed cameras were consulted about the positioning of each camera on average in the last year for which figures are available.  [88556]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w27.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 No information is held centrally about the number of local residents that may have been consulted because there is no requirement to consult local residents on the positioning of speed cameras.

 There is no requirement to consult local residents on the siting of speed cameras.

 Fixed site speed cameras are structures and equipment for the detection of traffic offences. As such highway authorities have powers under the Highways Act 1980 section 95(A) to install and maintain speed cameras on or near a highway. Any resident concerned about the visual presence of camera installations may make representations to the highway authority concerned.

 The local transport capital expenditure settlement announced on 10 December provides #13.9 million for Worcestershire for 2003&#150;04, including #1 million in respect of the proposed Chadbury-Twyford link road east of the Wyre Piddle bypass. The Wyre Piddle bypass has itself received funding of #5.9 million and is nearing completion. It is for Worcestershire county council as the local highway authority to consider whether the western Wyre Piddle link road is a priority within their local transport plan and for any future transport settlement.

 It will be for the Boundary Committee to decide on the size and number of unitary authorities it recommends in a local government review, having regard to any Guidance issued. The draft of the Guidance, on which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently consulting, indicates that in the Government's view the Boundary Committee will need to consider the impact of size on the organisational and managerial capacity of an authority in the context of the most appropriate unitary authorities for an area being those best able to deliver quality services and effective community leadership.

<a name="30107w29.html_para0">As we set out in our White Paper Strong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services XProperty Owners have a key role to play in BIDs. But there are significant practical difficulties in extending the levy to property owners, outside the rating system. This would, in effect, be a new tax on property ownership. The Office of the Deputy PrimeMinister therefore intends to build voluntary contributions, already substantial in many existing projects, into the model for BIDs in England. This would be done through the guidance rather than the legislation. This will encourage BID partnershipsto involve property owners from the start so that they can participate in the development and the implementation of BID proposals."

 The final report of the Independent Review of the Fire Service puts forward a series of common sense reforms which will lead to a better service, to a safer service, and to a service which saves more lives. These include the recommendation that the service should move to a system of targeted (or risk based) fire cover, based on a careful, professional assessment of the real risk of incidents in the each local area.

<a name="30107w29.html_para1">Risk based fire cover is not about cutting fire stations or firefighters.

 Robust information on housing need and stock condition is essential to the effective delivery of local authorities' housing strategic and landlord roles. The quality of this information is addressed in the annual scrutiny of authorities' housing strategies and housing revenue account business plans carried out by Government offices and will also be covered in some of the Housing Inspectorate's best value inspections. Detailed guidance is available to authorities on issues to be considered in commissioning housing need and stock condition surveys and in the use of the data obtained.

 As the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned in his reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King) on 16 December 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 612W, the office of the Deputy Prime Minister is considering whether overcrowding-including in rented accommodation-is best tackled through a more modern set of standards or through the new Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS), on which the office hopes to legislate when Parliamentary time allows. Provisions to introduce HHSRS will form part of the Housing Bill which we intend to publish in draft during this session.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w30.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Information on sheltered, or extra care housing was collected for Housing Investment Programme purposes until 2000. The number of very sheltered housing places was 18,041 in 1997 and 20,269 in 2000. Up to date figures will shortly be available from the supply mapping exercise undertaken by local authorities as part of the preparations for supporting people.
<P>

<a name="30107w30.html_para1">My right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) has announced a target of increasing the levels of extra care provision by 50 per cent. on 1997 levels by 2006. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will work to ensure that the number of places available in 2005 is at least in line with this target.

 We have gained useful experience through running the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) pilots. In light of this, when the scheme is extended to all areas in England in September 2004, there will be changes to the income assessment. This will no longer take account of the income of a parent who lives apart from the young person. Instead, the assessment will be based on household income and follow the same principles used by the Inland Revenue for calculating entitlement to the new tax credits.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on participation rates broken down by socio-economic class of parents of higher education students in each year since 1990.  [88328]<P>

<P>
<a name="30107w31.html_spnew6"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The latest available information is shown in the table. The sharp rise in participation rates in the early 1990s reflects the expansion of the higher education sector during these years. There was an increase in entrant numbers in 1997 related partly to the funding arrangements for higher education, with students choosing to enter HE rather than wait until 1998. There was a corresponding reduction in 1998 before the entry rates started to increase again in 1999.
<P>

<a name="30107w31.html_para1">The Government are committed to raising the participation rates for people from less affluent family backgrounds, and has introduced Excellence Challenge, including the AimHigher campaign, which is targeted at raising attainment and aspirations among young people who traditionally would not consider going to university.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what applications have been made for exemptions related to innovation under the Education Act 2002; and in each case <i>(a)</i> when the application was made, <i>(b)</i> what decision has been reached and <i>(c)</i> what his grounds were for that decision.

<P>
<a name="30107w31.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband </B> 
: <i>[holding answer 17 December 2002]:</i> The Department has received one application under section 2 of the Education Act (the 'power to innovate'). Langley Junior School applied on 7 November 2002 to gain exemption from the Changing of School Session Times Regulations 1999. The application has been approved because it will enable the school to create time for a curriculum enrichment session for pupils, and planning, preparation and assessment time for teachers. The Power to Innovate was needed to enable the school to implement the changes sooner than the start of the new school year (as required by regulations). We are expecting to receive many more inquiries and applications as this new power becomes known.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w31.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The entitlement for all pupils to study languages at Key Stage 2 must include one of the working languages of the European Union. It will be for schools to decide which European Union language is chosen. Over and above that, it is for schools to decide which and how many languages they choose to offer. Schools may decide for example to offer one main language, or one or two main languages and additional 'taster' sessions in other languages. In addition, by drawing in foreign language speakers, such as parents, those in the community and in business, schools will be in a position to offer and promote a much wider range of languages than has been possible before.

 A total of #710 million has been made available to schools in England through the ICT in Schools Standards Fund over the 2002&#150;04 financial years. This funding is targeted to improve schools' ICT infrastructure and connectivity. It is for individual LEAs to decide how the funding is distributed to schools in line with their ICT development plans.
<P>

<a name="30107w31.html_para2">An additional #30 million has been distributed to schools in September 2002 in the form of eLearning Credits (eLCs) for the sole use of buying certified curriculum online digital learning products. A further #20 million will be distributed in April 2003.
<P>

<a name="30107w31.html_para3">We will continue to work with public and private sector providers to increase provision, raise the quality and widen the range of online teaching and learning materials. The new curriculum online service will facilitate teacher access to high quality electronic materials across the curriculum and will stimulate the development of materials for languages as well as for other subjects. There are also many online and offline ICT resources already available for teachers, including the British Educational SoftwareDatabase and the National Grid for Learning website. The Department is currently considering other ways of using ICT to support the teaching and learning of Modern Foreign Languages at Key Stage 2.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on the common funding approach to be adopted by the Learning and Skills Council for 2003&#150;04 and subsequent years.  [87032]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w32.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) is establishing a common funding approach for 2003&#150;04 for further education, work-based learning, and school sixth forms. This replaces the previous separate funding arrangements for these three sectors. Adult and community learning will be brought progressively into the common funding approach as far as appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30107w32.html_para0">The main principle of the common funding approach is that funding must follow the learner. It is built on the best elements of the former Further Education Funding Council's national system of formula based funding. The key elements of this system include funding elements for the basic costs for delivering all programmes, the extra costs for specialist programmes, learner achievement, extra support for disadvantaged learners, and higher costs for delivering provision in London and related areas.
<P>

<a name="30107w32.html_para1">The LSC National Council has set up a Funding Group to consider future development of the common funding approach, including simplification of funding arrangements in response to the recommendations of the Bureaucracy Task Force. The LSC will take account of the XSuccess for All" strategy document and the forthcoming Government statements on 14&#150;19 learning and on the Review of Funding of Adult Learning. We will ensure that the outcome and implications are clear for school sixth forms, colleges and other providers of further education and training.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans he has to review the charitable status given to public schools; and if he will make a statement.  [88272]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w32.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30107w32.html_para2">The Cabinet Office report, XPrivate Action, Public Benefit", was published on 25 September 2002. Its 61 recommendations set out a package of measures which aim to modernise charity law and enable a wide range of organisations to be more effective and innovative.
<P>

<a name="30107w32.html_para3">The report recommends that in future all charities should have to demonstrate public benefit. Part of the report considers what happens now with those charities that charge fees which serve to exclude large sections of the population in terms of their having to make provision for wider access for those who would be excluded because of the fees. The report cites the example of independent schools.
<P>

<a name="30107w32.html_para4">At present there is no systematic programme in place to check the public character of charities. The report recommends that an on-going review programme run by the Charity Commission should check the public character of such organisations. It is proposed that the commission would identify charities likely to charge high fees (such as independent schools) and undertake a rolling programme to check that provision was made for wider access. This programme will be designed to minimise red tape and will not focus on any particular sector. Short returns will be issued which ask charities what they do in terms of widening access, such as making provision for sharing facilities. It is envisaged that for the majority of cases no further inquiry will be necessary beyond the initial return.
<P>

<a name="30107w32.html_para5">It is proposed that the Charity Commission, in consultation with charities likely to be affected and their umbrella bodies, would issue guidelines as to the level of access appropriate in particular circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30107w32.html_para6">Of course at the moment these are only proposals. The report was out for consultation until 31 December 2002, and we shall consider the responses to this, and all the other matters addressed in the report, very carefully.

<P>
<a name="30107w33.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has sent no response to representations on these targets. In recent weeks, officials have had meetings with representatives of the Construction Products Association to give details of the capital strategy and the role of the DfES in providing support for capital investment in their buildings by schools and LEAs. The Department is currently considering how best to collect information on the delivery of improved school buildings without imposing undue bureaucratic burdens locally or centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on the criteria which he will use to allocate planned extra resources for student places to particular <i>(a)</i> universities and <i>(b)</i> courses, with special reference to the academic excellence of particular institutions. [88230]<P>

<P>
<a name="30107w34.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) determine the extra allocations for individual institutions through an annual bidding exercise for additional student numbers. The criteria for the allocation of these places for 2003&#150;04 are set out in the HEFCE publication, XAdditional Student Places and Funds 2003&#150;04", report number 2002/39. The strategy document on higher education, which will be published in January 2003, will set out our vision for the future funding of higher education.

 Figures for the number of students who enter higher education are not collated centrally by constituency.
<P>

<a name="30107w34.html_para0">The available figures for Great Britain, showing the proportion of under 21-year-olds who enter higher education for the first time, are given in the table. There was an increase in the index in 1997&#150;98 related partly to changes in the funding arrangements for higher education, with students choosing to enter HE rather than wait until 1998&#150;99. There was a corresponding reduction in 1998&#150;99 before the entry rates started to increase again in 1999&#150;2000. Between 1997&#150;98 and 2000&#150;01, total HE students in English universities and colleges rose by 83,000. Nationally, around nine out of 10 18-year-olds who obtain two or more A levels enter HE by the time they are 21.

The members of the Council commended the Secretary General for the initiatives he had taken in November and December 2002 to bridge the gaps between the two sides and to enable them to reach an agreement. They expressed the view that the proposal put forward on 11 November as revised on 10 December offered an unique opportunity to reach a settlement in the coming weeks.

They underlined the importance of intensifying the negotiations so that full agreement could be reached before 28 February 2003, in conformity with the timetable proposed by the Secretary General in his proposals.

 As much UN information is available on-line, the United Nations Secretary- General in his report of 23 September 2002, "Strengthening of the United Nations", recommended the rationalisation of UN Information Centres in Western Europe, with their work being taken on by a single regional "hub". We believe the London UN Information Centre does an excellent job in promoting the UN in the UK. But we also fully support the Secretary-General's Reform report, which we believe will help to achieve a more efficient UN with resources focussed on priority activities. The proposed rationalisation of UN information centres will result in savings, which will be reallocated to those parts of the world with less access to information technology.

It is for the Secretary of State, in practice The National Asylum Support Service (NASS), to determine whether a person is a dependant under 18 and to determine who forms part of the household and can therefore receive support irrespective of whether the asylum seeker concerned applied for asylum as soon as reasonably practicable.

 No central records are maintained of the number of prisoners taken to hospital for medical treatment or the number of those who are held under restraint, and the information requested can be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The application of restraints to prisoners at hospital is determined by a risk assessment but restraints are not applied to women attending for antenatal treatment or to give birth. Once applied, restraints may be removed subject to a risk assessment, and will be removed where a healthcare professional seeks their removal because of an immediate risk to the health of the prisoner, or because the prisoner is in pain or discomfort, or because the restraints are impeding essential treatment.

 Air and shipping services are 'reserved' matters, which are the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Transport. Northern Ireland is reasonably well served at present by the existing transport linkages with Scotland, however there is always potential for such links to be further strengthened and enhanced, and I would expect this to happen as the private sector operators respond to new commercial opportunities and the changing market. It remains to be seen though what effect the growing competition between air and shipping operators will have on the Northern Ireland-Scotland routes.

<i>[holding answer 16 December 2002]:</i> The answer is as follows:
<P>

<a name="30107w37.html_para3"><i>(a)</i> I became aware that ASW Holdings Ltd. was in difficulty in early July and immediately initiated discussions to try to help the company. My colleague, Minister of State for Employment Relations, Industry and the Regions, held an emergency meeting, on 8 July 2002 involving the company, its bankers and credit insurers. Despite these efforts, I was informed on 10 July 2002 that the company unfortunately had been left with no alternative but to call in the receivers.

[87459]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w37.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 ASW is in administrative receivership and discussions with potential purchasers of the company are entirely a matter for the receivers, KPMG. My Department has therefore had no discussions with Celsa. My Department has, as you might expect, maintained a dialogue, and met, with KPMG to keep abreast of developments in order to assess the future of the company and its workforce. It has also maintained contact with officials at the Welsh Assembly to exchange information on the progress of discussions between the receivers and potential purchasers.
<P>

<a name="30107w37.html_para6">The sale of parts of ASW to Celsa has not been finalised. The discussions between Celsa and KPMG are subject to a confidentiality agreement and so full details of the proposed agreement are not known at this stage. Celsa has indicated that if its bid is finalised it hopes to create jobs for around 600 in Cardiff. KPMG continue discussions with prospective purchasers for the parts of the Sheerness plant not included in the proposed Celsa deal and I very much hope that a buyer can be found.

Similarly, the Welsh Assembly Government inform me that no grants have been awarded to the Cardiff site from Welsh authorities. Celsa, although it is currently in discussion with KPMG for the purchase of parts of ASW, is a Spanish company with no known business operations in the UK, and so would not have received any grants in the UK.

 The migration of benefit payments to ACT will take place over two years from April 2003. There will not be a sudden drop in benefit book related income in April 2003. On changeover of payment arrangements, all customers who wish to do so will be able to access their benefits in cash at a post office counter and sub-postmasters will be remunerated for those transactions. The change in revenue as a result of changes to the method of paying benefits from April 2003 will vary according to the individual circumstances of each office, and the extent to which they develop new revenue streams, including from banking services.
<P>

<a name="30107w39.html_para3">Post Office Ltd. continues to develop plans for expansion of revenue generating services in the post office network. Banking will be a central part of the Post Office's strategy to move forward.

 As I announced on 15 October, although the outcome of the evaluation of the Your Guide pilot of post offices as Government General Practitioners showed that a publicly funded national Your Guide service would not provide value for money and we therefore decided not to extend it, the pilot did identify opportunities for individual Government Departments to deliver services through post offices in the future. There is also commercial interest in placing kiosks in retail outlets including post offices. It is expected that a commercial kiosk pilot run by E-Daily will start in Cornwall next year and that this will involve a number of post offices. Officials in my Department are in contact with other departments about the potential for using E-Daily as an information channel and I understand that E-Daily is in direct touch with other departments as well as with the National Federation of Sub Postmasters.

<P>

 The universal postal service obligation was laid down in the Postal Services Act 2000 and consists of a service provided at an affordable price determined by a public tariff uniform throughout the United Kingdom. It includes the delivery each working day to the home or premises of every individual in the United Kingdom and a collection each working day from access points, subject to the exceptions to this agreed with Postcomm.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w40.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The intention of the scheme to help those MPS members on the lowest pensions who left British Coal before or shortly after 1975 is to address the problem of retired mineworkers who receive very low pensions in spite of lengthy service in the industry. For this reason, mineworkers with less than five years contributory service were excluded. For most MPS members, service prior to April 1961 is not included because they opted to take a refund of contributions with respect to that service, although service prior to April 1961 is counted in the cases of those who chose not to exercise that option. We have no plans to revisit these criteria.

 The Department commissioned a high level feasibility study into the possibility of building a subsea cable to transfer electricity generated in Scotland down the west coast to markets in the south. The report, which was published in February and is available on the DTI website: www.dti.gov.uk, includes capital costings for different systems and costs will be dependent of course on the length of the cable and its capacity. For illustrative purposes, the report concludes that the capital costs of an HVDC link capable of transferring 2000 MW of electricity would range from #790 million for a 200 km cable to #1,700 million for a 700 km cable.

 The UK Government have been at the forefront of the international debate on debt relief issues, and continues to press for the rapid and full implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Under the terms of the HIPC initiative bilateral creditors typically provide 90 per cent. debt relief. However, many creditors, including the UK, go further and provide 100 per cent. debt relief to qualifying countries.
<P>

<a name="30107w41.html_para4">In the provision of interim debt relief at Decision Point to reach a debt-to-exports ratio of 150 per cent. this additional bilateral voluntary debt relief is excluded. Subsequently at Completion Point if this debt ratio is greater than 150 per cent., perhaps due to new borrowing or weaker export prices, the initiative provides the option for further debt relief or 'topping-up'. Moreover, the UK has argued that we should be prepared to be proactive and flexible in providing this additional debt relief at Completion Point.
<P>

<a name="30107w41.html_para5">But at present this additional bilateral voluntary debt relief is included in the calculation of any 'topping-up' needed, and the net effect is that this additional relief benefits other creditors and not the HI PC. The UK believes that this additional relief should be excluded from the calculation of topping-up at Completion Point, and this would delineate more clearly the burden sharing between all creditors, both bilateral and multilateral, in the HIPC initiative.
<P>

<a name="30107w41.html_para6">This policy would ensure that this voluntary debt relief over and above HIPC terms would be truly additional. Moreover, it would provide an additional degree of support to vulnerable HIPCs facing the challenges of a global economic slowdown and weaker commodity prices.
<P>

<a name="30107w41.html_para7">However, even the provision of 100 per cent. debt relief to all low-income countries would still far short of the resources needed to fund the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is our ultimate objective to make a lasting difference in the lives of the world's poorest people by achieving the MDGs, but debt relief is only part of the solution: the real issue is one of total resources. That is why the Chancellor has proposed an International Financing Facility to leverage significant additional resources from developed countries, to help achieve the 2015 MDGs. Increasing our support from $50billion currently to the $100 billion a year needed to meet the MDGs would transform the ability of countries to increase their investment in critical poverty reducing programmes. The UK Government will shortly be publishing a detailed proposal on the International Financing Facility.

 The Treasury monitors those outputs which can be measured, such as replies to parliamentary questions, letters or other communications with the public, payment performance, and so on. However the Treasury's primary output is policy advice. Such outputs are difficult to measure&#151;and without a measure of overall output it is not possible to measure efficiency.

 Enterprise Areas are designed to improve access to and take-up of a number of Government policy measures focused on tackling the barriers to small business in disadvantaged areas. They are intended to ensure that these policies form a coherent package from the perspective of existing and potential new businesses, so that take-up by businesses in disadvantaged areas is easier, and effectiveness in improving outcomes is increased. In addition to stamp duty exemption on property transfers up to #150,000, and policies designed to tackle market failures and provide better business support, the Government is looking at ways to make the planning regime in Enterprise Areas more flexible.
<P>

<a name="30107w42.html_para1">The Enterprise Areas are the 2,000 most deprived areas across the UK. They are the same as the areas which benefit from the stamp duty exemption on property transfers up to #150,000. A list can be found at <i>www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/so/disadvantaged.htm</i>.

To ask Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the accuracy of the estimates he used of house price inflation from <i>(a)</i> major mortgage providers and <i>(b)</i> the Land Registry; and if he will make a statement.  [89394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w42.html_spnew10"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 There are significant concerns about whether currently available measures give adequate estimates of house price inflation. The Land Registry produces the most comprehensive measure, covering all transactions in England and Wales. However, price changes as measured by the Land Registry are affected by changes in the composition (mix) of transactions, as well as pure price changes. Mix- adjustment is desirable as there is significant variation from one period to the next in the characteristics of properties sold size, type eg flat or house, location and other factors that affect price. Figures from the Halifax and Nationwide are mix-adjusted, and also more timely, but only cover properties purchased with mortgages from these providers. These two indicators can show significant differences, highlighting concerns as to how representative they are. The Government is concerned about such discrepancies, and is therefore planning to launch a new official house price measure in the Summer 2003, though it will not cover non-mortgage financed house purchases.

The changes will therefore protect the tax base and ensure a fairer distribution of tax across the industry.

 Treasury officials have had discussions with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in connection with their report XAchieving Community Benefits through Contracts". As the report acknowledges, the authors' understanding of the issues surrounding the procurement policy and legal framework has been furthered by discussions with, inter alia, officials at HM Treasury and the Office of Government Commerce (OGC).

 There are no plans to introduce a take up target for the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG). However, from October 2003, the MIG will be replaced by pension credit. The Public Service Agreement (PSA) target is to be paying pension credit to at least three million households by 2006.

<P>
<a name="30107w44.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney </B> 
<i> [holding answer 12 December 2002]:</i> Ministers have met members of the ASW Action Group and their constituency MPs to discuss the Group's concerns about the Cardiff and Sheemess pension schemes. We identified a number of practical ways forward and have written to the hon. Member on a number of detailed technical pension issues on the process of winding up, and has raised the concerns of the Group as appropriate within Government.
<P>

<a name="30107w44.html_para0">It was also suggested that the scheme's independent trustee might like to contact the Inland Revenue to discuss the option of members being re-introduced into the State Second Pension (formerly SERPS). It may be possible, under the 'deemed buyback' provisions contained in the Pensions Act 1995, for members to have their state scheme rights restored, thus ensuring that they receive an additional pension under the state scheme, in addition to basic state pension.
<P>

<a name="30107w44.html_para1">The Government recognises that the ASW situation is extremely unfortunate, and that is why it acted quickly to put in place a range of measures through Jobcentre Plus, in conjunction with key partner organisations to help those employees being made redundant. No responsible Government could agree to be the guarantor of private pension savings. It would place huge liabiliites on tax payers some of whom will not have private savings of their own.
<P>

<a name="30107w44.html_para2">The Government is concerned about schemes that wind up with insufficient assets to cover their liabilities. That is why it has set out proposals aimed at improving protection for scheme members in the pensions Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement', Cm 5677. The Green Paper includes proposals to share out scheme assets more fairly, introduce some form of insurance and strengthen protection for members whose solvent employer chooses to wind up its scheme

 The discretionary Social Fund provides help with unexpected or occasional costs which vary widely in their nature and importance, to a wide range of client groups. People applying for community care grants can request any items they wish, whether or not they fall within the scope of the scheme. In deciding whether, and for what items, a grant is payable a balance has to be struck between meeting people's needs and the costs of providing that support from available resources.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

For 1998&#150;99,and part of 1999&#150;2000, it was possible to make a dual application for both a budgeting loan and a community care grant. For these years the average amount applied for is based on community care grant applications only, while the average amount initially awarded is for both types of application. Dual applications were phased out from 5 April 1999.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how much housing benefit is unclaimed so far this financial year; and what impact he expects the implementation of the Supporting People Partnership will have on reducing this figure.  [89242]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w44.html_spnew7"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Estimates of unclaimed Housing Benefit for 19997/2000, the latest financial year for which information is available, are in the report XIncome Related Benefits: Estimates of Take-Up 1999/2000", a copy of which is in the Library. Estimates for 2000&#150;01 will be published in March 2003. The Supporting People programme will give local authorities a leading role in matching the provision of housing-related support services with local needs so as to give vulnerable people in the community improved choice and flexibility. Under the programme, providers of support services and local authorities will encourage people to claim the Housing Benefit to which they are entitled, if they have not already done so. However, the impact of the programme on benefit take-up will not be measurable in isolation.

<a name="30107w44.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Love: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the change in the number of occupational pension schemes since the abolition of the right for employers to make membership a condition of employment; and if he will make a statement.  [89396]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w44.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Provision of an occupational pension scheme is a voluntary act by the employer and changes in the numbers of occupational pensions schemes since the abolition of the right to make membership compulsory in 1988 are unlikely to be related to whether membership of any particular scheme is compulsory.
<P>

<a name="30107w44.html_para5">A significant number of employees are not taking advantage of the occupational pension provision of their employers. The General Household Survey (2001) indicates that less than 70 per cent of employees whose employer provides a pension scheme actually participate in their employer's scheme. As a result, the Pensions Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: working and saving for retirement' Cm 5677, suggests options for employers to be able to make membership of their occupational pension schemes a condition of employment for new employees. This could be one way of increasing the numbers of employees who are members of, and contributing to, their occupational pension scheme and may have benefits for employers in terms of recruitment and retention of staff.

<a name="30107w45.html_para0">The Government Actuary's Department estimate that the unfunded public service pension scheme liabilities are approximately #380 billion as at 31 March 2002. It is not possible to separate out the liabilities relating to civil servants working for the Ministry of Defence, but the liabilities of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme covering armed forces personnel is #53.5 billion. The liabilities of the major public service schemes are reported in Resource Accounts, and from 2003&#150;04, the liabilities of the smaller schemes will be incorporated into the balance sheets of employers who are mainly non-departmental public bodies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w45.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Estimates of pension credit spending, included as part of total state pension spending in HM Treasury's publication, XLong-term Public Finance Report: An Analysis of Fiscal Sustainability", assumed that the savings credit threshold would be up-rated in line with increases to the basic state pension, and the guarantee credit would be up-rated by average earnings. The long-term assumption was that average real earnings would grow in line with productivity of two per cent. a year. This is one of several possible up-rating scenarios.

 The Department does not collect statistics on violence against social workers centrally. However, it did commission a national task force on violence against social workers that reported early in 2001. The task force made a number of recommendations that were accepted by Government and social care employer organisations.
<P>

<a name="30107w45.html_para1">The early targets recommended by the task force were for employers to: undertake an audit of their organisation's ability to deal with violence and abuse, do a training needs analysis for their workforce, prepare an action plan and begin to effect planned developments. The longer term target was for local authority employers to reduce incidents of violence and abuse by 25 per cent. by 2005 and the Department is working with employers to set up the means to measure their progress. The Department maintains and updates a website that was set up under the auspices of the task force on violence against social care. It is at www.doh.gov.uk/violenttaskforce. The Department does not collect information on reported number of violent or abusive incidents by groups of staff or by services such as child protection within the national health service. However, in June 2002 the following survey was published: X2000/2001 Reported Violent or Abusive Incidents, Accidents Involving Staff and Sickness Absence in NHS Trusts and Health Authorities in England". This survey states that there were a total of 84,273 reported violent or abusive incidents across all the staff in NHS trusts and health authorities in England in 2000&#150;01. A copy of this report is available in the Library.

<i>:</i> The Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000 strengthens the rights of carers to an assessment of their own needs as carers, and also gives local councils more powers to directly support carers. The carers grant for 2003&#150;04 will be increased to #100 million to ensure that more carers are able to receive breaks. One of the major changes to this grant is that the proportion to be spent on carers services will increase from 10 per cent, to 16 per cent.

 The Government recognise that there is still more to be done to ensure that high standards of child protection are applied in every case. That is why it commissioned XSafeguarding Children", the Joint Chief Inspectors' report on arrangements to safeguard children. It is also why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health and the Home Secretary set up the statutory Inquiry, chaired by Lord Laming, into the circumstances leading up to, and surrounding, the death of Victoria Climbi&#233;. The issues raised by Victoria's case are wide-ranging, in terms of both policy and practice. The recommendations of the Joint Chief Inspectors' report and those of the Victoria Climbi&#233; Inquiry will provide us with an authoritative basis for any reforms to child protection that may need to be made, and, if radical reform is necessary, we will implement it. In considering these reports, the Government will also consider all relevant recommendations in the Ainlee Walker/Labonte Serious Case Review report and those arising from any other serious case review reports that may be published in the near future.

 <i>[holding answer 19 December 2002]:</i> Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in animals are part of a group of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases. The precise nature of the agent responsible for CJD is not fully understood, but the most likely theory points to an abnormal form, known as a prion, of a normal cell protein. According to the protein-only hypothesis, infectious prions are composed mainly if not entirely of the abnormal form of the prion protein, which aggregates in infected tissue.
<P>

<a name="30107w48.html_para0">Post mortem examination of the brains of CJD patients and BSE animals shows the accumulation of the abnormal protein and there is a massive destruction of the brain, which shows the characteristic spongy appearance.
<P>

<a name="30107w48.html_para1">Although there is no direct evidence that the BSE prion is infectious to humans, obtaining such evidence could not be justified ethically as this would require humans to be inoculated with BSE agent. A judgment on the link between BSE and vCJD inevitably depends on an assessment of a range of clinical, pathological, epidemiological and laboratory based evidence. There is now convincing evidence that the agent causing BSE is

<P><I>7 Jan 2003 : Column 185W</I><P>

 <i>[holding answer 16 December 2002]:</i> Single measles and single mumps vaccines, which are prescribed and administered outside the national childhood immunisation programme, are imported unlicensed medicines. Licensed single rubella vaccine is currently available in the United Kingdom. Unlicensed single rubella vaccine may only be imported and supplied when the licensed vaccine is unavailable. Importers, who must be licensed by the Medicines Control Agency, are required to notify the Agency on each occasion that they intend to import an unlicensed medicine. Notifications may be submitted daily, but the maximum quantity that may be imported per notification is controlled by legislation.

 Under their national health service terms of service, pharmacies are not required to provide monitored dosage systems. Primary care trusts can negotiate contracts with pharmacies to pay for the provision of monitored dosage systems where they consider it appropriate to meet the needs of patients locally.

<P>
<a name="30107w54.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
<i>.</i> Mental health services are provided in prisons by both National Health Service providers&#151;mental health in-reach and secondary care&#151;and by healthcare staff employed by prisons. In addition, many prisons employ health professionals with mental health speciality on a contractual or sessional basis to support the work of permanent staff or to provide secondary care advice.
<P>

<a name="30107w54.html_para1">Of those prison staff providing healthcare in prisons approximately one third of nurses, and 7 per cent. of doctors have formal psychiatric qualifications.
<P>

<a name="30107w54.html_para2">Within the prison service much training in mental health awareness is being developed and delivered to a range of staff, including training for non-healthcare staff who work with prisoners.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w54.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Letters from the public arrive at several different points in the Department of Health and we do not collate the information routinely. We have established a new Customer Services Centre to improve the timeliness of responses to correspondence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w54.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Projects are well under way to deliver beds for the dangerous and severe personality disorder (DSPD) programme at both Broadmoor and Rampton High Security Hospitals. This programme will deliver an additional 70 in-patient beds at both hospitals, to be completed by late 2004. Work is due to commence in January 2003 on an initial 10 bed pilot ward for DSPD patients at Broadmoor, which is expected to open in April 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what proportion of children who ran away from home since 1997 he estimates suffered from <i>(a)</i> physical abuse and <i>(b)</i> mental abuse.  [88189]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w54.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Government are aware from the social exclusion unit's XYoung Runaways" (2002) report that it is estimated that 77,000 children and young people run away every year, including nearly 20,000 who are under 11. However, the information

<P>
<a name="30107w54.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what definition he uses of <i>(a)</i> high secure beds, <i>(b)</i> medium secure beds, <i>(c)</i> low secure beds and <i>(d)</i> long-term secure beds in relation to hospitals.  [87441]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w54.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 High secure beds are intended for those who pose a grave and immediate danger to others. The perimeter security of these hospitals has recently been upgraded to be equivalent of that of a category B prison. There are three such hospitals: Rampton, Broadmoor and Ashworth.
<P>

<a name="30107w54.html_para3">Medium secure beds are designed for those who pose a lesser risk and, although there is significant perimeter security, the emphasis is on security derived from the close attention of the staff of the units.
<P>

<a name="30107w54.html_para4">Low secure beds are those for people who present a minimal risk, often to themselves. They are not designed to prevent a determined escape, and may consist of no more than a locked door to an otherwise conventional ward.
<P>

<a name="30107w54.html_para5">Long-term secure beds can be either medium or low secure, and are specifically designed for those who are expected to need to stay in hospital for longer than two years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will commission a cost-benefit analysis of care villages and other forms of extra-care or very-sheltered housing.  [84012]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w54.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Government's policy on long-term care for older people is to promote quality, choice and independence by the increased use of alternative forms of care provision, such as intensive home care and extra care or sheltered housing.
<P>

<a name="30107w54.html_para6">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, together with colleagues from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, is considering commissioning information which will help to evaluate comprehensively the state of the potential and future development of the extra care home sector.

<P>

<a name="30107w55.html_para2">The priorities for social services and social services performance in general are assessed by the Social Services Inspectorate, taking into account a broad range of performance evidence from performance indicators, inspections and in-year monitoring. Since May 2002 this assessment of performance has been summarised as the social services performance Xstar" rating. There are significant freedoms available for the best performing councils, providing an incentive to improve. Where councils show poor performance and we do not believe the council has the capacity to improve, we have provided assistance in the form of performance action teams. In cases of .serious failure we will not hesitate to use our formal intervention powers.

<a name="30107w55.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Since March 2002, we have taken a number of steps aimed at improving the delivery of thrombolysis, including:

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>investment of #10 million from the New Opportunities fund for cardiac monitoring equipment, electro-cardiograph (ECG) machines, on 999 ambulances, to support faster thrombolysis either en route or on arrival at the acute hospital;
<P>
<BR>
a further #14 million a year central investment over the next three years to complete the programme of providing ECGs for 999 ambulances, to provide thrombolysis training for paramedics and to modernise communications between ambulances and acute hospitals;
<P>
<BR>
work with the coronary heart disease collaborative to ensure paramedics pre-alert hospitals that heart attack patients are on the way, so that thrombolysis can be started immediately on arrival; and
<P>
<BR>
a rapid review of best practice with the coronary heart disease collaborative to support better delivery of thrombolysis across the national health service.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30107w55.html_para5">In addition, in October 2002 the National Institute for Clinical Excellence published XGuidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction". In November 2002, the Royal College of Physicians published hospital performance data by the myocardial infarction national audit project. This should help hospitals to improve the time they take to provide thrombolysis to patients with a heart attack.

<a name="30107w55.html_wqn5"><B> Angela Watkinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what progress has been made in establishing the Tinnitus Research Consortium agreed by the then Minister on 11 July 2000.  [88317]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30107w55.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 There was no such agreement. At the meeting on 11 July 2000 with representatives of the British Tinnitus Association, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Health (Mr. Hutton), who then had responsibility for sensory disabilities such as tinnitus, was asked for advice about sources of support for tinnitus research. My right hon. Friend suggested that an approach should be made to the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its grant in aid from the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Technology and which is the main agency through which the Government supports medical research.
<P>

<a name="30107w55.html_para6">While it is true to say that my right hon. Friend made clear that funds for tinnitus research might be available from the MRC, it would be a mistake to imply that he undertook to secure such funds. The MRC is independent in its funding decisions and does not generally earmark funds for particular topics.
<P>

<a name="30107w55.html_para7">The MRC has discussed mechanisms of funding with representatives of the British Tinnitus Association, and always welcomes high quality applications for funding medical research, which are judged in open competition with other demands on funding. The MRC is currently funding research projects related to tinnitus, mainly at the MRC Institute for Hearing Research in Nottingham. The MRC is also funding some more basic work on the auditory system, and this would inform any developments in treatments for a range of hearing disorders including tinnitus.
