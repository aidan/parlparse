Transparency International&#146;s survey last year rated the country 142nd from 163 states. A particular area of concern, despite the Congo-Brazzaville Government having made a statement of support for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), is the management of natural resource revenues, which lacks transparency and attracts widespread NGO criticism. Campaigners against corruption in the country have faced harassment from state officials. The British embassy have raised concerns on several occasions with the Congo-Brazzaville Government, and requested more information about the brief detention last year of two members of the Publish What You Pay Coalition who have been effective advocates of EITI locally.</p>

Expenditures from this account are limited to agreed poverty-reducing categories and monitored by a committee comprising representatives in observer status from international donors and Congolese civil society.

Brazil (3,103) and Indonesia (1,871) demonstrated the largest net forest loss (1000 hectares per year) between 2000 and 2005. However, the net rate of loss is slowing down, thanks to new planting and natural expansion of existing forests. A range of initiatives introduced by Brazil are thought to have reduced deforestation rates in the Amazon by an estimated 31 per cent. in 2004-05 and30 per cent. in 2005-06.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_467"><a name="70124w0008.htm_para7"><a name="07012473000960">No single action can stop illegal logging. Combating it requires the simultaneous implementation of many policies and measures in and between those countries that produce timber and those that import it. In 2002, the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Indonesia that commits both governments to work together to tackle illegal logging and the associated trade in timber between the two countries. Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) legislation was adopted under the UK Presidency of the European Union (EU) in December 2005. This will allow the EU to enter into agreements with developing countries that export timber.</p>

This is because of the risk of such projects simply resulting in displacement of deforestation, to no net environmental gain. Proposals recently put forward by Brazil, Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Costa Rica, supported by the Coalition of Rainforest Nations, measure reductions in emissions relative to a national baseline, rather than a project-specific one. This greatly reduces the risk of displacement. The UK welcomes both proposals, and is actively working with the EU and international negotiating partners to secure a successful outcome on reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries at the UN climate negotiations in Bali, in December 2007.</p>

The Further Education and Training Bill [HL] retains the requirement for regulations, which prescribe both the type of information to be included in the proposal and the manner in which it must be published. This ensures those who have an interest in the proposal are informed and have an opportunity to make representations.</p>

The presence of a disc on a vehicle&#146;s windscreen would not prove that the person driving it at any particular time was properly insured to do so. Improved use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition technology linked to the Motor Insurance Database, the power to seize a vehicle being driven by someone without insurance and the introduction under the Road Safety Act 2006 of continuous enforcement from the record are likely to be more effective in dealing with uninsured driving.</p>

The equivalent gross contribution forecast, after taking account of the United Kingdom abatement, in these two financial years is &#163;7.9 billion and &#163;9.8 billion respectively. Based on Eurostat population figures for the United Kingdom in 2005 (60,034.5 thousand) the net and gross contribution, post abatement, per head in each of these two financial years would be &#163;47 net, &#163;132 gross (2006-07) and&#163;75 net, &#163;163 gross (2007-08). HM Treasury does not, as a matter of course, forecast the gross and net contributions of all the other member states as this is a matter for their respective Governments. Figures for the 2007 gross contribution of each member state will be included in the 2007 EC adopted budget which will be published in the European Commission&#146;s <i> Official Journal</i>, L (Legislation) series, in due course.</p>

1. Number of children lifted out of poverty is defined here as the number of children in households lifted above 60 per cent. of equivalised median household income before housing costs by increasing the level of the disregard.<br>
2. Estimates provided are indicative and should only be used to give some idea of scale, since there is uncertainty over future distributions of earnings and maintenance receipts, and figures are sensitive to the assumptions used and drawn from a sample of data.<br>
3. Figures for the number of children lifted out of poverty by a&#163;20 disregard are not available due to a small sample size.<br>
4. Poverty figures are based on analysis of 2004-05 Family Resources Survey and are rounded to the nearest 10,000.<br>
5. Costs are calculated to the nearest &#163;10 million and are based upon a combination of DWP administrative and survey data.<br>

Therefore the use of latest tax year information can only begin after primary legislation has altered the basis for calculating income and this has been followed by secondary legislation setting out detailed rules.

1. Numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand.<br>
2. The table includes deduction from earnings orders (DEOs) and deduction from earnings request (DERs). DERs are the equivalent method of collection when the non-resident parent is a member of the armed forces.<br>
3. November 1995 is the earliest month for which data is available and September 2006 is the most recent. Data on the old scheme prior to March 2003 are only available quarterly for irregular quarters (February, May, August, and November). As such, figures are shown at yearly intervals from November 1995 onwards except for September 2006.<br>
4. Robust information covering the period March 2003 to February 2004 is not currently available, so no figure is available for November 2003.<br>
5. The table includes those old scheme cases with a full maintenance assessment, and those new scheme cases with either a full maintenance calculation, or a default maintenance decision. Old scheme cases with a punitive interim maintenance assessment (an imposed assessment due to the non co-operation of the non-resident parent), a small number of which would have deductions from earnings orders in place, are excluded from this analysis in line with the Agency&#146;s target definitions, as are new scheme cases being processed clerically.<br>

<p><a name="stpa_608"><a name="70124w0024.htm_para0"><a name="070124120000416">We gave a guarantee that the basic state pension would increase by 2.5 per cent. or the retail prices index, whichever is higher, during the life of this Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_609"><a name="70124w0024.htm_para1"><a name="070124120000417">Between 1997-98 and 2006-07 pensioners have benefited from above-inflation increases in the basic state pension, with pensioners better off by 9 per cent. in real terms than if the basic state pension had been increased only by prices over the same period. Under reform the basic state pension will be uprated in line with average earnings. Our objective, subject to affordability and the fiscal position, is to do this in 2012 but in any event at the latest by the end of the next Parliament. We have said that we will make a statement on the precise date at the beginning of the next Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_610"><a name="70124w0024.htm_para2"><a name="070124120000418">Different groups and individuals will face different inflation rates because of their different spending patterns. There is, however, little evidence to suggest the rates of inflation pensioners face are substantially different from, or higher than, the rates of the population as a whole over the long term. If anything, published ONS statistics show that over the last 18 years all pensioners have&#151;on average&#151;faced slightly lower inflation than working age people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_611"><a name="70124w0024.htm_para3"><a name="070124120000419">Fuel prices have risen since 2003, but this follows a period of no change between 1997 and 2003. Across this period pensioners have seen improvements in their incomes; between 1996-97 and 2004-05 pensioners' net incomes increased by 25 per cent. in real terms, compared with a 15 per cent. real terms increase in utility bills between 1996-97 and 2006. It is important to note that whilst pensioner incomes tend to increase on a linear basis, utility prices tend to fluctuate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_612"><a name="70124w0024.htm_para4"><a name="070124120000420">At the time the earnings link is restored, the proportion the basic state pension represents in terms of earnings will remain constant and it will continue to hold its value over time, relative to earnings.</p>

1. Main operation<br>
The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but the figures for &#147;all operations count of episodes&#148; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>
The OPCS-4.2 codes for liver transplant are as follows:<br>

2. Time waited (days)<br>
Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>
 3. Ungrossed data<br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

prior approval for masts under 15 m simply means the local planning authority has only eight weeks in which to decide the application. In addition, when the Government published the revised planning policy guidance 8, we strengthened public consultation requirements for prior approval so that they are exactly the same as applications for planning permission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_650"><a name="70124w0029.htm_para2"><a name="070124120001107">Network operators estimate that only around a third of installations are under their permitted development rights. These installations are, by definition, the smallest and most discreet of developments. The current arrangements also encourage network operators to install smaller apparatus on existing buildings and structures wherever possible, which minimises the environmental impact of such developments. Furthermore, simply because these small developments do not need planning permission does not mean that there is no public consultation. The Code of Best Practice that was produced jointly by central and local government and the mobile phone industry is clear that operators will assess every potential site and rate it using the &#147;Traffic Light Model&#148;. The Traffic Light Model allows a site to be rated according to its likely sensitivity in terms of environmental, planning and community considerations. This model determines the level of public consultation that will be required if the site is selected for the installation.</p>

These are called roll-out plans. Roll-out plans are the principal means for the operators to inform local planning authorities of their network development plans for the forthcoming year. It is good practice for local planning authorities to have discussions with respective operators. These discussions can ensure that local issues are addressed at an early stage and make sure that the most appropriate solutions are found for individual developments. I wrote to all MPs at the end of last year to bring their attention to the latest round of roll-out plans and to encourage them to find out whether their local planning authority has had discussions with operators following receipt of these plans.</p>
