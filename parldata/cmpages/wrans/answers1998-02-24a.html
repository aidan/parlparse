<P>
<a name="80224w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Ann Taylor: </B> 
 The UK Anti-Drugs Coordinator, his Deputy and their personal assistant are based alongside the Central Drugs Coordination Unit in the Privy Council Office. The total budget for the CDCU in 1998-99 will be &#163;553,000. This includes &#163;102,471 for the UK Anti-Drugs Coordinator's salary, &#163;45,000 for his Deputy's salary, and their pension contributions (16 per cent. of salaries). The remainder of the budget covers the salaries of their personal assistant (&#163;17,219) and CDCU officials, accommodation and IT costs and travel and subsistence. It is not possible to specify the proportion of office costs which relate to the Coordinator and his Deputy, or to predict the precise extent of claims for travel and subsistence which may be made.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the private finance that would be available for public sector housing if local housing authorities were to transfer their housing to public corporations.  [30552]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 No such estimate has been made. We shall be looking at the implications of housing corporations as part of our comprehensive review of housing policy.

<a name="80224w02.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what advice his Department has issued to local housing authorities regarding the formation of local housing companies. [30553]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My Department has not issued any guidance specifically on local housing companies (LHCs). Guidance on the formation of LHCs is contained in the Housing Corporation's booklet: <i>Guidance for applicants seeking to become registered social landlords: general applicants.</i> A separate version is available for applicants undertaking a stock transfer. My Department has also assisted the Chartered Institute of Housing in preparing their good practice guide on LHCs.

<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to restrict the speed limit for newly qualified drivers.  [30549]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w02.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We have at present no plans to change the qualifying age for taking a driving test, or to restrict the speed limit for newly qualified drivers. However, we are developing a new long term strategy for road safety to achieve further casualty reductions by the year 2010 and in that context will be considering further measures aimed at reducing the current high level of accidents involving novice drivers.

 Planning permission for all but the most minor overhead lines is granted by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. It is frequently a condition of such a permission that the apparatus is removed if no longer needed. Where such a condition has not been attached and there is an affect on amenity, a local planning authority has powers to serve a notice under section 215 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 requiring removal. Such notices may be enforced by, or appealed against to a Magistrate's Court and do not concern the Secretary of State.

[31023]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w03.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> United Kingdom legislation requires dangerous goods (which include toxic substances) carried by air to be in compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organization's Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air. These Instructions are subject to a biennial review and amendment cycle, and the United Kingdom provides a member for the Panel which carries this out. The Civil Aviation Authority is satisfied that there are adequate and up-to-date safety arrangements in place for all dangerous goods carried by air.
<P>

<a name="80224w03.html_para3"><i>(b)</i> The carriage of dangerous goods by sea is governed by the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code, which like the air regulations applies world wide. Its provisions have proved adequate for the safety of dangerous goods exported and imported to and from the United Kingdom. The Code is revised biennially on the basis of proposals presented at meetings of the International Maritime Organisation in London, and the United Kingdom plays an active role in these proceedings. It is implemented into United Kingdom regulations, the last revision of which came into force on 1 November 1997.

<a name="80224w03.html_para4"><i>(c)</i> Dangerous goods are carried through the Channel Tunnel in accordance with Eurotunnel's arrangements, which were approved in 1994 by the UK/France Intergovernmental Commission, on the advice of the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority. These apply a number of restrictions additional to those already applicable to road and rail carriage which limit both the types and the quantities of dangerous goods that are permitted. These arrangements were reviewed after the fire in the Channel Tunnel on 18 November 1996 and as a result further restrictions were introduced in June 1997, when the suspended HGV shuttle services resumed.

Member for Truro and St. Austell (Mr. Taylor), on strategic environmental assessment, for what reason the Government have decided not to put the proposed Directive to the Council of Ministers.  [30804]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government support the principle of strategic environmental assessment, but we are not convinced that the proposed Directive is the best way to ensure that environmental concerns are integrated into Member States' different strategic decision making processes. A number of other Member States share our concerns over the scope and practicality of the proposal, and those whose Presidencies will follow ours have indicated that they would not continue any negotiations which we might begin. We have a full and well balanced environment programme for the Presidency, and we would rather devote our resources to matters where real progress can be achieved.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The importance of bees in the pollination of crops is taken into consideration in the review of all applications to release genetically modified plants. The risks that crops genetically modified for insect resistance pose to non-target beneficial species such as bees will depend on the crop plant and the genes for insect resistance which are introduced. To affect bees the inserted insect resistance genes must be expressed in the plant's pollen. To date, no applications have been submitted for the release of such plants in the United Kingdom. My Department let a contract to IACR Rothamsted in October 1996 to investigate the effects of insect resistant GM crops on non-target insects. This research is investigating the interactions between insect resistant GM oilseed rape and commonly associated insect species under carefully controlled conditions. The results of this research will be published on completion of the project in 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what monitoring is being undertaken of Local Agenda 21 proposals on sustainability; and what account of these is being taken by his Department in formulating policy.  [30769]<P>

<P>
<a name="80224w05.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Local Government Management Board (LGMB) monitors progress by local authorities in adopting and implementing Local Agenda 21 strategies. In June 1997, the LGMB published "Local Agenda 21 in the UK--the first five years" reviewing progress made by local authorities since the Rio 'Earth Summit' in 1992. This showed that 70 per cent. of local authorities had made a commitment to Local Agenda 21, and that about 55 per cent. were putting strategies in place. At the United Nations General Assembly Special Assembly in June 1997, the Prime Minister called on all UK local authorities to adopt Local Agenda 21 strategies by the year 2000.
<P>

<a name="80224w05.html_para0">On 14 January 1998, the Deputy Prime Minister launched guidance produced jointly by the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions, the Local Government Association (LGA) and the LGMB, "Sustainable Local Communities for the 21st Century", to encourage the remaining local authorities to make such a commitment. The LGMB and LGA will be supporting all local authorities in their Local Agenda 21 work, and providing further guidance and advice. The LGMB will be surveying all local authorities again in April 1998 to ascertain the progress each has made on Local Agenda 21 and to identify areas where further support is required.
<P>

<a name="80224w05.html_para1">On 4 February 1998, the Government launched their consultation paper "Opportunities for Change" on the review of the UK Sustainable Development Strategy. Local authorities, and the local people involved in their Local Agenda 21 processes, will provide a key input to the consultation process.

 Given the lack of progress of European proposals to control aggressive bull bars, we issued a consultation document in October last year which sought views on a range of possible options for tackling bull bars at a national level. This consultation ended on 31 December and we are now carefully considering the responses received and analysing the arguments prior to formulating our proposals.

<P>
<a name="80224w05.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Neither of the devices which are being trialled will detect the presence of Prozac or Benyllin. The purpose of the trials is to assess the robustness and practicability of the devices when used at the roadside--not to test drivers for the presence of drugs.

 I have set a new financial target for the London Dial-a-ride service for achievement for the financial year 1998-99. The new target will be &#163;10.50 per trip at current 1997-98 prices and will replace the previous target set in 1996.
<P>

<a name="80224w05.html_para2">The new target will be to allow the Dial-a-ride companies sufficient flexibility to provide a wider range of trips and ensure that the grant is spent in a way which improves services for users.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State last met Mr. MacGregor on 16 February 1998 and a number of issues, including museum admission charges, were discussed.
<P>

<a name="80224w05.html_para8">I am aware of Mr. MacGregor's views on the desirability of free admission to museums and galleries, and these will be taken into account in our continuing examination of access issues as part of our Departmental Spending Review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w05.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 We estimate very roughly that some &#163;40 million p.a. would be required to secure free access to those national museums and galleries which currently charge for admission, and to preserve free access to those which do not currently charge. This figure includes compensation to charging museums for loss of recovery of VAT and the operating costs of new gallery space provided through major capital developments.

 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate, the cash limit for Class X, Vote 1 will be increased by &#163;19,169,000 from &#163;873,953,000 to &#163;893,122,000. This is to increase provision for assets accepted in lieu of tax; a transfer from the Board of Inland Revenue (Class XVI, Vote 4) towards the refurbishment costs of Somerset House for the housing of the Gilbert Collection; to provide for additional appropriations in aid for the Historic Royal Palaces to offset net increases in gross expenditure; and to provide for an increase in provision to meet the costs of the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales.
<P>

<a name="80224w06.html_para1">The increases will be offset by transfers, savings and charges to the Reserve, and will not therefore add to the planned total of public expenditure.

<P>
(3) if the Government guaranteed that National Lottery fund distributors would have &#163;1.8 billion in total to give out.  [30781]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 In 1994, the good causes were predicted to receive around &#163;9 billion in total over the first licence period until September 2001, that is, &#163;1.8 billion for each of the five good causes. The financial success of the Lottery means that it is now likely to generate at least &#163;10 billion over the life of the licence, allowing the Government to make available &#163;1 billion for the New Opportunities Fund and NESTA while maintaining &#163;1.8 billion for each of the arts, sport, heritage, charities and Millennium good causes. While Lottery funds, by their nature, can never be predicted with absolute certainty, the Government are confident that these forecasts represent a prudent estimate for planning purposes. This position was outlined in the White Paper, <i>The People's Lottery</i>, (CM3709) published in July 1997.
<P>

<a name="80224w06.html_para2">On 1 October 1997, I announced the changes in percentage shares for the existing good causes which, on current forecasts, will generate these totals for each good cause. I also confirmed that the Millennium Commission would receive &#163;2 billion during its funding life, which would be extended as necessary beyond 31 December 2000.
<P>

<a name="80224w06.html_para3">I will continue to issue forecasts of Lottery income to the distributors from time to time to enable them to plan their commitments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The National Lottery Bill contains provisions for altering the percentage shares of the existing good causes, and allocating a percentage to the New Opportunities Fund. If the Bill becomes law, these provisions will take effect as from 14 October 1997. Meanwhile, the proceeds for good causes continue to be allocated between existing distributors' accounts in the National Lottery Distribution Fund as provided by the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 and Orders made under it.
<P>

<a name="80224w06.html_para4">The distributors are maintaining shadow accounts for indicative planning purposes, on the basis of the Government's announced policy, to enable the smooth and straightforward implementation of the Bill if it becomes law. No actual funds will pass from existing distributors to the New Opportunities Fund, unless and until the Lottery Bill receives Royal Assent.
<P>

<a name="80224w06.html_para5">These arrangements were agreed between distributors and the Government in discussions over the summer last year.

<a name="80224w06.html_para6">In accordance with the Civil Procedure Act 1977, the Lord Chancellor has chosen members with a wide range of experience in the civil justice field, including members of the judiciary and the legal professions, civil servants concerned with the administration of the courts, persons with experience in and knowledge of consumer affairs and the lay advice sector, and persons able to represent the interests of particular kinds of litigants. The Council will meet for the first time in March.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will list the average volume of work undertaken by county courts in each year since 1980.  [30184]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The information for 1987 to 1997 is set out below. County courts vary considerably in size but the average figures have been calculated by taking the county court workload as a whole and dividing it by the number of county courts open in that year. Figures prior to 1987 will take a little longer to prepare. I will write to my hon. Friend as soon as they are available.

 We have already looked at the possibility of housing the county court in these two buildings. It is very unlikely that the magistrates' court would have future capacity to accommodate the county court. The Crown Court is located in a building leased from Shropshire

<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 February 1998]:</i> This Government are pressing Taiwan strongly for the early elimination of the current tax discrimination on Scotch whisky and introduction of satisfactory legislation on the definition and labelling. We are fully conscious of the adverse effect which the discriminatory tax treatment and the absence of legal definitions is having on the Scotch whisky industry and on the UK's export earnings. During his visit to Taipei last year, British Overseas Trade Chairman Sir Martin Laing raised this with both the Taiwanese President and the Vice Minister for Finance. My hon. Friend the Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office also raised it during his visit in October. In November 1997 the head of the British Trade and Cultural Office in Taipei wrote, with DTI support, a joint letter with his French counterpart urging Taiwan to take immediate action to equalise taxes on all spirits. Following a disappointing response, UK officials in London and Taipei have emphasised to the Taiwanese our concern about the slow progress on these issues. My hon. Friend the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs and DTI officials will reinforce our expectation of early progress at the UK/Taiwan trade policy consultations in London on 26-27 February. DTI officials have also written to the European Commission, ahead of the next EU-Taiwan market access negotiations over Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organisation in Taipei on 23-26 February, to ensure that in its negotiations the Commission continues to reflect the UK's and other Member States' concerns on these issues.

 International co-operation in scientific research is of vital importance for the health of the domestic science base, and is an important component in our export promotion, inward investment, developmental and diplomatic efforts world-wide. For this reason, scientific co-operation is promoted by a wide range of governmental and non-governmental agencies. The Office of Science and Technology plays a key role in bringing a high-level strategic focus to these activities. In Europe, I am particularly keen to see continued vigorous participation by UK researchers in the EU's Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development. In 1996, 15 per cent. of new partnerships established in the Fourth Framework Programme involved UK teams, more than those of any other country. I am also very pleased that we were able, at the EU Research Council on 12 February, to secure a common position on the structure, content and management of the Fifth Framework Programme. This should provide a good basis for continuing strong UK participation in the future. Beyond Europe, recent DTI initiatives include, for example, the strengthening of science and technology links with the Russian Federation and the negotiation of an agreement with Brazil, the establishment of a joint &#163;600,000 fund to support scientific collaboration with the Republic of Korea, and a &#163;500,000 programme of post-doctoral researcher exchanges with Australia.

 I chaired the meeting of the EU Research Council on 12 February 1998.
<P>

<a name="80224w08.html_para2">After a hard and long negotiation, the UK Presidency was able to secure unanimous agreement on a "common position" on the EC Fifth Framework Programme for Research Technological Development and Demonstration Activities 1998-2002 (FP5). This was particularly welcome as we have identified progress on FP5 as a key priority for our Presidency. We were also able to achieve a political agreement on the Fifth Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for Research and Training Activities (1998-2002).
<P>

<a name="80224w08.html_para3">The achievement of a common position means that we have secured a firm foundation for bringing FP5 into operation on time thus avoiding a gap in funding for European research. FP5 also represents a significant improvement on FP4 in that it is well focused on a limited number of objectives of clear European importance, complementing the work undertaken at national level. FP5 will deliver real results of value to European competitiveness and society, playing an important part in helping to strengthen the technological edge of European

industries and services and in tackling pressing European issues in fields such as health and the environment.
<P>

<a name="80224w08.html_para4">Though it had many very difficult issues to tackle, the Council was able to agree on all areas of FP5 including scientific and technological content, structure and the budget, which was settled at 14 bn ecu (around &#163;10 billion). While my responsibility as President was to reach a compromise all could accept, the outcome very closely reflects the UK's national priorities and objectives.
<P>

<a name="80224w08.html_para5">I also made further announcements on the management of the FP5. In the light of the conclusions of the Council held on 10 November 1997, which committed the Council to consider FP5's management further, I confirmed that the UK presidency would host a Ministerial Colloquium on 28 April in London, to look closely at the management and administration of FP5 and how it can be improved. Its conclusions will provide an important contribution to future work.
<P>

<a name="80224w08.html_para6">Having achieved a common position we can now move onto the next stage in negotiations. We must keep up the pace to achieve agreement on all aspects of FP5, including the more detailed specific programmes to ensure a smooth transition from FP4 to FP5 at the end of the year. I encouraged the Commission to produce drafts of these urgently so that the Research Council on 22 June can reach preliminary conclusions on them.
<P>

<a name="80224w08.html_para7">The Council also received a presentation from the Commission on the rules of participation and dissemination (130j rules) which will again be discussed in more detail at the 22 June Research Council.

We have no plans to use it for any other purpose and it has been designed specifically for ammunitioning. The question of Crown immunity does not, therefore, apply.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action he is taking to increase the take-up of immunisation among people from areas of multiple disadvantage.  [29350]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w10.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Annual immunisation rates are now at their highest ever levels, for example the uptake of three doses of diphtheria, tetanus and polio immunisation by age two in 1996-97 was 96 per cent. This has resulted in the reduction of childhood diseases to very low levels and reflects the hard work of doctors, nurses and other health professionals in dedicated immunisation teams across the country.
<P>

<a name="80224w10.html_para1">Immunisation uptake is influenced by many factors including the attitude of health care professionals, social deprivation, available information, ethnicity, the presence of older siblings, religious beliefs and media reporting. These factors interact in different ways and will vary between areas. We have a range of literature about immunisation for both parents and health professionals to assist in strategies to maintain the high uptake levels already achieved and improve those in lower uptake areas.
<P>

<a name="80224w10.html_para2">The national target for immunisation uptake is 95 per cent. A few health authorities (HAs) have significantly lower immunisation rates, achieving 86-89 per cent. uptake rates for diphtheria, tetanus and polio immunisation. Such HAs are targeted through the Department's performance management function, local action plans developed and progress monitored on a regular basis. The detail of these improvement strategies are necessarily decided at a local level as they will depend on the specific circumstances. Local immunisation co-ordinators work with primary care health professionals to achieve immunisation targets.

 The Department has not directly commissioned research into the linkage between changes in levels of suicide and unemployment among young men. There are a number of relevant papers which discuss the complexity of this issue. These include studies by Colin Pritchard: <i>Is there a link between suicide in young men and unemployment? A Comparison of the UK with other European Community Countries</i> (British Journal of Psychiatry, London, volume 160, June 1992, pages 750-756) and <i>Suicide, Unemployment and Gender in the British Isles and European Economic Community (1974-1985)--A Hidden Epidemic?</i> (Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, Berlin, volume 23, number 2, 1988, pages 85-89).

 We have asked our independent scientific and medical experts on the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) to review the toxicity of vitamin B6. As part of this review the COT considered the Dalton and Dalton study. In addition to information supplied by interested parties the Committee also considered over 100 other scientific papers from both national and international journals.
<P>

<a name="80224w11.html_para0">The COT noted some methodological deficiencies in the Dalton and Dalton study, but in the light of other supporting human and animal data, concluded it would be unwise to ignore evidence from this study that daily doses of vitamin B6 of 50mg and above are potentially harmful.
<P>

<a name="80224w11.html_para1">We have every confidence in the rigour with which the COT reviewed the data on vitamin B6 and the robustness of the recommendations it made.

 Data from the Prescription Pricing Authority show that in the vast majority of health authorities (99), some prescriptions for Aricept have been dispensed.

 The General Medical Council does not make findings of "incompetence" or whether doctors are qualified to carry out surgical procedures. It considers allegations relating to the conduct and performance of doctors. Information about the cases considered by the Council's Professional Conduct Committee and whether or not the doctors were found guilty of serious professional misconduct is published annually. Cases involving treatment are not broken down by specialty. Since the introduction of the professional performance procedures in July 1997, no doctor undertaking cosmetic surgery has been found to be seriously deficient.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much the Government are spending on raising awareness of the risks and symptoms of meningitis among students.  [30490]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w12.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) holds an annual press briefing for journalists to raise public, professional and media awareness of meningitis. The CMO also writes to all doctors each year giving advice on the early diagnosis of suspected cases of meningococcal infection and stressing the need for immediate antibiotic treatment and urgent referral to hospital. The Department contributes to the many articles in newspapers and the medical press, and television and radio programmes that appear during the winter increase in cases.
<P>

<a name="80224w12.html_para5">Last year we also revised the Department's information leaflet entitled "Knowing about meningitis and septicaemia" available to the public from general practitioners' surgeries. As meningococcal infections peak with most cases in children under one year, with a second smaller peak in late teenagers we target extra information in these areas. The Health Education Authority (HEA), funded by the Department, produces a leaflet targeted at students, "Look out for your mate", which is distributed to colleges and universities. The Department provides funding to both the National Meningitis Trust and the Meningitis Research Foundation to support their valuable information work.
<P>

<a name="80224w12.html_para6">It is not possible to identify the amount spent on student awareness of meningitis separately, but it is a key theme of the Department's, the HEA's and the meningitis charities' information campaigns. 1.5 million "Look out for your mate" flyers and 35,000 posters were distributed to 765 colleges in England and Wales. 250,000 copies of the Department's "Knowing about meningitis and septicaemia" leaflet were printed last year.

<a name="80224w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 Substantial progress has been made to meet the Government's election manifesto commitment to make National Health Service trust boards more representative of their local communities.
<P>

<a name="80224w12.html_para7">Working within the parameters for public appointments established by the Commissioner for Public Appointments, Sir Leonard Peach, and following my consultation with him, a number of substantial changes were announced last June to apply to the 1997 round of appointments of chairmen and non-executives to NHS trusts to fill 1005 vacancies out of a total of 2509 places on trust boards:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) The person specification for non-executives and chairmen has been changed to encourage more NHS users and carers. Candidates are expected to live in the area served by the trust.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) Interview panels have been instructed to ensure that all candidates are personally committed to the NHS and can bring a user's perspective to the board.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) Members of Parliament and Local Authorities have been asked to nominate candidates for consideration. These are not for reserved places but to widen the local base from which candidates can be drawn.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) The balance of board membership will move in favour of ordinary users and carers and those with a community voice.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(e) The commitment to the goals set for women and ethnic minorities on NHS boards has been reinforced.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="80224w12.html_para8">Over 1,800 nominations were received from Members of Parliament and Local Authorities. Both these nominated candidates and those responding to public advertisements were considered against the new criteria. All appointments were made on merit under the Nolan rules, candidates having gone through the same selection process, including an interview with a panel including an independent member.
<P>

<a name="80224w12.html_para9">At 23 February, I have made 884 appointments to NHS trusts and a further 121 are currently under consideration. Of those appointed as non-executive directors in this round, 52.3 per cent. are women. Of those appointed as chairs, 35.5 per cent. are women. This is a significant improvement on the position inherited from the previous Government at 1 May.
<P>

<a name="80224w12.html_para10">We have also significantly improved representation of people from ethnic minorities. The previous Government set the target that each NHS trust with 10 per cent. of people from ethnic minorities in their local population should have a board member from an ethnic minority. They failed to achieve this in 19 of the NHS trusts to which appointments had to be made in 1997. I have made appointments of members from ethnic minorities in all but two of these. One was a specialist orthopaedic trust to which I appointed a disabled member. The other is to be merged in the summer of 1998. In total, 9 per cent. of appointments since 1 May have been of people from ethnic minorities, taking the total from 5 per cent. to 7.2 per cent.
<P>

<a name="80224w12.html_para11">Around a third of those appointed were existing board members reappointed for a further term of office after a previous period of satisfactory service.
<P>

<a name="80224w12.html_para12">Of those appointed, 620 have declared no political activity and 264 have declared that they have been politically active within the definition used by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. Twenty-five have been active on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, 29 on behalf of the Conservatives including a former

Cabinet Minister, 206 on behalf of Labour and four Other. Many of these people represent their community as serving councillors; 117 Labour, six Conservative, 16 Liberal Democrats and 3 Other.
<P>

<a name="80224w12.html_para13">The Government are committed to an open and transparent process for NHS appointments. The appointments process which we inherited from the previous Government was not consistent and varied from place to place. This is most unsatisfactory. In consultation with the Regional Chairmen I have produced guidelines which are to be followed in every part of the country. The guidelines also stipulate that there should be a standard procedure for assessing the performance of individual non-Executive directors and chairmen. These guidelines have been cleared with the Commissioner for Public Appointments and we will be placing copies in the Library.
<P>

<a name="80224w12.html_para14">These procedures will be used to identify candidates for the 302 vacancies for the boards of health authorities which will fall due in March. We are committed to ensuring that health authorities, like NHS trusts, have board members who represent the interests of local NHS users and carers. Public advertisements have already been placed and we have asked Members of Parliament and Chief Executives of local authorities to make nominations. Around 3,000 completed applications have already been received. To enable proper consideration to be given to all these candidates, especially as in future health authorities will be required to discharge additional duties, and to enable proper notice to be given to all appointees, I intend to ask the 302 incumbents to serve for an additional three months until 30 June 1998.
<P>

<a name="80224w12.html_para15">Full details of appointments to NHS bodies will be published in the Department of Health's Public Appointments Annual Report in March.

Advice that driving ability may be impaired is included where necessary. However, retrieval of the number or percentage of marketing authorisations carrying this advice from our records would incur a disproportionate cost.

A draft Order is being laid before the House today which continues in force most provisions of the Act for a further 12 months. In accordance with the announcement I made on 30 October 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1027-37, I have decided not to renew the exclusion order powers under Part II of the Act. This recognises the limited use which has been made of the powers in recent years. 248 orders were in force in 1982, falling to 74 in 1994. No exclusion order has been in force in Northern Ireland since February 1995. No order was made in 1996 or 1997 against anyone who had not been previously excluded despite the fact that the ceasefire had ended. By May 1997, 22 orders were in force. No orders are in force now. It has long been our view that the powers are of limited value and objectionable on policy grounds.

<a name="80224w13.html_para2">There is nothing in Mr. Rowe's report which leads me to change that view, nor has it been the practice of this or previous administrations automatically to follow the recommendations of reviewers.

 The available information given in the table shows the number of persons aged 10-13 and 14-17 either cautioned or proceeded against and convicted by type of court for certain sexual offences, where the victims were known to be aged under 16 years. It is not possible to identify, from the information held centrally, all sexual offences where the victim is aged under 16 years.

<a name="80224w14.html_wqn2"><B> Helen Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 30 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>398</i>, what estimate he has made of the number of police surgeons who are refusing to carry out intimate body searches <i>(a)</i> in Cheshire and <i>(b)</i> nationally.  [29275]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 February 1998]:</i> I am informed that in Cheshire none of the 17 retained police surgeons will carry out an intimate body search without the consent of the suspect. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) Drugs Sub-Committee has recently conducted a national survey of police forces to assess how widespread this situation is. I do not have statistics but I am told that a significant number of forces replied stating that they are experiencing problems of this nature. I am inviting the ACPO Drugs Sub-Committee and the British Medical Association, which has issued guidelines on the subject, to meet Home Office representatives in an attempt to find a solution.
<P>

<a name="80224w14.html_para0">I am glad to say that not all police surgeons take the same view. The latest statistics available show that, of a total of 132 intimate searches carried out in 1996, 128 were carried out by, or in the presence of, a registered medical practitioner or a registered nurse.
<P>

<a name="80224w14.html_para1">When a police surgeon declines to conduct an intimate search, the options are to use any registered medical practitioner or a registered nurse.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w15.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. John Cunningham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 February 1998]:</i> The outturn removal costs for Ministers' offices and those of officials from Whitehall Place to the Department's accommodation at Nobel House, Smith Square, was &#163;38,000.
<P>

<a name="80224w15.html_para0">Additionally alterations to Nobel House to prepare it for Ministers and senior officials cost &#163;240,000, and &#163;54,000 was spent on furniture and carpets for Ministerial offices. The move was completed on 24 November 1997.
<P>

<a name="80224w15.html_para1">Associated with this move, some staff from Nobel House were relocated to temporary accommodation at St. Christopher House, Southwark to create space for those moving from Whitehall Place. &#163;253,000 was spent in preparing two floors at St. Christopher House for the Department's occupation. The building was already on the Government estate so there are no additional rental costs to the Exchequer. However, the Department will pay an occupancy charge (rent, rates and service costs) of &#163;367,000 for the year to the Property Advisers to the Civil Estate, an executive agency of the Office of Public Service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w15.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. John Cunningham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 February 1998]:</i> Display of beef on the bone on a butcher's counter is not prohibited under the Beef Bones Regulations 1997. However, unless accompanied by an indication that it would be deboned before being sold, display could be construed as evidence that it was intended for sale. The sale of bone-in beef to the ultimate consumer is an offence under Regulation 3 of the Beef Bones Regulations 1997.

 No, the applications have not been stopped. However, no decision about whether to place these varieties on the National List will be taken until the appropriate marketing consents have been issued by the French authorities in accordance with Council Directive 90/220/EEC on the release of genetically modified organisms to the environment. In December 1996, Member States voted in favour of this genetically modified oilseed rape being placed on the market and the decision was published in the Official Journal. However, the French Competent Authority, who have responsibility for giving these consents to Plant Genetic Systems, have not yet implemented the decision.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Charges for Inspections and Controls Regulations 1997 implement in GB the provisions of Directive 96/43/EC. This Directive requires member states to recover the actual costs of surveillance arising from the requirements of Directive 96/23/EC from the industry affected and lays down minimum charges in respect of redmeat, poultrymeat, farmed fish, game and milk. In the case of poultry, the income raised by setting the charge at the EU minimum will exceed the cost of the surveillance programmes and in this situation the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) is obliged by Directive 96/43/EC to levy the EU minimum charge.
<P>

<a name="80224w16.html_para0">The VMD currently estimates the cost of the surveillance programme in Great Britain to be &#163;0.811 million and the cost to the industry, based on a charge of &#163;1,0461 per tonne of poultrymeat produced, to be &#163;1.3 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w16.html_wqn8"><B> Ms Osborne: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what was the outcome of discussions with the fishing industry on arrangements to implement United Kingdom obligations under MAGP IV, with particular reference to the introduction of effort controls in the pelagic and beam trawl segments; and if he will make a statement.  [31038]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 As I explained to the House on 17 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>227-29</i>, the progress made during negotiations with the European Commission on the UK's detailed plans for implementing MAGP IV, together with the results of the 1997 Decommissioning Scheme, mean that, provided fishing effort in other fleet segments does not increase, immediate further action in 1998 can be limited to the introduction of effort controls in the pelagic and beam trawl segments.
<P>

<a name="80224w16.html_para2">I also explained that the Government's preference was for such controls to be managed by the industry itself and that detailed discussions with the fishermen concerned would be held without delay. As a result of those meetings, it has been possible for the fishing effort available in 1998 to be allocated between the various Producer Organisations (POs) or groups of fishermen concerned. The allocations are, however, provisional and will need to be reviewed as definitive information about activity in 1997 becomes available.
<P>

<a name="80224w16.html_para3">All POs and groups have been invited to manage their uptake of effort to stay within these allocations on whatever basis they and their members consider appropriate within their constitutions. The Government are not seeking to impose any particular formula for this and are not making any allocations of effort to individual vessels. POs and groups will therefore have the flexibility to respond to local circumstances and, within their allocations, to take account of any special factors affecting particular members. I would expect them to do this in a fair and responsible way in accordance with their rules. These arrangements are expected to cover virtually all vessels definitively assigned to both segments this year. There may, however, be a few vessels which remain outside PO or other membership, for which a separate non-sector effort allocation will operate.
<P>

<a name="80224w16.html_para4">Where POs or groups remain within their effort allocations no further action by Government will be needed. But in cases where monitoring shows risks that allocations will be exceeded, POs or groups will be warned and fishing by their members suspended, through the licensing mechanism, if no appropriate response is made.




<P>
<P><I>24 Feb 1998 : Column: 188</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80224w16.html_para5">Guidance on the arrangements for measuring and monitoring fishing effort is being issued to all fishermen concerned and copies will be placed in the Library of the House shortly, together with details of the provisional effort allocations.
<P>

<a name="80224w16.html_para6">In addition to the above, certain limited changes are being introduced for distant water vessels, which were the subject of a separate consultation exercise with those concerned. These are designed to reflect the possibility of effort outside EU waters being varied in line with fishing opportunities, as provided for in Article 8 of Council Decision 97/413/EC. But any such requests need also to be cleared with the European Commission and will be subject to examination on a case by case basis.
<P>

<a name="80224w16.html_para7">All the above changes are without prejudice to the further consultations on the operation of the licensing system, which I announced on 17 December, and to the review of the current moratorium on the issue of distant water licences, which will be taking place shortly.
<P>

<a name="80224w16.html_para8">The Government recognise that the introduction of these effort management measures represents a new development in fisheries policy. We are alive to the concerns of the industry and will be seeking to ensure that the details of implementation are as practically devised as possible. The arrangements will be kept under review and, in particular, we shall want to consider the possible need for changes at the time of the Commission's interim review of MAGP IV in the first quarter of 1999.

To assist the negotiating process we are convening, as the EU Presidency, a group of EU experts on the subject at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on 25-26 February. We are also contributing $100,000 to a UN Trust Fund to assist representatives of the 48 Least Developed Countries to attend the Diplomatic Conference and the remaining meeting of the Preparatory Committee. I have today placed in the Libraries of the House a paper setting out our policy on the Court in greater detail.

 The islands of the British Indian Ocean Territory are British, and have been since 1814 when ceded by France. We do not accept that they were ever an integral part of Mauritius.

 Successive British Governments have given generous financial assistance to help with the resettlement of the Ilois in Mauritius.

 We regularly discuss human rights issues in Bosnia with the Bosnian authorities and others concerned with this aspect of implementation of the Dayton Agreement. The issue figured prominently in discussions during my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary's visit to Bosnia in July 1997 and my own in October. The human rights agenda in Bosnia is moving forward but much remains to be done, especially on refugee return to all parts of Bosnia, a free media and transfer of war crimes indictees to the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague. Respect for human rights is crucial to full implementation of the Dayton Agreement, a fact which was underlined strongly at the Peace Implementation Conference in Bonn (December 1997). Together with our partners and Allies, we are keeping up the pressure on all the parties in Bosnia to meet their obligations in this regard.

 The response to the Teacher Training Agency's (TTA) advertising campaign has been very positive. Between October 1997 and January 1998 the TTA's Teaching Information Line received 25,418 inquiries, a 76 per cent. increase above the same period in the previous year. And in January 1998 there were on average 53,000 hits per week to the TTA's website, compared to around 13,500 hits per week in September 1997. We will not know how many new entrants have entered teacher training until the autumn, which will be the first intake following the publicity campaign and we have no information on the proportion of such entrants who may have expressed an interest in teaching prior to the launch of the campaign.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what <i>(a)</i> number and <i>(b)</i> proportion of pensioners did not claim their state pension at age 60 years for women or age 65 years for men in 1997 because they (i) deferred claiming it or (ii) failed to make their claim.  [24809]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The information requested is not available. People are not required to inform the Department that they wish to defer claiming their pension, although some 6,000 people in 1995/96 did let the Department know that they were doing so. Increments are earned in all cases where someone puts off receiving their pension for at least seven weeks during the five years starting on the day they reach pensionable age.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many of the 433 lone parents who she announced in October had gained employment through the New Deal for Lone Parents are <i>(a)</i> in the same employment as they were then, <i>(b)</i> have changed to other employment or <i>(c)</i> are no longer in employment.

<a name="80224w21.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what powers she has after April 1998 to make supplementary payments of premiums to lone parents presently with maintenance from absent parents where variations or cessations of such maintenance cause the income of the lone parent with care to fall below income support entitlement levels.  [22982]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80224w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 All lone parents making a new claim for Income Support on or after 6 April 1998 will receive the same level of family premium as couples with children. Existing recipients will continue to receive the higher rate. There will be no cash losers.
<P>

<a name="80224w21.html_para4">We are looking closely at all aspects of the Child Support Agency to ensure that it provides a modern, efficient and effective service. The receipt of regular maintenance is a key part of the Government's strategy for helping lone mothers into work and one of our key objectives for the Child Support Agency in the coming year is that it chases up fathers who avoid paying maintenance.

The figures take into account the whole cost of administering appeals including non-staff costs. The rising costs during the first three years are attributable to a large increase in the number of appeals and an increase in salaries. The basis upon which the cost estimates have been provided may not be consistent across the years. The reduction in the figures for 1997-98 is accounted for by increased Information Technology usage, which has reduced the unit cost of appeals, and a forecasted reduction in volumes.<P>

 The Government believe that work is the best form of welfare for people of working age.

Participation in the New Deal, which will be voluntary, will not be restricted to people suffering from any particular disability or long-term illness.

 Sections 13 and 14 of the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997 introduced new offences of dishonest representation and failure to report a change of circumstance. The measures are aimed at people who set out to defraud the benefit system, including those who intentionally collude with claimants to commit Social Security fraud. Third parties, such as social workers and welfare advisers, who act in good faith, have nothing to fear.

<P>
<a name="80224w24.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Harman: </B> 
 One of my priorities as Minister for Women is to establish a new dialogue with women. I presented a framework of principles and goals for a renewed Women's National Commission to their members earlier today.
<P>

<a name="80224w24.html_para4">Our statement on the framework of principles and goals is as follows:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Statement from the Ministers for Women</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. The Government review was launched in September 1997. Its aims are:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to examine the objectives, membership and funding of the WNC in the light of the Government's need to ensure that there is an effective, efficient, independent channel of communication between women's organisations and Government for the 21st century; to assess costs and benefits; and to develop, if appropriate, options for change.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. This statement sets out a framework of principles and goals which have been agreed by the Government team reviewing the WNC for consideration by the WNC at its plenary session on 24 February 1998. Draft specific terms of reference for the WNC, incorporating the principles and goals set out in this paper, will be available in May for discussion at the next available plenary session of the WNC.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. The WNC provides a channel for the views and experience of women's organisations to be conveyed to Government. However, far greater precision and clarity is needed about the role of the WNC and the terms of its relationship with Government. To be an effective and efficient channel for communication between Government and women's organisations, the renewed WNC must be:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>modern and dynamic</i>--geared to meet the needs of women's organisations and Government in the 21st century, both at home and abroad;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>strong and influential</i>--capable of adapting and maximising the opportunities presented by rapidly changing circumstances;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>broadly based and widely known</i>--representing a wider range of organisations and with a high profile among organised women;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>fully accountable for its use of public resources</i>--entering into mutual agreements with Government which specify tasks, objectives and timetables, and reporting on an annual basis, so that performance can be monitored and outcomes evaluated;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>able to speak with a genuinely independent voice</i>--steps will be taken to increase independence by evolving into a non-government organisation and relocating outside Government;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>free to grow and change in directions of its own choosing</i>--functions specified under agreement with Government will be publicly funded; the WNC will be given practical encouragement to generate funds to support other activities;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>given clear and settled funding arrangements</i>--protected against risks commonly faced by similar voluntary and/or umbrella organisations.</FONT></UL>
