 Following representations from some compliance schemes, the Environment Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, my Department is preparing a consultation paper on the mechanism used to calculate the registration fees paid by compliance schemes under the Producer Responsibility Obligation (Packaging Waste) Regulations. The paper is being prepared in consultation with the Agencies and is due to be issued in the next few weeks. The Government are required by law to consult before making any changes to the regime. We will provide all interested parties with an opportunity to comment further on the issues involved.

 Cornwall has its own fire service. Devon has a Combined Fire Authority consisting of representatives from Devon, Plymouth and Torbay. Devon county council's representation on the provisional local government finance settlement for 2000-01 drew attention to the gap between Fire Standard Spending Assessment and the level of spending on the fire service. My officials' reply to the council told them that the Secretary of State would take their comments into consideration before taking his final decisions on the settlement. This he did.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00410w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 We do not believe there is justification for any whaling, other than some subsistence whaling by indigenous people. We would like to see all other forms of whaling ended through a permanent, worldwide ban. We strongly believe that all discussions on whaling should be left to the International Whaling Commission as the primary international body for dealing with the management and conservation of whales, and we firmly support their current moratorium.

<a name="00410w02.html_para0">The Japanese Government are fully aware of these views. Whaling is regularly raised at official and ministerial meetings with them, and the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my hon.

<a name="00410w02.html_spnew7"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The North West Regional Office of the National Health Service Executive is developing three cancer services networks across Merseyside and Cheshire, Lancashire and South Cumbria and Greater Manchester, comprising cancer centres for oncology and their associated cancer units. This is consistent with the approach that has been adopted by the National Cancer Director and is supported by him.
<P>

<a name="00410w02.html_para1">Cancer surgery for common cancers will continue to be carried out in designated local cancer units. Given the complex distribution of surgery for less common and rare cancers within each cancer network, it will not always be appropriate to designate a single hospital within each network for surgery for these cancers. Surgery for the less common and rare cancers in the north-west will be provided in accordance with national guidance, within managed clinical networks which will comprise a cluster of hospitals working with their associated oncology centre. Different hospitals may lead on surgery for specific cancers within this less common and rare group.

Tribunal in relation to each of the individuals named had to be considered with great care by the Wales Office, Department of Health and other Government Departments to ensure that appropriate action was taken in the light of these conclusions. It was also important to establish the legal basis on which the Consultancy Index could be specially extended to include the names of people who had not been referred by their employer. We took immediate and determined action on receipt of the Waterhouse Report to achieve these tasks.

 Information on uptake of the new meningococcal Group C conjugate vaccine in babies and in school children aged 15 to 17 years will not be available till later this year, but anecdotal evidence suggests that between 80 and 95 per cent. of 15 to 17-year-olds have been immunised, with uptake in babies even higher.

 Funding for the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme is included in health authority allocations and is not separately earmarked. The Forrest report, on which the programme is based, assumed that 10 per cent. of screens would be carried out on women who self-refer. In 1998-99, 88,119 women aged 65 and over were screened within the programme, representing 7.2 per cent. of all screens.

<a name="00410w03.html_para0">Women aged 65 and over are offered free three yearly screening on request. Women who have already participated in the programme are informed of this entitlement.

<P>

<P>
<a name="00410w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 In 1998 the Department of Health sponsored the Disabled Living Centres Council to produce 'Community Equipment Services . . . why should we Care?', a guide to good practice in disability equipment services, which was distributed to councils and the NHS. This recommends that there should be effective arrangements to review the suitability of disability equipment after it has been issued. The Department is funding the Council to promote this guidance through conferences and the development of an internet website.
<P>

<a name="00410w03.html_para1">We recognise that review arrangements are often unsatisfactory. Our guidance on Fair Access to Care Services (to be issued for consultation in May) will stress the importance of local authorities reviewing services, including disability equipment to ensure its continued suitability.

 Any young woman, aged under 16, seeking emergency contraception without parental knowledge or consent from one of the pharmacists operating in the pilot must be assessed by the pharmacist in relation to the criteria set out in the Gillick judgment. This covers the young person's understanding, maturity and their best interests including physical and mental health. It is for the pharmacist to use his or her judgment as to whether the criteria are satisfied. If necessary, the pharmacist can seek further advice from a doctor and refer the young person on to specialist contraceptive services.

 Fluoridated water is currently provided by Anglian Water Services Ltd., Northumbrian Water Ltd., North West Water Ltd., Severn Trent Water Ltd. and South Staffordshire Water plc. No water company has acceded to a request from a health authority to fluoridate its water supply since 1985. We understand that the water companies are reluctant to disregard the views of a minority of people opposed to water fluoridation. The National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York is undertaking a review into fluoride and health. If it finds that there are

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00410w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Dentists practising in the general dental services are already required by their terms of service to take reasonable steps to develop professional knowledge and skills to maintain an up-to-date knowledge of dental science and practice. Principal dentists are entitled to claim postgraduate education allowance for up to two sessions of approved postgraduate activity each year to help meet that requirement. The General Dental Council is to introduce a recertification scheme that will make the continued registration of all dentists dependent upon their regular participation in continuing education. In the first instance, the scheme will be voluntary, but the Council has asked the Department if, in due course, it could be made mandatory by amendment to the Dentists Act 1984. We support the principle of the scheme and will be responding on the detail shortly.

It is within the gift of the chairman of the Inquiry to determine whether or not those making representations to the Inquiry are legally represented.

<a name="00410w03.html_para4">It is important that the independent Inquiry offers the relatives of the victims of Harold Shipman, including the relatives of people whose cases may not have been brought to trial, the opportunity to make their views known to the Inquiry. In addition, the Inquiry has now written to the families and friends of all the victims identified by the police, inviting them--within the scope of the Inquiry--to inform the Inquiry of their particular circumstances surrounding the death of their relative or friend.

<a name="00410w05.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 It is a condition of service that Service personnel are provided with publicly funded accommodation at or within an appropriate distance from their place of duty. When family and single accommodation is not available, suitable equivalent property is rented from the commercial rental market. Until 1 February 1997, MOD satisfied this requirement in GB through the payment of an allowance to personnel to enable them to find rented accommodation under private arrangements (Excess Rent Allowance for family accommodation and Lodging Allowance for single accommodation). However, with effect from 1 February 1997, MOD established an Accommodation Agency which utilises an MOD contractor to obtain equivalent rented accommodation for Service personnel. This has since superseded the allowance regimes.

The figures represent the full cost of providing rented accommodation for all ranks since it is not possible to extract the costs for officers alone. Prior to FY 1997-98 costs for Excess Rent Allowance and Lodging Allowance were met by respective budget holders.

 Currently there are two C-130 and one VC10 resupply flights to Saudi Arabia every week; these flights also serve Kuwait in their schedule. If the Antonov An-124 were employed, it could substitute for the two C-130s, but the VC10 would have to be maintained for passengers. As the C-17 can also carry passengers, only one C-17 flight per week would be necessary to meet the total requirement.

 The current six Tristar C2 passenger and one Tristar KC1 freighter flights to the Falkland Islands all refuel at Ascension Island and rely on Rio de Janeiro or Montevideo for their diversions. If the Antonov An-124 or the Boeing C-17 were used in place of the Tristar KC1 freighter, the present refuelling and diversion arrangements would not change.

 The Government anticipate that the vast majority of human rights points will be raised in existing cases, rather than new cases, save for applications for leave to move for Judicial Review which may rise from the 300 received in 1998 to 600 per year. We expect a significant number of human rights points to be raised in the months following implementation but it is anticipated that the level of challenges will reduce subsequently as the higher courts determine the basis on which the Act and Convention are to be applied.
<P>

<a name="00410w06.html_para0">The Government have made annual provision for the overall costs of implementing the Human Rights Act in the courts--&#163;60 million, including &#163;39 million for legal aid. In addition, &#163;4.5 million has been set aside to ensure that all full and part-time judges, lay magistrates and their legal advisers are trained to deal with Convention points effectively, which should reduce the impact on court time.

The budget for 1999-2000 is &#163;839,440. The rise between expenditure in 1998-99 and the budget for 1999-2000 is principally due to the additional costs of the re-design and re-launch of the No. 10 internet site which included the replacement of outdated computer equipment and the creation of two additional established Civil Service posts. Savings have of course been made in other departments as a result of the transfer of work to the SCU and its role in providing consultancy services to departments which are not reflected in these figures.

That is why we have introduced Welfare to Work programmes such as the ONE pilots and New Deals to advise all groups of working age people, including unmarried mothers and divorced women, about the options available to them and to help them into work. And through the introduction of the National Minimum Wage and tax and benefit reforms we are making sure that work pays. These programmes are working, producing results. For example, up to December 1999, 103,000 lone parents had volunteered to participate in the New Deal for Lone Parents and 35,000 had found work.

 Our estimate of the target group of five million people for stakeholder pension schemes is based on the number of people earning between around &#163;10,000 and &#163;20,000 who are not in an occupational pension scheme. Some of those initially in this group will have personal pensions and will therefore be unlikely to take up stakeholder pensions when they are first introduced. But the majority are making no personal contributions to a private pension scheme.
<P>

<a name="00410w07.html_para4">People outside this target group will also benefit from stakeholder pension schemes. We expect that some people on higher earnings will want to join a stakeholder scheme and our decision to relax the rules linking earnings and pension contributions will mean that, for example, carers, women taking breaks from work, students and children will also be able to contribute.
<P>

<a name="00410w07.html_para5">The number of people actually taking out a stakeholder pension scheme will depend on how stakeholder and other pensions are marketed by providers, and on individual choices by savers.

The Debt Accounting and Management System (DAMS) was to provide integrated debt management and accounting capability for the Benefits Agency's programme debt. Housing Benefit is administered by local authorities and therefore was not part of the DAMS development.

 The Northumbria Tourist Board (NTB) will receive &#163;340,687 for tourism projects in the region from the English Tourism Council in 2000-01--an increase of 31 per cent. on the current year. These projects include the development of information and communications technology to improve regional competitiveness and deliver added value for tourism businesses, which will help promote tourism throughout the North-east. The region, in common with all parts of England, also benefits from the promotion work of the British Tourist Authority (BTA), which promotes Britain as a visitor destination in overseas markets. The BTA is receiving &#163;37 million from my Department this year.

 The installation of domestic television aerials is a matter for those responsible for individual properties. I appreciate that many consumers rely on shared aerial systems, over which they have no direct control. My officials are in touch with the ITC, the BBC, and the digital broadcasters to ensure that this does not present a significant obstacle to those consumers having access to digital television. I understand that many homes with shared aerial systems can obtain satisfactory reception of digital television using their existing receiving equipment. Where upgrades are required, I would encourage tenants or landlords to approach the digital broadcasters, the ITC or the BBC who can advise on how to achieve this in the most cost-effective manner.

 The Government strongly support the OECD Convention on Combating the Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. We played a leading role in the negotiations of the Convention and were among the first countries to ratify it. We have played a full part in the peer review process associated with the Convention. The Government are not, however, complacent. The Home Office will publish in May the Government's proposals aimed at modernising the existing legislation, with a view to introducing new legislation as soon as possible thereafter.

 Vehicles will be affected by this Directive only when they become waste as defined under existing legislation--in other words, only when the owners have decided to discard them. For this reason, amendments to the Directive designed to exempt 'historic' vehicles are unnecessary. However, the UK has made it clear that we would have no difficulty with amendments designed to clarify the situation, provided that suitable wording can be found.

 The Gas and Electricity Markets Authority which will be established under the Utilities Bill will have power to do anything calculated to facilitate the performance of its functions under the Electricity and Gas Acts. The Authority's primary focus under the Acts is economic regulation. The Acts will also require the Regulator to take account of guidance on social and environmental matters issued by Government. A draft of such guidance is currently the subject of consultation.
<P>

<a name="00410w10.html_para6">In its Plan and Budget for 2000-01, Ofgem mentioned that it would develop an Environmental Action Plan. This plan will, for example, identify any barriers to fair access for renewable generation and combined heat and power (CHP) to the electricity market as a contribution to meeting government targets for renewable and CHP production.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much of the non-fossil fuel obligation income for renewable energy support remains unspent in terms of <i>(a)</i> income not yet spent or allocated to a non-fossil fuel obligation project and <i>(b)</i> income allocated to a non-fossil fuel obligation project but not yet taken up by the project sponsors; and if he will make a statement in respect of unspent and unallocated non-fossil fuel obligation income to support the development of renewable energy.

<P>
<a name="00410w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Receipts from the Fossil Fuel Levy can be used only for expenditure on the above market cost of electricity generated under contracts entered into as a consequence of non-fossil fuel obligations (NFFO) and the related administrative costs of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) and their agents. The surplus of receipts over expenditure is currently about &#163;70 million. Expenditure on electricity contracted under the third, fourth and fifth non-fossil fuel obligations (NFFO-3, 4 & 5) for renewables is estimated to be &#163;42 million in financial year 1999-2000. This figure is expected to rise to &#163;60-&#163;80 million next year and peak in 2003-04 as more projects commission and generate. Expenditure is likely to continue until November 2018 when the last contract ends. In the event that Fossil Fuel Levy receipts fail to cover NFFO expenditure generators might not be paid. The surplus is maintained at a level intended to guard against rapid and unexpected falls in electricity prices that would reduce levy receipts and increase NFFO expenditure.

 The Government's proposals for new Assisted Areas were published in the booklet, "The Government's Proposals for New Assisted Areas", on 15 July 1999. A copy of the proposals was placed in the Library. The proposals were submitted to the European Commission for approval as required by Community law.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para0">The European Commission have informed us that the proposals published in July cannot be accepted. They have stated that the proposals, as drafted, would give the United Kingdom an unfair advantage against other member states. The Commission have further stated that if revised proposals are not submitted, they will begin a procedure under Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty. Such a procedure could delay agreement on the new Assisted Areas for up to six months.

<a name="00410w11.html_para1">In light of this situation and the damage that would be caused by an extended delay in the approval of the new Assisted Areas, the Government intend to submit revised proposals to meet the Commission's concerns. The amendments to the July proposals are being published today in the booklet "Amendments to the Government's Proposals for New Assisted Areas". A copy of the booklet is being distributed to each Member and a copy will be placed in the Library. There will be a three week consultation period on the amendments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when he intends to publish the Competition Commission report on the supply of new motor cars within the United Kingdom.  [118704]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00410w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I have published the report and my response today. I have announced new proposals to bring more competition to the supply of new cars and so help reduce prices.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para4">The Competition Commission found that prices in the UK have been between 10-12 per cent. higher than in similar countries in Europe. This is despite the fact that two-thirds of the cars sold in the UK are imported. They conclude that private car buyers are paying about 10 per cent. too much--or &#163;1,100--for the average car, after taking account of discounts, trade-ins and finance deals.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para5">The Director General of Fair Trading estimates that the annual cost to private car purchasers could be around &#163;1 billion a year as a result of the present system.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para6">In my view the findings of the Competition Commission report cannot be ignored. They represent a clear and unambiguous call for change which requires a positive response.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para7">For many private buyers, a car is the second most expensive purchase of their lives. This report confirms what many people have thought was the case--that in Britain we are paying over the odds for new cars. The reason for this is that the market is not operating as competitively as it should.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para8">I will be introducing measures to bring about greater competition in the supply and selling of new cars which should mean lower prices and increased sales. These measures should restore consumer confidence and bring certainty to the car market.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para9">The Competition Commission has identified a number of ways in which this market fails to function properly. It recommends substantial changes to the distribution of new cars--particularly in the relationship between manufacturers and dealers.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para10">To make the market more competitive, I am taking the immediate steps recommended by the Competition Commission and the Director General of Fair Trading. As the Consumers' Association said in its evidence to the Competition Commission, steps such as insisting dealers are offered the same bulk discounts as fleet customers should make this market function more fairly and put downward pressure on prices.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para11">These immediate remedies will be imposed by Order under the Fair Trading Act 1973. I have published a notice of this order today. By law interested parties must have 



<P>
<P><I>10 Apr 2000 : Column: 40W</I><P>
an opportunity to comment on these proposals. Representations are invited by 19 May 2000, and I intend to make the Order within two months of today.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para12">Among the measures are:
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para13"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Requiring suppliers to offer dealers who buy cars outright equivalent terms, including volume discounts, to those offered to fleet buyers.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00410w11.html_para14"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Requiring suppliers to provide their dealers with regular statements of terms they are prepared to offer which reflect the terms given to fleet customers.
Dealers who buy a large quantity of new cars outright will therefore be able to benefit from the sort of volume discounts currently enjoyed by fleet customers and pass on the benefits to customers.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00410w11.html_para15"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Prohibiting suppliers from discriminating in their dealings with contract hire companies by giving less attractive discounts if the end-user is not a fleet customer.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00410w11.html_para16">This will allow contract hire companies to offer a better deal to their private customers and encourage more competitive pricing to private customers generally.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para17"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Prohibiting suppliers from imposing contract terms on dealers that prevent or inhibit dealers from advertising prices at which they are willing to sell.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00410w11.html_para18"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Prohibiting suppliers from refusing to supply on the grounds of the price at which a dealer advertises it is willing to sell.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00410w11.html_para19">The current practices can mislead consumers about prices. These measures will ensure that dealers are free to advertise the price at which they are prepared to sell, without fear of penalty from suppliers. The Secretary of State has also not ruled out a ban on recommended retail prices if these two specific remedies need to be reinforced.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para20"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Suppliers will be prohibited from imposing conditions or targets on dealers in respect of the number of cars a dealer registers during a certain period, or giving a dealer an advantage which is dependent on the number of cars the dealer registers during a certain period.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00410w11.html_para21"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Requiring suppliers to publish information on a regular basis concerning the number of cars they have pre-registered.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00410w11.html_para22">These should increase transparency and price competition by encouraging suppliers and dealers to set a market clearing price for new cars.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para23">The Competition Commission also makes a number of recommendations for more fundamental change which relate to practices permitted by the European Union's Car Block Exemption rules. I believe these are important changes for the longer term in altering the structure of the market. We are discussing these issues with the European Commission now that the report is published.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para24">Although the Block Exemption formally runs until September 2002, our discussions with the European Commission could bring about changes in the UK before then.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para25">However, owing to the complicated legal and other factors that surround this issue, a point recognised by the Competition Commission, I expect it to take at least a year to resolve.
<P>

<a name="00410w11.html_para26">I will also be pressing the European Commission to enforce the existing Block Exemption rules vigorously to ensure that dealers are free to import new cars from dealers in the manufacturer's franchised network in other EC member states, and that they will not be disadvantaged if they do so and that private buyers are not obstructed if they wish to buy abroad for import into the UK.

The report considers the significance of gender differences and looks at ways of involving young people more as policies are developed. It sets out the Government's response to the key concerns raised by young people, giving an outline of those areas where gender specific policies could make a difference.

 We are keen to encourage all debates on the issues of grammar schools to be conducted fairly.

We commend its principles to all those involved in the debate. A breach of the principles of the Code may lead the Secretary to State to declare a ballot void if, in his opinion, it is likely to have had a significant effect on voting.

 Access-to-work is one of a number of programmes and services, provided through the Employment Service, to help disabled people get, or stay in, a job. As such, Access-to-work does not have a separate budget for publicity. During the first 10 months of the last financial year the Employment Service spent &#163;314,000 marketing and promoting the full range of their services for disabled people and their employers. The following table shows how much was spent by the Employment Service, over the previous two financial years:

 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2000]:</i> The additional funding will be part of secondary schools' delegated budgets, so they will be free to decide what to spend it on.

<a name="00410w13.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The provisional allocation of the extra budget funding for schools in Shropshire is &#163;1.693 million. This is based on January 1999 number pupil data, and will be updated when January 2000 pupil number data become available. The funding to be paid to each school will be based on January 2000 pupil numbers. It is not therefore possible at the moment to list individual school allocations, but I will place in the Library a complete list by constituency when the data enabling me to do so become available.

The principal reason for the greater historic funding per head for secondary schools is their lower pupil teacher ratios. The table demonstrates that a greater percentage of the additional funding

<P>

<a name="00410w15.html_para5">The Ministry is already supporting the specialist cheese sector through its sponsorship of Food For Britain (FFB) which has day-to-day responsibility for the speciality food industry; its promotion of the EU scheme for protecting food names; and its secondment of an official to the Specialist Cheesemakers Association (SCA), for 12 months, to assist on legislative, regulatory and promotional issues.

 Proposals to reduce the impact of the climate change levy on horticulture were announced in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Budget statement on 21 March. This pre-dated the publication of the Action Plan for Agriculture. The measures announced in the Budget include a discount of fifty per cent. on the levy for a period of up to five years (subject to state aid rules) the allocation of a special package of support from the &#163;50 million energy efficiency fund set up under the levy and the extension of the list of energy investments which qualify for enhanced capital allowances to include thermal screens used in glasshouses.
<P>

<a name="00410w15.html_para6">Some horticultural companies should also be able to take advantage of the measure, announced in the Chancellor's pre-Budget statement last November, to exempt from the levy electricity generated from 'new' forms of renewable energy and in 'good quality' combined heat and power plants.

 MAFF does not offer any assistance to small growers and farmers for their payroll system. However the Department of Trade and Industry conducted a consultation exercise in 1999 on the possible development of a payroll service for small business. As a result it was agreed that the Inland Revenue's New Enterprise Support Initiative (NESI) would be extended to provide on-going, one to one support for payroll assistance. As from 1 April 2000, the expanded NESI includes, free of charge, the following:

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State discussed EU Structural Funds issues with Commissioner Neil Kinnock, Vice-President of the European Commission, on 25 November 1999.

 Under the Criminal Appeals Rules 1968, the arrangements for the retention of exhibits in criminal proceedings pending appeal, are matters for the court to determine. The rules provide that exhibits must be retained for 35 days from the date of conviction or, if an appeal is lodged, until the determination of the appeal. The exhibits may be retained in the custody of the court, the person who produced the exhibit at the trial (prosecution or defence) or any other person and such arrangements can include provision for the inspection of the exhibit by any interested party.
