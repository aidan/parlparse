<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. Figures relate to actual spend per year and not to offers made.<br>
2. Grant expenditure has remained around the &#163;30 million mark because English Heritage's Grant-in-Aid allocation, the money it receives from Government to carry out its work, has not kept pace with inflation.<br>
3. Inflation has also had a negative effect on the buying power of English Heritage's grants. The construction industry has its own calculator of inflation; using this, English Heritage's grants over the last seven years have lost out by a cumulative &#163;64 million in buying power.<br>
4. English Heritage disburses its grants through seven main grant schemes: Historic Buildings, Monuments and Designed Landscape scheme, Partnership schemes in Conservation Areas, Cathedral repairs, Repair Grants for Places of Worship in England scheme, Historic Environment Enabling programme, Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund and others including War Memorial grants, Capacity Building programmes for the voluntary sector and various grants for local authorities.<br>

1. UK Film Council was only incorporated in July 1999. In 1999-2000, operations were limited, with only a small number of lottery awards being made. The organization became fully operational as a grant-in-aid and lottery distributor on 1 April 2000.<br>
2. For lottery awards, figures are shown according to the date when the grant was decided/awarded, and not necessarily the date at which funding was paid out. This is consistent with UK Film Council reporting arrangements, and with information published in its annual reports.<br>
3. All amounts are rounded to the nearest &#163;1,000.<br>
4. All figures 1999-2007 are extracted from UK FC audited annual report and accounts. Those for 2007-08 are draft, awaiting audit sign off in July 2008.<br>
5. Fluctuations in levels of lottery awards are due to several factors including the launching of funding streams, and in some cases awards covering a period in excess of one year (e.g. in 2003-04, a three-year delegation of &#163;6,500,000 per annum to Skillset was made&#151;resulting in a soft commitment being recorded of &#163;18,500,000 in that year). Core grant-in-aid activities have remained reasonably constant across the period with the main fluctuations relating to one-off additional funding received and allocated, e.g. the re-development of the bfi Southbank.<br>

 While it is the intention of my Department to review the legislation on the selling of pet animals, I cannot offer a date when such a review will take place. The urgency to review the legislation was removed in 2006 when the High Court made a judgment on a Judicial Review about the issuing of a licence, under the Pet Animals Act 1951, to the organisers of a pet fair. One of the findings from the Judicial Review was that local authorities could not issue licences under the 1951 Act to organisers of pet fairs, where these events involved the sale of animals, as part of a business, to members of the public.</p>

 The original target for staffing numbers for the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) was 1,946. This figure was based on the assumption that the new IT solution would deliver significant headcount efficiencies, which did not prove to be the case.</p>

 The process of identifying areas for designation as Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs), as proposed in Part 4 of the draft Marine Bill, will be based, as far as possible, on consensus between stakeholders. With this in mind, Natural England and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee are establishing a series of regional stakeholder-led partnership projects. These projects will be advised on appropriate site selection principles, including relevant scientific and national policy considerations, by the statutory conservation agencies and a number of national steering groups. The regional projects will make choices and then submit recommendations to the Secretary of State, by Easter 2011.</p>

 Within six nautical miles of baseline, the draft Marine Bill proposes that Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities will be required to further the conservation objectives set for marine conservation zones (MCZs). This will be achieved through the use of mechanisms such as the introduction of byelaws. In areas of shared fisheries, beyond six nautical miles, we would seek to secure the protection of MCZs from damaging fishing activities through the common fisheries policy.</p>

In June 2007 the Commission sent a warning letter to Cypriot authorities, regarding a two-day exemption which permitted the hunting of turtle doves in spring, and warned that any future exemptions from the directive could lead to legal action being taken. The Cypriot authorities agreed not to renew this exemption. The Commission has also taken action to prevent spring hunting of certain birds in Malta, which it believes is contrary to the provisions of the Birds Directive. This action resulted in a ruling from the European Court of Justice preventing Malta from authorising the hunting of quails and turtle doves outside the period of hunting for these species permitted under the Birds Directive.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 June 2008]:</i> General practitioner (GP) practices are extending their opening hours by entering into enhanced service agreements with their primary care trusts (PCTs) as part of their contractual arrangements. An overriding principle in entering into such agreements is that practices should maintain standards of access and availability during contracted core hours. GP practices remain contractually required to provide essential, and where appropriate, additional primary medical services that are appropriate to meet the reasonable needs of their patients within core hours. Where they do not meet those requirements, they may be judged by their PCT to be in breach of their contract.</p>

1. DWP&#146;s customers interact with the Department through its agencies/businesses and any consolatory payments are made at the agency/business level, rather than centrally.<br>
2. DCS only retain readily available information for the previous two years on their special payments database. Information prior to this period is deleted on an ongoing basis. The SPEC forms (the individual special payment decision and authorisation forms) for individual cases are retained for a longer period but are kept at a remote storage centre.

3. DCS do retain overall category statistics for each month but not the individual case breakdown that is being asked for.<br>
4. The Pension Service figures are only available from 1 November 2003 when the new system was installed. We do not have access to any earlier information.<br>
5. Debt Management is not an executive agency of DWP. A consolatory payment awarded because of error by Debt Management is paid by Jobcentre Plus.<br>
6. The Rent Service (TRS) was formed in October 1999 as an executive agency of the Department of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. TRS became an executive agency of the Department for Work and Pensions in June 2001. The Rent Service has not made any consolatory payments in the period concerned.<br>

 It is an indictment of the regime that they chose to go ahead with their flawed constitutional referendum at a time when hundreds of thousands of Burma's citizens were suffering without food, clean water or shelter in the Irrawaddy Delta. The political situation in Burma precludes a free and fair vote. Fundamental rights and freedoms are completely absent and the democratic opposition is persecuted &#151; its leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi, are locked up and its supporters live in fear of detention and violence. The referendum itself was conducted in an atmosphere of intimidation, where criticism of the process was punishable by long prison sentences. We also have serious doubts about the secrecy of voting. The results, a turnout of 98 per cent. (including those areas hit by the cyclone) and a &#145;yes&#146; vote of over 92 per cent, lack all credibility.</p>

 HMRC have a clearly defined process for monitoring the payment of identified arrears to workers. National minimum wage compliance officers send letters to any workers for whom they identify arrears, advising them of the amount due to them and asking them to contact the officer by a due date if the employer does not make payment. An officer will also ask the employer to provide evidence of payment of arrears to workers. Where it is evident that an employer has not made payment to all workers to whom arrears are due, the officer will pursue this with the employer. HMRC remain committed to ensuring that workers receive what they are due and the proposals in the Employment Bill will improve and strengthen the enforcement regime of the minimum wage.</p>

 Switching into the points-based system (PBS) in the UK will be possible only from employment or student categories. The Working Holidaymaker (WHM) Scheme is neither. This general approach was first outlined in the March 2006 Command Paper &#147;A Points Based System: Making Migration Work for Britain&#148;, and the December 2007 publication &#147;Highly Skilled Migrants under the Points Based System - Statement of Intent&#148; specifically explained that those with WHM leave will not be able to switch into any highly skilled sub-category. Copies of both documents are available in the House Library. If a WHM wishes to apply for PBS tier 1 (general) they are expected to go home to make their application. Once PBS tier 2 is launched, the same process will apply. Currently WHMs can switch to work permit leave if the job they are doing falls into a shortage occupation and they have been in the UK for 12 months; or to the innovator category.</p>

The total number of people interviewed in these offices to end of March 2008 was 87,765 (including people who were involved in the live trial). In the financial year 2008-09, IPS expects to conduct a further 404,000 interviews, an average of 33,700 per month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_599"><a name="80611w0025.htm_para6"><a name="0806122000676">The monthly cost of operating the interview office network, including office rental, security, IT systems, administrative overheads and staff is estimated at &#163;2.50 million.

Once the interview network is complete and operating at full capacity, I would be in a position to provide detail on number of customers interviewed and cost per interview for each office. These will vary considerably from office to office reflecting both size and location. These costs are spread across all passport customers rather than being recovered solely from first time adult applicants, and there is no plan to charge higher fees to customers of smaller offices where the unit cost is higher. The aforementioned unit cost spread across all passport applicants amounts to about &#163;12.50 per person and this is a component of the current overall adult passport fee of &#163;72.</p>

This year, the reviews process will operate in a similar fashion to previous years.</p>

There is no specific fund to support mergers. However, the LSC may decide to support the development of proposals in a number of ways, for example, by paying for a strategic options study to look at how provision might best be configured in an area. We are currently reviewing the organisational structure framework within which mergers and other organisational models are considered. This will include a stronger focus on the need to protect and enhance learner choice in an area, value for money and a robust process for appraising all proposals. We are keen to ensure that all options have been considered before mergers, as there is no evidence to suggest that larger colleges provide a better quality experience for the learner.</p>

 The Secretary of State has commissioned the National Foundation for Educational Research to supply data on the performance of fifteen-year-olds in schools in England for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's programme for international student assessment (PISA 2006).</p>

It assesses students' knowledge on a three-year cycle, with each cycle focusing mainly on one of three areas: reading literacy, mathematical literacy and scientific literacy.
