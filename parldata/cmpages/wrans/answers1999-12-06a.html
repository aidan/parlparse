 The number of research contracts let since May 1997 is very large, running into hundreds. Recording them and listing the value of each would involve disproportionate cost. The Department for International Development's (DFID) net expenditure on research was estimated at &#163;112 million in 1997-98 and &#163;116 million in 1998-99.

 Ministers and MOD civilians are paid the same Motor Mileage Rates if they use their private vehicles for official duty. Reimbursement for motor mileage for official travel in private vehicles is paid at different levels. The higher (Standard) rate is restricted to journeys that would be impracticable by public transport, taking into account the overall cost to the Department. It reflects the full cost of travel by car. The lower (Public Transport) rate is set at a level which reflects the average cost of travel by public transport and is paid for all other official travel by car.

 The number of research projects placed since May 1997 is 1,317. The total value of these projects is approximately &#163;254 million. Detailed information is being placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Written agreements, contracts or memoranda of understanding cover all projects. The Department's policy is to encourage its contractors to make the results of research available to the public, to industry, and the wider research community, including through peer-reviewed scientific papers and a range of other routes. The Ministry's approach is that information should be released, save where disclosure would not be in the public interest. We publish details of MAFF-sponsored R & D projects on our website (www.maff.gov.uk) and copies of scientific reports are normally available on request. Overall policy on the release of Government information is set out in the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. There is no requirement that contractors incorporate departmental amendments to their research results though final reports are sometimes discussed with contractors as necessary.

<a name="91206w05.html_para2">It must be noted that expressing cases by month of confirmation does not reflect the occurrence of disease at that particular time. The interval between slaughter of the suspect and confirmation of the disease may be six to eight weeks for routine cases, but could be considerably longer in cases where additional tests or further on-farm investigations are requested.
<P>

<a name="91206w05.html_para3">The high number of confirmed cases in the first five months of 1999 is a consequence of accelerated diagnosis in order to provide material for an EU research project. Many of these would have been confirmed in April or May under normal procedures.

<P>
<a name="91206w05.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The European Commission has recently put forward proposals for an EU scheme for compulsory origin labelling of beef. These are under discussion with European partners. In principle, compulsory labelling of beef will benefit consumers but will have a cost implication for the supply chain. The Government will consider the UK position on the proposals in the light of negotiations, but in principle we see advantages in labelling.

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 1999]:</i> It is for the French authorities to check the welfare standards under which turkeys are reared in France against any relevant standards set by French law. The welfare of turkeys and all animals during transport is protected by the requirements of Council Directive 91/628/EEC as amended by Council Directive 95/29/EEC. This Directive is implemented in Great Britain by the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 and enforced by local authorities.

<a name="91206w06.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 December 1999]:</i> None, as direct payments and similar supports to producers are not part of the CAP pigmeat regime. However, we have pressed the European Commission to reopen the aids to private storage of pigmeat scheme and to reinstate special refunds on exports of fresh and frozen pig carcases and cuts to Russia. Officials in the Department have also discussed with the European Commission the costs faced by British pig producers because of BSE and the possibility of introducing a pig offal disposal scheme.

 There are three authorised antimicrobial growth promoters still available for use in poultry production, with similar effects on the gut flora of poultry to that of bacitracin.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No such studies have been initiated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Government's Tourism Strategy "Tomorrow's Tourism", launched earlier this year, recognises tourism's role in maintaining the viability of farm businesses. The European Council Rural Development Regulation (1257/1999), which applies from 2000, enables member states to support projects to encourage tourist and craft activities, among other things. A decision on the implementation of the Regulation will be made shortly. Schemes to provide advice and support for those farmers contemplating farm-based tourism have been supported through Objective 5b Schemes. These close at the end of the year.

 The European Employment Pact agreed at the Cologne European Council on 3-4 June 1999 brought together three processes. Two of these were the existing Luxembourg employment process and the Cardiff economic reform process. The third, new element was the macro-economic dialogue, termed the "Cologne process". The dialogue takes place biannually among social partners and fiscal and employment policy makers from existing institutions and considers the interaction between economic and employment policies.

<a name="91206w06.html_para3">All elements of the Pact are subject to the usual Parliamentary Scrutiny procedures. The Pact is an amalgam of three processes and therefore there are no new budget lines.

 I established the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU) in December 1997. Its remit is to help improve Government action to reduce social exclusion by producing

"joined up solutions to joined up problems".

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91206w07.html_para0">Most of its work is on specific projects, chosen by me following consultation with other Ministers and suggestions from interested groups.
<P>

<a name="91206w07.html_para1">Since its inception, the unit has focused on the following priorities: truancy and school exclusion, rough sleeping, poor neighbourhoods, teenage pregnancy and 16-18-year-olds not in employment, education or training. The unit has reported to me on each, with a full analysis 



<P>
<P><I>6 Dec 1999 : Column: 357W</I><P>
of the problem and concrete recommendations for action, all of which I have accepted. These are now Government policy and are being implemented.
<P>

<a name="91206w07.html_para2">I announced in December 1998 that, as the unit was set up on a time-limited basis, its success would be reviewed in the summer 1999, and a decision announced about its longer term future and work programme.
<P>

<a name="91206w07.html_para3">During the summer, this review was undertaken by KPMG, working with members of the SEU. The review took evidence and opinions in writing and face to face with a large number of individuals and organisations with an interest in the work of the unit. The review has now reported to me and the full review report will be published to coincide with this announcement.
<P>

<a name="91206w07.html_para4">The consultation showed that there is overwhelming support for the continued existence of the SEU, and a widespread belief that it has been a success in terms of operation and its effect on wider Government policy, although it is too early to judge the impact of the SEU on the ground.
<P>

<a name="91206w07.html_para5">In particular, the quality of the unit's reports was considered exceptional and its working practices, with a mix of civil service and external staff, was seen as a strength. The approach could be used more widely across the whole of Government. It is also clear that the unit's work has done much to raise the profile of social exclusion as a policy issue within and outside Government.
<P>

<a name="91206w07.html_para6">It is clear from both from the quality of the unit's work and its impact so far that there is a role for it to play for some years to come. I have therefore decided that it will continue in existence, and be reviewed again at the end of 2002.

<a name="91206w07.html_para7">In the short term, I have set the unit the following new priorities as a result of this review. They are:

Any side may raise with the other any issue that might have an impact on EU/US relations. The two principal groups in which this dialogue and exchange of information takes place are the Transatlantic Economic Partnership Steering Group and the New Transatlantic Agenda Task Force. Co-ordinating this work, the Senior Level Group of officials reviews early-warning items in preparation for the six-monthly EU/US Summits. The Transatlantic Legislators' Business, Consumer, Environment and Labour Dialogues have also been invited to contribute to the process by identifying problems and offering proposals for resolution.

 The Report and Accounts were laid before the House this morning.

Furthermore, they show that ECGD's finances are in a very healthy position, which must be good news for their ability to support further business while protecting the interests of the taxpayer.

<a name="91206w08.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Changes to postage tariffs are primarily a matter for the Post Office in consultation with the Post Office Users' National Council (POUNC) to whom the Post Office is statutorily required to refer major proposals for comment. The proposals are formally notified to my Department at the same time as they are referred to POUNC. The increase was prompted by increasing handling costs and is in line with the agreement, set out in the European Postal Services Directive, that prices should be geared to costs. It is still one of the cheapest rates in Europe.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w11.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans he has to ensure that local authorities carry out adequate checks on housing benefit claimants in order to reduce the amount of bogus claims.  [101419]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We inherited a flawed system which placed far too much emphasis on the detection of fraud once it had occurred. Working in partnership with local authorities, we are transforming the delivery of Housing Benefit by emphasising the importance of getting it right to begin with and keeping it right during the life of a claim.




<P>
<P><I>6 Dec 1999 : Column: 372W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91206w11.html_para1">We are financing local authorities to focus on both the prevention and detection of fraud with the introduction of the Verification Framework. The Framework specifies the evidence which must be verified before a claim can be paid and sets out the checks which must be made during the life of a claim. We have made &#163;100 million available to allow all local authorities to implement this important new initiative. So far, we have funded the implementation of the Framework in 223 local authorities. We want all local authorities to adopt the high standards set by the Framework and we have embarked on a programme to increase its take up, particularly among the highest spending authorities.
<P>

<a name="91206w11.html_para2">From 6 September 1999, with the application of Section 19 of the Fraud Act, all new claims for Housing Benefit are subject to tough new identity checks to ensure that all claimants can be linked with the appropriate National Insurance number.
<P>

<a name="91206w11.html_para3">As part of our strategy to ensure that local authorities have in place arrangements for the secure and accurate administration of Housing Benefit, we have instructed the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate to focus their attention on the 30 largest local authorities who between them account for almost a third of the total expenditure on Housing and Council Tax Benefit. These authorities will have been inspected or revisited by the summer of next year and a report will be published with recommendations on each authority which we will follow up. This will allow us to measure their progress in the fight against fraud.
<P>

<a name="91206w11.html_para4">We have also made good progress in preventing the significant amount of fraud which occurs when fraudsters make false claims and then redirect benefit mail from addresses at which they are not resident. The Royal Mail Do Not Redirect scheme was introduced nationally from 1 February this year and will stop the redirection of appropriately marked benefit mail. To date, over 200 local authorities have taken up this initiative and we are aiming that all authorities will adopt this service.

<P>
<a name="91206w11.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Jim Murphy: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many families were officially living in poverty <i>(a)</i> in each of the past 20 years, <i>(b)</i> on 1 May 1997 and <i>(c)</i> on the most recent date available.  [101309]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Poverty and social exclusion are complex multi-dimensional issues, affecting many aspects of people's lives; their income, health, housing, the quality of the environment, opportunities to work and to learn. There is no single measure which can capture the complex problems which need to be overcome.
<P>

<a name="91206w11.html_para5">We are determined to tackle the problems that condemn many individual and communities to poverty. That is why we set out our strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion in our first annual report "Opportunity for all" (Cm 4445). The report includes a range of indicators that capture many of the aspects of poverty and social exclusion.
<P>

<a name="91206w11.html_para6">Information on the indicators, including definitions and baseline data, was placed in the Library on 21 September to accompany "Opportunity for all". One of the indicators monitors the proportion of people living in low income households. Further information on low income statistics are published (annually in recent years) in Households Below Average Income (HBAI). The results can be found in the HBAI publication for the relevant year in the Library.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Pensioner benefit units in private households exclude claimants in Residential care and Nursing Homes.<P>

2. Figures are rounded to the nearest thousand, percentages given to one decimal place.<P>

3. Figures refer to benefit units, which may be a single person or couple.<P>

4. Income Support for the unemployed was replaced by Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance from October 1996. Income Support figures from 1997 exclude unemployed.<P>

5. Pensioners are defined as benefit units where either the claimant and/or partner are aged 60 or over.<P>

6. Income Support figures are based on a 1 per cent. sample up to 1993 and a 5 per cent. sample thereafter.<P>

7. All Percentages are Income Support benefit units expressed as a proportion of all pensioner benefit units (private households).<P>

8. The percentages quoted are based on pensioner benefit units estimates for Great Britain private households taken from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) for 1993-94 to 1997-98 and the Family Expenditure Survey HBAI datasets from 1988 to 1992.<P>

9. FRS estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors that control for region, Council Tax Band and a number of demographic variables. Estimates are subject to sampling error and to variability in non-response.<P>

10. Details of all pensioner benefit units are not yet available for 1999 therefore no percentage is given for this year.<P>

 The current child support formula requires a wide range of information to be obtained, not only about the financial and family circumstances of the parents involved but also about their new partners. This can include details of their income from earnings, benefits or other sources, housing costs (such as mortgages, rent, service charges, council tax, home improvement loans, property and loan insurance), travel to work costs and clean break property settlements.
<P>

<a name="91206w12.html_para0">The new child support rates will require information to be obtained only about the non-resident parent's income and the number of children for whom he is responsible. The definition of what is to count as income will also be considerably simplified as set out in Annexe Two of the White Paper "Children's Rights and Parent's Responsibilities" (Cm. 4349) published on 1 July 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The deployment of police officers is the operational responsibility of Chief Constables. However, the introduction of best value into the police service from April next year and the requirement that year on year efficiency savings of 2 per cent. must be recycled into front-line policing should allow Chief Constables to allocate more officers to the essential job of reducing crime.
<P>

<a name="91206w12.html_para1">Information Technology systems being delivered under the National Strategy for Police Information Systems (NSPIS) and new radio technology for the police being provided as part of the Public Safety Radio Communications Project (PSRCP) will do much to free officers from administrative burdens.
<P>

<a name="91206w12.html_para2">The NSPIS Custody application draws much of the criminal history information required for effective administration of those in custody automatically from the Police National Computer, saving police time, effort and paperwork. The NSPIS Case Preparation system is designed to produce all the information needed by the police, courts, Crown Prosecution Service and other bodies to process cases automatically. This, too, will substantially reduce the administrative burden on police officers, freeing them for front line duties. Holmes 2 harnesses modern technology to make the best use of police resources used in the investigation of major crimes. NSPIS Crime automates the recording of crime reports, saving effort in compilation and making them easier to use in crime management and intelligence led policing. The National Management Information System (NMIS) provides an integrated set of tools to deliver the information commanders at all levels need to manage their resources as efficiently as possible to meet performance targets. NMIS will also enable data to be collected on a common basis to a standard format making it easier to collate and compare at the national level. This will reduce the burden on the police in producing returns and help Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in their work.
<P>

<a name="91206w12.html_para3">The NSPIS applications will be interlinked so that information can be shared electronically, and transmitted to front line officers via the new Public Safety Radio Communication System. These new applications will help free officers from the burden of paperwork and free them for front line duties.

<a name="91206w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Government are committed to protecting children and others from sex offenders. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 contained strong additional safeguards in the new sex offender orders and extended supervision provisions. This session we are bringing forward proposals for a scheme to prevent unsuitable people, including sex offenders, from working with children as part of the Crime and Public Protection Bill.

<P>
<a name="91206w13.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Shepherd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will set out his Department's policy on the notification of hon. Members of the release of sex offenders into bail hostels within their constituency; and in respect of that policy if he will list <i>(a)</i> the number of category A sex offenders placed in bail hostels within England and Wales in each of the past two years, <i>(b)</i> the notification given to his Department, in each case, prior to the offender being placed in a bail hostel and the notification given, in each case, to the hon. Member for the constituency where the hostel was located and <i>(c)</i> on how many occasions the notification given to hon. Members was less than four days.  [101359]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Over the last two years, two sex offenders who were category A prisoners were released to hostel accommodation. Home Office Ministers were notified of the release arrangements two weeks before the first prisoner's release and five weeks prior to the second prisoner's release. The hon. Members for the relevant constituencies received notification seven days and 34 days respectively prior to their release.
<P>

<a name="91206w13.html_para0">In addition to the arrangements for category A prisoners, the Department has, since 1 April 1999, operated an Early Warning system within the prison and probation services in relation to the release of offenders in respect of whom there is a strong risk that a serious violent or sexual offence will be committed after release and where there are victim issues; difficulties with the supervision plan or accommodation; and where it is likely that the case will be subject to media attention. Prisons and probation services are asked to give the Department two months notice of the release of an offender who meets these criteria.
<P>

<a name="91206w13.html_para1">Thirty such cases have been notified to the hon. Members concerned. The information was passed on as soon as we knew what the accommodation arrangements were going to be. I did this in order to reassure hon. Members of the safeguards which have been put in place. This is particularly important if there is likely to be a hostile media reaction so that hon. Members are able to respond if necessary. Many hon. Members have been very supportive to the local agencies responsible for managing dangerous offenders in the community, for which I am grateful.
<P>

<a name="91206w13.html_para2">I am currently reviewing the arrangements for handling these cases. As part of that review, I shall be writing to hon.

We 



<P>

 The elderly, like all age groups, will benefit from the &#163;250 million Crime Reduction Programme that was launched in July 1998 as an evidence-based approach to reducing crime, and from the Crime Reduction Strategy that we announced last week.
<P>

<a name="91206w13.html_para3">The Crime Reduction Programme includes the Reducing Burglary Initiative, under which more than &#163;50 million will be used to support anti-burglary projects over three years covering some 2 million households in 500 areas with high levels of domestic burglary. Of the 63 strategic development projects already under way under this initiative, seven will specifically benefit the elderly.
<P>

<a name="91206w13.html_para4">In addition, we recently announced an &#163;11 million project to provide security improvements for the homes of pensioners on low incomes in high burglary areas, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions' New Home Energy Efficiency Scheme, which starts in June. We plan to announce in the Spring how the improved security arrangements will operate.
<P>

<a name="91206w13.html_para5">This scheme, along with the Reducing Burglary Initiative, will be evaluated to help identify what works most cost-effectively in which circumstances. The results will be disseminated to all partnerships to help them tackle their own burglary problems.
<P>

<a name="91206w13.html_para6">Home Office literature on crime prevention already includes detailed advice to help the elderly reduce the risk of burglary, including burglary by fraudulent callers.
<P>

<a name="91206w13.html_para7">We are also in the initial stages of developing a national programme to combat distraction burglary (the victims of which are mostly very elderly). This will use widespread publicity and improved intelligence and detection methods and will involve the police, other organisations such as Neighbourhood watch and the public utility companies.

 I understand that officers in both the Metropolitan Police and other forces in England and Wales receive formal training on mental illness as part of their probationer training. It is open to chief officers to provide additional training on this subject if there is a particular need for it. Home Office Circular 12/95 sets out advice for chief police officers and others on dealing with mentally disordered suspects or offenders, including the need to develop effective contacts with other local services and agencies. We have noted the recommendations of the Police Complaints Authority and will assess whether there is scope for further guidance to the police.

 It is essential that all police officers receive the training necessary to enable them to carry out their duties properly. The Government published options for future police training arrangements in a consultation document on 18 November. The principal aim of these proposals is to ensure that all officers and support staff are equipped to carry out their duties to common high standards.

 The Working Time Regulations do apply to the Police Service. However, while the regulations clearly apply to police officers and support staff, there are a number of defined exceptions covering circumstances routinely encountered by operational police officers and support staff. Regulation 18 specifically exempts those police duties which inevitably conflict with the limits and entitlements provided for. Regulation 20 applies to workers whose duration of working time is not measured or predetermined, or can be determined by the worker him/herself. Regulation 21 applies in a range of circumstances, including duties in security or surveillance.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department since 1983, in how many cases of people convicted of murder the tariff was set at less than 20 years; and what, in each case, was the reason for a tariff being set at less than 20 years.  [101342]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w16.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Tariffs of 20 years or more are reserved for the gravest types of murder including, for example, terrorist murders, murder by firearm in the course of robbery, the murder of police or prison officers and the sexual or sadistic murder of children. The great majority of murders do not fall into any of the gravest categories and the tariffs they attract are, therefore, normally less than 20 years. About 88 per cent. of all those convicted of murder and currently serving their sentence in custody in England and Wales have a tariff of less than 20 years.

 Ruth Ellis was convicted of murder in 1955, for which the death sentence was mandatory. No appeal was lodged. The Home Secretary of the day concluded that there were insufficient grounds to justify the sentence not being carried out. The powers of the Home Secretary to refer alleged miscarriages of justice to the Court of Appeal were replaced in 1997 by new powers vested in the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which is now responsible for the investigation of cases of alleged wrongful conviction. I understand that an application for a review of Ruth Ellis's case has recently been submitted to the Commission. It will be for the Commission to decide in due course whether the case should be referred to the Court of Appeal.

Details of the ethnic minority employment targets are available in "Race Equality--the Home Secretary's Employment Targets. Staff targets for the Home Office, the Prison Service, the Police, the Fire and the Probation Services", published by the Home Office on 28 July 1999. A copy has been placed in the Library.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will publish the names and addresses of the solicitors' firms and other agencies which have been awarded block contracts by the Legal Aid Board to give advice, assistance and representation in immigration and asylum cases.  [101295]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Legal Aid Board has only recently offered contracts in immigration and asylum work to solicitors and other agencies and the exact number of contracted providers will not be known until the end of December 1999. Almost 500 contracts have been offered and the Board expects a high proportion of them to be taken up. From January 2000, the Board will be able to provide information on those contracted to do immigration and asylum work. It would not be right to publish the names and addresses of firms and agencies who have been offered contracts, but who have not yet decided to accept them, because to do so would be breaking the commercial confidentiality held between the Board and the suppliers. The names and addresses of those solicitors firms and other agencies awarded contracts will be placed in the Library in January 2000 and will also be set out in the Community Legal Service Directory. The Directory is expected to be published in April 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w19.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The founding document of the Stability Pact for South-East Europe places the pact under the auspices of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The Special Co-ordinator for the Stability Pact (Bodo Hombach) was appointed by the European Union, after consultation with OSCE Chairman in Office and other Pact participants.
<P>

<a name="91206w19.html_para2">The Office of the Special Co-ordinator is in Brussels. The Office currently has 29 staff, many secondees from participant countries (including the UK). We anticipate that the UK's contribution to cover the costs of the inaugural Summit meeting of the Stability Pact, and the costs incurred in supporting the EU's Special Representative for the Stability Pact until 31 December 1999, will be approximately &#163;225,000.
<P>

<a name="91206w19.html_para3">The Pact brings together the countries of the region, the EU, the USA, Russia, a range of other countries, many international organisations and International Financial institutions. It has been stressed at all Stability Pact meetings that there is a role for FRY when conditions permit. Meanwhile, Montenegro is fully involved in the Pact's work.
<P>

<a name="91206w19.html_para4">The Pact aims to promote peace, stability and democracy in the region. The EU plays a leading role in the Pact. But other international organisations and the IFIs also have a critical role to play. The Pact's strength is as a catalysing and co-ordinating organisation. It is not intended to be a grant-giving body. We will continue to support the implementing agencies (EU, OSCE, IFIs, etc.) through our regular contributions and on a case-by-case basis.
<P>

<a name="91206w19.html_para5">The UK has played an active role in the first meetings of the Regional Table and three Working Tables (covering Democracy/Human Rights, Economic Reconstruction/ Development/Co-operation and Security Issues). These and other meetings and regular bilateral contacts enable us to have a full exchange of views with all Pact participants and the Special Co-ordinator on all aspects of the Stability Pact process.
<P>

<a name="91206w19.html_para6">There was an informal meeting of Stability Pact Foreign Ministers in the margins of the OSCE Summit in Istanbul on 18 November. This provided a useful stock-taking opportunity. Overall progress has been good.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what <i>(a)</i> UK bilateral and <i>(b)</i> NATO financial assistance is being (i) offered and (ii) provided to Russia in relation to (1) decommissioning redundant nuclear weapons and delivery systems, (2) destruction of chemical weapons and (3) other arms control systems; and if he will make a statement. [101384]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The UK has provided &#163;35,900,000 in bilateral assistance to support the decommissioning of redundant nuclear weapons. This figure comprises &#163;35 million for equipment to transfer warheads from the Former Soviet Union to Russia between 1992-95 and approximately &#163;900,000 assistance on safeguards and materials accountancy. We have also announced a &#163;5 million bilateral assistance programme to help Russia deal with its nuclear waste and spent fuel legacy. Specific projects are now being considered, but, before we can initiate projects on the ground, we need an adequate legal and financial framework for such assistance. This is under negotiation.
<P>

<a name="91206w21.html_para1">NATO does not provide financial assistance in these areas. At the Washington Summit this year, NATO said that it would consider options for confidence and security-building measures, verification, non-proliferation

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs for what reasons the United Kingdom made representations to the Russian Government about the prosecution of the journalists Nikitin and Pasko; and if he will make a statement. [101383]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 We, along with our EU partners, have been concerned that the trials of the environmentalists Nikitin and Pasko should be conducted fairly, justly and in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights. We will continue to monitor both cases.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs for what reason qualified majority voting has been introduced into the Common EU strategy on Russia; what was his policy on its introduction; what decisions henceforth will no longer be subject to unanimity; what decisions have been taken under the new procedure; and what is the procedure for restoring the unanimity principle.  [101013]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which entered into force on 1 May 1999, provides for the European Council to decide on common strategies unanimously. It also provides for the Council to act by qualified majority when adopting joint actions, common positions, or taking any other decisions on the basis of a common strategy. If a member of the Council declares that it intends for important and stated reasons of national interest to oppose the adoption of a decision to be taken by qualified majority, a vote shall not be taken. The Council may, acting by qualified majority, request that the matter be referred to the European Council for decision by unanimity. No actions have yet been taken on the basis of the common strategy on Russia by qualified majority. We support the new arrangements for the common foreign and security policy put in place by the Treaty of Amsterdam.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the extent to which the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty has been <i>(a)</i> ratified and <i>(b)</i> implemented by the relevant states.  [101385]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> The Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty was ratified by all 30 States and entered into force in July 1992. The adapted CFE Treaty was signed in Istanbul on 19 November 1999. The adapted Treaty will not come into force until all 30 signatories have ratified. This could take some time. In the interim period, the original CFE Treaty remains in force.
<P>

<a name="91206w21.html_para3"><i>(b)</i> While there have been a number of examples of non-compliance, implementation since the Treaty came into force has generally been good. We and our NATO Allies continue to press for full compliance, and have made clear that our ratification of the adapted Treaty will depend upon the level of all Parties' compliance with limits that have been agreed.

 Following a further review, I am now able to give figures for arrests for activities related to the State Visit in all police areas visited by the Chinese President. As I made clear in the Debate on the Address, no-one was charged. As the Minister of State, Home Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke) said on 5 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 366W, 15 people were arrested in the Metropolitan Police Area. I regret that I may have implied during the Debate on the Address that there were no arrests. I can now confirm that, in addition to those above, one person was arrested in the City of London. There were no arrests in Cambridge. I reconfirm that no one was charged in any of these police areas.

<P>
<a name="91206w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Presidency have carried forward the conclusions of the European Council at Cologne on non-military crisis response tools, and will present a report to the European Council at Helsinki suggesting how the Cologne conclusions may be taken further. Decisions on any new arrangements in this area will be taken by consensus. No decisions have yet been taken on the roles of the Commission or of national governments in any new coordinating arrangements. We support better coordination of the various non-military crisis response tools at the disposal of the Community and member states as a way of strengthening the European Union's common foreign and security policy.

<P>
<a name="91206w22.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 My Department issued planning guidance to assist the early years development and child care partnerships to draw up their updated plans for 2000-01 in September. The guidance emphasises that plans should be working towards comprehensive coverage of child care services. Between May 1997 and end of June 1999, this Administration has created 94,316 new child care places, compared with 74,053 new places created by the out of school child care initiative in the four years between April 1993 and April 1997.
<P>

<a name="91206w22.html_para0">Since September, we have held a series of 14 planning guidance conferences around England attended by over 900 partnership members. As part of an extensive programme of partnership support we have also made a series of two and three day strategic planning modules available to partnerships. These modules offer workshop sessions tailor made to suit the needs of individual partnerships and give an opportunity for partners to identify detailed strategies to implement their early years development and child care plan.
<P>

<a name="91206w22.html_para1">The wider programme of partnership support includes publication of a series of good practice guides, the setting up of quarterly, regional partnership meetings for partnership chairs, lead officers and members, and the issue of regular newsletters and information sheets to partnership members. We are currently assessing partnership training needs and will make training packages available to them by the end of this financial year.

 Since September 1998, all four-year-olds have been eligible for a free early education place. Currently around 587,000, or 95 per cent., of these places are taken up.
<P>

<a name="91206w22.html_para2">In addition, we are making available &#163;390 million over three years to almost double the number of three-year-olds in England able to access a free early education place. These resources will fund 190,000 new places by March 



<P>
<P><I>6 Dec 1999 : Column: 412W</I><P>
2002. From September 1999, &#163;40 million of this new money has been allocated to the 57 local education authorities with the highest levels of social need, to create around 48,000 new, free places during 1999-2000. From April 2000, additional funding for three-year-olds will be distributed across all local education authorities, again prioritised by social need.
<P>

<a name="91206w22.html_para3">The table shows the number of places that we expect to be created across all authorities by 2000-01. We have yet to determine the allocation for 2001-02.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many clients have joined the New Deal Voluntary Option since its launch <i>(a)</i> nationally and <i>(b)</i> in the constituency of Heywood and Middleton.  [100295]

<a name="91206w22.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on the inspection system for early years services.  [99096]<P>

<P>
<a name="91206w22.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 November 1999]:</i> On 2 December, the Care Standards Bill was introduced into another place. Part V of the Bill makes provision for the reform of the regulation of early years services. In particular, it enables the regulation of child care and early years education in England to be brought together under a distinct and new Early Years Directorate in Ofsted.
<P>

<a name="91206w22.html_para4">Part V also makes other important changes to the regulation of child care. For example, it provides for new and uniform national standards for child care. It introduces, for the first time, checks on people working with children aged 8 and over. It will also ensure that overnight care is properly regulated.
<P>

<a name="91206w22.html_para5">These measures will ensure greater consistency in child care provision. They will result in safer environments of a higher quality for children and less bureaucracy for providers. Parents will have access to more information and so make better informed choices. And they will have greater peace of mind knowing that unsuitable people are prevented from caring for their children.

<P>

<a name="91206w23.html_para0">The Council approved the draft Joint Employment Report for 1999, the latest draft Employment Guidelines for 2000 and the latest draft of the Council Recommendation on the implementation of member states' employment policies. These elements were also agreed by the Joint ECOFIN/Social Affairs Council, held on the same day, at which the Secretary of State and I represented the UK. They will now be submitted to the Helsinki European Council on 10-11 December for agreement.
<P>

<a name="91206w23.html_para1">The Council reached political agreement on the Council Decision establishing the Employment Committee.
<P>

<P>

<a name="91206w23.html_para3">In the absence of consensus on the provisions for employees involvement in the proposed European Company, Presidency efforts to find a compromise solution will continue in December.
<P>

<a name="91206w23.html_para4">The UK confirmed that it could only accept Article 63(4) as a legal base for extending Regulation 1408/71 (Co-ordination of Social Security Systems to Third Country Nationals). Some other member states supported Articles 42 and 308. The issue will be taken forward under the Portuguese Presidency.
<P>

<a name="91206w23.html_para5">Most member states called for varying degrees of extension of Regulation 1408/71 to cover Third Country Nationals and non-active persons. The UK argued in

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if section II 4 of the Resolution of the European Council on the European Employment Pact permits positive discrimination. [101099]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w23.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Section II 4 of the Resolution of the Employment Council does not permit positive discrimination and, in any case, has no legal effect.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w23.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on the implementation of subsidiarity within the Employment Pact, with reference to individual projects planned. [101098]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w23.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The European Employment Pact is consistent with the principles of subsidiarity. The Pact is an amalgam of three non-binding processes, the existing Luxembourg employment process and the Cardiff economic reform process, and a third, new element, the macro-economic dialogue, termed the 'Cologne process'. There are no new individual projects planned.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w23.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on his policy regarding the Macro-economic Dialogue, indicated in section 12 of the Resolution of the European Council on the European Employment Pact; and what discussions he has held on the dialogue.  [101111]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w23.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The macro-economic dialogue referred to in section III of the Resolution of the European Council on the European Employment Pact takes place biannually among social partners and fiscal and employment policy makers at EU level. There are two elements, a technical working party which had their first meeting on 29 October 1999 and a political level ministerial meeting which took place for the first time on 8 November 1999. These meetings provided an opportunity for an initial exchange of views.

 The Jumbo Council is the meeting of the Finance and Economic Policy Council and the Employment and Social Affairs Council. It meets every six months during each Presidency.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list the measures for closer co-operation between EU states within the framework of the European Employment Pact; what new priorities are under discussion; and if he will make a statement on progress made under the Pact.  [101110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w23.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The European Employment Pact agreed at the Cologne European Council on 3-4 June 1999 brought together three processes. Two of these were the existing Luxembourg employment process and the Cardiff economic reform process. The third, new, element was the macro-economic dialogue, termed the 'Cologne process'. The Pact gives fresh impetus, through the macro-economic dialogue, to the promotion of long term, sustainable job creation in a climate of stability and steady growth.

<a name="91206w23.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many jobs his Department estimates have been created as a consequence of decisions taken through the Employment Pact. [101112]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w23.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The European Employment Pact gives fresh impetus to the existing Luxembourg employment process as well as introducing a macro-economic dialogue process which helps create a climate of stability and steady growth. The UK National Action Plan, produced as part of the Luxembourg process sets out policy initiatives for a medium term strategy to maximise job creation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on the future of middle, deemed secondary, schools. [101177]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w24.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Systems of organisation involving middle deemed secondary schools are traditional in some local education authority areas. We recognise that a variety of patterns of organisation are possible, and we support those that are in the best interests of education in the area. Any proposals to change the age range of a school by a full year or more will need to go through the formal statutory proposal process. If there are any objections, the proposals will be decided by a local school organisation committee or, if the committee cannot agree, by an independent adjudicator.

<a name="91206w24.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Promoting regular school attendance is a key component in the Government's strategy to raise educational standards. Our recently published strategy document "Tackling Truancy Together" sets out our proposals to reduce days lost to education as a result of truancy. A copy has been placed in the Library.

<a name="91206w24.html_para1">In 1998-99, 0.6 per cent. of half days were missed as a result of unauthorised absence in maintained primary and secondary schools in those local education authorities in England which operated a three-tier system. This compares with an overall national figure of 0.7 per cent. of half days missed.

<a name="91206w24.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 &#163;10 million of Standards Fund money has been made available for 2000-01 to support the early retirement of headteachers. A limit of &#163;50,000 has been placed on the support available in any individual case. This will allow for at least 200 retirements to be supported by the scheme. Local Education Authority employers will determine which of their headteachers appear to meet the scheme's criteria and prioritise those for whom they are applying for support. This Department and OFSTED will consider the evidence provided by LEAs in support of each application and announce during January which applications have been approved.

<a name="91206w24.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what is the planned expenditure on performance-related pay for teachers over the next two years, broken down by category of expenditure, including <i>(a)</i> training, <i>(b)</i> cost of external assessors and advisers and <i>(c)</i> pay awards for teachers passing through the threshold. [101397]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w24.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Government have set aside up to &#163;1 billion over the next two years to fund Green Paper proposals, the vast majority of which is for pay. We have announced a Standards Fund grant of &#163;20 million in 2000-01 for introductory training for performance management and provisionally a further &#163;8 million in 2001-02. We are considering what further training and support might be provided centrally for schools. The costs associated with this training and the external assessors and advisers will be subject to the outcome of negotiations. The Government has proposed to the STRB that teachers should receive up to &#163;2,000 for passing the threshold. There will be no quota on threshold successes and it is not possible therefore to give a total cost in advance; this will depend upon the number of teachers who pass the threshold.

 <i>[holding answer 22 November 1999]:</i> Approximately 80,000 items of mail are received at DVLA daily. For security and operational reasons, DVLA post is never opened until the point of processing and therefore there is currently a four to five day queue of unopened mail, which is about normal for the time of year. The level of work awaiting processing is carefully monitored each day.
<P>

<a name="91206w24.html_para2">On the driving licence side, which accounts for 20,000 to 30,000 applications per day, the DVLA undertakes to issue driving licences, including return to the applicant, within three weeks--15 working days--from the date of receipt at the Agency. This three-week standard has been met or bettered consistently throughout the year.
<P>

<a name="91206w24.html_para3">In cases where a driver declares a medical condition--amounting to some 1,100 applications a day--because of the increased complexities the service standard is five weeks for a car licence and seven weeks for a bus or lorry licence. Some current cases in these categories are taking longer. Action is being taken to bring this service up to standard and the position is steadily improving.
<P>

<a name="91206w24.html_para4">There are no exceptional operational difficulties at the Agency. Over the pas 18 months, major changes to both driver and vehicle computer systems have been successfully introduced.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w24.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The cost of the control trial is approximately &#163;800,000 over four financial years. The aims of the control trail are to test the feasibility of eradicating the UK's population of ruddy duck within ten years, determining the financial cost of such a programme and indicating the number of birds needed to be culled each year to achieve this.
<P>

<a name="91206w24.html_para5">Additionally, the control trial aims to identify the factors which will impact on any national programme, such as whether compulsory access to land would be necessary, the distribution and numbers of ducks at various sites, methods of control dependent upon differing habitats and the number of visits needed to individual sites. Due to the many varied aspects and requirements of this control trial, a cost of controlling each individual duck was not requested from the contractors.

 The control trial is being undertaken in three areas of the country: Western Midlands, Anglesey where the control is all year round, and Fife, where the control is post-season only. The control trial does not focus on the numbers of birds culled, it looks at the wider picture of how the control is progressing given the various conditions, such as habitat, numbers of birds at each site, migratory movements, access to land, and number of site visits. However, between March and end of September 1999, with control only taking place in two of the regions, 



<P>
<P><I>6 Dec 1999 : Column: 423W</I><P>
over 12 per cent. of the total national ruddy duck population was culled. At the conclusion of the first year, the contractors will produce a detailed report one aspect of which will be the number of birds culled.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions who has responsibility for search and rescue on the River Thames in the event of an emergency.  [99624]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Her Majesty's Coastguard is responsible for the initiation and co-ordination of civil maritime search and rescue within the United Kingdom search and rescue region. That region includes all tidal waters within UK territorial limits, and so includes the tidal River Thames.
<P>

<a name="91206w25.html_para0">Within that, responsibility for search and rescue on the Thames is undertaken by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), the Port of London Authority (PLA) and the Metropolitan Police; under detailed Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) between them, MCA retains overall responsibility and also handles incidents in the Thames estuary upstream to Canvey Island as part of its coastal operation. Under the MoU between MCA and the PLA, the PLA co-ordinates search and rescue incidents on the rest of tidal Thames, west of Canvey Island to Teddington Lock. PLA in turn have an MoU with the Metropolitan Police, covering the Thames between Crayfordness and Teddington, under which the Police assume responsibility for handling major incident in that area.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will set out the division of responsibilities between the Marine Coastguard Agency, the River Police (Thames Division), the Fire Brigade and the Port of London Authority for safety on the River Thames.  [99622]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is responsible for developing, promoting and enforcing high standards of marine safety; for minimising loss of life among seafarers and coastal users; and for responding to maritime emergencies 24 hours a day. This responsibility applies to the River Thames where MCA is responsible for the initiation and co-ordination of search and rescue.
<P>

<a name="91206w25.html_para1">The Port of London Authority (PLA) is responsible for the maintenance of the safety of navigation and for the conservancy of the tidal Thames. Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the MCA, the PLA also co-ordinates search and rescue incidents west of Canvey Island to Teddington Lock. The PLA in turn has an MoU with the Metropolitan Police covering the Thames between Crayfordness and Teddington, under which the Police assume responsibility for any major incident in that area.
<P>

<a name="91206w25.html_para2">The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) Thames Division is responsible for the prevention of crime and disorder, high visibility patrolling and emergency policing response, which includes saving or preserving life when called upon to do so. It has general responsibility for the co-ordination of the response to civil emergencies. Accordingly, the MPS assumes responsibility for any major incident between Crayfordness and Teddington. But it does not provide a dedicated search and rescue facility.

<P>

<a name="91206w25.html_para3">The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has designated responsibility for fire fighting and the provision of fire prevention information and advice. It has no designated responsibility for river rescue. With a view to increasing flexibility of river borne operations, it recently took delivery of two new fast response craft. While the primary purpose of these craft is for firefighting, they can be used to assist rescue operations and are equipped to do so. In the event of a serious incident on the Thames, the LFB would place their vessels and themselves at the disposal of the other relevant authorities to help rescue casualties.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions on how many occasions the Regional Marine Safety Committee has met; who are the members; what recommendations it has made on safety on the Thames; and how many recommendations have not been acted on.  [99620]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w25.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The London District Marine Safety Committee covers safety on the Thames. It is chaired by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and has met on 11 occasions. Its members are representatives of HM Coastguard; Norfolk County Council; London Fire and Civil Defence Authority; Environment Agency; Port of London Authority; Health and Safety Executive; Trinity House; the Metropolitan Police; P&O European Ferries; Stena Line; F T Everard and Sons; National Federation of Fisherman's Organisations; Royal Yachting Association and Upper Thames Passenger Boat Association.
<P>

<a name="91206w25.html_para4">The main purpose of District Marine Safety Committees is to keep under review the distribution of responsibilities for safety, rescue and control of pollution on inland and coastal waters. They facilitate communication between interested parties and resolve local issues quickly. In fulfilling this role the London District Safety Committee, its sub-committees and working groups have considered a wide range of issues, many relevant to safety on the Thames. Achievements include development of model guidelines for Port Emergency Plans; assisting in the development of two Codes of Practice, one for local authorities and one for users, on Personal Watercraft; providing guidance on manning scales for small passenger boats; development of an inland waterway boat activity matrix as a basis for risk assessment and development of emergency plans for stretches of water with significant usage.
<P>

<a name="91206w25.html_para5">The London District Marine Safety Committee has made recommendations of more general interest to the annual National Marine Safety Steering Group Committee and its successor, the Marine Safety Co-ordinating Committee. Of particular relevance was a recommendation on the need to introduce more specific regulation to control alcohol abuse; a public consultation document was issued on 2 December 1999.

 <i>[holding answer 30 November 1999]:</i> The Highways Agency is currently undertaking detailed studies at a considerable number of locations with a view to identifying appropriate measures to reduce excessive levels of noise at nearby properties. The results of these studies are not yet available.

 <i>[holding answer 30 November 1999]</i>: The responsibility for pursuing the keepers of unlicensed vehicles rests with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). The Agency works closely with the police and traffic wardens to detect unlicensed vehicles on the public road. Where an offence has been confirmed, action is taken through out of court settlement or, in the more serious cases, by prosecution.
<P>

<a name="91206w26.html_para0">Last year successful action was taken against 475,000 tax dodgers with some &#163;57.9 million recovered in fines and penalties. In addition, 125,000 evaders or potential evaders relicensed their vehicles as a direct result of enforcement action bringing in a further &#163;15 million.

 Utilities carrying out street works are required to reinstate the street in accordance with the Specification for the Reinstatement of Openings in Highways, which is a statutory code of practice published under the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991. The specification requires the permanent reinstatement to match the original surface materials as closely as possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the initiatives taken since May 1997 on women and public transport usage, indicating in each case the <i>(a)</i> date of the initiative, <i>(b)</i> budget and <i>(c)</i> impact assessment carried out; and if he will make a statement.

 As women are the main users of public transport, our "New Deal for Transport" is of particular importance to them. It has put a greater emphasis on providing better quality transport services; on providing safer public transport; on improving the quality of the pedestrian environment; and on promoting land-use policies which encourage local services. The Commission for Integrated Transport will also take full account of women's transport needs.
<P>

<a name="91206w26.html_para1">A number of initiatives have been--and will be--undertaken to improve the general availability and accessibility of public transport; for example, through Local Transport Plans, Bus Quality Partnerships and the national public transport information system. More specifically, we are finalising the production of a gender audit to assist transport planners and operators to develop and implement public transport systems that meet women's transport requirements and encourage sustainable development. The audit will be available in the new year.
<P>

<a name="91206w26.html_para2">We are also continuing to make use of consultations, research projects and disaggregated statistics to identify the impact of policy on women. We also require the inclusion of policy appraisal statements in each Ministerial policy submission.

<P>
<a name="91206w26.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The A380 Kingskerswell bypass was withdrawn from the trunk road programme in 1996 and, indeed, the A380 no longer forms part of the Trunk Road Network. Responsibility for the promotion of any such scheme lies with Torbay Council and Devon County Council which would have to consider it within the context of their respective Local Transport Plans. The Authorities are currently undertaking a joint study along the A380 corridor, which is to be developed for inclusion within their final Local Transport Plans, due for submission in July 2000.

 The Government's plans, announced in March this year, to introduce a new statutory right of access on foot to specified categories of open countryside--mountain, moor, heath, down and registered common land--will be included in the countryside Bill which was announced in the Queen's Speech. At the Government's request, the Countryside Agency, the Countryside Council for Wales and the Forestry Commission have recently reported on the case for extending public access to other types of open countryside, such as coast, woodland and riverside. We are considering their views carefully before deciding how best to proceed.

 My Department has published comprehensive guidance on the stock transfer process, which is designed to assist local authorities who are transferring all or part of their housing stock to a Registered Social Landlord. Other measures in place include (a) the ability to use capital resources (i.e. provision for credit liabilities) rather than revenue to meet the cost of premium payments which arise when outstanding loans with the Public Works Loan Board are repaid early; (b) allowing authorities to capitalise for up to three years after transfer which additional rent allowance expenditure would otherwise fall on the general fund; (c) allowing authorities to value their stock using a discount rate of 7 per cent. rather than 8 per cent. as previously, thereby increasing the size of their capital receipt; and (d) guidance about warranties.

 The Government believe that the interests of UK consumers are best served by ensuring that a framework exists within which airlines can compete freely to provide services.

 Avon Health Authority, working with local general practitioners and National Health Service trusts, is looking at ways of improving orthopaedic waiting times.

No formal assessment of the North Bristol pilot scheme has been undertaken by the NHS Executive. We welcome local initiatives to reduce out-patient waiting times by involving PCGs.

 Since April 1999, St. Bartholomew's Hospital has cancelled an estimated three operations, the Royal London Hospital an estimated 14 operations and the Homerton Hospital no operations, due to illness or absence of anaesthetic staff, or because an anaesthetist was called away to deal with a clinical emergency.

Currently, there are enough higher specialist trainees in anaesthetics, for there to be around 1,280 extra qualifying for consultant posts by 2005. It will be for individual NHS trusts and health authorities who are accountable for the quality of the services they provide, to determine the number, grade and mix of staff they will require to deliver quality services in their location.

These studies have the aim of improving estimates of dose and risk by providing information for the development of biokinetic and dosimetric models. In recent years, many of these studies have been carried out with partial support from the European Commission in multi-partner projects involving institutions in several member states. The NRPB has recently participated in a review of risks from ingested and inhaled particles, and in the development of a database of experiments on radionuclide biokinetics, undertaken for the European Late Effects Programme funded by the European Commission.

<a name="91206w28.html_spnew15"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 December 1999]:</i> The Department has funded research into whether the chemical form (speciation) of particular radionuclides effects their uptake.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w28.html_spnew16"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 December 1999]:</i> There are two methods that are currently in widespread use by the radiation protection profession around the world. Both were developed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). The first is the ICRP 30 Lung Model, the second the ICRP Human Respiratory Tract Model for Radiological Protection (HRTM). The approaches in both are broadly similar to each other, but HRTM is based on more recent 



<P>
<P><I>6 Dec 1999 : Column: 442W</I><P>
information and understanding. In particular, the parameters used in the HRTM to calculate the amounts of inhaled materials retained in the tracheobronchial lymph nodes (TBLN) were based on numerous measurements of radionuclides in lungs and TBLN from tissues taken at autopsies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w28.html_spnew17"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 December 1999]:</i> The Department has funded research to establish whether plutonium concentrates in human gonads. The project, using extremely low levels of a very pure form of plutonium-237 in volunteers, demonstrated that plutonium does not concentrate in human testes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w28.html_spnew18"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 December 1999]:</i> The Department relies on advice on this matter from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB). As part of a programme of research on the biokinetics and dosimetry of radionuclides, NRPB have measured the retention of radionuclides in the testes of rodents and, in collaboration with the Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, studied mechanisms of uptake. Work has concentrated on the behaviour of naturally occurring and artificial alpha emitters and also Auger emitters, because of the importance of the relative position of the retained nuclide and target cells for these short range emissions. Most radionuclides do not concentrate selectively in the gonads. The NRPB's Assessment of Internal Doses to Subjects in the Health and Safety Executive Follow-up to Gardner Study involved calculating doses to testes from incorporated radionuclides for a group of Sellafield workers. As a part of this project, information relating to radionuclide retention in the testes was reviewed. Particular attention was paid to plutonium. From the data available, it was found that only between one thousandth and one ten thousandth part of the plutonium taken up by the body ended up in the testes.

 The Department has funded research in an attempt to examine the interaction between ionising radiation and other environmental agents, specifically the interaction between gamma rays and benzene. These experiments proved very difficult to perform in realistic biological systems and the results were inconclusive. Further information on the mechanisms of interaction between radiation and other environmental agents remains a priority for research.

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 1999]:</i> The National Radiation Protection Board has undertaken experimental studies of the biokinetics and dosimetry of

<P><I>6 Dec 1999 : Column: 443W</I><P>
naturally-occurring alpha-emitting radioisotopes of thorium, uranium and polonium, with the aim of improving estimates of dose and risk from exposure to these radionuclides. An NRPB study of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of in-utero exposure of mice to plutonium-239 alpha emissions, chromosome damage in bone marrow cells of offspring was compared in animals exposed to either plutonium-239 or x-rays. This methodology is applicable to naturally occurring alpha-emitting nuclides and avoids large-scale studies of tumour induction. The Department is also funding studies in animals on the effects of inhaled radon. These studies, concentrating on dose and dose rate effects in the induction of lung cancer, will provide information for the assessment of RBE.

 The Department is committed to ensuring that voluntary organisations in receipt of section 64 funding gain maximum benefit from this financial support. The Department constantly keeps under review grants awarded, to check that the voluntary organisations such as Childline are performing effectively and the grants continue to take forward departmental policy priorities and objectives.
<P>

<a name="91206w29.html_para0">As part of this process, during the autumn of 1997, Childline had a routine but in depth inspection by the Department. The report was extremely positive, describing Childline as a significant national organisation. The monitoring, evaluation and review arrangements attached to grants received by voluntary organisations such as Childline, requires them to provide us with an annual report on the way the Department's funding has been used. The report gives a detailed account of what has been achieved during the preceding financial year.
<P>

<a name="91206w29.html_para1">Over its 10-year existence, Childline's achievements have been considerable. In particular, the agency has identified a previously largely unrecognised need; established a unique non-statutory service shaped from the start by children themselves in the way they used the service and the needs they expressed; built a good reputation becoming well respected and credible in the field; and maintained a very clear image to the public through the purity and consistency of its focus.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he will announce his decision on the abolition of the carry forward/carry back tax rules relating to personal pensions; and if he will make a statement. [101382]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w30.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The proposal to remove the carry forward and carry back facility forms part of the current public consultations on stakeholder pensions. We will announce our intentions when we have considered the responses to the consultation.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the tax relief that will be saved as a result of his proposal to abolish the carry forward/carry back tax rules relating to personal pensions; and if he will make a statement.  [101381]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91206w30.html_spnew1"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The consultation proposal to remove the carry forward and carry-back facility is intended to simplify pension administration not to raise revenue. We would not expect the removal of carry forward carry back to save tax relief.

<P>
<a name="91206w30.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 It is estimated that receipts of between &#163;100 and &#163;160 million will be received by the Exchequer this financial year, and in each of the following three years, as a result of public service employees who were mis-sold personal pensions being reinstated into public service pension schemes. The amount of receipts paid in match future liabilities. Any compensation paid into public service schemes will be matched by future benefits to pensioners.

 The 1996 Commission report "The mutually beneficial effects of greater co-ordination of economic and structural policies (Europe as an economic entity)" presented a study of the employment history of the EU. The report highlighted the importance of the European single market for growth and employment across Europe and underlined the need for further structural reforms to Europe's product and labour markets. A copy of the report has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

Any changes to capital gains tax would apply to all qualifying businesses in the area, but we have no specific figures for these.

 In the 1999 Pre-Budget Report, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the Government will set up a new Children's Fund in the spending review in 2000. The Fund will support pioneering work by voluntary and community sector organisations working with low-income children and their families, building on the sector's access to communities and families that the statutory sector struggles to engage. The review will take place in forthcoming months and as yet resources have not been allocated to the Fund, but we expect children from all over England to benefit from the activities it will support.
