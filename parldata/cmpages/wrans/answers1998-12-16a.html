<P>
<a name="81216w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Charles Kennedy: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if the <i>(a)</i> draft Toll Order for the Skye Bridge and <i>(b)</i> draft Assignation Statement were placed in the Library in 1991; and if he will make a statement.  [63320]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Macdonald </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 December 1998]:</i> A draft of the Order and the Assignation Statement were not placed in the Library. The Order was not subject to parliamentary procedure but the proposal to make the Order was advertised and a draft of the Order was available for inspection in accordance with the required procedures under the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984. There was no draft Statement. The procedures in the 1984 Act require the Assignation Statement itself to be made available for inspection with the draft Order and this was done.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what powers the devolved Scottish Parliament will have to alter the rules governing the amount of capital receipts from right to buy which local authorities must use to repay their capital debt.  [63323]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Macdonald </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 December 1998]:</i> These arrangements were applied as a condition of the consent to local authorities to incur capital expenditure under section 94 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 and it would be open to the Scottish Executive to alter those conditions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement on the progress he has made in allocating resources to help with the regeneration of Scotland's former coalmining communities.  [64628]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 Scotland's former coalmining communities will benefit from a share of the &#163;10 million being made available in recognition of miners' pension fund surpluses. In addition, we are making &#163;1 million available to help these communities. I will be announcing details about how we will be targeting the funding for these communities, following consultation with Scottish Enterprise, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Region of the Coalfield Communities Campaign. We will ensure that it is deployed to complement the range of initiatives already underway, including the new Social Inclusion Partnerships, which will be supported by &#163;48 million over the next 3 years, for which former coalfield areas are eligible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement on the suitability of procurators fiscal with qualifications as solicitor-advocate <i>(a)</i> to be advocate deputes and <i>(b)</i> to prosecute in the High Court.  [62670]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 My noble and learned Friend the Lord Advocate is responsible for the appointment of Advocate Deputes. My noble and learned Friend is satisfied about the competence of many Procurators Fiscal, including some with qualifications as Solicitor- Advocate, to undertake the work carried out by Advocate Deputes, including prosecuting in the High Court. However, he takes the view that it is necessary for the proper operation of the prosecution system in Scotland to maintain the traditional separation between the role of the Procurator Fiscal and that of Crown Counsel, to ensure independence of decision making and prosecution in respect of High Court cases. He is not, therefore, inclined to appoint Procurators Fiscal as Advocate Deputes.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement on the relative costs of using <i>(a)</i> members of the Faculty of Advocates and <i>(b)</i> procurators fiscal qualified as solicitor-advocates, as advocate deputes.  [62671]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 My noble and learned Friend the Lord Advocate has responsibility for prosecutions in Scotland. The post of Advocate Depute is assessed for remuneration purposes at rates comparable with the Senior Civil Service, on which individual pay is based regardless of whether the incumbent is a member of the Faculty of Advocates or a Procurator Fiscal. There is therefore no significant difference in their relative costs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will list the companies which to date have been offered additional grant if they employ residents of assisted areas under the RSA Priority Initiative launched on 22 May.  [63908]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 Under the pilot "RSA Priority" initiative, launched on 22 May 1998 in five particularly deprived areas of Scotland, nine companies have to date been offered the opportunity to receive additional grant if they employ residents of the designated areas. Information regarding offers of Regional Selective Assistance to individual companies is generally regarded as commercially confidential, although details of offers of &#163;75,000 or more are published in "Labour Market Trends" once the company has received its first payment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if the proposed identity card scheme for young people announced by Health and Home Department ministers will operate in Scotland.  [63857]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 The Government have no plans to introduce an identity card scheme for young people in Scotland, or in the rest of the United Kingdom. Ministers have, however, welcomed the various proof of age card schemes covering age-restricted products such as alcohol, 



<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 1998 : Column: 513</I><P>
tobacco and fireworks, and we have encouraged representatives from these industries to consider the feasibility of developing a multi-purpose proof of age card.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland which categories of properties, which are not owned or operated by recognised charities or other non-profit making bodies, benefit from relief on their water or sewerage rates; and what figures he has for the number of properties concerned and the amount of the relief afforded them.  [63859]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 Following the establishment of the three Scottish water authorities, relief from water and sewerage charges is no longer specified in statute, and is a matter for the authorities. Overall, it is estimated that the amount of relief is some &#163;14 million per annum.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what his timetable is for making further orders to give effect to local authority ward boundary changes following the recommendations of the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland.  [64035]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 It is the intention to have orders made in respect of all local authority areas (apart from Orkney and Shetlands) by 31 December 1998. As a consequence of the Petitions for Judicial Review submitted by Orkney and Shetlands Island Councils, we will delay making an order in respect of these 2 areas until 15 January 1999, the latest practicable date if the new arrangements are to take effect for the elections due in May 1999. No order will be made, however, if the Court gives an indication before that date that a decree of reduction is to be granted in respect of the relevant Petition.

<a name="81216w01.html_sbhd8"><H4><center>Incapable Adults Report</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w01.html_wqn10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement on the Government's policy on the Scottish Law Commission's Incapable Adults report (Scots Law Com. No. 151).  [64388]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The subject of decision-making on behalf of adults who are unable to manage their own affairs is an important one. The Government have been made fully aware of the issues through the report by the Scottish Law Commission in 1995 and subsequent public consultation, which attracted a substantial and carefully considered response. We accept the need for reform of the existing legislation in this important area of the law that provides support and protection for some of the most vulnerable people in society.
<P>

<a name="81216w01.html_para1">It will be within the competence of the Scottish Parliament to legislate in this area and this statement cannot pre-empt announcements about the Scottish Parliament's legislative programme. It excludes consideration of the SLC's recommendations about medical treatment and research and advance statements. These are sensitive issues and we received many responses on them in the consultation exercise. We have not made any decisions on these matters yet; and we shall also want to consider what emerges from the Lord Chancellor's recent consultation exercise on similar proposals for England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="81216w01.html_para2">We agree with the general principles proposed by the SLC that any intervention should produce a benefit for the adult; be least restrictive of the adult's freedom; wherever possible encourage the adult to use existing skills and acquire new skills, and take account of the present and past wishes of the adult.
<P>

<a name="81216w01.html_para3">In relation to particular aspects of the Report we agree with the SLC on the following:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The proposed definition of mental incapacity;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The current office of the Accountant of Court should be expanded to form a new office of Public Guardian;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The function of the Public Guardian should be to maintain public registers of all those authorised to take decisions on behalf of an incapable adult and to supervise and monitor the performance of financial guardians;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The recognition of continuing and welfare powers of attorney and the introduction of public scrutiny of the exercise of such powers;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The creation of a new concept of guardianship to provide for a broad and flexible system of one-off intervention orders and longer term guardianship, with appropriate welfare or financial powers as ordered by the court; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That key decisions on applications, and in other proceedings under the proposed legislation, should be dealt with in the sheriff courts.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="81216w01.html_para4">There are a small number of areas where we propose to vary the SLC's recommendations.
<P>

<a name="81216w01.html_para5">We propose to modify the SLC scheme for carers in domestic settings to have access to funds from the bank accounts of incapable adults, in order to meet daily living expenses. Under the revised scheme, the Public Guardian would grant authority to have stipulated payments made for a time limited period from the incapable adult's 



<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 1998 : Column: 515</I><P>
account to a designated account. The Public Guardian would have powers to check that the incapable adult's funds were being applied for the intended purpose.
<P>

<a name="81216w01.html_para6">We propose to modify the SLC recommendations that residential homes should apply to the Public Guardian for authority to manage residents' finances. Under the revised proposals, registration and inspection authorities in local authorities and Health Boards would authorise the managers of residential establishments to manage the funds of residents who are incapable of so doing, up to prescribed limits, and in circumstances where no other arrangements would be appropriate for managing the finances of these residents.
<P>

<a name="81216w01.html_para7">We do not propose to follow the SLC recommendation that the Public Guardian should be able to be appointed as financial guardian to an incapable adult. We take the view, however, that the arrangements recommended for withdrawals from bank accounts and for intervention orders, and also for management of finances by residential establishments, should be sufficient to meet the needs of incapable adults with modest estates. The Public Guardian's functions will be focused on maintaining public registers of guardians and monitoring and supervising guardians with financial powers. Local authorities and the Mental Welfare Commission will monitor those exercising welfare powers on behalf of incapable adults.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what categories of data are used in gathering information concerning export surveys from Northern Ireland; how the data are collected; and what part the NIERC plays in the gathering of such information.  [63962]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Export data for the UK as a whole are gathered by HM Customs and Excise. However, due to the limitations of this data at regional level, the Department of Economic Development and the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland jointly commission the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre (NIERC) to undertake a bespoke annual survey of Northern Ireland sales and exports. NIERC designs the survey questionnaire, collects and analyses the data and assists with the preparation of the survey report for publication.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 A detailed academic report was produced on the first export survey published in 1992 (in respect of 1990 data). Subsequent export survey reports have been produced within a tighter timetable with the objective of giving a snapshot of key export information. Additional information is available on request including the retrospective analysis referred to in the question.

 The Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland (IDB) the arm of DED responsible for inward investment, examines among other issues Northern Ireland's performance in the inward investment market relative to competitors. IDB has not directly purchased or commissioned any study into Northern Ireland's competitive advantage in attracting inward investment. However, a report prepared by Price Waterhouse Coopers in 1996 into Northern Ireland's investment performance compared with the UK and Republic of Ireland makes comment on Northern Ireland's competitive advantages.

 The Department of Economic Development does not have any results from the Annual Census of Production (now referred to as the Annual Business Inquiry) below NI level.

 Two unclassified documents, both containing references to depleted uranium (DU), are known to have been removed without authorisation from the MOD's Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) last month and have since received some publicity. The investigation into their removal is now a matter for the Ministry of Defence Police. In view of the considerable public concern raised by misinformed media reporting of the contents of these two documents, I am today formally releasing both of them and placing copies in the Library of the House.

 <i>[holding answer 8 December 1998]:</i> Any Gulf veteran who is concerned that his or her health has been adversely affected by Service during the Gulf conflict, including possible exposure to depleted uranium (DU), is advised to seek a referral to the Ministry of Defence's Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) for a full medical assessment. During this assessment, MAP patients are asked by the examining MAP physician to provide detailed information about possible factors, including DU, to which they may have been exposed during the Gulf conflict.
<P>

<a name="81216w03.html_para1">The kidneys are the organs most likely to be affected by the presence of uranium and the standard battery of tests carried out as a matter of routine on MAP patients includes a baseline trawl of renal function, which in turn includes serum creatinine, urea and electrolytes, a urine test for protein and blood and an ultrasound abdominal scan. Such tests should indicate the presence of any kidney damage in patients, although such damage would not necessarily have been caused by the presence of DU. The standard MAP tests do not, however, currently include a specific test to detect the presence of DU. The veterans who have so far been examined by MAP physicians have not exhibited symptoms which, in the clinical judgment of the examining physician, have indicated a requirement for a specific referral to another agency or organisation for DU testing. If the examining physician at the MAP considered it clinically appropriate for a patient to be tested for the presence of uranium, the necessary arrangements would be made.

However, this is only one of a number of factors which have been suggested as causes of Gulf veterans' illnesses and, pending further medical and scientific evidence, my Department is keeping an open mind on this issue.

 Plastic baton rounds provide a more effective means of combating physical violence than the rubber bullets they replaced. The increased accuracy of plastic baton rounds also reduces the risk of accidental injury.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how much has been spent by each nation in the EU in each of the last 10 years in pounds sterling on defence <i>(a)</i> in total and <i>(b)</i> per head of the population.  [64195]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The information requested for calendar years 1987 to 1997 is shown for NATO members of the European Union. Comparisons of defence spending between nations are conventionally given in US Dollars rather than pounds sterling. Figures for calendar years 1987 to 1995 are those which have been published in successive versions of the Statement on the Defence Estimates (SDE). Figures for 1996 are based on information drawn from NATO sources and those for 1997 are as published in the MOD Performance Report 1997-98 (Cm4170).
<P>

<a name="81216w04.html_para0">Where possible the figures are published against a common definition of defence spending so that true comparisons can be made. Some anomalies and inconsistencies will, however, remain. Particular care is needed in making year on year comparisons of the figures for the UK where there have been changes in the definition of defence spending in recent years and major transfers of responsibility to and from other Government Departments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The Defence Military Assistance Fund is a cash fund, which is available to subsidise the cost of overseas military assistance in support of the Defence Diplomacy and Support to Wider British Interests Missions. The latter mission includes support to defence sales. Assistance may include the provision of training (either in country or in the UK), advice (by either military or civilian personnel), Loan Service Personnel and Short Term Training Teams.
<P>

<a name="81216w04.html_para7">The table breaks down expenditure, by country, under the Defence Military Assistance Fund for each of the last three years. This breakdown covers centrally administered programmes only, and does not include military assistance activities funded by Top Level Budget Holders, since these costs cannot be identified separately. Nor does it cover costs borne by other Government Departments, which are a matter for the Departments concerned.

<P>
<a name="81216w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The Defence Diplomacy Mission is funded either by those Top Level Budget Holders responsible for specific activities or from the Defence Military Assistance Fund (DMAF). Figures on the former are not separately identified. The DMAF budget for 1998-99 is some &#163;11 million, of which about &#163;7 million is allocated to activities which now fall within the Defence Diplomacy Mission.
<P>

<a name="81216w05.html_para0">The increases we intend to make to the DMAF of around &#163;5 million next year and up to &#163;15 million in the two subsequent years, will also be used largely for Defence Diplomacy-related activities.

 The principal Christmas entertainment provided for troops in Bosnia this year was a Combined Services Entertainment show which ran from 27 November to 4 December. It played at all major sites and all troops had the opportunity to see it. In addition to this, the British Forces Broadcasting Service will be broadcasting Christmas messages and conducting a radio link with families. There will also be a Christmas delivery of library books and the Service Sound and Vision Corporation are donating videos.
<P>

<a name="81216w05.html_para1">Units will also be arranging their own activities such as Christmas lunches and carol services. In addition, all troops will be given extra telephone time free of charge over the holiday period.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The accidental explosion at a chemical factory in Bhopal, India in 1984 provided a large amount of information on the dangers in the storage of very large quantities of toxic chemicals, and on the possible consequences of the destruction, by accident or otherwise, of such storage facilities.
<P>

<a name="81216w05.html_para4">We advise caution, however, before this information is directly applied to other scenarios.

 Since 2 May 1997 I have received over 3,500 letters on this subject, the large majority of which were opposed to lowering the age of consent for homosexual acts to 16 years.

<P>
<a name="81216w05.html_spmin5"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 I am not prepared to speculate about the possibility of military action or its possible consequences. The statement on 12 November by the Damascus Declaration countries made clear that the Arab world holds Saddam Hussein responsible for the consequences of his actions and the Gulf Co-operation Council summit earlier this month reinforced the message that the Government of Iraq were responsible for the suffering of the Iraqi people. The Iraqi people would no doubt express similar views, if they were allowed to do so.

<a name="81216w05.html_spmin6"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 UNSCOM is mandated under United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 to ensure that Iraq gives up its weapons of mass destruction (WMD). With full co-operation from Iraq, UNSCOM's work could have been completed very quickly. Instead, Iraq has chosen to attempt to retain its WMD capability at all costs. Its behaviour towards UNSCOM has been marked by persistent duplicity, evasion and confrontation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w05.html_spmin8"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 I am satisfied that UNSCOM would not have requested these documents without good grounds to believe they existed. I will not speculate on when and if military action will be necessary. I have made clear that I am watching Iraq's behaviour closely against a range of criteria. Iraq's response to UNSCOM's requested for documents is not a good start.

To ask the Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the observations by Mr. Denis Halliday, the UN's former humanitarian co-ordinator, in Middle East International on 13 November, concerning the deaths of children as a result of the UN sanctions against Iraq.  [62668]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w05.html_spmin9"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Like Mr. Halliday, we deeply regret the suffering of the Iraqi people and we agree with him that it is unfortunate that the UN has been obliged to sustain a sanctions regime against Iraq for so long. But we reject claims that the Iraqi people are suffering because of sanctions.
<P>

<a name="81216w05.html_para5">The international community has done all it can to protect the Iraqi people from the effects of sanctions. It is the Iraqi Government, by consistently seeking to thwart these efforts in an attempt to bring pressure for sanctions to be lifted before it has complied with its obligations, who bear responsibility for the suffering of the Iraqi people. The latest report by the UN Special Rapporteur Mr. Max van der Stoel into the human rights situation in Iraq also holds Iraq primarily responsible for the precarious food and health situation in Iraq.

 My Department does not provide any specific assistance to local housing authorities to enable them to allocate tenancies in self-contained accommodation to 16 to 18-year-olds.
<P>

<a name="81216w06.html_para4">The Housing Act 1996 requires authorities to allocate social housing on the basis of housing need. A person aged 16 to 18 with dependent children would have to be given priority under an authority's allocation scheme. However, it is the practice of many local authorities to include under 18-year-olds on their housing registers only if the social services authority supports the application or if an adult is prepared to act as a guarantor for any tenancy allocated to the young person. 16 to 18 year olds who are unintentionally homeless and considered vulnerable for the purpose of the homelessness legislation are also required to be given priority under an allocation scheme. My Department's Code of Guidance on the Allocation of Housing and Homelessness, which is currently being revised, provides general guidance to authorities on these matters.

<a name="81216w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Staffing levels are primarily determined by the appeals workload. The staffing complement as at 1 April 1998, which has generally been retained for the financial year commencing 1 April 1999, is for 180 staff. Continuing reductions towards that level are dependent on local decisions by the valuation tribunals and their staff. The staffing complement from 1 April 2000 will need to take account of estimates of the number of appeals likely to arise from the non-domestic revaluation in that year.
<P>

<a name="81216w06.html_para5">The longer term aim is to move to a structure of 14 administrative units to serve valuation tribunals in England, with one or at most two offices per unit. Progress by the stated dates will depend on discussions with the individual valuation tribunals in each of the administrative units. We expect there to be at most 32 offices by 1 April 1999. It is impossible to be precise about the figure on 1 April 2000, because this will depend on progress locally, but it will probably number 30 or less.

 As indicated in the policy statement, "Planning for the Communities of the Future" (Cmnd 3885) we need to provide enough housing to help meet the housing objective of offering everyone the opportunity of a decent home and so promote social cohesion, well-being and self-dependence. Achieving sustainable development means addressing economic, social and environmental objectives equally, both for present and future generations. The Government's objective is to provide sustainable solutions which will help ensure that new housing will, by its nature and location, enhance the quality of the environment. The household projections are the starting point for assessing housing requirements and local authorities will need to be realistic in the assumptions that they make about the number of households likely to form and how they should be accommodated.

In considering the broad distribution of housing within the region the South West Regional Planning Conference is also expected to have regard to the Government's policy for urban regeneration, transport and sustainable development and to the Regional Development Agency's regional economic strategy.

Therefore, where development plans are being

<a name="81216w08.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We announced our intention to legislate for a statutory minimum concessionary fare scheme for pensioners in our White Paper "A New Deal for Transport", the minimum scheme will entail half fares, on purchase of a &#163;5 annual bus pass. Meanwhile, decisions on concessionary fare schemes will remain for individual local authorities. I have no plans to issue guidance to them, but I should, of course, be glad if those authorities who at present offer less generous schemes were to implement the proposed minimum in advance of legislation.

<a name="81216w08.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 None. The provisions of the Health and Safety (First Aid) Regulations 1981 (HSFAR), a relevant statutory provision of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act, 1974, which apply to train operating companies, require employers to provide access to adequate first aid facilities for their employees in the workplace. All trains must therefore be fitted with first aid equipment which on modern trains is located in the drivers cab and on older trains in the guards van.




<P>

<a name="81216w08.html_para3">There is no legislation which requires train operating companies to provide first aid equipment for use by the public.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Government would be most concerned if a casual link was established between congenital anomalies and hazardous waste landfill sites. The study reported in <i>The Lancet</i> did not establish cause and effect, but concluded that there was a need for further study. The commentary in <i>The Lancet</i> on the study pointed out that the lack of adequate exposure information made the present results difficult to interpret.
<P>

<a name="81216w08.html_para4">My Department has nevertheless been looking at the results of the study very carefully with the Department of Health and the Environment Agency. The Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) at Imperial College has been commissioned by the Government to carry out a substantial survey of health effects around landfill sites, including congenital malformations. This work will take at least two years to complete. In addition, my Department and the Department of Health have asked the Institute for Environment and Health (IEH) to arrange a one-day meeting of invited experts to discuss <i>The Lancet</i> report, to identify gaps in the knowledge base and to explore priorities for future Government research. We anticipate that a range of expertise will be represented at the meeting including environmental epidemiology, reproductive toxicology, landfill technology and exposure assessment.

 We have published The Town and Country Planning (Playing Fields)(England) Direction 1998 which is one of the key measures in a co-ordinated approach between my Department, the Department of Education and Employment, and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to stop the loss of playing fields. The Direction requires local planning authorities to notify my Department of planning applications where they wish to grant planning permission, but where the English Sports Council advises against the development, because there is, or the development would result in, a deficiency in playing field provision for schools or the wider community in the area.
<P>

<a name="81216w09.html_para0">This Direction applies to local authority-owned playing fields and all others which are currently used, or which have been used in the past five years, by educational institutions. The effect of the Direction will be to give the Secretary of State the opportunity to decide whether to call-in a notified planning applications for his own determination, or leave the matter for the local planning authority to decide. Taken together with measures by the Department for Education and Employment to limit the sale of playing fields, these new controls will help to ensure that playing fields which schools and local communities need are not lost for ever.

 The section 180 (formerly section 73) grant programme run by my Department provides grants to voluntary sector organisations concerned with homelessness. The grants are provided on a tapered basis, initially for up to three years to allow organisations to set up new projects to prevent and tackle single homelessness. All organisations are made aware of the tapered and time-limited nature of the grant when they apply, and are expected to have a fund-raising strategy in place to secure the continuation of the project. This approach allows more new projects around the country to benefit from grants than would otherwise be possible. The taper has been applied flexibly and many organisations have benefited from grant for periods well in excess of three years. This year 79 of the 205 projects in receipt of grant have been funded for between four and eight years. All aspects of project performance are considered when deciding whether funding should be offered beyond the usual three year period.

<a name="81216w10.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 I am today announcing that 28 applicants demonstrated that they suffered extreme and exceptional hardship as a result of past CTRL blight and will be receiving &#163;10,000 each. This is an <i>ex gratia</i> scheme which is additional to normal compensation arrangements for those directly affected by the CTRL. The scheme originated from a finding of maladministration against the then Department of Transport by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what proposals he has to allow the University for Industry to be a direct provider of further education and higher education courses; and if resources for such provision will come directly from FEFC and HEFC budgets.  [61826]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 The University for Industry will be launched nationally in the year 2000. There are no plans for UfI to be a direct learning provider but will rather act as a broker of learning opportunities. We expect the further and higher education sectors to make a major contribution to the UfI as a key part of the strategy to embed the Lifelong Learning culture.
<P>

<a name="81216w10.html_para0">It will be open to the Higher Education Funding Council England (HEFCE) and the Further Education Funding Council (FEFC) to allocate places with accompanying funding to enable institutions to develop joint provision of learning opportunities with the UfI.

<a name="81216w10.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 In 1996-97, in maintained secondary schools in England that had pupils in years 10 and 11, full-time teachers spent an average of 28 per cent. of the school week teaching years 10 and 11 in subjects which can be tested at GCSE, although not all such

<P>

<a name="81216w10.html_para2">The Government continue to keep training for unemployed adults under review and is testing new ways in which training can be delivered in the future.

 The Government's policies on widening participation and increasing access are intended to be inclusive and to benefit students with learning difficulties and/or disabilities as well as others.
<P>

<a name="81216w11.html_para0">The Secretary of State has asked the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) when allocating funds to institutions to take into account the additional costs of providing learning support for students with learning difficulties and disabilities and to monitor the provision made by institutions for disabled students. This was made clear in the grant letter of 8 December to HEFCE. Under the new higher education student support arrangements for 1998-99, Disabled Students' Allowances will no longer be means tested for disabled full time students and the amount students may claim has been increased.

 The Government recognise that music is a key part of the broad and balanced education to which every child is entitled. Music is a foundation subject in the National Curriculum, which every child must study from the ages of 5 to 14, and it will maintain its key place in the curriculum. We also recognise the important contribution made by LEA music services; that is why we proposed new arrangements to safeguard them in our "Fair Funding" consultation document. We will be making a further announcement on this matter early in the new year.

 The importance of improving the standard of facilities and equipment in accident and emergency departments has been recognised by the Government. As a result, &#163;30 million from next year's Modernisation Fund for Capital has been earmarked for investment in accident and emergency departments of which &#163;4.367 million has been allocated to London. These resources will be used to provide faster, better services for patients and a safer working environment for staff. Funds will be allocated across a range of schemes. Many factors will be taken into consideration in deciding which should have the greatest need for investment including, where applicable, the level of activity of accident and emergency departments.

In advance of its report, the Committee has advised Ministers that the use as growth promoters of antimicrobials where there is a medical equivalent in current or planned use should be phased out at the earliest opportunity. For growth promoters where there is currently no medical equivalent or where medical use is rare, the advice was that there is currently insufficient information available to justify an immediate ban. The use of substances like avilamycin should therefore be kept under review and if any evidence becomes available of medical equivalents being developed then their use as growth promoters should be phased out.

<P><I>16 Dec 1998 : Column: 564</I><P>
Community Directive 93/104/EC on the organisation of working time. They set a maximum working time limit of 48 hours a week. Under the terms of the regulations, however, doctors can volunteer on an individual basis to work longer than 48 hours.
<P>

<a name="81216w14.html_para5">The Health Departments have agreed some derogations with the British Medical Association, as allowed under the regulations. These allow doctors and their employers to organise service cover flexibly to comply with the basic 48 hour limit, thereby maintaining high quality patient care around the clock.

<P>
<a name="81216w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Negotiations have began between officials and representatives of the British Medical Association on a new contract for consultants. We want to see robust arrangements in place to ensure that the undoubted energy and commitment of consultants is clearly focused on NHS service priorities and on improving the quality of patient care.
<P>

<a name="81216w14.html_para6">The vast majority of our consultants work hard for the NHS and more than fulfil their contractual commitments. We need a contract which ensures that their undoubted energies are focused clearly on delivering key service goals and priorities, providing patients with the high quality care that they need and expect, increasing productivity where it is needed most and cutting waiting lists.

There is evidence to suggest that pesticides have harmful effects on wildlife, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and on human health. The Government will evaluate the findings of the research project, and the results of other ongoing work, in considering how best to proceed. No decision has yet been taken on whether to proceed with a tax or charge on pesticides.

 <i>[holding answer 14 December 1998]:</i> The Government consider that information on environmental impacts should be presented alongside, and not separate from, information on economic and financial impacts. The Financial Statement and Budget Report released in March 1998 included, for the first time, an assessment of the environmental impact of those Budget measures which are expected to have a significant effect on the environment. An updated version of that assessment was given in the recent Pre-Budget Report. The Government are looking to build upon that approach in the future. Including an assessment of the environmental impact of Budget measures within Budget documentation reflects the Government's commitment to put the environment at the heart of the policy making.

<P>

<a name="81216w16.html_para0">The outline national changeover plan will set out the practical steps that would need to be followed if the UK were to decide to join the single currency and is the result of Treasury consultation with our 100 organisations, including trade associations and businesses.

<P>

<a name="81216w16.html_para2">This progress must be maintained. It is essential that all phase 1 cases are completed by 31 December. Although the industry has largely recognised the need for the pensions review to be completed quickly, some firms could still do better. The regulators will not tolerate further delays, and the Government will continue to support their efforts to see phase 1 completed and phase 2 underway.
<P>

<a name="81216w16.html_para3">The ABI's Pension Adviser's Support Scheme (PASS), which offers small firms assistance with actuarial facilities and financing for the review is a welcome development. All of the 30 major providers have joined PASS, which should prevent many businesses folding. It has aroused considerable interest among independent financial advisers, and will give a significant boost to the pensions review.

 With effect from today, the Swiss Exchange (SWX), having satisfied the conditions under sections 37 and 40 of the Financial Services Act 1986, has been granted recognition as an Overseas Investment Exchange. The Swiss Exchange is therefore able to carry out investment business in the UK.

 The DTI's Small Firm's Loan Guarantee Scheme already offers support to people with viable business proposals seeking finance but who lack the assets to offer as security against a conventional loan. By providing a guarantee against default the Scheme encourages lenders to lend where finance would not otherwise be available.

Any payments which a company makes to sponsor a university or college will qualify for a deduction when calculating the business's trading profits for tax purposes if the payment is a revenue payment made wholly and exclusively for trading purposes.

 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1998]:</i> Sheffield is working closely with the UK and English Sports Councils to work up a successful application for Lottery funding. To date a total of &#163;825,000 has been received from the Lottery Sports Fund by Phoenix Sports Limited, the company formed by the Sheffield Consortium which won the bid, to allow development work to progress. I have asked the Sports Councils to confirm by the end of December the extent and certainty of the matching funding put in place by Phoenix to take the project forward, to continue to exercise the closest control over payments while the project brief is developed, and to report on the final specification for the project in the light of their consultations with the sports which will use it.

<a name="81216w17.html_para2">Monitoring in the area of staff recruitment within DCMS is based on ethnic origin, not nationality. The nine categories monitored are based on those used in the 1991 census, which did not include an Irish category. This will be reviewed following any suggested changes for the 2001 Population Census.

Nevertheless, the Offshore Petroleum Production and Pipe-lines (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations 1998 require that the cumulative impact of any relevant project on the UKCS should be assessed before any decision about the granting of consent for that project is taken.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what was the average redundancy payment made to coal miners made redundant in each year from 1979-80 to 1997-98.  [63347]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Prior to 1987 redundancy payments to coal miners were made under the Government's Redundant Mineworkers' Payments Scheme. These payments comprised lump sums plus ongoing weekly benefit for those over a certain age who remained unemployed. It is therefore not possible to calculate meaningful average redundancy payments to coal miners made redundant over that period. From April 1987 British Coal Corporation became responsible for its industrial redundancy arrangements and this comprised a system of lump sum payments only. The following table sets out the average redundancy payment made by British Coal Corporation to redundant colliery industrial workers over the period 1987 to 1994. These figures are on a calendar year basis.

 I have no current plans to review the rules and regulations governing the granting of licences to credit reference agencies. However, I am pleased to announce that later this month I will publish a consultation paper on the changes in Regulations needed to put the supervision of rights of individuals and sole traders on access to their credit reference files unequivocally under the Data Protection Registrar. This replaces the dual supervision by the Director General of Fair Trading and the DPR which currently exists under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and the Data Protection Act 1984. It will complete the regulatory changes on this issue introduced in the Data Protection Act 1998. The change will also give sole traders the clear right to see their credit reference files, rather than the conditional right they currently have. The paper will also set out proposals for making clearer the statements of rights borrowers receive on correcting wrong information held on their files.

 <i>[holding answer 14 December 1998]:</i> The administration of the National Numbering Scheme is a matter for Oftel. Oftel has consulted extensively on changes to numbering arrangements. The National Numbering Scheme was established following public consultation. Oftel's proposals to change freephone numbers, in line with the Scheme, were the subject of a separate consultation earlier this year and conclusions have yet to be reached.
<P>

<a name="81216w20.html_para0">Demand for freephone numbers increased by over 50 per cent. in 1998, compared to 1997. Oftel believes that a change to freephone numbers is necessary as it will shortly run out of 0800 blocks of numbers.

<a name="81216w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Department has maintained a close dialogue with the aerospace industry concerning the support available for civil research which has been provided under the Department's Civil Aviation Research and Technology Demonstration (CARAD) Programme. Plans for the future promotion of research await decisions about detailed DTI budget allocations in future years.
<P>

<a name="81216w20.html_para3">Support has been provided by the Government for development of civil aerospace projects in the form of repayable risk-sharing investment known as Launch Investment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when he expects the backlog of claims to industrial tribunals in respect of pension rights for part-time workers to have been dealt with.  [64234]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 Progress on these pension cases has been stayed pending the outcome of a further referral to the European Court of Justice in January 1998. When the outcome of this referral is known, the cases will be processed in accordance with directions given by the Presidents of Employment Tribunals.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many industrial tribunal claims relating to part-time workers' pension rights have been initiated since the European Court of Justice decision of September 1994; and how many have been settled.  [64232]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 Following the judgment of the European Court of Justice in September 1994 approximately 42,000 cases have been registered claiming part-time worker pension rights. The pension cases are not identified separately in the records of the Employment Tribunals, therefore, information is not available on the number of cases that have been settled.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The Fairness at Work White Paper contained a proposal for an order making power enabling the Government to extend the coverage of employment legislation to categories of workers not currently covered. It also indicated that the Government would consult fully on specific changes before exercising this power. The position of the clergy is one of the matters to which consideration will be given during the course of this consultative process.

 With effect from 1 January 1999, recipients of Regional Selective Assistance (in Northern Ireland, Selective Financial Assistance) for internationally mobile investment will be given the option of having their grants denominated in euro where it is to the country's competitive advantage to do so. This will particularly help those companies which trade internationally and who may find it convenient to use the euro a common planning currency. It shows that the UK is well prepared for companies dealing in the euro and will help ensure that the UK remains the most favoured venue for foreign direct investment in the EU.

 South Africa is one of the countries most badly affected by HIV/AIDS. The rate of new infections is estimated at 1,500 per day and 2.5 million people are already infected. South Africa's leaders are beginning to take the issue seriously and support for AIDS control and preventions is a priority for our development partnership. But the challenge also requires regional action and we are discussing with governments, UNAIDS and the European Commission how to intensify our support for sexual and reproductive health to develop more effective national and regional programmes.

 We have recently published our strategy for improving the quality of EC development assistance. It has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. It was prepared in consultation with a wide range of interested bodies. The paper sets out 18 detailed objectives for the Department for International Development (DFID) for its partnership with the EC. The main focus is on: improving the poverty focus of the EC's programmes, in particular through forthcoming decisions on resource allocation; rationalising the Commission's organisation structure for managing external assistance, and strengthening staffing; improving aid management systems and harmonising and streamlining procedures to increase the developmental impact of the EC's programmes; and strengthening coordination and collaboration between the Commission, member states and other donors, within a framework managed by beneficiary countries.
<P>

<a name="81216w22.html_para0">DFID will work with other member states, the Commission. the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors in pursuit of these objectives. We are committed to maximising the effectiveness of the EC's work to promote international development. Our approach will, as

<P>
<a name="81216w22.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We are assisting programmes of good governance in Nepal and hope to do more in the future. Nepal's new democracy has led to increasing recognition of the need for fundamental reforms to bring about more effective government. The Government's plans for decentralisation may lead to improvements. We shall be looking at ways in which we can support this. We believe that Government and donors need to do more to empower the people to pursue their basic rights. The success of the national community forestry programme demonstrates that the right combination of legislative reform, administrative change and empowerment has great potential for changing the lives of the disadvantaged. This is part of DFlD's strategy which we recently published in the Nepal Country Strategy Paper, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House.

 I am in regular touch with churches and representatives of other faiths on this important issue. I addressed the General Synod of the Church of England on 18 November, and called for us to join forces to construct a world-wide alliance of world faiths for the elimination of poverty during the next century. In this speech I made plain the Government's support for faster and deeper debt relief in the right circumstances. But I also make it clear that debt relief was no "magic bullet" to end all poverty, as some campaigners appear to believe. Nor should debt relief be unconditional or unilateral. Not all poor countries need debt relief, and where it is needed it should go only to those countries which are committed to the eradication of poverty. This approach has been fully endorsed by church groups and NGOs.

 The Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) Technical Committee on Humanitarian Affairs met on 16 to 18 November 1998. An agreement on the operational standards for rail corridors and cross-line road corridors was signed by the Government of Sudan, the Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement and the UN. Further work is being undertaken to put this agreement into effect.

<a name="81216w22.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We are supporting the International LabourOrganisation's work aimed at producing a new International Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour which we hope will be agreed by all members of the ILO at the International Labour Conference in June 1999. This will cover forms of labour which enslave, corrupt, maim and kill children and young people under the age of 18.
<P>

<a name="81216w22.html_para3">We are also working with developing country governments and international organisations to help tackle the problem in practical ways because in many countries despite laws against child labour, children from very poor families--often female headed--work as a result of extreme poverty. Programmes are needed to enable their parents to work for a better income and to provide schooling for children. Examples include a project in Sialkot to provide social support for children leaving the football stitching industry. We are also discussing with ILO's International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour a possible programme on child labour in small-scale mining in Tanzania. Earlier this year we provided a grant of $1 million to IPEC to help take forward their programmes.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on her Department's humanitarian work in Kosovo.  [62771]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w23.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We have worked closely with international organisations, such as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), to ensure that the humanitarian needs of those affected by the conflict in Kosovo are met. We have so far provided &#163;3 million for this purpose.
<P>

<a name="81216w23.html_para0">A Department for International Development mission visited the Former Republic of Yugoslavia and Albania between 16-26 November to assess conditions on the ground and the state of aid co-ordination. A humanitarian disaster has been averted, but the situation remains serious and must be monitored carefully. The internally displaced persons who were living out of doors are now back under shelter. The international response is generally adequate to meet current emergency needs of displaced people and refugees for food, blankets, stoves, mattresses and fuels. It is vital that this current level of humanitarian operations be maintained.

 Finding safe and effective vaccines, microbicides that prevent sexual infection and low cost means to reduce mother to child transmission are vital elements of efforts to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS. The UK is supporting national and international initiatives to establish incentives for product discovery and product development in poor countries. Left to themselves, market forces will not develop products for the poorest countries. The UK is collaborating with the World Bank in exploring and devising market support mechanisms necessary for industry to engage in developing vaccines and other products of benefit to the poorer countries. This work is still in its early stages.

 We directly support maternal health projects and programmes in around 20 countries, mainly in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. A list will be placed in the Libraries of the House. It includes support for national safe motherhood programmes in Malawi and Nepal. It does not, however, include the maternal health work of multilateral organisations such as the World Health Organisation, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Population Fund, the European Community and the World Bank, or international civil society groups such as the International Planned Parenthood Federation, all of which receive substantial support from the UK's Department for International Development.

 In calendar year 1997, 3.6 per cent. of the UK overseas development assistance (&#163;73 million) was invested in reproductive health, excluding expenditure through the EC and the World Bank, which we are unable to dis-aggregate. We estimate that around 15 per cent. of this spend was invested directly in reducing the dangers of pregnancy and childbirth. But clearly our spending on improving basic healthcare systems also benefit material health. We are reforming the Department's management information system to track all spending in relation to the International Development Goals. This will include a dedicated marker for contributions to reduced maternal mortality.

 During the last financial year (1997-98), the Department for International Development (DFID) invested &#163;30 million in development cooperation with the Palestinians. This comprised &#163;16 million through DFID's direct programme in the West Bank and Gaza and contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees and &#163;14 million in contributions to the EC's programmes for assistance for the Palestinians. DFID expects to spend a similar amount this financial year. In addition, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department of Trade and Industry provided some small scale assistance totalling just over &#163;50,000.

The list for each applicant country covers the period since it formally applied for EU membership. Although careful efforts were made in compiling the lists to include all visits for which the FCO has records, it is possible some visits were made that are not reflected in the materials available to the FCO.

He has met all his opposite numbers and has hosted all but the most recently appointed Central European Foreign Ministers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w25.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Local child curfews are a permissive rather than a mandatory power. The decision to apply for a local child curfew scheme is one for an individual local authority. A curfew notice would be applied only where a local authority identifies a problem involving disruptive children and decides to intervene. The number of curfew notices imposed annually will therefore reflect the nature of youth crime problems as identified locally.
<P>

<a name="81216w25.html_para5">Local child curfews should be seen within the context of a general community safety strategy. The aim of such curfews is two fold. They will address the need to protect young children from being drawn into anti-social or criminal behaviour, and they will protect communities from the misery and distress which can be caused by groups of unsupervised children.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to include Irish as a category in his Department's ethnic monitoring of staff recruitment.  [63874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It is an overriding principle of Civil Service recruitment procedures that they should be fair and that selection should be on merit.
<P>

<a name="81216w26.html_para5">Monitoring in this area is based on ethnic origin and not nationality. The nine ethnic minority origin categories monitored by my Department are based on those used in the 1991 census which did not include Irish as a category. They will be reviewed in the light of any suggested changes for the 2001 Population Census.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Under section 30(c) of the Firearms Act 1968 (as amended), a shotgun certificate may be revoked by the chief officer of police for the area in which the holder resides if he is satisfied that the holder is prohibited by this Act from possessing a shotgun or cannot be permitted to possess a shotgun without danger to public safety or to the peace. The Home Office issued general guidance on this subject in the publication 'Firearms Law: Guidance to the Police' in 1989. A person aggrieved by a decision to revoke a certificate may appeal to the Crown Court against the police decision.

<P>
<a name="81216w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Government of Wales Act 1998 provided for a Transfer of Functions Order to be made to transfer Ministerial functions to the National Assembly for Wales. This Order was published in draft for consultation on 12 November. Until the content of the order has been finalised, it is not possible to state with certainty what functions and associated expenditure will transfer.

<P>
<a name="81216w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 This information is not available to the Home Office. The hon. Member should approach the local authority.
<P>

<a name="81216w26.html_para7">Illegal immigrants who do not claim asylum and who have no special needs are not eligible for support from public funds. Asylum seekers and other illegal immigrants (who are given temporary leave to enter) who are not otherwise detained and who are able to support themselves are free to live within the United Kingdom in a place of their own choosing. Asylum seekers who register their application for asylum at their port of entry may be eligible for Income Support and Housing Benefit and can then find their own accommodation. Asylum seekers who do not qualify for benefits but who may be supported under the terms of the National Assistance Act 1948 or the Children Act 1989 are supported by local authorities under the terms of that legislation. The Home Office currently has no role in providing support and is consequently not aware of the information sought. The Government plan a fundamental reform of the asylum and immigration laws to remove cash benefits and more strictly control where asylum seekers live.

 The available information relating to the numbers of persons detained solely under Immigration Act powers, as at 14 December 1998, who have been served with a notice of illegal entry is that: 140 of those persons had been issued with illegal entry papers by the South East Ports Surveillance Team based at Dover; 5 by immigration officers at Harwich; 5 at Portsmouth; and none at Newhaven. Information relating to the previous six months could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what are the limits on the information which the police can demand from service providers in respect of e-mail without the need to secure approval from him.  [63792]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Under the Interception of Communications Act 1985, e-mail in the course of its transmission over the public telecommunications network may be intercepted only under a warrant issued by the Secretary of State or for one of the limited purposes in section 1(2) or 1(3) of the Act. E-mail held by an Internet Service Provider is subject to data protection legislation and any conditions in the service provider's licence. It is open to the police to apply for a court order in order to obtain any e-mail retained by an Internet Service Provider.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the legislative framework relating to the interception of signals connecting <i>(a)</i> mobile phones, <i>(b)</i> pagers and <i>(c)</i> interactive cable TV services.  [63559]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w27.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Interception of Communications Act 1985 provides that communications may lawfully be intercepted in the course of their transmission by means of a public telecommunications system only in obedience to a warrant issued by the Secretary of State or in certain other circumstances specified in section 1(2) and (3) of the Act. This applies equally to mobile and fixed public telecommunications systems and to interactive cable TV services.
<P>

<a name="81216w27.html_para3">The question whether a communication is, at the point of interception, on the public or the private side of a telecommunications system is a point of fact which has received some measure of clarification by the Courts. I have announced the intention to legislate to bring so-called "private side interception" within the law on interception.
<P>

<a name="81216w27.html_para4">Pagers operate by wireless telegraphy and, as such, are covered by section 5 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949. This provides that it is an offence to use Wireless Telegraphy intending to obtain information about the contents of a message, its sender or the recipient, except under the authority of the Secretary of State or in the course of a person's duty as a servant of the Crown. As police officers are not, in law, servants of the Crown in England and Wales, police applications to intercept pagers in the course of criminal investigations are warranted by the my Department under my authority.

<P>
<a name="81216w27.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Schedule 5 refers to reserved matters. Work is in train to agree secondary legislation on the specification of cross-border public authorities. Until that work is completed, it is not possible to say how many people are employed in these offices or what specific equal opportunities practices are adopted. My Department is committed to a policy of equal opportunities for all staff, regardless of ethnic origin, religious belief, sex, sexual orientation, disability or any other irrelevant factor.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how much money is currently planned to be spent on the regeneration of coalfield communities in Wales.  [62619]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The needs of deprived areas, which include communities within former coalfields, of the South Wales Valleys and North East Wales, are taken into account in the various spending programmes of the Welsh Office. Specific programmes, directed to these areas to tackle social, economic and environmental regeneration, include nearly &#163;30 million in 1998-99 under Welsh Challenge and the Strategic Development Scheme; &#163;337,000 in 1998-2000 on the 4 of the 8 approved "People in Communities" pilots in these areas aimed at tackling; and nearly &#163;20 million by the WDA on reclaiming 370 hectares of land, the majority of which is in former coal mining areas. An estimated &#163;10 million of New Deal funding for Wales is expected to be spent in the Employment Service Districts covering Welsh coalfields areas in 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="81216w27.html_para5">The share for Wales of the recently announced endowment in lieu of the &#163;10 million surplus from the miners' pension fund will be used to fund further projects in former coalmining areas. The South Wales Valleys are part of the area of Wales which is set to gain Objective 1 status, bringing access to a substantial package of European aid.

of ruminant feed with meat and bonemeal incorporated into feed for other farm animals. There is, therefore, no basis on which it would be reasonable to restrict imports of pig meat or chicken. However, my hon. Friend may be aware that the Government have received undertakings from the major retailers that all own label fresh pork, bacon, ham and sausages sold in their supermarkets will come from meat and bonemeal (and stall and tether) free production systems.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w27.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 December 1998]:</i> Visits by Ministry personnel to intensive egg production units, as distinct from packing stations, are basically those undertaken by members of the State Veterinary Service in relation to animal welfare. 272 welfare visits have been undertaken since 1 May 1997. Of these, 44 per cent. were undertaken in response to complaints or other indications that welfare may be poor, and in many cases were unannounced.

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 1998]:</i> The provisions originally set out in these regulations are now included in Schedule 1 of the Welfare of Livestock Regulations 1994 (SI 2126). This Department has concluded two prosecutions under that Schedule since 1 May 1997. Records of prosecutions taken by other bodies such as local authorities and the RSPCA are not kept centrally.

 The Benefit Integrity Project (BIP) has been subject to continuous review and we have made changes based on an analysis of cases showing the rate of change in entitlement.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what were the arrears of child support payments owed by self-employed non-resident parents to children living in Wolverhampton on 30 September.  [63435]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81216w29.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We expect the Child Support Agency to provide a consistent, fair and efficient service to all its clients. We have set out proposals for radical reform in our Green Paper "Children First: a new approach to child support" (Cm3992).
<P>

<a name="81216w29.html_para0">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the Chief Executive, Mrs. Faith Boardman. She will write to my hon. Friend.
<P>

<a name="81216w29.html_para1"><i>Letter from Faith Boardman to Ms Jenny Jones, dated 15 December 1998:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about child support payments owed by self employed non-resident parents to children in Wolverhampton.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I cannot provide precisely all the information that you have requested, but have provided as much as possible from information available.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency has six front-line Business Units; each of these consists of a Child Support Agency Centre and associated field offices. Cases where the parent with care lives in Wolverhampton are dealt with by the Midlands Business Unit for which information has been provided.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At 30 September 1998 the amount of child support full maintenance assessment debt for the Midlands Business Unit was &#163;91,546,756. This can be broken down further to &#163;53,371,759(58.3%) collectable debt, &#163;35,611,688(38.9%) possibly uncollectable debt and &#163;2,563,309(2.8%) deferred debt. Deferred debt is where the Agency has deferred the debt indefinitely, provided non-resident parents meet certain conditions on payment of regular maintenance and any remaining debt. Where appropriate the parent with care will be compensated for the loss of this money.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To further increase the flow of maintenance and to help non-resident parents pay the arrears that they owe, wherever possible the Agency makes every effort to re-schedule debts; re-scheduled debts are those where the Agency has negotiated a closely monitored agreement with the non-resident parent to pay arrears by instalments. The amount of debt re-scheduled included in the &#163;91,546,756 at 30 September 1998 was &#163;69,513,784.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is not possible to say how much of this debt is owed by self employed non-resident parents, however I can tell you that 3.5% of the Midlands Business Unit's live and assessed caseload relate to cases where the non-resident parent is self employed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency acknowledges that cases where the non-resident parent is self employed can be more difficult to progress, especially where the non-resident parent does not wish to comply. The key to securing early compliance is by personal contact with our clients. By approaching clients at the initial stages of their assessment we aim to build a better relationship with them, address their concerns promptly and provide an improved level of service.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 1998 : Column: 615</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have increased resources for our Client Helplines and the National Enquiry Line, extended our hours of opening to cover 8.00am to 8.00pm Monday to Friday and 9.00am to 5.00pm on Saturdays and carried out trials to greatly improve and increase clients' opportunities to secure a face to face service.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Additionally we have recently completed a pilot study in the South Western Business Unit, looking at how best to process self employed cases. Trials using dedicated staff dealing exclusively with the self employed have shown a marked reduction in processing time and an increase in the collection of maintenance. We intend to have specific sections, supported by accountants where necessary, in each Business Unit by March 1999 to deal exclusively with self employed customers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Also, to assist us to trace the whereabouts of self employed non-resident parents, we are exploring the possibility of sharing information with other Agencies and Government Departments. We 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>16 Dec 1998 : Column: 616</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>have also revised staff training and raised staff awareness of the Agency's self employed powers, working practices and related issues.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If all voluntary methods to secure maintenance from a self employed non-resident parent fail, a liability order is applied for. It is hoped that the threat of such action will be enough to ensure compliance. The majority do agree to make an arrangement and only in a very small minority of cases is legal action actually taken.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We will use any and all enforcement methods legally available but we experience the same difficulties as other litigants in enforcing a civil debt. During 1997/98 we have been successful in registering debt by County Court Judgement in 522 cases. Where all other action has failed, the Agency has pursued cases for prosecution; between October 1997 and March 1998 a total of 15 suspended custodial sentences were imposed. A self employed non-resident parent was committed to prison as a result of non payment of maintenance.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I hope this reply is helpful.</FONT></UL>
