 The waste minimisation programme run by the Government-funded Waste Resource Action Programme (WRAP) is working to stem the growth of household waste.

DFID&#146;s approach to providing emergency assistance to these IDPs has been to use our comparative advantage (the fact that we have a small presence inside the country and a strong network of relationships with ethnic minority and other groups) to reach the IDPs using local community groups inside Burma. This is a complementary approach to the use of relief teams operating cross border from Thailand, and it enables access to IDPs who would not be reached by any other means, and through a mechanism which is much less well supported by other donors. The development of civil society within the country is also a fundamental step in a successful transition to democracy.</p>

Those delivering assistance to IDPs cross border from Thailand face similar challenges. Therefore we recognise the importance of maintaining co-ordination with all donors (both those delivering assistance cross border, and those working inside the country) to ensure that together we manage to reach as many IDPs as possible.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list contracts in excess of &#163;500,000 his Department has entered into in connection with Iraq since the beginning of 2003; on what date each was entered into; whether the civilian contractor in each contract had military connections; what the nationality of each civilian contractor was in each case; what each contract was for; whether each contract was awarded following competitive bidding; whether work was wholly carried out in Iraq; and what estimate he has made in each case of the comparable cost of similar work carried out in the UK.

 I will place three lists of contracts in the Library of the House. The first shows works contracted by the Multi-National Division (South-East) Civil Secretariat with total value in excess of &#163;500,000, and wholly carried out in Iraq, from 2003, detailing the company, service provided, and date each contract was entered into. Second are those contracts let by the Defence Communications Service Agency for and in support of British operations in Iraq. And third are those contracts placed for movement of freight or personnel by air or surface means, awarded following competition. Two of these contracts (DTMA/CB/0803 and DTMA/CB/0813) were let for air support entirely within Iraq/surrounding area. Two further contracts (DTMA/CB/0703 and DTMA/CB/0720) were let specifically for aeromedical tasks between Cyprus and the UK. The remaining movement contracts were placed for the transport of freight/personnel mainly between the UK/Europe and Iraq/Gulf States in support of Op TELIC. Comparable costing for these is inappropriate. Further details are not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

 The UK Missile Defence Centre was opened by the former Minister of State for Defence Procurement on 18 July 2003. It provides the primary technical interface between the UK and the US Governments in this area of research and development.

 The Royal Military Police (RMP) Special Investigations Branch (SIB) has a minimal interface with the general public in comparison to their civilian counterparts.

Improvements were proposed under the Armed Forces Bill which included a redress panel system where panels would include an external, independent member for certain types of complaints, and an external reviewer focusing on process, delay, fairness, and the effectiveness of the procedure, and providing recommendations for improvements where necessary. Further to the Deepcut Review, we plan to extend the role of the external reviewer, renamed the Service Complaints Commissioner, who would have statutory powers to receive a complaint or allegation from a service person, family or other third party, to place it in the hands of the chain of command and to be notified  <br>

 The legislation does not provide for the Government to make derogations. The home information pack regulations laid on 14 June 2006 allow for cases where despite all reasonable efforts, certain documents are unavailable or cannot be obtained. In such cases, marketing may begin without those documents. Where documents are temporarily unavailable, efforts to obtain the missing information must continue, with documents added to the pack as soon as they are available. The pack must also make clear what information is missing, why, and what steps are being taken to obtain it.</p>

 It is important that sellers and buyers should have reliable information about the condition of properties they are considering up front, particularly as this reduces significantly the risk of transaction failure, wasted costs, duplication and unexpected repair costs once the buyer has moved in. The Home Condition Report will bring transparency to the process and ensure that negotiations regarding sale price reflect the condition of the property.</p>

They also consulted in March 2003 on whether there should be special arrangements in such cases. The findings of the research and consultation showed that buyers, sellers and local property professionals felt that HIPs could help the functioning of the market in those areas, and that exempting particular properties or areas of properties could reduce demand and therefore prices even further.</p>

1. Long-run projections of the number and proportion of pensioners eligible for means tested benefits under the White Paper proposals are not available. 2. Projections of the number and proportion of pensioners eligible for pension credit are sensitive to modelling assumptions and to projected changes in the distribution of pensioner incomes.<br>
3. The estimates of proportions shown here are the mid-points of projections taken from two separate micro-simulation models. Modelling of the reform proposals does not include any increase in private saving from the introduction of personal accounts, which would further reduce the numbers eligible for pension credit.<br>
4. Projections of the number of pensioners eligible for pension credit are derived from the projected proportions eligible and projections of the number of pensioner households in Great Britain.<br>
5. These projections assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard guarantee credit; earnings uprating of the savings credit threshold from 2008 to 2014; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; price uprating of the maximum savings credit from 2015; measures to improve coverage of the basic state pension described in the White Paper.<br>
6. Estimates cover all those aged above women's state pension age in the private household population of Great Britain.<br>
7. Estimates account for equalisation of state pension age between 2010 and 2020. They also account for the proposed further increases in state pension age described in the White Paper. The estimates assume that the minimum age at which people can claim pension credit rises in line with women's state pension age.<br>
8. Estimates are calibrated to the mid-points of the 2004-05 National Statistics range estimates of non-eligibility to pension credit, which adjust 2004-05 family resources survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting. Although the estimates here are not presented as ranges, they are subject to a margin of uncertainty.<br>
9. Estimates of the number of pensioner households eligible are rounded to the nearest 50,000.<br>

 The committee on the medical effects of air pollutants (COMEAP) has recently published a report on air pollution and cardiovascular disease. This report focuses on particulate matter and, in so far as the available data permit, on particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometres or smaller in size (PM2.5). The comprehensive report can be found on COMEAP&#146;s website at www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/. No recent assessment of effects of PM2.5 on the respiratory system has been made. This will be addressed during COMEAP&#146;s work on the quantification of effects of air pollutants on health. Work so far has focused on PM2.5 and effects on mortality. It seems that the majority of the effects reported in the literature reflect the effect of particles on the cardiovascular system.</p>

Does not include any contribution to combined budgets or fees for pupils at independent schools for pupils without SEN.<br>
2. The ISB for special schools will include some general education costs for pupils with SEN in addition to those costs specifically for SEN while the figures recorded against "notional SEN" are only indicative of the amount that might by spent by schools on SEN. From 2004-05 onwards "notional SEN" delegated to nursery schools was reported on Section 52 for the first time and accounts for &#163;0.5 million, &#163;0.6 million and &#163;0.6 million of the 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07 totals respectively. In 2005-06 and 2006-07, Bristol LA also budgeted &#163;3.7 million and &#163;5.3 million for SEN transport expenditure but this is not included in the above table as figures are not available prior to 2005-06.<br>
3. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;1,000.<br>
4. 2006-07 data is provisional and is therefore subject to change by the local authority.<br>

 The Department has not commissioned Edison Schools UK, nor has it made an assessment of the role Edison is playing, to help local authorities meet their duties in regard to special educational needs (SEN). Local authorities have duties to identify, assess and arrange suitable provision for children with SEN and to keep their arrangements for special educational provision under review. Local authorities can buy in consultancy advice to help them with their special needs duties, as can schools, including special schools. The Department does not record how much local authorities have spent commissioning Edison nor what, if any, of this has been spent on SEN consultancy. Through programmed annual performance assessments and periodic joint area reviews of children's services, Ofsted and other inspectorates inspect how local authorities meet their duties, including any arrangements they make with private or voluntary sector organisations.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 26 June 2006]:</i> The Department does not collect this data. However all schools including specialist schools are bound by the limitations set within the School Admissions Code of Practice. Relatively few such schools select in this way. When the Department last collected such data in summer 2001, only 45 schools or 6.5 per cent. of those that were specialist at the time did so.</p>

 Funding for Building Schools for the Future is allocated formulaically, based on pupil numbers and our area guidelines for secondary schools, published in &#145;Building Bulletin 98&#146;. Within &#145;Building Bulletin 98&#146; swimming pools are considered to be a &#145;supplementary area&#146;&#151;in other words they are not part of the core school facilities which we fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_498"><a name="60628w0022.htm_para0"><a name="06062910003918">While Building Schools for the Future funding allocations do not include money for new swimming pools, we do allow existing pools to be refurbished within the programme. It is for each local authority to decide how to make the best use of its overall Building Schools for the Future funding allocation across the schools in a particular project and the scope of works at each school. A decision could be taken locally to put some of the available funding towards a swimming pool instead of the second of the two PE spaces allowed for in our guidelines, but only if the resulting provision satisfies the school&#146;s PE curriculum as well or better than the standard provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_499"><a name="60628w0022.htm_para1"><a name="06062910003919">There is also the option of exploring other sources of funding to supplement that from Building Schools for the Future. In order to help facilitate that locally the Department has produced guidance on joining-up funding in the context of Building Schools for the Future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_501"><a name="60628w0024.htm_para0"><a name="06062910004421">Research by the National Foundation for Education Research (NFER) conducted during 2005 and published by the Department in January 2006 indicated that 92 per cent. of all teachers teaching science were science specialists with 44 per cent. holding a biology specialism, 25 per cent. holding a chemistry specialism, 19 per cent. a physics specialism and 5 per cent. a specialism in another science. An estimated 2 per cent. of teachers teaching science did not hold a post A-level qualification in science. In addition, the research estimated that 76 per cent. of teachers teaching maths were maths specialists. An estimated 14 per cent. held no post A-level qualification in maths. For both maths and science, the research suggested that specialists deliver a greater proportion of the curriculum time than their relative size within the work force would suggest. For example, although only 10 per cent. of teachers teaching science at Key Stage 4 hold a degree  <br>

 The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has issued 8.9 million disclosures since its launch in March 2002 to 31 March 2006. In that time, there have been 2,273 occasions where disclosure applicant details were matched by the CRB to a person with the same or very similar details who has a criminal record and, where the details had been challenged by the applicant, their dispute was subsequently upheld.

As with the police, when making their decision they must bear in mind that the source of much of the information recorded on the police national computer (PNC) database is provided by the individual concerned at the time of his or her arrest. CRB have to consider that the individual may deliberately choose to give or, in the heat of the moment, may be confused and give incomplete or incorrect information. The CRB is acutely aware of the human consequences of making an incorrect matching decision and does not do so lightly.</p>

It is for these reasons that the CRB must err on the side of caution when an individual has the same or very similar personal details to those of someone who has a criminal record. This is because it is better to be safe than run the risk of letting an inappropriate person through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_524"><a name="60628w0025.htm_para19"><a name="06062910004693">When a disclosure is disputed the only safe way to resolve the situation is by asking the applicant to have his or her fingerprints taken at a local police station to help either confirm or overturn the original matching decision.

 I have asked law enforcement authorities to work together to assess the impact of accession on the UK&#146;s crime and law enforcement and to take necessary mitigating action. Cooperation on law enforcement is a key part of the UK&#146;s relationship with Bulgaria and Romania. We continually engage with Bulgarian and Romanian law enforcement officials. The Commission Monitoring Report of 16 May recognised recent progress in tackling organised crime but highlighted the need for further action in preparation for accession. In our contacts with the Bulgarian and Romanian Governments we have repeatedly stressed the need to address the concerns of the Commission. We are also providing some capacity building support to the Bulgarian and Romanian law enforcement authorities.</p>

 The proposed merger of police forces into new strategic forces addresses an identified weakness in current provision and is intended to strengthen forces&#146; ability to deliver protective services to the public. No decision has yet been made in respect of forces in SW England including Gloucestershire. Decisions about future posts will be for the new strategic forces management teams to determine.
