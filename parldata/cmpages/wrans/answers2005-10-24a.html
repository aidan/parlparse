 Copies of the code were made available to all local authorities at the time of publication in July last year. The code provides advice for large scale land managers on how to develop a strategic approach to ragwort control. Feedback that we have had from a number of local councils during this summer indicates they are taking seriously the provisions of the code and the need to control ragwort where it poses a threat to animal welfare. Where Defra receives concerns about ragwort spreading from local authority land to land used for grazing animals or the production of conserved forage, we investigate the complaint in accordance with our enforcement procedures under the Weeds Act.

 The Essex and Thurrock coroner has explained the reasons for delay in holding this inquest. Following the death by hanging of Marcus Downie on 11 May 2002 in HMP Chelmsford there was a police investigation and an internal Prison Service inquiry. At the pre-inquest hearing in May 2003 the family&#039;s representatives made several requests for further information, including expert psychiatric evidence. A date in September 2003 was provisionally booked for the inquest, but the coroner decided to await the House of Lords judgments in two relevant cases, Middleton and Sacker which were delivered in March 2004. Staff shortages in the coroner&#039;s office prevented progress during the summer and autumn of 2004 but a further pre-inquest hearing was held on in January 2005 and, after difficulties in finding a suitable courtroom for a lengthy jury inquest, it was held between 3 and 12 October 2005.

<p><a name="st_57"><a name="51024w05.html_spnew1"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 Within the English regions, there are large regional variations in the take up of incapacity benefit (IB) with 11.2 per cent. of the working age population claiming IB in the North East compared to 4.6 per cent. in the South East. The three northern regions (North East, North West, Yorkshire and Humberside) account for over 860,000 claimants, almost 40 per cent. of the English total, yet their working age population account for just 28 per cent. of the English total. Wales and Scotland also have high proportions of their working age population on incapacity benefit.

<a name="stpa_31">Employment is seen as a key driver in this target and supporting incapacity benefit claimants into work is essential in reducing the employment disparities between the regions.

By October 2006, 11 of the 15 English Pathways will be operational in the three northern regions. In addition to this, the Northern Way will run complementary IB pilots and the first of these is due to start on 7 November 2005 in the district of Easington, which has one of the highest rates of IB claimants at 19.7 per cent. (in 2004). By October 2006 the number of Pathways to Work pilots will increase to four in Wales and three in Scotland.

 The precise location of future development in the Thames Gateway during the course of the regeneration programme will be dependent on a number of factors: the land allocated in local development frameworks, the sites attracting planning applications, the success of those applications and their ability to satisfy national planning policy intentions. Exact proportions cannot be predetermined.

<a name="51024w05.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_34">As to the proportions of development on flood plains, flood risk assessments indicating whether it would be appropriate to develop on a site are determining factors in the eventual location of development. All development will be in line with Planning Policy Guidance note: Development and Flood Risk (PPG25), which applies a sequential risk-based approach to prevent inappropriate development in flood risk areas. To support the effective application of planning policy, the Office of the Deputy Minister is funding Strategic Flood Risk Assessments across the Thames Gateway to assess flood risk and inform planning decisions. PPG25 advises that applications for development in flood risk areas should be accompanied by a flood risk assessment appropriate to the location, scale and nature of the development which identifies the risks of flooding to and from the development, measures to be taken to reduce those risks and how any residual risk will be managed.

 In responding to famine, the Department for International Development (DFID) provides funding to the World Food Programme (&#163;78 million in 2004, including approx &#163;15 million through the European Community), Governments and non-governmental organisations. However, DFID also attaches considerable importance to disaster prevention. In the area of food security this includes supporting reforms in agricultural methods and promoting livelihoods that are less susceptible to the effects of famine, by working with partner governments, local communities and multilateral agencies including the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. DFID is also supporting the creation of social safety nets such as income support and social insurance, bans and grants. These aim to limit the numbers of people who require emergency food aid.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51024w07.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_46">DFID&#039;s approach to tackling disease epidemics in the developed world is to balance prevention with reducing the impact of epidemics when they do occur.

<p><a name="st_74"><a name="51024w07.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Malawi has an early warning system, the Malawi Vulnerability System Committee (MVAC). DFID finances the secretariat. The MVAC made its first assessment of the need for humanitarian assistance as soon as harvest and other data was available and reported in May. By June, food aid was being delivered. 1.8 million people have received food aid to date; it is planned to feed 2.8 million by December. The MVAC is updating its assessment and will provide a preliminary revision next week, with a full reassessment by early November. DFID&#039;s commitment to humanitarian assistance for this year&#039;s food shortages in Malawi totals &#163;15.32 million. The UK stands ready to do more if more people need to be fed.

<a name="stpa_48">In Niger, a major humanitarian relief operation has been under way over the past three months in response to a food crisis affecting an estimated three million people, with the lives of up to 150,000 children at risk. The humanitarian operation is now working at full capacity and has helped to avert a major catastrophe. The UK has played an important part, being one of the first donors to respond when the United Nations and NGO relief agencies alerted the world to the severity of the crisis. To date, around 2.8 million people have received food aid and more than 90,000 children have received life-saving nutritional therapy. Food is also under harvest, and thanks to good rains, a bumper crop is expected. Nonetheless, the relief effort will continue in the months ahead, with priority being given to the needs of malnourished children and to those who will not benefit fully or adequately from the new harvest. Much work also remains to help those who have suffered during the crisis to recover, and in the longer term to put in place welfare safety nets and other measures to help the most impoverished people of Niger avoid further crises of this kind. DFID sent a humanitarian adviser to Niger last June, to neighbouring countries in August, and to Niger again this month. On the basis of his report, we shall be reviewing needs, and options to provide humanitarian assistance to the recovery process.

<p><a name="st_76"><a name="51024w07.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Thomas  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 21 October 2005]:</i> Poverty, both rural and urban, is pervasive in Nicaragua. While the figure for rural poverty in the Atlantic coast is higher than the rural average (77 per cent. compared to 64 per cent.) there are many other regions in the country displaying similar, or worse poverty indicators. Less than 20 per cent. of Nicaragua&#039;s poor live in the Atlantic coast. DFID, therefore, makes decisions on the extent and nature of its support on the basis of the Government&#039;s commitment to tackle poverty throughout the country rather than in just one part.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51024w07.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_52">DFID does, however, recognise the particular challenges of the Atlantic coast. We seek to tackle these through a combination of direct support to the area and through high-level dialogue with the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51024w07.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_53">A significant proportion of DFID&#039;s programme directly benefits Nicaragua&#039;s Atlantic coast. Our HIV/AIDS programme has provided information and education services for specific vulnerable target groups, and has built capacity among local government and civil society to provide basic care for people living with HIV/AIDS. Part of the &#163;850,000 of support in 2005&#150;06 to help municipal Government initiatives tackle poverty will benefit the autonomous regions on the coast. We have helped to increase visibility of the region&#039;s challenges, and its potential contribution to development, by supporting the participation of Afro-descendent youth in debates on marginalisation and the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Oct 2005 : Column 33W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
dissemination of the United Nations development programme (UNDP)&#039;s human development report for Nicaragua&#039;s Atlantic coast. DFID support to the 2005 census is contributing to the better identification of the poverty on the coast, thereby enabling more effective targeting of resources in the future. DFID has also begun discussions with the Presidential Commission for Competitiveness to explore how the bilateral programme can support market access for small enterprises and rural producers in the region.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51024w07.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_54">DFID uses its position as a member of the influential group of donors providing budgetary support to challenge the economic and political marginalisation of the region, and seek opportunities to demonstrate its potential contribution to national development. Participation in this group also enables DFID to advocate increased spending on social sectors and employment generation in the national budget. My visit to Nicaragua last year enabled me to press specific issues of the Atlantic coast, such as land rights, when I met with President Bolanos.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of illegal logging and mining activity in West Papua.  [17239]</p>




<p><a name="st_80"><a name="51024w08.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 The scale of illegal logging and mining in Papua has, until recently, been poorly understood. An official Government of Indonesia investigation team in 2003 was turned away by the Governor of Papua. February 2005, however, saw the publication of a damning report &quot;The Last Frontier&quot; by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and local NGO Telapak, supported by DFID. This resulted from several years of undercover investigations and reported that timber theft on a massive scale was taking place in Papua, to a value of $1 billion a year, mostly exported to feed the booming timber industries in China.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51024w08.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_61">The report galvanised serious action from the Government of Indonesia, which sent a team of 1,500 people to investigate, but no high level convictions resulted. The investigation was closed after criticism in Parliament of its lack of focus, inability to reach powerful actors, and unfair scape-goating of poor rural communities. However, the Ministry of Forestry has now instigated a review of the timber licensing systems in Papua, which DFID is currently supporting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51024w08.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_62">There have been no systematic investigations into illegal mining in Papua. In 2001, the Indonesian environmental organization Walhi brought a successful 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Oct 2005 : Column 35W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
conviction against Freeport Mines for breaking environmental law and misinforming the public about its responsibility for the inadequate construction and subsequent breach of a dam below its mine site that was filled with toxic waste. The dam&#039;s breach resulted in many deaths. The conviction was later overturned on appeal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51024w08.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_63">DFID has been supporting the work of EIA/Telapak for a number of years, through our Forestry Programme (MFP) in Indonesia. The programme is also supporting the review of current forest management systems with the Ministry of Forestry, the Papua Provincial Forest Department, local NGOs and community groups. More widely in Papua, the programme is supporting rural communities to strengthen local institutions and map their traditional land claims in order for them to better negotiate with government and private businesses over future forest land uses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51024w08.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_64">DFID also supports a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding on Illegal Logging with the Government of Indonesia, which aims to tackle illegal logging in a variety of ways but has no activities specific to Papua. The Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan, which DFID supports through the EU, foresees a voluntary partnership agreement with the Government of Indonesia that would restrict imports of illegal timber from Indonesia to the European Union member states.

 As in other countries, the number of &quot;unauthorised&quot; or &quot;illegal&quot; migrants&#151;including failed asylum seekers&#151;in the UK is unknown. A report by the Migration Research Unit (MRU) of University College London on &quot;Sizing the Illegally Resident Population in the UK&quot; was published last year.

 City academies and foundation schools benefit from the full range of VAT and direct tax reliefs available to charities.

These VAT reliefs include a zero rate for construction of buildings, or parts of buildings, where at least 90 per cent. of total use will be solely for a relevant charitable purpose, such as the provision of core education. City academies and foundation schools also qualify for a reduced VAT rate of 5 per cent. when they purchase fuel and power for use in the course of their charitable non-business activities.

<p><a name="st_122"><a name="51024w13.html_spnew0"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The Valuation Office Agency (VOA), whose valuation officers are responsible for maintaining non-domestic rating lists, do not hold any statistics relating to the loss of revenue due to any game farms not being identified and entered into the relevant lists. The VOA believes that any significant game farms have already been identified either by the Agency, billing authorities (who are responsible for notifying the Agency) or via inquiries by animal rights organisations or the Game Farmers Association. In general, game farm assessments produce relatively low rateable values. This is because the average operation is on a relatively small scale, the area of land utilised for the actual operations is often no more than a field or part of a field, often this is transient (which may mean the operation is not treated as rateable due to the de minimis provisions relating to the exemption of agricultural land) and any rateable buildings are poorly located, minimal and of agricultural quality.

These identify reserves remaining in existing discoveries, classified according to the probability of their development, and estimates of resources in as-yet-undiscovered fields. As at the start of 2005, perhaps 22 to 28 billion barrels of oil equivalent were expected to remain. How much of that oil and gas will be produced will depend on future activity levels, which are uncertain, but it seems likely that the large majority of the UK&#039;s hydrocarbon resources will have been extracted by 2030.

 Nuclear materials accountancy is used at UK nuclear sites to help meet statutory domestic regulations and international safeguards requirements.

The Thorp chemical plant design included the application of statistical analysis techniques at regular intervals to its nuclear material accountancy data. This &#039;near real time materials accountancy&#039; was not designed for process control and is distinct from systems for monitoring the safety and security at the plant.
