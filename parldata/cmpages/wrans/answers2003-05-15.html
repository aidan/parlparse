 Each of the services has a well-defined and practised casualty reporting procedure with written guidance available to commanders and their staffs involved in bereavement aftercare. The guidance has recently been reviewed and new guidance issued where this was thought necessary. In addition, commanders and their visiting officers who are tasked with assisting bereaved families are able to draw upon the expertise and experience of unit welfare staffs (including service chaplains) and the Casualty Co-ordination Cell in each service. Aftercare guides and videos have been produced in order to help with the training of commanding officers, their personnel staffs and visiting officers.

<a name="30515w05.html_para3">DLC was awarded the project following competitive tender. The project brief was designed as a 'scoping study' to provide a broad overview of the issues relatively quickly, rather than an in-depth analysis. Commenced in mid November 2002, DLC's report was submitted to the Department on 19 February 2003. The timing of the delivery of the report was in part dictated by the deadline for contributions to the DWP Review of Employers Liability Compulsory Insurance (ELCI). Copies were issued to study participants, and officials leading on insurance matters at the OFT, DWP and Treasury, and since then to inquirers on request. Some minor amendments on points of detail have since been made in response to requests from two study participants and an amended version will be lodged on the DTI website in the next few days.

<a name="30515w05.html_para4">The Department welcomes the report as providing a perspective on construction&#151;specific aspects adding value to the work of the other studies in the area, and concurs with its general thrust.

The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), which regulates the sales activities of energy suppliers, may take investigative and enforcement action, including levying financial penalties, against any supplier that breaches the terms of its supply licence. In November 2002, Ofgem fined London Electricity &#163;2 million for mis-selling under its own brand aid that of Virgin Energy.

 The Animal By-Products Regulation 1774/2002 maintains the same principle as the previous Council Directive 90/667/EEC (the Animal Waste Directive) which classified uncooked meat and fish as an animal by-product.

However the Government are concerned at a lack of balance, which requires far more from the EU than from some of our other major trading partners, including the USA. Nevertheless the Harbinson paper provides a negotiating basis on which we can build.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many co-disposal hazardous waste sites will close as a result of the United Kingdom's implementation of the EU Landfill Directive of 1999; and what volume of waste is involved in such closures.  [111795]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30515w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Under the Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations 2002, co-disposal of waste will end in July 2004. While it is unlikely that many landfill sites will close as a result of this provision, it is expected that a large number will change classification from hazardous to non-hazardous landfill sites at that time.
<P>

<a name="30515w07.html_para2">What this constitutes in terms of waste cannot at present be estimated, but all waste generated has to be either re-used, recycled, recovered or disposed of regardless of the number of landfill sites available. It is Government policy to move waste up the hierarchy and thereby move towards more sustainable ways of dealing with waste than is achieved by disposal to landfill.

<a name="30515w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State supports the provision of rebates for customers whose surface water does not flow into public sewers. This involves a reallocation of charges between non-connected customers and other customers, which is taken into account on a year-by-year basis. Neither Ofwat nor the Government can require companies to offer retrospective rebates, or periods with no charge in lieu of past payments. Such a scheme would imply retrospective increases for other customers, which is against the Government's policy of stable and predictable charging.

I understand that although the London borough of Barnet has increased its schools budget by 11 per cent. or &#163;17 million the individual schools budget has only been increased by 7.8 per cent. or &#163;10.5 million. Schools that followed earlier advice on freeing teachers from administrative duties should find that implementing the commitments on school workforce reform this autumn makes no additional demand on their resources.

1. Net Current Expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by LEAs. The spend per pupil figures for pre-primary/primary relate the gross current expenditure (after recharges) in the pre-primary sector and maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained nursery and primary schools sector.<P>

2. Real Terms figures are adjusted to 2001&#150;02 prices using the March 2003 GDP deflators.<P>

3. Pre-primary, primary and secondary column contains the per pupil costs across all three phases of education. The figure is not a 'sum' but a weighted average of the previous two columns figures.<P>

4. Figures rounded to the nearest 10.<P>

5. Financial data are drawn from the RO1 forms up to 1998&#150;99 and from the DfES Section 52 outturn statements from 1999&#150;2000.<P>

6. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<P>

7. SEN Schools expenditure not included because it distorts the unit costs and can make meaningful comparison difficult.<P>

 As my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister made clear when he launched the "Sustainable Communities: building for the future"(SCP), some 22 billion is being invested, across England over the next three years. The East of England will share in the &#163;4.7 billion being provided for housing investment in the three South-Eastern regions over the next three years. The recently established Regional Housing Board (RHB) will have a pivotal role in ensuring that the priorities set out in the forthcoming Regional Housing Strategy (RHS) are addressed and are adequately funded through the single housing pot.
<P>

<a name="30515w11.html_para1">Regional Planning Guidance (RPG) for the South East calls for an additional 2,430 new homes per year in Luton and Bedfordshire. Luton and Bedfordshire, also fall into one of the four "Growth Areas" identified in that RPG, which have in total, been earmarked for an additional 200,000 new homes by 2016. The area will benefit from a share of &#163;164 million allocated in the SCP to expedite delivery of housing. All this will help ease the strain on the housing market and enable more people in Luton to have the opportunity to own their own home, and will promote regeneration in the town, higher standards in design and efficient use of land.
<P>

<a name="30515w11.html_para2">Luton has a number of affordable housing schemes already underway, in partnership with the Housing Corporation and Registered Social Landlords, to increase the amount of affordable housing. The development of the former Electrolux site will provide over 50 dwellings of affordable accommodation, the redevelopment of disused elderly homes to create sheltered accommodation for the frail and needy will also provide over 50 homes with care facilities. Other schemes are also in progress increasing the amount of affordable accommodation and other tenures in Luton.
<P>

<a name="30515w11.html_para3">Luton's issues, as detailed in the "Luton Factors 2002&#150;2003" document, are being addressed by a number of Government led incentives, designed to alleviate the housing situation that this country finds itself in. The emergence of RPG 14, the RHS and the developing sub-regional strategies, will enable the Government Office for the East of England to work together with regional and local partners to put policies into practice and deliver the housing so desperately needed.

 The Chancellor has proposed an International Finance Facility (IFF) that would seek to double the amount of development aid from just over US$50 billion a year today to $100 billion per year in the years to 2015. The IFF could also be used to help fund further debt relief for existing debts, which for some poor and indebted countries is a valuable instrument to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
<P>

<a name="30515w13.html_para8">At their eighth meeting in Kigali, Rwanda on 28&#150;29 April 2003 36 HIPC Finance Ministers endorsed the UK proposal for an International Finance Facility, and urged that its funding should be fully additional and channelled to grants. The UK is promoting the IFF through a range of international fora and the communiqu&#233; from the April 2003 G7 Finance Ministers' meeting agreed they would continue to focus on the Millennium Development goals and their financing, including facilities, with a view to progress by the Evian Summit.

 The amount of money held at any one time for income tax overpayments is not accurately identifiable. This is because several systems cover different groups of taxpayers and an overpayment may not arise until an Income Tax liability has been established. How overpayments and potential repayments are identified and dealt with will depend on the group of taxpayers being considered.

 The Government introduced the first ever National Minimum Wage in April 1999 and has recently announced that, from October 2003, the National Minimum Wage will increase from &#163;4.20 to &#163;4.50. Subject to an assessment of the future economic situation, it will increase again to &#163;4.85 in October 2004. At least 1.3 million workers stand to benefit from the 2003 increase, and 1.7 million from the 2004 increase. Since the introduction of the National Minimum Wage in 1999, low paid workers will have seen their wages increase by 25 per cent. by October 2003.
<P>

<a name="30515w14.html_para2">The Government have reduced taxes for lower-paid workers. As a consequence of the introduction of the 10p rate of income tax in 1999, and the subsequent to the basic rate down to 22p in 2000, 3 million low paid workers now pay lower taxes. The reforms to the National Insurance Contributions have removed the unfair "entry fee" and have raised the point at which employees start paying NICs from &#163;66 in 1999 to &#163;89 per week now, while leaving their entitlement to contributory benefits protected.
<P>

<a name="30515w14.html_para3">In 1999 the Government introduced the Working Families Tax Credit, which reached nearly 1.4 million families with children, helping around 550,000 more families than the old Family Credit at its peak. Building on this success, from April 2003 the Working Tax Credit improves support for workers on low and moderate earnings and for the first time extends support to single people and couples without children, provided they are aged 25 or over and they work at least 30 hours per week. Alongside the Working Tax Credit, the Government have introduced the Child Tax Credit, that supports families with children and it is paid in and out of work. The Child Tax Credit is expected to benefit 5.75 million families, and will channel &#163;13 billion in support to families, most of them on low and moderate incomes.
<P>

<a name="30515w14.html_para4">As a consequence of the reforms illustrated above, from October 2003 a family with one child and one adult working 35 hours per week at the National Minimum Wage will be guaranteed an income of &#163;241 per week, while a couple without children and one adult working

35 hours a week will take home at least &#163;187 per week. These figures compare with &#163;182 in April 1999 for a family with one child and &#163;117 for a childless couple. Before the introduction of the National Minimum Wage, no minimum income from work could be guaranteed.

 The 2005 Millennium Development Goal on gender parity and access to primary and secondary education is a key priority of DFID. We believe that achieving the MDGs requires learning lesson from past efforts, encouraging and supporting governments in developing countries to implement sound policies, and in providing countries with the necessary resources.

 The main output of the 2002 G8 meeting in Kananaskis was the G8 Africa Action Plan. In response to this we announced an increase in bilateral spending to Africa from around &#163;650 million a year then, to &#163;1 billion by 2006. The provision of adequate and appropriate support to countries with credible plans to achieve UPE was integral to the Action Plan. Education is not likely to feature so prominently in this year's meeting. Nevertheless, the international community remains committed to meeting the Millennium Development Goals on universal primary education and gender parity in access to primary and secondary education. The Fast Track Initiative illustrates this commitment and could improve donor harmonisation in the education sector.

 A preliminary Reconstruction Needs Assessment was carried out in late 2001/early 2002 by UNDP, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

 There can be no automatic presumption that organic certification will deliver improved livelihoods for poor coffee producers. It is important that careful consideration is given to ensuring that any additional premium generated from the production and sale of organic produce justifies any additional costs that may be incurred, including associated certification costs. In 2000, DFID financed a study to examine the opportunities and constraints for resource poor farmers in organic production and trade.

 The World Health Organisation (WHO) is monitoring the level of disease in Iraq, including gastroenteritis. It is difficult to establish an accurate picture of disease trends, as a pre-existing Iraqi disease surveillance system is no longer functioning. The reactivation of this system is a priority for the WHO. UNICEF has delivered oral rehydration salts, including an extra 200,000 sachets which are being pre-positioned in the region to deal with diarrhoeal disease outbreaks.

 World Food Programme (WFP) reports indicate that the amount of food distributed by the Oil for Food Programme (OFF) prior to the start of the conflict varies by region. WFP is currently in discussion with Iraq's Ministry of Trade and OFF Public Distribution System officials to ascertain the levels of food pre-positioned at local level. WFP estimates that existing family food stocks could begin running out soon.
<P>

<a name="30515w17.html_para12">The WFP has pipeline stocks for May and June, although there are shortages of some other commodities. On 24 April 2003, the UN Security Council unanimously agreed to extend provisions of resolution 1,472 from 12 May until 3 June 2003. This enables the UN to process those existing orders under the Oil for Food (OFF) programme which can be dispatched to Iraq by 3 June. Outside of OFF, WFP are also procuring some foodstuffs from the region. They are aiming to build up supplies similar to those previously supplied by the Oil for Food Programme (480,000 tonnes of food per month) as soon as possible.

 The World Health Organization recognises for diseases prevalent in poor countries&#151;including AIDS, TB and Malaria&#151;four key factors that can improve access to medicines: affordable pricing, sustainable financing, reliable health and supply systems, and the rational selection of drugs.

<a name="30515w18.html_para0">Availability of affordable medicines was one of a number of issues my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short) looked into when she chaired a recent High Level Working Group on increasing Access to Essential Medicines in the developing world. DFID is firmly committed to increasing access to medicines for the poorest, in line with the WHO strategy. For example, we have committed over &#163;1.5 billion since 1997 to support the strengthening of health systems, which will build capacity to deliver medicines to the poor and to make effective choices about the selection of drugs.
<P>

<a name="30515w18.html_para1">DFID is currently working with a number of key stakeholders, including the Pharmaceutical industry, for an integrated approach to increasing access to medicines for the poor, including tackling affordability. This will focus on the major diseases of the poor including Malaria.
<P>

<a name="30515w18.html_para2">The UK has committed over $200 million over five years to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria for the procurement of drugs and commodities and some associated strengthening of health systems. We have already disbursed $80 million to the fund.
<P>

<a name="30515w18.html_para3">The UK is strongly committed to tackling Malaria, recognising its importance not just in terms of burden of disease, but also in terms of the impact Malaria has on economic development, particularly in Africa where this has been an increasing problem. The UK Government are committed to the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goal to halt, and begin to reverse the incidence of Malaria by 2015. At the 1998 G8 summit in Birmingham the UK Government pledged &#163;60 million to support action on Malaria, and financial commitments since then have far exceeded this figure. To date the UK has provided in excess of &#163;110 million to support Malaria control globally and at country-level. This includes a contribution to basic Malaria support through the Medical Research Council (MRC) and support to the Malaria Consortium resource centre. We are supporting the development of new drugs appropriate for developing countries through partnerships such as the Medicines for Malaria Venture and programmes that help find new low-cost Malaria treatments, for example Lapdap.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to provide specific funding for the implementation of the Government's commitment to end ageism in the NHS.  [110594]<P>

<P>
<a name="30515w21.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Implementation of the national service framework (NSF) for older people, including the standard to root out age discrimination, is supported by the substantial additional investment that has been provided for the national health service since the NSF's publication in 2001. In 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, the NHS received average annual increases of 6.3 per cent. above inflation. Cash allocations to primary care trusts in the three years from 2003&#150;04 will provide an average increase over the three years of 30.83 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30515w21.html_para3">Since publication of the NSF, significant progress has been made in tackling age discrimination. NHS organisations have checked their written policies to ensure they have no inappropriate age discrimination. Only a small number of age-related written policies were found, and the evidence base for them is being reviewed. A tool to help identify incidence of implicit age discrimination&#151;by comparing, across the country, the rates of 10 hospital procedures by different age groups&#151;has been provided and this is currently being developed further. We have funded Age Concern to run eight events on age discrimination across England later this year.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30515w21.html_para4">During the period in question, the Home Office has provided programme funding to tackle crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour. We have also provided record numbers of police officers and police support staff, and tackling anti-social behaviour is firmly embedded as one of our four key priorities in the National Policing Plan. As part of the Crime Reduction Programme the CCTV Initiative has provided &#163;170 million across England and Wales. The Communities Against Drugs programme provided crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRPs) with a share of &#163;120 million over 2001&#150;03 with &#163;50 million allocated in year one and &#163;70 million in year two. The Safer Communities Initiative provided additional funding of &#163;20 million in 2002&#150;03. In 2002&#150;03 &#163;19 million was available for the new community support officer initiative, and &#163;41 million will be available in 2003&#150;04.




<P>

<P>

<a name="30515w21.html_para5">Each of these initiatives has enabled partnerships to fund a wide range of interventions, including means to tackle anti-social behaviour where this has been identified as a local priority. &#163;75 million is being made available over the next three years, specifically to support the drive to tackle anti-social behaviour.
<P>

<a name="30515w21.html_para6">The Home Office also contributes to various diversionary schemes for young people.

 We have taken measures to deliver all nursing care through the national health service, because this will be free at the point of use, and to remove the previous overlap whereby both the NHS and councils could provide nursing care. To effect this change, it has been necessary to extract from councils the funds spent on nursing care by local government, and to pass them to the NHS for re-allocation to primary care trusts.
<P>

<a name="30515w22.html_para4">A survey of PCTs was carried out in December 2002 to establish the number of self-funders and the number of residents in care homes providing nursing care. Included within the survey was a request for information on the number of local authority supported residents for whom a Registered Nursing Care Contribution determination had been completed. This information has informed the allocation of funding to PCTs for 2003&#150;04.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his answer of 7 April 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 96W, on care homes, what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the package announced on 11 March in ensuring care home providers passed on the free nursing care contribution.

<a name="30515w22.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The way that care homes take account of national health service funding when setting fees is a matter for them. The announcement on 11 March last year was about strengthening and safeguarding the rights of residents of care homes providing nursing care and ensuring that they have accurate information about the costs of providing that care. Following consultation on draft regulations earlier this year, we will shortly be bringing forward an amendment to the Care Homes Regulations that will ensure that residents get access to such information.

 Guidance issued under cover of Local Authority Circular LAC(2002)13, that took effect from 7 April 2003, requires councils to review and re-assess the needs and circumstances of all care home residents admitted under section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948 on a routine basis. The guidance suggests that first reviews should be completed within three months of admission and thereafter reviews should be conducted at least annually. If a review indicated the possible need for substantial health services, then a comprehensive assessment, informed by the single assessment process, should be completed.

<P>
<P>

 Electronic magnifiers are considered to be aids to daily living and as such, their provision is the responsibility of social services departments. They can provide these if they are felt to be warranted. However hand-held, stand and spectacle-mounted magnifiers are considered to be more widely available, more accessible, easier to use and more cost effective.

 The National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) attaches a high priority to ensuring that service users are fully engaged in all that it does. The NCSC, as part of the implementation of its service user strategy, uses a mix of focus groups and inspection feedback tools to help evaluate the difference it is making to service users.

 Inpatient and general practitioner services were surveyed as part of the 2002 patient survey programme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to reduce waste in prescription arrangements, with particular reference to carrying out investigations as to how patients may avoid re-ordering medicines they do not need.  [112453]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30515w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 We are introducing a number of measures to reduce wastage of medicines.
<P>

<a name="30515w25.html_para1">We have set up medicines management schemes to promote better use of medicines. 106 schemes are now in operation around the country and we are aiming for all primary care trusts to have schemes by 2004. One such scheme in Coventry recently reported it might save &#163;150,000 per year through a range of measures designed to improve the effectiveness of local prescribing. Many general practitioner (GP) practices have hands-on support to help set up repeat prescribing systems, which will help reduce the re-ordering of medicines that patients do not need.
<P>

<a name="30515w25.html_para2">We are funding a joint task force based at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain to lead implementation of a national strategy to spread better understanding and partnerships between patients and health professionals on taking their medicines. This will promote the benefits of helping patients to take a more active role in managing their own care.
<P>

<a name="30515w25.html_para3">We are introducing repeat dispensing, beginning with 30 "pathfinder" sites, and with the aim of having schemes in place nationwide by 2004. These will enable patients to have their medicines dispensed for up to a year by their pharmacy without having to go back to their GP. It will allow the pharmacist to check that the medicines are needed. Evidence from pilot studies has shown that repeat dispensing helps reduce waste.

Within these figures, the rates for young women aged between 16 and 20 were 57 per cent. and 50 per cent. respectively.

 All Prison Service establishments and their national health service partners are working to implement the improvements to mental health services set out in "Changing the Outlook, a Strategy for Developing and Modernising Mental Health Services in Prisons" published in December 2001. Prisoners who need in-patient treatment for mental disorder may be transferred to psychiatric hospitals. The care and treatment of mentally disordered prisoners who do not need to be admitted to hospital is generally undertaken by prison healthcare staff under the supervision of NHS specialists and, increasingly, by NHS-funded, multi-disciplinary, mental health in-reach teams. Such teams are already in operation or being developed at six of the establishments that hold young women aged 15 to 17 and one is to be introduced at the seventh during this financial year.

<P>
<a name="30515w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 Productivity is vital in improving the competitiveness of manufacturing industry. Budget 2003 introduced a number of new measures that should enable United Kingdom companies, including those in Northern Ireland, to meet the productivity challenge.
<P>

<a name="30515w26.html_para1">The Research and Development tax credit will be made more accessible to small companies in particular through a number of measures including a reduction in the minimum expenditure threshold from &#163;25,000 to &#163;10,000. This will increase the number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) benefiting from the scheme. There will also be a one year extension of the 100 per cent. First Year ICT capital allowances scheme. This will be available to 89,000 small businesses in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30515w26.html_para2">VAT compliance costs will be reduced for small and newly registered businesses thus benefiting 13,000 businesses in Northern Ireland. In addition, further steps have been taken to further boost enterprise in enterprise areas, which includes 230 wards in Northern Ireland. From 10 April 2003 all non-residential transactions are now exempt from stamp duty in these enterprise areas.
<P>

<a name="30515w26.html_para3">The measures announced in Budget 2003 build on those announced in previous budgets (such as the introduction of the 125 per cent. R&D tax credit for large companies and the reduction in the corporation tax starting rate for small companies). The net effect of the Government's corporation tax changes since 1997 is to reduce the corporation tax rates to the lowest in UK history. Manufacturing industry in Northern Ireland now faces one of the lowest tax burdens in the EU.

<a name="30515w27.html_para1">The figure of 19,397 for 2001&#150;02, which was quoted in a previous reply to the hon. Member on 21 October 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 98W, was based on estimates in the case of those forces for which we had not received figures. The revised figure reflects data, which has since been received.
<P>

<a name="30515w27.html_para2">The British Crime Survey (BCS2002), which includes crimes not reported to or recorded by the police, estimated that six per cent of burglaries involve gaining access by false pretences. The BCS also estimates that there were 991,000 burglaries in England and Wales in 2001&#150;02, which suggests that there were some 60,000 distraction burglaries.

<a name="30515w27.html_para3">From 2003&#150;04 we will be collecting numbers of recorded distraction burglaries centrally from police forces.

 It was never intended that the "no switching" provision&#151;prohibiting those given leave to enter for six months or less from switching into marriage&#151;would include those given leave to enter as fianc&#233;s. This will be made absolutely clear in the next rules change.

 At the meeting in Veria on 28&#150;29 March 2003, Ministers discussed current developments in the area of asylum, in particular hearing from Ruud Lubbers, head of the United Nations' High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). I set out the Government's ideas on establishing zones of protection and transit processing centres for refugees outside the EU's borders. Ministers also examined the effectiveness of financial resources available at Community level to take forward the work mandated by the Seville European Council on management of the external EU border and co-operation with third countries on returning illegal immigrants. The Commission also confirmed the arrangements put in place at EU level to cope with the potential influx of refugees from Iraq.

During the subsequent discussion my noble Friend (Lord Filkin) stressed the importance of ensuring that the new Treaty clearly defined those tasks which were necessary at European Union level and those which were for Member States. At European level, the focus should be on cross-border issues where there would be proper facilitation of mutual recognition. Lord Filkin also noted that the idea of a European Public Prosecutor presented real problems of accountability.
<P>

<a name="30515w27.html_para9">Justice Ministers also discussed the Commission's recent Green Paper on procedural safeguards in criminal proceedings. Lord Filkin said that action at EU level should be based on the principles of mutual recognition and subsidiarity and should avoid over-regulation.
