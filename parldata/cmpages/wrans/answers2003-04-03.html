<a name="30403w01.html_para2">Local authorities often supplement the civil defence grant from their revenue support grant. I understand that Portsmouth city council budgeted to provide an additional &#163;17,304 in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;20,533 in 2003&#150;04 and that Hampshire county council budgeted to provide an additional &#163;326,900 in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;336,600 in 2003&#150;04.

<P>
<a name="30403w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 31 March 2003]:</i> The Ministry of Defence does not believe that Paul Connolly's renal disorder is attributable to the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict. The nature of traumatic psychological injury is such that the Ministry of Defence would need to carefully consider up to date specialist psychiatric assessment before being able to give a view on whether or not Paul Connolly has PTSD and, if so, its aetiology.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what financial support will be made available to the dependants of those killed or injured in the conflict in Iraq; and if he will make a statement.  [106245]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30403w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) provides valuable occupational ill-health benefits, based on years of service and rank, where a service person is injured and medically discharged from the armed forces. If the injury is considered attributable to service, the AFPS benefits are enhanced and paid tax-free. In addition, the War Pension Scheme (WPS) pays a War Disablement Pension and may pay other associated allowances, which include recognition of carer responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="30403w01.html_para11">Where the member dies in service from an attributable cause and leaves a widow or widower, and/or a dependant child, the AFPS benefits include a short-term family pension, equal to the service person's annual rate of pensionable pay; this is payable for up to 182 days and maintains the household income level in the early months of bereavement. In addition, a death-in-service lump sum is paid of between 1 and 1&#189; times the individual's representative rate of pay, and an attributable gratuity is also payable; both these are paid tax-free.
<P>

<a name="30403w01.html_para12">Thereafter, a long-term widow's or widower's pension and, as appropriate, children's pensions are paid. Attributable widow(er)'s pensions are significantly enhanced, index-linked and paid for life, regardless of whether the widow(er) remarries or cohabits. The attributable widow's or widower's pension is 90 per cent. of the member's full career pension, less an abatement to reflect the amount by which the WPS war widow's or widower's pension exceeds the basic state widow's pension. Attributable children's pensions are also enhanced and index-linked, and are paid until age 17; they may remain in payment until a later age if higher education is undertaken. The WPS provides additional compensation for families of those service personnel whose death is attributable to their service. This includes a tax-free War Widow's or Widower's Pension.
<P>

<a name="30403w01.html_para13">In my written statement of 20 March 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 54WS, I announced that unmarried partners, including same sex partners, of service personnel whose death was attributable to conflict-related service would be eligible for ex-gratia benefits equivalent to those awarded to spouses under the AFPS. Partners would need to demonstrate that the relationship was substantial. However, the policy change is not retrospective with respect to deaths occurring before 20 March and does not affect the WPS, which already has its own rules regarding unmarried partners.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30403w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 We have made very clear our commitment to the welfare and future of the people of Iraq, and deeply regret any civilian casualties resulting from coalition action. However, it is impossible to know for sure how many civilians have been injured, or killed and subsequently buried. Figures presented by the Iraqi regime are likely to be inflated or distorted for propaganda purposes, and may include civilians injured or killed by Iraq's own forces.

However, approximately three-quarters of UK regional development funding already comes directly from the UK Government. And, if the Government's proposals for the future of the Structural Funds were accepted, the Government would guarantee that regional spending would be increased so that the nations and regions of the UK receive a level of resources which ensures that they do not lose out from the UK's proposals on Structural Funds reform, for example from the transitional funding they would automatically have received from the application of the eligibility criteria to EU 25 instead of EU15.

 The Medical Research Council (MRC) is internationally renowned for its promotion of excellent medical research. Its core mission is to support research that will have an impact on human health. Everyone is in agreement that it does this very well.
<P>

<a name="30403w04.html_para1">The Office of Science and Technology (OST) has processes in place to review the planned activities of all the Research Councils. Each council, including the MRC, submits an annual Operating Plan which sets

out their planning and funding assumptions for the following year. The MRC will be publishing its 2003&#150;04 Operating Plan on its website in due course.
<P>

<a name="30403w04.html_para2">Some of the recommendations and conclusions of the Select Committee report on the MRC issued on 25 March related to management and planning. We will be responding in detail to the recommendations of the SC report in due course and as part of this will consider what additional elements we might need to introduce in this specific case into the standard monitoring and reporting processes that we have with Research Councils in order to address the issues identified.
<P>

<a name="30403w04.html_para3">OST recognised some time ago that the processes underpinning the ability of the MRC to make a judgment of the financial implications of forward commitments could be improved. OST have been working with them to address this and are pleased with the progress made to date.
<P>

<a name="30403w04.html_para4">The MRC does not normally earmark funds for particular topics: research proposals in all areas will compete for the funding available. The MRC spent an estimated &#163;19.1 million in 2001&#150;02 on its reproductive health portfolio. Reproductive health research includes normal and abnormal fetal and placental development and growth, as well as conditions affecting pregnancy and childbirth.
<P>

<a name="30403w04.html_para5">The MRC always welcomes high quality applications for support into any aspect of human health and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding. Awards will continue to be made according to their scientific quality and importance to human health.

<a name="30403w04.html_para6">In respect to funding alpha rated research projects, it is not possible to anticipate the number of applications MRC will receive, nor what the outcome of the subsequent peer review and rating will be at this stage in the cycle.

<P>
<a name="30403w05.html_spnew2"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The UK has raised the question of whether a directive with a treaty base of Article 137(6) can cover pay. The European Commission and several other member states are of the view that it can because it only addresses pay in terms of non-discrimination and does not set absolute pay levels. The Government have continued to reserve their position on the inclusion of pay under Article 137 pending further clarification of the definition of pay.

 Information in respect of the year 2002 could be provided only at disproportionate cost. In 1997&#150;98 sampling carried out in preparing the Department's Green Transport Plan indicated that about 90 per cent. of travel by staff for official business was by public transport, mostly by train. It is estimated that the cost of this rail travel was about &#163;1.3 million.

<P>
<a name="30403w05.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 March 2003]:</i> The EU operates a system of strict controls on imports of animal products. All products of animal origin must be checked on entry into the UK at a border inspection post (BIP). Following the outbreak of FMD, the State Veterinary Service have introduced an audit programme for BIPs to ensure consistent application of these import checks. During the visits officers provide advice to BIPs and monitor progress to correct any deficiencies found.
<P>

<a name="30403w05.html_para1">Additional measures have been introduced at ports and airports to tackle illegal imports. Temporary agency staff attached to the local and port health authorities and funded by Defra, have been recruited to carry out checks to detect smuggled goods&#151;teams of six are based at our major airports and teams of two at major seaports. We are also paying for additional checks through overtime elsewhere. Further inspection resources have also been provided through the detector dog pilot, and a publicity campaign which has targeted ports, airports and points of departure. We have announced that with effect from 11April, HM Customs and Excise will be taking over responsibility for anti-smuggling activity since they have the infrastructure, intelligence and experience to target more effectively.
<P>

<a name="30403w05.html_para2">The Food Standards Agency has responsibility for public health checks on all other imported foods. Following a Cabinet Office review of checks on imports the Food Standards Agency are leading a step change project to deliver improved co-ordination of all imported food controls by local authorities and port health authorities at seaports, airports and inland.

A number of projects relating to farmers' markets have received funding under these schemes. In addition, the National Association of Farmers' Markets continues to receive financial support from the Countryside Agency, which we grant-aid.

<a name="30403w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that forcing of the climate due to aviation was responsible for 3.5 per cent. of man-made forcing of the climate in 1992. Forcing due to aviation is projected to grow by between 2.6 and 11 times by 2050. This is projected to be equivalent to 3 per cent. to 15 per cent. of total man-made forcing of the climate in 2050. The aviation industry, like other industries, needs to pay for the environmental damage that it causes, and the Government will shortly be holding discussions with stakeholders on the appropriate use of economic instruments to achieve this.

 The LINK Aquaculture programme, launched in 1996 and sponsored by Defra, SEERAD and the National Environment Research Council contributed approximately &#163;5.3 million to thirty-seven R and D projects, which, together with industry match funding, created an R and D programme valued at approximately &#163;10 million. The Defra contribution to this was &#163;2.2 million. This highly successful programme which comes to an end this year has been subject to comprehensive independent review, see the Defra website (http://www.defra.gov.uk/esg/economics/econeval/LINK&#150;Aqua.PDF).

 The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) attaches a high priority to the relative importance of cattle-to-cattle transmission, but it is not possible to put a percentage figure on it at present. Current research will help fill the gaps. While the badger culling trial is looking at the part badgers might play in the transmission of cattle TB, other research, such as the TB99 epidemiological questionnaire and cattle pathogenesis studies, should provide data about cattle-to-cattle transmission. A research project looking at TB in herds restocked after the foot and mouth outbreak should also provide valuable data. A preliminary analysis of the risk factors associated with cattle TB is set out in the ISG's Third Report, which is available online at: www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/isg/report/isg3.pdf

 I presume that this question refers to a sulphur dioxide 'bubble' in a national plan under the revised Large Combustion Plant Directive (2001/80/EC) for plants that were in existence in 1987. We have a choice whether to implement the revised Directive for these plants by the emission limits approach or by adopting the national plan approach. Measures under the Directive would apply to these plants from 2008. If we adopted the national plan approach, we expect power stations in the electricity supply industry to contribute about 66 per cent. to the calculation of the bubble, which would be about 177 kilo tonnes. This is based on current information about operation of these plants between 1996 and 2000.

<a name="30403w07.html_para0">The most recent energy projections for the UK, published as Energy Paper 68 in November 2000, show an estimated range for coal demand in the major power stations of approximately nine to 20 million tonnes of oil equivalent in the year 2010. This corresponds to a coal tonnage of around 15 to 31 million tonnes. The estimated range is based on two different energy price assumptions, a working assumption for the means by which operators would react to the revised large combustion plant directive and a number of other assumptions.

We have a choice whether to implement the revised Directive for these plants by the emission limits approach or by adopting the national plan approach, and results from the consultancy work will inform our decision. Measures under the Directive would apply to these plants from 2008.

 The enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative was agreed by the international community at the Annual Meetings of the World bank and the IMF in September 1999. These institutions work jointly with the HIPC countries to assess the level of debt relief required to bring debt sustainability ratios down to the HIPC thresholds&#151;150 per cent. debt to export earnings and 250 per cent. debt to government revenue. Linked to this process, countries are required to develop national poverty reduction strategies setting out how government resources, including savings from debt relief, will be spent. These strategies, which are produced in consultation with civil society and donors, are increasingly owned and led by the countries themselves, reflecting a fundamental change in the relationship between donors and developing country partners.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30403w07.html_spnew10"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The UK, along with other donors, is committed to countries exiting the HIPC process with sustainable levels of debt. The World bank and the IMF have agreed to provide additional debt relief at Completion Point to those countries that have suffered a fundamental change in their economic circumstances due to external shocks. The UK is pressing these institutions to widen their approach to topping up, so that any HIPC eligible country facing unsustainable debts, that has demonstrated its commitment to poverty reduction and economic reform, should qualify for this additional relief. It is essential that countries take strong measures to improve their economic position in order to maintain long term debt sustainability. This means strengthening their debt management offices, taking out new borrowing on concessional terms only, and diversifying their export markets. Through the multi donor HIPC Capacity Building Programme, we are helping countries to learn to plan and manage their debt more effectively, and to negotiate with their creditors better terms on their external debts.

 DFID's assistance to the Saharawi refugees is channelled through contributions to the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO).

<a name="30403w08.html_para4">A global plan for assistance to the Saharawi was agreed by the EC in May last year.

This brings the total assistance provided since 1993 to over 95 million euros, including over 79 million euros in food aid programme co-ordinated by ECHO, the World Food Programme and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Approximately 19 per cent. of this funding comes from my Department's budget.

For 2003 this contribution is &#163;14 million. As this contribution is unearmarked it is difficult to ascertain exactly how much of the &#163;14 million is spent in the context of this specific refugee situation.

<i>[pursuant to his reply, 17 December 2002, c. 685W]:</i> There is no legal obligation for the industry to report the TOC involved in an incident reportable under the Reporting of Injuries, Disease and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR). However, since January 2000 the industry has agreed to record the TOC on a voluntary basis. Line details are reportable under RIDDOR but the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has only been able to capture this information since January 2000 with the introduction of its new database system.

These include guidance on respect for human dignity and treatment of minorities. Broadcasters must adhere to these rules and respect them as regards prisoners of war.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to his answer of 24 February, ref 96714, what assessment he has made of the impact of narrow in-school variation on value-added standards of achievement at Key Stage 3 and GCSE.  [100255]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30403w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The variation within schools in pupils' Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3 attainment is only slightly associated statistically with the progress they make during Key Stage 3 (as indicated by the 2002 Performance Tables school-level Key Stage 2&#150;3 Value Added measure). In general, the smaller the variation in Key Stage 2 or Key Stage 3 performance between pupils within their schools, the marginally greater the level of aggregate relative progress recorded by the value added measure. These features are also evident in the progress made during Key Stage 4.

<a name="30403w10.html_para7">Kent local education authority has informed the DfES that there are seven specifically designated resourced mainstream maintained provisions for children and pupils on the autistic spectrum in Kent, in addition 119 Kent maintained mainstream schools meet the needs of pupils with statements of special educational need where the primary need type is identified as autism and the need is described as very severe and complex. Many other Kent maintained mainstream schools meet the needs of pupils on the autistic spectrum, some with statements of special educational needs and others without.
<P>

<a name="30403w10.html_para8">There is no DfES definition of a generic special school. However the Kent authority has told us that there is one Kent special school which meets the needs of pupils with both moderate learning difficulties and specific learning difficulties, which may be one definition of "generic". There will be many other Kent special schools which cater for children with a range of special needs.
<P>

<a name="30403w10.html_para9">None of the Kent maintained special schools is specifically designated for children with autism. However there are 16 that will meet the needs of pupils who are on the autistic spectrum and there are other special schools which will take pupils who have needs associated with autism.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will reverse the policy on exclusion in secondary schools.  [105539]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30403w11.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 31 March 2003]:</i> As a result of the SEN and Disability Act 2001, children who have statements of special educational needs (SEN), have a stronger right to mainstream education where this is what their parents want, and where it is compatible with the efficient education of other children. The Act also amended the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to provide protection from discrimination for disabled pupils and prospective pupils, and introduced duties on LEAs and schools to plan strategically to increase access to schools for disabled pupils.
<P>

<a name="30403w11.html_para3">There are strong educational, as well as social and moral, grounds for educating children with SEN or disabilities with their peers, and we believe that with the right strategies and support, the vast majority of children with special educational needs or disabilities can be included in a mainstream school. An increasing number of schools are showing that an inclusive approach can reinforce a commitment to higher standards of achievement for all children. This approach applies equally to early years settings, primary, and secondary schools. However, we also see a continuing and vital role for special schools, and are currently consulting on the proposals of the Special Schools Working Group, who have made recommendations on how special schools could work with mainstream schools to further develop their role within the Government's inclusion framework.

 The available information is shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="30403w12.html_para2">There is currently no requirement for schools to submit information in the Annual Schools' Census on the nature of such pupils' disability or learning difficulty. However, in June 2001, the Department carried out a pilot study involving a sample of 200 mainstream and special schools to assess whether it would be possible to collect data from schools on a broad range of types of Special Educational Needs (SEN). From January 2004 the Department is planning to ask schools and Local Education Authorities to provide this information.
<P>

<a name="30403w12.html_para3">Local Education Authorities and schools have statutory responsibilities under the Education Act 1996 to identify, assess and make appropriate provision for children with special educational needs, including those with emotional and behavioural difficulties. Guidance on carrying out those responsibilities is given in the Speicial Educational Needs Code of Practice.

<P>

<a name="30403w12.html_para4">Local Education Authorities have a duty to secure sufficient schools for pupils in their area and in doing so much have particular regard to the need to secure special educational provision. It is up to Local Education Authorities to determine the pattern of provision in the light of local needs and circumstances.

 We are deeply concerned about the overthrow on 15 March of the democratically elected government of the Central African Republic. As the first successful coup d'etat in Africa in over three years, it is a serious retrograde step. We condemn it unequivocally, as we condemn any unconstitutional seizure of power. We support the European Union declaration of 21 March that urges the resumption of political dialogue and early progress towards the restoration of the democratic process. We call on all parties in the region to support these aims and to respect the territorial integrity of the country.

 There have been no recent ministerial discussions with the Kenyan authorities on small arms proliferation, but we have supported their efforts to tackle the problem, both regionally and nationally. Following the signing of the Nairobi Declaration on Small Arms in March 2000, the UK committed significant resources to support the Nairobi Declaration Secretariat. We have also provided the Kenyan police with equipment to help destroy weapons. On 15 March there was a public destruction of 1,000 illegally held weapons.

 Half of the administration subsidy for both housing benefit and council tax benefit is funded through a grant from the Department for Work and Pensions. This is allocated to individual local authorities using a formula agreed in consultation with the local authority associations. The formula takes account of the size of the caseload and the complexity of housing benefit cases, with elements for accommodation and staffing costs. The remaining half is funded by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Executive through the Revenue Support Grant (Grant Aided Expenditure in Scotland) within their local government finance settlements.

<P>

<a name="30403w15.html_para6">Actual expenditure on the administration of these benefits, as reported by local authorities, exceeds the total subsidy provided by central Government. Local authorities account for their expenditure in very different ways. For example, some will include a portion of central charges for administrative costs that will have little to do with housing benefit administration in their housing benefit costs, some will provide a cost net of additional grants from the Department. Because the data reported by authorities do not reflect a uniform accounting standard across authorities, reported expenditure across all authorities may not be directly comparable with the grants paid figures.

 <i>(a)</i> Uprating of benefits by RPI ensures that claimants' benefit incomes rise at least in line with the rise in cost of living. Some benefits will be uprated by more than prices from April. For example, retirement pension will be uprated by 2.6 per cent., giving a pensioner on full state pension an extra &#163;100 a year, and the minimum income guarantee by earnings (4 per cent.).
<P>

<a name="30403w16.html_para0"><i>(b)</i> Income-related benefits, excluding the minimum income guarantee, are uprated by the Rossi index, which is the RPI excluding housing costs and local taxes. This is because housing costs and local taxes are met through separate hypothecated benefits, for example housing benefit for rent. The impact of RPI itself on income-related benefits depends on the relative values of the two indices, but since any marginal increases in eligible rents and council taxes are almost always met in full by increased benefits, most claimants will see their benefits rise at least in line with the cost of living.

<i>[holding answers 28 March 2003]:</i> The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the independent scientific advisory group the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) have kept the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants under close review since authorisation, it is normal practice for the CSM to convene an expert group to consider particular issues. The meeting of the ad hoc expert working group of 21 November 2002 was primarily convened to hear a presentation of the research of Dr. David Healy. Members of the Medicines Act advisory committees, such as the CSM, are required to follow a code of practice relating to declarations of interests in the pharmaceutical industry. The code is applied where members attend meetings of expert working groups and this was the case on 21 November 2002.
<P>

<a name="30403w18.html_para3">A new CSM expert group is being appointed to conduct further review of SSRIs and appropriate membership is being considered in light of issues raised at the meeting and the further work these will require, as well as further legal advice on interests in the particular circumstances of this class review.
<P>

<a name="30403w18.html_para4">Officials at the MCA are in contact with members of the Seroxat Users Group and have taken the views of the group into account.

 The Department of Health no longer has traditional civil service grades, but has paybands into which all posts fall.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30403w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Community pharmacists play a vital role in the national health service and in local communities more generally. They dispense around 600 million NHS prescriptions a year. They provide advice on minor ailments and sell a wide range of medicines which help people take care of their own health. They are increasingly involved in a range of additional services, including detailed advice to patients and to doctors on the use of medicines, smoking cessation schemes, and supervised consumption of methadone by drug misusers. The first repeat dispensing schemes, under which community pharmacists will supply repeat medication for up to a year, will begin shortly.
<P>

<a name="30403w19.html_para1">Later this year, the first pharmacists will become supplementary prescribers. We want to see an increased role for community pharmacists in providing services to NHS patients and we are currently developing a new contractual framework to make that happen. We also want to improve access and choice, so that more NHS patients can use the skills of community pharmacists for advice, information and services.

<P>
<a name="30403w19.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill, introduced to the House on 12 March, proposes that each primary care trust (PCT) be given a duty to provide or secure the provision of primary dental services in its area to the extent that it considers reasonable to do so and be given the financial resources to do this. These financial resources are currently managed centrally. It is the intention of the Bill that local commissioning will give PCTs levers that they do not currently have to influence the provision of oral health services in their areas, rural or otherwise.
<P>

<a name="30403w19.html_para5">The Bill also puts in place a framework by which it will be possible to pay dentists differently. Under the proposed arrangements, primary care dentists would be able to spend more time with their patients and focus on prevention and health promotion as well as treatment. It is anticipated that this will make national health service dentistry a more attractive option for dentists and that they will be encouraged to remain within the NHS or increase their NHS commitment.

<a name="30403w22.html_para4">In 1997, the latest year for which there is data, it was estimated that treating illness and disease caused by smoking costs the national health service in England up to &#163;1.7 billion every year in terms of general practitioner visits, prescriptions, treatment and operations <sup>1</sup> . No comparable information is available for the remainder of the UK.
<P>

<a name="30403w22.html_para5">It is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the cost to the NHS per smoker from these data, as costs are incurred not just for current smokers but also for ex-smokers and those affected by passive smoking.

 The Government wants to increase the number of smoke-free environments. We have worked closely with the hospitality trade to develop a Public Places Charter designed provide customers with clear information on the type of smoking policy operating in a particularestablishment and allow them to make an informed choice.
<P>

<a name="30403w22.html_para6">As part of ensuring people have the information to make an informed choice we are developing education and information resources to raise awareness and understanding of the risks associated with passive smoking.
<P>

<a name="30403w22.html_para7">This includes increasing the visibility of health messages highlighting to smokers the risks environmental tobacco smoke presents. This is through regulations to transpose into UnitedKingdom law the European Union directive on the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products. These regulations require tobacco products to carry larger and starker health warnings, on both the front and back of the packet. The dangers of passive smoking are highlighted in two of the new warnings, which include "Smoking seriously harms you and others around you" and "Protect children: don't make them breathe your smoke" The contents of tobacco smoke are also highlighted in a warning saying, "Smoke contains benzene, nitrosomines, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide".

<P>

<a name="30403w22.html_para8">We are also encouraging all employers to introduce smoke-free work places. This year the Department is funding local tobacco control alliances across England to carry out projects in close co-operation with local employers to tackle passive smoking and to increase the number of smoke-free environments. These projects vary in nature from the production of smoke-free guides to pubs and restaurants to the provision of advice and support to managers wishing to introduce policies. We hope that many will be suitable for national application.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what research her Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated into the effect of conditional fee agreements on legal services, with particular reference to access to justice. [106198]<P>

 My Department has a comprehensive research programme into the impact of CFAs. The first report was published in July 2002 on the "The impact of conditional fees on the selection, handling and outcomes of personal injury cases" by Paul Fenn, Alistair Gray, Neil Rickman and Howard Carrier. This study analysed cases that closed prior to the introduction of the April 2000 Access Justice Reforms and produced baseline data for assessing the effects of changes in recoverability rules and for charting developments in the mechanisms being used to fund personal injury claims.
<P>

<a name="30403w26.html_para0">My Department recently commissioned further research that will consider the effects of making success fees and after-the-event insurance premiums recoverable. The study will also consider the handling of clinical negligence cases and investigate the role being played by funding mechanisms in these cases and review experience in relation to funding mechanisms in other European jurisdictions.
<P>

<a name="30403w26.html_para1">The research has started and is due to be completed in the summer of 2004.
