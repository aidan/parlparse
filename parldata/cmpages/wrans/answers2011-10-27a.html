 The Department's estimate is that general practitioners currently provide around 75%, of all contraception in England. The majority of this is through the national general practitioner contract and it also includes any locally commissioned provision by primary care trusts (PCTs). We expect no change in the proportion of contraception provided through the national general practitioner contract as a result of our proposals for improving public health. Subject to the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill responsibility for decisions on locally commissioned contraceptive provision outside the national general practitioner contract moves from PCTs to local authorities from 1 April 2013.</p>

 In 2004, the Government introduced a single definition of domestic violence replacing the previous 14 different definitions in use across government and the public sector. The current cross-government definition defines domestic violence as “any incident of threatening behaviour, violence or abuse (psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional) between adults who are or have been intimate partners or family members, regardless of gender or sexuality” and this definition is used in my Department's Staff Handbook. There are no qualifications to the definition.</p>

 The Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund (ALSF) was managed by DEFRA and discontinued at the end of the financial year ending March 2011. The decision was taken as part of the spending review settlement in October 2010 in a very tight spending context where we had to look very carefully across all the Department's priorities to see where we can make best use of available funds in keeping with the Government's priority of cutting the deficit.</p>

 All species of bats are afforded a very high level of protection through transposition of the EU Habitats Directive into UK law; this includes making it an offence to deliberately capture, injure or kill a bat or to damage or destroy a breeding or resting site. In addition, the very best sites for populations of greater and lesser horseshoe bats have been given further protection as sites of special scientific interest and special areas of conservation. Natural England works with landowners within agri-environment schemes to enhance the environment for both the lesser and greater horseshoe bat. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee and Natural England also provide financial support to the Bat Conservation Trust to co-ordinate the National Bat Monitoring Programme, which in turn provides annual population trend data. The latest data from 2010 suggests that the population of both species is increasing steadily.</p>

General inspections are carried out every two years and more detailed principal inspections are undertaken every six years.

 Commission Communication (2000) 1, of 2 February 2000, outlines the European Commission's approach to using the precautionary principle and establishes Commission guidelines for applying it, among other aims. This communication stresses the need for the precautionary principle to be considered within a structured approach which is made up of risk assessment, risk management and risk communication. In the communication the Commission recognises that one way of applying the precautionary principle is through the Community rules for prior approval of certain products before they are placed on the market, such as in the case of pesticides.</p>

This will include an assessment of the toxicity of each product and the ways in which spray operators, the public or environment may be exposed to it. CRD routinely restrict the way products can be used (e.g. specifying dose rates, timing and place of application) to ensure protection of human health and the environment. Pesticide users are also legally obliged to take all reasonable precautions to protect the health of human beings, creatures and plants. As part of its role, CRD considers relevant scientific studies as they arise to see if they are relevant to UK authorisation, and continues to keep abreast of research and developments in other EU member states and elsewhere.</p>

 The current legislative framework is intended to provide a balance between rights and responsibilities for landlords and tenants. We therefore have no plans to change tenure arrangements in the sector. Private rents are market led and, therefore, significantly driven by housing supply. Excessive regulation would drive up rents and reduce choice for tenants. Rent controls, historically, resulted in the size of the private rented sector shrinking from 55% of households in 1939 to just 8% in the late 1980s. Rent controls also meant that many landlords could not afford to improve or maintain their homes.</p>

 No. The entire ethos of philanthropy is built around the relationship between the donor and the cause or institution they support, it is not for Government to seek to mediate that relationship, nor the funds involved. We are instead working to strengthen fundraising skills and boost levels of giving across all regions of England. We have established a £100 million match funding programme to create endowments and cultivate philanthropy. We have introduced new tax measures to incentivise legacy giving and gifts of pre-eminent objects to public collections. We have strengthened public recognition for those who give, including through the honours system. We have arranged master classes across the country by world-leading fundraisers, and we have published a Giving White Paper. All of these measures will benefit the entire country.</p>

 Out of a total of £271.6 million paid by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority in 2010-11, at least £15.2 million was paid to people with unspent convictions. These figures only reflect cases where CICA reduced the award due to unspent convictions, which the current compensation scheme says they must do. But there are cases still being considered under previous schemes that did not make such reductions compulsory, so the real figures are likely to be higher.</p>

 Providers of probation services in England and Wales will be subject to the requirements of the Probation Qualification Framework (PQF) in the same way as Probation Trusts. This means that they will be obliged to provide induction training for all offender facing staff and professional qualification training for Probation Services Officers (PSO), Probation Officers or equivalent staff. The quality of the training will be assessed by the Probation Qualification Assurance Board as part of the contract monitoring process.</p>

However, in order to protect their identity, the appointments of former members of the security and intelligence agencies are generally not made public, although the appointments of the most senior officials whose identity is already in the public domain have been published on the Committee's website.</p>

 Access to Work provides vital support to help disabled people get and keep employment. We want as many disabled people as possible to know this support is available. The recent Sayce review recommended changes that will increase the number of people who are able to benefit from Access to Work and raise awareness about its availability among disabled people and employers. A public consultation following the review has just closed and we will be considering ideas and reactions from that consultation and publishing a statement in due course.</p>

               <a name="1110287000045"> During the Sayce consultation period two Access to Work events were held, one in Manchester for Third Sector organisations and Access to Work Users and a further meeting in London for employers of disabled people. The attendee list at both events was extensive and featured many recognisable names.</p>

This delivers the commitments in the coalition programme to reform Access to Work, so that disabled people can apply for jobs with funding already secured for any adaptations and equipment they will need.</p>

But it is possible the UK would be granted some form of preferential access, whereby UK business would pay less than the full MFN tariff. In either case, tariff payments would also depend on the precise pattern of trade in any given year. In addition, estimating the extra administrative burdens associated with completing customs declarations, claiming preferential tariff treatment or other non-tariff costs of exporting goods and services to the EU could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

My Department is working with DFE and DWP on the Participation Strategy, which will be published in November and set out how we intend to maximise the number of young people in education training and employment.

Universities and colleges that charge more than £6,000 for tuition will need new access agreements that demonstrate to the satisfaction of the independent Director of Fair Access what more they will do to attract and retain students from under-represented and disadvantaged groups. They will also need to participate in the new National Scholarship Programme from 2012 and provide matched funding.</p>
