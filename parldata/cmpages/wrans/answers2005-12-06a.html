 Anyone who keeps poultry has an obligation to report signs of illness in their birds, and must know what to do about an avian influenza notifiable disease: this includes operating adequate biosecurity, and consulting their vet.

<a name="stpa_0">My department has distributed guidance material to our partners in the industry who are helping to distribute this material to their members, who cover the great majority of birds. We have also produced a simple one-page leaflet on biosecurity and surveillance for smaller concerns and back-yard keepers. This was posted on our website and sent out to organisations representing the industry to send on to their members.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51206w01.html_spnew2"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The bee health programme is funded from the Departmental vote. Funding is allocated in order to achieve the best available value for money in achieving the Department&#039;s objectives.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps her Department <i>(a)</i> has taken and <i>(b)</i> is planning to take to safeguard bee health against the threat of the varroa mite.  [34610]</p>




<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51206w01.html_spnew3"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 DEFRA (and MAFF before it) has been helping the beekeeping sector to better equip itself to manage varroa infestations ever since the pest was first discovered in England in 1992. The Department has funded a range of measures delivered by the National Bee Unit, including the provision of a free diagnostic and inspection service to beekeepers and a comprehensive training and advisory programme, as well as R&D.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Although varroa continues to pose challenges to contemporary beekeeping particularly with the development of mite resistance to chemical treatments, it is now endemic in the UK and has been for several years. The Department has issued a consultation document on plans to remove the mite from the list of notifiable diseases in March 2006. However, the National Bee Unit will continue to offer advice to beekeepers about its management and control, as it does now for other serious but non-statutory diseases.

 Information on the removal of tree tops and branch wood for use as fuel following conventional timber harvesting operations is not routinely collected.

 Meticillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) in animals has been specifically discussed at the Defra Antimicrobial Resistance Co-ordination (DARC) Group, which is led by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) and includes the Department of Health (DH) membership. The VMD held a meeting in 2004 involving DARC group members, and external specialists in MRSA, to consider how the issue should be addressed. It was decided to turn this group into a MRSA sub group of DARC. There have been two meetings of this MRSA sub group in 2005, in January and in July and a position statement on (MRSA) in animals is available on the web at http://defraweb/animalh/diseases/zoonoses/mrsa.htm

The earlier phases of the development have no planning conditions that require the A1 to be widened. However, in order for the later stages to be built the developer would have to fund the widening of a section of the A1 Western Bypass immediately adjacent to the development&#151;between Ponteland Road and North Brunton Junctions&#151;from two to three lanes in each direction, a distance of 4 kilometres. This would be under the provision of a S278 agreement which is equivalent to S106, but for a trunk road not a local road.

 The Blue Badge scheme is a European and national scheme offering parking concessions primarily for disabled people with severe walking difficulties who travel as drivers or passengers. The scheme applies to on-street parking only.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w10.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_52">The Blue Badge scheme does not apply to off-street car parks, private roads or at most airports. Charges for and conditions of use in off-street car parks, which are likely to be privately owned and managed, are a matter for the landowner. It is unlikely that spaces in such off-street car parks marked for blue badge holders are legally enforceable and the regulation of such parking is at the discretion of landowners and depends on the courtesy and consideration of drivers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w10.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_53">It is the Department for Transport&#039;s view that it is possible in law for the owners of a private car park to agree with the local authority that a parking place order be made in respect of that car park. Conditions of use can then be enforced as if it were a local authority car park, with penalties or excess charges levied on offenders. It would, therefore, be an offence under the Traffic Regulation Order rather the Blue Badge regulations.

Motoring costs include expenditure on car purchase, spares, maintenance, insurance, taxation, fuel and parking, but excludes costs paid by employers.

 The Government have, with the support of all sides of the House, brought forward a reform of general fire safety legislation in the form of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (SI 2005 No. 1541). The Select Committees that considered the draft order (the Regulatory Reform Committee and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in another place) considered that continuance of the necessary protections afforded by the Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations Regulations 1989 (as amended) by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 could be demonstrated by guidance. The Government are firmly of the view that all necessary protections are either continued or enhanced by the new regime. However, in the light of the consideration given by the hon. and noble Members of the Committees, the Government decided to withdraw revocation of the 1989 regulations until such time as guidance was in place which shows how the protections are continued.

<a name="stpa_86">Although the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is convinced that the case is made, we always listen to concerns about fire safety. We therefore propose to run the new regime in tandem with the old so that ample evidence of the efficiency and broad ranging nature of the new regime can be shown. Once that evidence has been gathered we expect to proceed to remove the 1989 regulations. However, the evidence shows there to be a gap, or a problem we have not foreseen, then we will work to make sure any such gap or risk is fully addressed before the 1989 regulations are removed.

 Attendance in learning over the age of 16 is voluntary. However our aim is that all young people should stay in learning up to age 19, and continue in learning throughout life, to secure the skills that they, and the economy, need. Participation and attendance in post-16 education and training depends on the quality, relevance, effectiveness and perceived value of the provision and outcomes for each learner alongside sound information, advice, guidance and pastoral care.

 The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 recognise the different needs of pupils in day and residential schools. A greater provision is required in the latter because washroom facilities must be located near to sleeping accommodation, with easy access, in addition to the facilities required convenient to teaching accommodation. Some of the daytime provision may count towards that required for boarders if it is in an appropriate location and offers good access to residential pupils.

However, the Department&#039;s design team is producing new design guidance for extended schools. This does say that additional facilities may be needed to cope with a wider range of adult and child users, and gives the example of additional adult toilets being needed in a primary school. This should be published early in 2006. A review of the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 has not been undertaken and is not currently planned.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what action he is taking to ensure that International Monetary Fund conditions allow increases in spending of money provided by the IMF on health in countries fighting HIV/AIDS.  [34783]</p>




<p><a name="st_286"><a name="51206w31.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 DFID is working with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other donors to improve the predictability of aid flows, the effectiveness of IMF signalling, and countries own expenditure management capacity. This will ensure that countries are better able to plan for increased spending in health and other key sectors identified in their Poverty Reduction Strategies, while maintaining the fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability which are essential to long term growth and poverty reduction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w31.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_216">DFID has supported a series of High Level Meetings on the health related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) over the past 18 months. These meetings have brought together senior representatives of Ministries of Health and Finance from developing countries, donors and international organisations including the World Bank and the IMF. The meetings have looked to develop solutions to the systematic barriers to faster progress in realising the MDGs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w31.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_217">The IMF&#039;s focus is appropriately, on maintaining fiscal sustainability and overall macroeconomic stability, as an essential underpinning to planned Government programmes and economic growth. Within these objectives, DFID has worked with the IMF on the issue of creating &#039;fiscal space&#039;&#151;that is increasing the financial scope for countries to expand their allocations to provide critical services such as health and HIV/AIDS services. The IMF has led much of this work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w31.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_218">The UK has also worked with the IMF to improve its role in &#039;signalling&#039; and donor co-ordination. The unpredictability of future aid flows from donors is a significant constraint on countries&#039; ability to plan future spending, creating uncertainty about both overall budgets, and about the availability of resources to finance individual programmes, including in the health sector. The IMF has a role to play in supporting countries&#039; own budget processes, and in working with donors to improve the predictability of their aid.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w31.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_219">The UK is pushing for greater predictability and less volatility of aid and longer-term financial commitments. This would provide confidence to Ministries of Finance to establish more ambitious financial frameworks and take on the long term recurrent costs associated with, for example, scaling up comprehensive HIV/responses. Malawi is a good example where the IMF has worked effectively with the Ministry of Finance to support the implementation of an ambitious emergency human resource programme for health.

The framework had clear recommendations around the importance of ensuring medicines, including ARVs, were available in appropriate paediatric formulations. In the context of this work, DFID has convened a series of meetings with the industry, at which this issue has been addressed.

<a name="stpa_225">More does need to be done to ensure a long-term supply of affordable paediatric drugs for the treatment of HIV and AIDS in developing countries. We will therefore continue our work with the pharmaceutical industry, to support appropriate use of TRIPS and to increase R and D investment, and work to ensure that children are able to access the drugs they need in the formulations they need.

 Between 1997 and 2001, DFID funded over 1,000 housing units in Montserrat for displaced residents. Further housing assistance, agreed with the Government of Montserrat (GoM) in October 2001, focused on provision of 200 serviced residential lots, sheltered housing for the elderly and mentally ill, a self-build materials grant scheme for poorer households, and refurbishment of temporary housing. Additional support, including the preparation of serviced lots and the construction of 60 houses, is being funded by the European Union.

<a name="stpa_226">Most displaced residents, who remained on the island, now have satisfactory accommodation. However, some still live in sub-standard conditions; and inadequate access to permanent housing is cited as one of the major factors deterring displaced Montserratians overseas from returning.

<a name="stpa_227">DFID officials held talks in Montserrat in November about the outstanding needs, especially improving housing for the most vulnerable and those still living in shelters. We will be reviewing our assistance in the light of those discussions.

<p><a name="st_289"><a name="51206w32.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 Volcanic activity on Montserrat is monitored on a day to day basis by the staff of the Montserrat Volcano Observatory, which is run under contract by the British Geological Survey. Their reports are analysed at regular intervals by a Scientific Advisory Committee. The resulting information and advice is conveyed to the Governor and the Montserrat Government, as well as to residents, visitors and other interested groups. It is fully taken into account in all development plans. The most obvious outcome has been the focusing of development activities in the &#039;safe zone&#039; in the north of the island.

 The responsibility for such issues rests with the Turks and Caicos Island authorities. Between 2001 and March 2005, however, we funded an

His responsibilities included provision of advice on tourism development control and the formulation of policies relating specifically to development activities within protected areas. The Turks and Caicos Islands graduated from the need for UK development assistance in March of this year.
