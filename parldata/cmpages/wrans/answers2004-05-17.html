 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to update computer <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;hardware and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;software standard packages used in her Department.  [166363]</p>








<p><a name="40517w01.html_spnew0"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The wide range of Defra&#039;s responsibilities and its geographic spread result in a variety of computer hardware and software being employed. These are constantly reviewed and updated where necessary in order to ensure they continue to meet business requirements, offer value for money and are fully supportable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w01.html_para0">
The supply of computer hardware and software standard packages to Defra is currently subject to an outsourcing procurement exercise.

<p><a name="40517w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Hoyle: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the use of the red tractor logo on food produced in the UK.  [172451]</p>








<p><a name="40517w01.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Red Tractor logo is privately owned and its use on food is licensed by a private company, Assured Food Standards (AFS). The logo denotes foods which comply with standards of production set by AFS or by schemes that AFS has recognised as being equivalent. The Government plays no part in setting those standards nor in validating its operations.

At the Eighth Conference of the Parties to the Convention (COPS) in New Delhi, in October-November 2002, the Parties adopted a five-year non-binding Article 6 work programme, known as the New Delhi Work Programme to steer Parties towards implementation of Article 6. As part of this, UK officials are currently involved in the planning stage of a web-based internet clearing house that will act as hub for public users to find out information on Article 6 related activities carried out by different countries.

<a name="40517w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Milk (Lancashire)</h3>





<p><a name="40517w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Hoyle: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many milk&nbsp;processing companies in Lancashire are available for farmers in Lancashire to sell the milk they produce.  [172072]</p>








<p><a name="40517w01.html_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 There are 112 milk processing establishments in Lancashire, approved under the Dairy&nbsp;Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1995. However, producers are not restricted to delivering their milk to purchasers or processors within their county. Farmers in Lancashire can therefore deliver their milk to milk processing companies outside Lancashire.

<p><a name="40517w01.html_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 To date no applications for Quality status has been received from parish councils or town councils in Lancashire or Chorley. However, the Lancashire and Mersey County Training Partnership

<p><a name="40517w01.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the total annual cost of her Department&#039;s websites, including those of its agencies, was in the most recent year for which figures are available.  [159514]</p>








<p><a name="40517w01.html_spnew6"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The use of websites is now a mainstream of communication for any organisation in the public sector or the private sector and for business units throughout any large organisation. Direct operating costs for the main Defra website (www. defra.gov.uk)&#151;including technical and staff costs associated with hosting of the site, and staff costs for the central team with lead responsibility for updating and maintaining the content of the site&#151;are estimated at around &#163;294,000 for the financial year 2003&#150;04.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w01.html_para6">
Additional costs arise from the activities of a large number of staff in business units across the Department, contributing to the content of the website as part of their communications activities, but an overall cost for this could not be accurately estimated without incurring disproportionate cost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w01.html_para7">
A number of other websites are operated by the Department and its agencies, for which costs are either covered by the budgets for specific programmes (and not separately identified), or included within the above figures. Detailed information is not held centrally for other websites managed by the Department, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies, and could not be obtained without incurring disproportionate cost.

<a name="40517w01.html_dpthd1"><h3 align=center>CULTURE, MEDIA AND SPORT</h3>

<a name="40517w01.html_sbhd7"><h3 align=center>Community Sports</h3>





<p><a name="40517w01.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on the effects of Government expenditure policy on community sports since 1994.  [173478]</p>








<p><a name="40517w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The Government has invested over &#163;3&nbsp;billion Exchequer and lottery funding in sport since 1997. Government policy is to marry mass participation with sporting excellence, as illustrated by the 45 County Sports Partnerships, comprising local authorities, schools, governing bodies of sport and the voluntary sector, established to generate competitive and grass roots sport. Community sport has also benefited from unprecedented investment in facilities, improving community access. To complement this, the Government is investing in coaching and volunteering to deliver community activities. For children and young people the Government is investing almost &#163;120&nbsp;million this year to deliver the entitlement to high quality PE and School Sport.

<a name="40517w01.html_sbhd8"><h3 align=center>Licensing Act</h3>





<p><a name="40517w01.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Austin Mitchell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what consultations were held with the police about the effects of binge drinking on local alcohol and violence problems before the introduction of the Licensing Act 2003; and what consultations are going on now about its implementation.  [173665]</p>









<p><a name="40517w01.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Prior to the publication of the White Paper on licensing reform in April 2000 (Cm 4696), the Association of Chief Police Officers (&quot;ACPO&quot;) were thoroughly consulted on the related development of the policy. Following the publication of the White Paper, ACPO, the Association of Police Superintendents&#039; Association and the Police Federation engaged in the public consultation, as well as several individual police forces. In developing the legal instructions for the Licensing Bill, ACPO provided advice to officials in weekly meetings. In July 2002, a Licensing Bill Advisory Group was formed which included a wide range of stakeholders, including ACPO, and assisted the Government in preparing the Bill. The Group met on a weekly basis and continued to meet regularly throughout the Bill&#039;s parliamentary stages. Since Royal Assent in July 2003, this Group has continued to meet on a monthly basis to discuss issues relating to the implementation of the Licensing Act 2003. In addition, during the House of Commons stages of the Licensing Bill, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State also met ACPO to discuss underage drinking and the way in which the Bill dealt with children and the then Minister responsible, the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr.&nbsp;Howells), also met ACPO to discuss other general licensing issues. More recently, I have met the police in a Working Group which is examining issues relating to alcohol related violent crime.

 Investigations by the Royal Military Police Special Investigations Branch into allegations of abuse continue and as I have already informed the House, I cannot put a precise timeframe on how long these might take. As I said, in my statement last week, it is essential that the integrity of the criminal justice process be maintained. This can involve detailed and lengthy processes, but these are crucial to allow the necessary impartial evaluation of the evidence. As I said last week, two cases have reached an advanced stage with decisions on prosecution pending.

 I have assumed that my hon. Friend has in mind the National Audit Office Report on Operation Telic, which reported that approximately 200,000 sets of Enhanced Combat Body Armour had been issued since the Kosovo campaign in 1999, but seemed to have disappeared.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w04.html_para1">
I should explain that the figure quoted in the NAO report was an estimate provided for the NAO inquiry of the equivalent number of sets of body armour that would have been issued since 1999. However, the body armour ensemble is not usually issued as a complete set. Instead, units request the number of components required to make up the sets they need (covers, fillers and ceramic plates). The fillers and covers are accounted for as items of consumable stock and are, therefore, usually disposed of locally when they wear out, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 May 2004 : Column 666W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
although items may be returned to stock and re-issued if undamaged. Due to their value, the plates, when surplus to unit requirements and serviceable, are returned to stock for re-issue as the need arises.

<p>
<a name="40517w04.html_para2">
In light of the concern raised about the supply of body armour, the Defence Logistics Organisation conducted an audit of Enhanced Combat Body Armour The audit has provided a picture of our current holdings. It shows that current stock holdings account for 66&nbsp;per cent. of the total number of Enhanced Combat Body Armour components procured since 1992.

 The Ministry of Defence has studied the Amnesty International report &#039;So does it mean that we have the rights?&#151;Protecting the Human Rights of Women and Girls Trafficked for Forced Prostitution in Kosovo&#039;. The report&#039;s findings are a matter of grave concern. The Government condemns the exploitation of vulnerable people, and expects UK military personnel to adhere to the rules for conduct on operations. Military personnel breaking these rules are dealt with under the relevant military disciplinary procedures and, depending on the offence, UK criminal law. With the exception of two cases where, as the report recognises disciplinary measures were taken, we are not aware of any involvement of UK military personnel in the activities the report describes.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what proportion of the savings projected from the transfer of functions from RAF Boulmer to RAF Scampton are assumed to derive from savings in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;personnel costs, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;maintenance and infrastucture running costs and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;depreciation and capital charges.

<p><a name="40517w05.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Prime Minister&#039;s letter of 21&nbsp;April to the right hon. Member explained that the estimated net running cost saving from the transfer of functions from RAF Boulmer to RAF Scampton is &#163;13&nbsp;million a year. Some three fifths of this is attributable to personnel costs and one fifth to maintenance and infrastructure running costs.

The Government&#039;s position in those cases is that ECHR rights have no application in Iraq. The applicability of the Geneva Conventions and of UN Security Council Resolution 1511 are not matters that turn upon whether jurisdiction is being exercised. Resolution 1511 is a binding Security Council resolution and therefore binds the UK and all other UN member states. The mandate given to the multi-national force to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq in resolution 1511 applies to UK forces in those areas where they are operating. The UK accepts that the Geneva Conventions apply to the conduct of UK forces engaged in an armed conflict and that in some areas of southern Iraq, UK forces are exercising sufficient control as an occupying force for the purpose of the application of the Geneva Convention IV.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs pursuant to his answer of 10&nbsp;May 2004, on targeted assassinations, question reference 169853, on what basis the Government has determined that the policy of targeted assassinations by the Government of Israel is illegal.

<p><a name="40517w08.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 We recognise Israel&#039;s right to defend itself against terrorism but it must act in accordance with the applicable law. We do not consider that Israel&#039;s policy of targeted killings is in conformity with its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention and international human rights law. In particular, the policy does not appear to meet the conditions required for a killing to be justified as self-defence.

<p><a name="40517w08.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I have had no specific representations concerning the pay gap between men and women in Hampshire. However I have ongoing dialogue with trade unions, employers and others including the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) and Opportunity Now concerning action to tackle the gender pay gap. For example, last week I met with over 40 trade union women from across the country to discuss this issue and identify action which builds on what we have already achieved. We have made it easier for employers to pay fairly through EOC toolkits, which have been well received. Recent EOC research shows a significant increase in the number of large organisations undertaking pay reviews which suggest we are on track to meet our Public Service Agreement target of 35&nbsp;per cent. by April 2006. 41&nbsp;per cent. of those that had carried out a pay review or were planning to do one said that government policy and publicity had influenced them.

 To ask the Minister for Women pursuant to the answer of 26&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 486W, on equal pay, what methodology was used to conclude that the gender pay gap in the South East is the second biggest in Great Britain.  [171710]</p>









<p><a name="40517w08.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 The figure I reported on 26&nbsp;February 2004 was based on April 2002 figures. Using April 2003 figures shows that the South East had the third largest pay gap of regions in Great Britain. The figures in both cases were taken from the New Earnings Survey (NES), conducted by the Office for National Statistics.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w08.html_para0">
Average earnings are estimated for full-time employees on adult rates of pay whose pay was unaffected by absence during the pay period, by their place of work. This is the standard definition used for NES tables. The gender pay gap for each region is derived from the male and female estimates for those regions.

<p><a name="40517w08.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I have commissioned no specific research into the impact of a long working hours culture on women&#039;s employment and promotion prospects, however last year my Department published &quot;Working Long Hours: a review of the evidence&quot; which was commissioned from the Institute for Employment Studies. It is available on the internet at hppt://www.dti.gov.uk/er/emar.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w08.html_para1">
Its main findings are that 11&nbsp;per cent. of employees in the UK work long hours (over 48 hours per week). There are clear gender differences with men more likely 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 May 2004 : Column 680W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
to work long hours than women. Two thirds of women who work long hours are in managerial and professional occupations (23&nbsp;per cent. and 40&nbsp;per cent. respectively).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w08.html_para2">
Through the Work-Life Balance Campaign and the introduction of the right to request flexible working, my Department has sought to demonstrate the benefits of alternative work patterns. Employers who pursue family friendly policies and provide their employees with choice about how they work, report greater motivation and productivity and a reduction in recruitment and retention costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w08.html_para3">
In April my Department published research complied by the Office for National Statistics on the first year of the flexible working law. It showed that overall the new flexible working law is proving to have been a huge success. Many more flexible working requests (86&nbsp;per cent.) are being either fully or partly accepted by employers compared to the rate immediately prior to the new law (77&nbsp;per cent.). The study can be found at the website mentioned above. 11&nbsp;per cent. of flexible working requests made since April 2003 were declined, which represents a near halving of the rate of refusal by employers compared with the previous two years. And it suggests the new law has significantly increased employers&#039; willingness to consider employee requests.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w08.html_para4">
The Second Work-Life Balance Baseline Survey of Employers published in 2003 showed that more than nine out of 10 employers agree that people will work best when they can strike a healthy balance between work and the rest of their lives. The report is also available at the website mentioned above. The report also revealed an increase in the provision of flexible working time practices by employers. Significantly this increase was not confined to workplaces of a particular size or in a particular sector or industry.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps her Department has taken to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;export the UK model of co-operation between Government, police and industry to tackle child pornography on the internet.  [173047]</p>








<p><a name="40517w08.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The Department of Trade and Industry attaches great importance to protecting children from illegal or harmful material on the internet. The Government are primarily addressing it through the Home Secretary&#039;s Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet. The Department takes part in the activities of the Task Force, and in particular, supports cooperation between Government, law enforcement, industry and other stakeholders to develop self-regulatory responses to problems arising, in order to strengthen the take-up of the internet and the growth of e-commerce. We strongly support the work of the industry-led Internet Watch Foundation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w08.html_para5">
Child protection on the internet is a common challenge in the UK, Europe and the rest of the world. The UK&#039;s approach has served as the model for the EU&#039;s main programme to tackle it, the Safer Internet Programme. Since 1999, Safer Internet has funded 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 May 2004 : Column 681W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
over&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130 projects across Europe bringing together Government, industry, law enforcement and child protection agencies in the following streams of activity:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">hotlines: Safer Internet supports at least one hotline along the lines of the UK&#039;s Internet Watch Foundation in each of 17 countries in Europe, allowing users to report internet content they regard as illegal or harmful. INHOPE, based in the UK, is the European hotline coordinating body, responsible for monitoring standards and spreading best practice for these hotlines.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">rating and filtering technology: the programme encourages the development of software that empowers users to filter or otherwise limit the amount of unwanted material they receive, as well as ways to measure and benchmark its performance.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">promoting cooperation: it has created European-level forums to drive consensus on the challenges and solutions among experts from industry, law enforcement, government, educators, consumer groups, child welfare and other NGOs.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">raising awareness: support is offered to initiatives at country, regional or other levels to inform parents and educators of means to use the internet more safely, using techniques based largely on practice developed by members of the Home Office Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w08.html_para6">
UK companies and NGOs are very well represented among the participants in the various projects, and some of them act as coordinators at European level (e.g. for best practice for ways of promoting awareness of self-help techniques).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w08.html_para7">
In March 2004, the European Commission adopted a proposal for Safer Internet Plus, a programme to continue these activities for the next four years. It will increase the international reach of the UK&#039;s model approach because it will particularly encourage hotlines and awareness activity in the 10 new member states, and provide resources for the EU to pursue effective cooperation and solutions in international forums and with third countries, especially those which are the origins of a large proportion of illegal, harmful or unwanted material, such as child pornography and spam.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w08.html_para8">
The Government also take opportunities to raise the profile of a cooperative approach to online child protection in international discussions: for example, at the conclusion of the first phase of the United Nations sponsored World Summit on the Information Society in December 2003, the UK, working with its EU partners, strongly supported a statement to the effect that

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;all actors in the Information Society should take appropriate actions and preventive measures, as determined by law, against abusive uses of ICTs, such as .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all forms of child abuse, including paedophilia and child pornography .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot; (Declaration of Principles, para. 59).</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w08.html_para9">
As part of its strategy to promote a globally competitive environment for electronic communications businesses, the Department has developed a number of dialogues with other countries&#039; regulators, officials and industry representatives. These discussions have frequently covered the implications of offensive or harmful online material. The Internet Watch Foundation and other leading UK players take part to give a first hand account of the UK&#039;s cooperative approach, and also actively pursue their own extensive international contacts, supported wherever possible by the Department of Trade and Industry and other Departments. In addition, meetings recently arranged or to take place within the framework of dialogues with the United States, Japan

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development (1) what the changes are to survey methods and the revisions to statistical estimates in relation to the poverty reduction target for South Asia referred to on page 186 of the 2004 departmental report;  [171711]

</p>



<p>(2) what the changes in statistical methodologies are which make it impossible to measure firm progress on the target for sustainable poverty reduction in East Asia and the Pacific.  [171704]</p>








<p><a name="40517w10.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 The 2000 poverty data are not directly comparable with the 1998 baseline data in these two regions because of significant changes to the raw data used to estimate the poverty figures. This, combined with the inherent uncertainty associated with the data and the small time period being considered, means the available data does not allow an accurate assessment of progress. However, the data does point to a reduction in poverty. More details are provided in the following paragraphs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w10.html_para5">
Progress towards these poverty reduction targets is measured using the proportion of the population living in absolute poverty (defined as less than an international $1 a day). The data comes from the World Bank, which publishes estimates in their annual Global Economic Prospects report. Each year the World Bank provides the data for the latest year (currently 2000), and revises the data for 1990.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w10.html_para6">
Estimates for past years can change because additional or updated data is included in the analysis, or the estimation methodology is updated.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 May 2004 : Column 688W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w10.html_para7">
Usually this results in a relatively small change to the data for previous years. However, this year there were substantial changes to the China and India data. These populous countries have a large impact on the East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia regional figures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w10.html_para8">
In China, data on household expenditure instead of income was used for the first time (this has not been available before). Expenditure data is considered more reliable than income data for poverty analysis as expenditure tends to be more accurately reported by households than income. In India, data from an additional household survey was included in the analysis. This additional data, and other more minor methodological changes, resulted in a significant reduction to the poverty figures in East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia for both 1990 and the latest year when compared with the estimates available last year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w10.html_para9">
The World Bank does not currently update figures for the years between the latest year and 1990. Hence we do not have 1998 poverty figures that have been estimated using the additional data sets. This means the 1998 baseline data is not directly comparable with the 2000 data published in the Departmental Report.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w10.html_para10">
There are many problems with the accuracy and reliability of this data. However, it is still the best internationally comparable measure of absolute poverty currently available. DFID is working with the World Bank to improve the quality of this data.

<p><a name="40517w11.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 The Government of Vietnam has made rapid progress in reducing poverty in recent years and in maintaining a high rate of economic growth. The number of people living in poverty halved from 58&nbsp;per cent. in 1993 to 29&nbsp;per cent. in 2002 and economic growth has averaged at approximately 7&nbsp;per cent. over the last 10 years. Despite this, approximately 23&nbsp;million people still live below the poverty line and an estimated 8.8&nbsp;million live in hunger. However, health and education indicators are at similar levels to those normally seen in a country with a per capita income two or three times higher than Vietnam&#039;s.

registration in certain circumstances, for example, where there were concerns about their suitability to look after children. Second, the national standards and associated regulations were revised in September 2003, following a public consultation. Amongst the changes were new rules allowing childminders to care for more babies and preventing them from smacking or smoking in front of the children in their care. At this time we also extended the registration requirements to child care provided by schools, which had previously been exempt.

 Ownership of schools will not usually change when schools are built or refurbished in the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme.

In this case, the Academy Trust&#039; will own the buildings for as long as the Academy remains in operation. If the Academy ceases to exist, ownership of the Academy land, and any buildings on it, will revert to the previous owner, which would be either the LEA or the voluntary aided sector body.

The Office for Standards in Education considers the effectiveness of schools in meeting the needs of all learners and this takes account of the contribution made by SENCOs.

 New standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) came into effect in September 2002 and new induction standards came into force a year later.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w17.html_para3">
In order to be awarded QTS, trainee teachers must demonstrate that they understand their responsibilities under the statutory SEN Code of Practice, know how to seek advice from specialists on less common types of SEN, can differentiate their teaching to meet the needs of pupils, including those with SEN, and can identify and support pupils who experience behavioural, emotional and social difficulties.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w17.html_para4">
The standards for the Induction Support Programme for those awarded QTS require that newly qualified teachers can demonstrate that they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils in their classes with SEN, with or without a statement, and, in consultation with the SEN co-ordinator, contribute to the preparation and implementation of individual education plans or the equivalent.

Based on the best available international research, local strategies adopt a multifaceted approach, which includes a range of measures: to help young people resist peer pressure to have early sex; to improve the quality of sex and relationship education and access to effective contraceptive services; and to involve parents and the wider community.

 The interim findings of an environmental study, undertaken by the Highways Agency, to look at options for improving the length of A417 from Cowley to Brockworth were published in a pamphlet in March 2003. The tunnel option was discarded as a result of its high cost (at around &#163;200&nbsp;million), environmental impact and the implications for road safety. In the light of this the Highways Agency was asked to continue work on various surface options. This work is continuing in liaison with the statutory environmental bodies and other stakeholders.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;Figures are for the financial year 2002&#150;03, the latest date for which data are available.<br>

2.&nbsp;Estimates are for Great Britain.<br>

3.&nbsp;Estimates relate to the status of individuals at the time they were interviewed for the FRS.<br>

4.&nbsp;The estimates are based on sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that control for tenure, council tax band and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to sampling error, and to remaining variability in non-response which is not corrected by the grossing regime.<br>

5.&nbsp;The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income<br>

(that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household).<br>

6.&nbsp;The Households Below Average Income series presents analysis of income of two bases: Before Housing Costs (BHC) and After Housing Costs (AHC). This is principally to take into account variations in housing costs that themselves do not correspond to comparable variations in the quality of housing.<br>

7.&nbsp;Proportions are presented to the nearest per cent, and numbers to the nearest 10,000. Rounding numbers in this way means that compared to other rounding conventions, the distribution is smoother at this level of rounding for the small subset of the population.<br>

8.&nbsp;Deciles nine and 10 have been combined as individually, these deciles contained too few households to provide robust estimates.<br>

It is only at ports where passenger services have ceased that immigration coverage has been withdrawn.

Passengers subject to control will be examined to ascertain whether they qualify for entry to the UK. This examination will include checks against the Immigration Service database.

 From 1&nbsp;May 2004 nationals of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Cyprus and Malta, will no longer be eligible for National Asylum Support Service (NASS) support or for support from a local authority under the Asylum Support (Interim Provisions) Regulations 1999. This is because of the effect of paragraph 5 schedule 3 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Schedule 3 also prohibits local authorities from providing support to European Economic Area (EEA) nationals under other provisions including section 2 of the Local Government Act 2000, section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948 and section 17 of the Children Act 1989. However, schedule 3 does not prevent the exercise of a power or the performance of a duty if, and to the extent that, its exercise or performance is necessary for the purpose of avoiding a breach of a person&#039;s convention rights or a person&#039;s rights under the Community Treaties.

 The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) undertook research to identify the most suitable areas for the dispersal of asylum seekers. The aim was to establish cluster areas where there was already an ethnic minority community or where it was believed the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 May 2004 : Column 755W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
area&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was capable of sustaining a new community. Other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;factors taken into consideration included the availability of support services able to assist newly arrived asylum seekers. It was always acknowledged that not all areas would be suitable for dispersal and, with regard to Northern Ireland, the research identified both a low population of ethnic minorities and a lack of available support services. While the area was not designated as a dispersal area it was agreed that those making their application for asylum in Northern Ireland could remain there if they requested it. Others making their application elsewhere can opt to live with family and friends in Northern Ireland and receive subsistence only support from NASS.

In 1992, following the withdrawal of routine Customs and Excise attendance from ports where they had traditionally operated an immigration control on behalf of the Immigration Service, then Ministers introduced a new policy for immigration coverage of small ports and airports. This policy was later developed with the introduction of new powers in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 enabling a more flexible approach to the operation of the immigration control. Under the Act carriers are obliged to notify the UK Immigration Service in advance of all passengers subject to control. The passengers will then be cleared by the Immigration Service either by attending the port or remotely; the decision being based on all the available intelligence.

The increasing involvement of organised crime in illegal immigration led to the creation in 2000 of Reflex, the multi-agency forum which brings together key law enforcement players including the Immigration Service, as well as relevant Government Departments and the Security Services, under the chair of the National Crime Squad.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w28.html_para30">
Reflex has successfully brought focus to the issue and has also provided funding and structures to tackle the problem both in the UK and overseas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w28.html_para31">
UK funding for two successful infrastructure-building projects in the Western Balkans was provided by Reflex, as was funding for other projects in Romania and Turkey aimed at upstream disruption of illegal migration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w28.html_para32">
As part of a longer-term strategy, the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) manages an expanding network of Immigration Liaison Officers (currently 12) in key overseas posts who work closely with local law enforcement agencies to combat illegal migratory flows.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w28.html_para33">
We have also had in place for some time a network of Airline Liaison Officers (currently 25) working closely with airline staff at key locations worldwide, who offer advice to carriers on the admissibility of passengers seeking to travel to the UK.

I should also point out that the introduction of juxtaposed immigration controls in France, and the deployment of New Detection Technology (x-ray machines and scanners) in France and Belgium have been very successful in identifying and stopping unqualified passengers from travelling on to the UK.

<p><a name="40517w29.html_spnew10"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The period 1997&#150;98 pre-dates National Drug Strategy, during this time the local council and primary care trust allocated funding for tackling drug misuse. Accounting procedures mean that the 1997 figures are no longer available and that 1998 figures are not accessible by the DAT.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w29.html_para17">
In 2003&#150;04 the total drugs allocation was &#163;2,187,607. In order to ensure consistency figures supplied are based on funding streams associated with the National Drug Strategy and are readily verifiable. These funding streams are specifically targeted at tackling the harm caused to individuals, families and communities by the misuse of drugs. Other mainstream funding is made available at a local level, this varies and both in amount and origin as a result it is not possible to provide robust financial information.

The department achieves this through the production of a range of services and publications. Examples are Home Office Today&#151;a daily on-line news service for staff, and Inside Track the corporate staff magazine. In addition each agency keeps its own staff informed of internal activities through agency publications.

<p><a name="40517w30.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Measures to intercept passengers with inadequate documents on their arrival in the UK include risk-assessing all incoming flights, conducting intelligence-led document checks, observing passengers as they disembark from aircraft and planned special exercises sometimes involving other agencies and at certain locations using CCTV.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w30.html_para2">
At the main arrivals control, passengers are interviewed and their documents examined to detect impostors and to identify forged or counterfeit passports or passengers without the requisite entry clearance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w30.html_para3">
In addition we have strategies in place to prevent passengers with inadequate documents arriving in the UK. These include the use of pre-entry controls in France (Juxtaposed controls), new detection technology screening equipment to detect clandestine entrants and Airline Liaison Officers (ALOs) who offer advice to airlines on the validity of travel documents held by passengers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w30.html_para4">
The Government are currently legislating to make disposing of travel documents without reasonable excuse a criminal offence. In addition a pilot is planned for airlines to scan travel documents at points abroad 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 May 2004 : Column 766W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
and supply copies to the UK Immigration Service. This will deter those who might otherwise destroy their documents en route.

<p><a name="40517w30.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Surveillance techniques to ensure that inadequately documented passengers are identified and intercepted are already in use at major airports other than Heathrow. The UK Immigration Service has the ability to employ CCTV and/or overt surveillance in order to identify and intercept such passengers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w30.html_para5">
Smaller airports where these methods are not routinely employed are subject to regular risk assessment, monitoring and special exercises with Customs and other agencies. Resources are deployed to identify and intercept inadequately documented passengers on an intelligence led basis.

<p><a name="40517w32.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 We know that about 35&nbsp;per cent. of terrorists use false or multiple identities. An identity cards scheme which made it far more difficult to establish multiple identities would help to disrupt terrorist support networks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w32.html_para5">
As the Home Secretary has always made clear&#151;going back to 2001&#151;an identity card scheme would not guarantee to protect the UK against a terrorist attack.

<p><a name="40517w32.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Legislation on Identity Cards&#151;A Consultation (CM 6178) explains that the Identity Cards Programme will be subject to continuing external review by the Office of Government Commerce Gateway process. A Gateway 0 review of the Programme took place in January 2004 which concluded that it was ready to proceed to the next stage.

<p><a name="40517w32.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Gibb: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department on what occasion and how frequently identity cards under the Draft Identity Cards Bill would need to be renewed.  [169913]</p>








<p><a name="40517w32.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 ID cards will have a limited validity, this power is provided for in the draft Identity Cards Bill. At present passports and driving licences are valid for 10 years and the cost estimates for the identity cards scheme are based on fees for cards covering a 10 year period.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 May 2004 : Column 774W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w32.html_para6">
However, in advance of it being a requirement to register, there will be no compulsion to renew an identity card. Only when it is a requirement to register will there be a requirement on individuals, whose card will expire in a prescribed period or whose card is not valid, to apply for an ID card within a prescribed period. Different validity periods will apply in different cases, for example the validity of cards issued to foreign nationals will be linked to the length of their entitlement to stay in the country. Validity periods will require the approval of Parliament.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the draft regulations under the Draft Identity Cards Bill that will be published in time for pre-legislative scrutiny at the same time as the Bill.  [169914]</p>








<p><a name="40517w32.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The Legislation on Identity Cards Consultation paper (Cm 6178) makes clear that the draft Identity Cards Bill is an enabling measure and that detailed provisions will be set out later in regulations, relating for example to the level of fees or the application process. Regulations will not, therefore, be published during the consultation period on the draft Bill but will be determined as the identity cards programme proceeds.


</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Department if he will list the Government databases that will be linked to the National Identity Register under proposals in the Draft Identity Cards Bill.  [169916]</p>








<p><a name="40517w32.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 There are no provisions in the draft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identity Cards Bill, which establish a direct link between the National Identity Register and any other Government database.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w32.html_para7">
However, applications for one of the family of identity cards will require checks to be made against other databases, including those of public sector bodies. The data-sharing gateways established for this purpose will be used only when processing applications for cards or related purposes to ensure that the person, who applies to register and to be issued with an identity card, is the person he or she claims to be. Under the draft Bill, Parliament would have to approve each such &quot;gateway&quot; via an affirmative order where no powers already exist for the sharing of data in this way.

<p><a name="40517w32.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Disclosure of information from the National Identity Register without the individual&#039;s consent may be made to the police only in the specified circumstances set out in Clause 20(3) of the draft Bill. This is subject to certain rules, including that information will only be disclosed if the Secretary of State is satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable for the police to have obtained the information by another means. For example, if fingerprint information 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 May 2004 : Column 775W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
is recorded on the register, the police would first have to search their own fingerprint records before resorting to the register. I will consider the need for further guidance on this subject nearer to the time of the introduction of the identity cards scheme.

<p>
<a name="40517w32.html_para8">
It is incorrect to say that any body or person will have &quot;access&quot; to the register, rather the legislation will permit the Secretary of Sate to disclose information where a person consents or, where a person does not consent, only for specified purposes to specified persons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w32.html_para9">
There will be an exception to the general bar on disclosing information without consent, but disclosure will only be allowed to specified persons for specified purposes approved by Parliament and will be subject to an internal authorisation and independent oversight procedure.

In addition, law enforcement agencies will be able to seek disclosure of information from the National Identity Register for the prevention or investigation of crime under clause 20 (3). For these groups, disclosure of &quot;audit trails&quot; of card usage would be permitted only in cases of serious crime under clause 20 (8). The police in Scotland will have similar powers but will only be permitted to apply for disclosure in relation to matters that are reserved under clause 20 (7)<i>(b)</i>&nbsp;.

Friend said that an identity card, although very helpful to public services as a reliable means of proving identity, would not become mandatory for free public services and benefits until a specific further parliamentary decision on a move to compulsion. Where the identity card is used to access public services we will want to ensure that procedures are in place to help those whose card has been lost or stolen, especially in cases of emergency.

<p><a name="40517w32.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The communication strategy on identity cards includes the following elements to ensure engagement with the public:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Quantitative and qualitative research was undertaken with the general public during the first consultation period. The findings are set out in &quot;Identity Cards: A summary of Findings from the Consultation Exercise on Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud&quot; (CM6019). Further quantitative and qualitative research among the general will be undertaken during the current consultation period.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">It is important that members of the public are able easily and quickly to obtain information about identity cards from a dedicated UK Government website. Therefore a new website domain has been registered (www.identitycards.gov.uk) and a new website created that contains official publications about identity cards. This will be updated with additional information as the national identity cards scheme progresses. Currently, there is a section about the consultation which invites individuals to comment on the draft legislation through a dedicated e-mail address.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Media handling strategies have been developed to make the best use of press and broadcast opportunities for engaging with the general public about identity cards.</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The &#039;essential information&#039; leaflet which is sent out with all new passports has been updated by the UK Passport Service to confirm that, subject to legislation, the passport will become part of a future family of national identity cards.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p><a name="40517w32.html_spnew13"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 &quot;Identity Cards: The Next Steps&quot; (CM&nbsp;6020) published in November 2003 made it clear that applications for one of the family of identity cards will require checks to be made against other databases, held by the public or private sector, in order to help establish that an application for a card is genuine. This followed recommendations on identity verification included in the Cabinet Office study on Identity Fraud, published in July 2002.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w32.html_para12">
The data-sharing gateways which may be approved by Parliament in clause 11 of the draft Identity Cards Bill will only be used when processing applications for an identity card or for related purposes (for example, issuing a replacement) to ensure that the person who applies to register is the person he or she claims to be. These powers do not confer any general right to share data for wider purposes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w32.html_para13">
In order to allow for testing of the identity cards scheme in advance of the first cards being issued, these data sharing powers could be piloted but it is not possible to give further detail at this stage as detailed work on implementation of an identity cards scheme is not at the stage where we can be definitive about these timings. Use of the powers on a pilot basis would require Parliament&#039;s consent.

<p><a name="40517w32.html_spnew15"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The United Kingdom Passport Service is planning to implement the facial recognition image biometric in the British Passport book from 2005.

 Clause 3 (1) of the draft Identity Cards Bill published on 26&nbsp;April sets clear limits for the information that could be held on the National Identity Register. Schedule 1 lists the categories of information that may be held on the Register.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w32.html_para16">
Individuals registered on the identity cards scheme would have subject access rights under the Data Protection Act 1998. In addition the Government will investigate whether it would be possible for a cardholder to use his card securely to access his own record to avoid the usual authorisation process and cost involved in applying for subject access. The Government will have to be satisfied that this could be achieved without compromising personal information, for example that another person could not use a stolen card to view another person&#039;s record on the National Identity Register.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w32.html_para17">
Clause 14 (4) excludes information held in Schedule 1, paragraph 9 (records relating to disclosure of an entry) from being disclosed unless the Secretary of State deems it appropriate.

<i>[holding answer 30&nbsp;April 2004]:</i> This is a matter which is kept under review. We introduced an amendment to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Bill during Lords&#039; Committee Stage, which creates a right of appeal on a point of law in respect of bail decisions by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) in cases involving a person detained under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. This mirrors the existing right of appeal in

<p><a name="40517w34.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 There are a number of mechanisms available to minimise the risk to databases operated by Government Departments and Agencies from staff who might not be trustworthy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w34.html_para1">
In the case of the UK Passport Service (UKPS), all prospective staff are subject to a number of pre-employment checks to confirm identity and entitlement to take employment. UKPS staff are also subject to security clearance checks in accordance with the Prime Minister&#039;s statement on security vetting of 15&nbsp;December 1994. These checks provide UKPS with an appropriate degree of assurance as to the integrity and trustworthiness of staff. The same arrangements apply to the employees of UKPS&#039; private sector partners.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w34.html_para2">
In addition to pre-employment checks and security clearance for staff, all UKPS systems undergo formal risk assessment and are accredited in line with Government standards and Information Security Standard BS7799. This ensures that UKPS has in place management and technical systems to provide comprehensive auditing and accounting facilities to monitor all access to, and activity on, its databases.

 Assaulting a public sector worker in the course of his or her duty is an extremely serious matter.

The Sentencing Guidelines Council will draft a new set of consolidated sentencing guidelines for use in all criminal courts. We anticipate this would similarly include references to whether the victim was at the time of the offence working with the public. We believe this is the right way to deal with such offences.

The British Crime Survey (BCS) data shows that vehicle thefts fell by 38&nbsp;per cent. and burglary by 29&nbsp;per cent. between 1991 and 2002&#150;03. Recorded crime fell by 23&nbsp;per cent. and burglary in dwellings by 17&nbsp;per cent. between 1990 and 2002&#150;03 and that the fear of crime is now lower than the levels in the 2001 British Crime Survey.

<i>[holding answer 30&nbsp;April 2004]:</i> We hope to receive Ken Sutton&#039;s report shortly. The length of the temporary suspension of the arrangements for those, in Sofia, seeking visas for managed migration schemes will be as short as possible. The impact on those wishing to seek entry to the UK legitimately under managed migration routes is a matter of regret. However, we consider that this temporary suspension was the right action in the circumstances and crucial to public confidence in the integrity of our immigration system.

<p><a name="40517w38.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The latest available information for Hampshire shows that there were 288 dental practices and 635 dentists providing national health service dental services in the general dental services or personal dental services.

In the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Strategic Health Authority there were 62 dentists working full or part-time in the Community Dental Service area (a whole time equivalent of 42) and, in the hospital dental service, there were 57 dentists (48 whole-time equivalent). Information on the number of practices is not available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w38.html_para3">
Information is not available on the number of hours worked as general dental practitioners are independent contractors who are able to vary the amount of NHS dentistry they do and to vary their working week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w38.html_para4">
We are currently taking forward major reforms of NHS dentistry through proposals in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003. Under these proposals, primary care trusts (PCT) will have a duty to secure the provision of primary dental services. With these new responsibilities will go the &#163;1.3 billion financial resources (2003&#150;04) currently held centrally. The reforms will give a better deal for patients, for dentists and for the NHS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w38.html_para5">
In the run up to the changes, we have provided new investment totalling &#163;90&nbsp;million to improve NHS dentistry. &#163;59&nbsp;million will support access, and strategic health authorities have been advised of their shares and are working with their PCTs to address access issues. &#163;30&nbsp;million is to support information technology and the balance of &#163;1&nbsp;million will support organisational development locally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w38.html_para6">
The PCTs in Hampshire are working closely with their strategic health authority (Hampshire and Isle of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wight) supported by the shadow special health authority (dentistry) to improve local dental access using their share of the access funds: some &#163;1.64&nbsp;million in 2004&#150;05.

<p>

Dentists can leave the national health service for a variety of reasons. These include retirements, short-term absence, leaving for other employment as well as dentists leaving the NHS dental services to practise wholly privately. Those working in the GDS can increase or reduce their NHS commitment, and this is not reflected in the figures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40517w38.html_para8">
Few dentists leave the NHS altogether to practise privately. The Office of Fair Trading report, &quot;The private dentistry market in the UK&quot;, stated that only 210 practices are totally private in the United Kingdom out of 11,000 practices in total.

<p><a name="40517w39.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 In his 2002 Budget announcement, my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced the largest sustained increase in funding of any five-year period in the history of the national health service. Over the years 2003&#150;04 to 2007&#150;08, these plans mean that expenditure on the NHS will increase on average by 7.4&nbsp;per cent., a year over and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above inflation.

In-year admissions<br>

An in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1&nbsp;April at the start of the data year. Periods of care ongoing at the end of the data year (unfinished admission episodes) are included. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

Since the appointment of Aidan Halligan, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, as joint senior responsible owner and director general for NPfIT, plans are in hand to improve and review the formal arrangements for engaging with key stakeholders across the national health service.

 Training plans are still evolving as is to be expected when approaching a phased programme of implementation and roll out of new applications, systems and services. The training requirements are not solely related to the national programme for information technology in the national health service in England (NPfIT) as general IT skills are now an everyday element for any public service and service based organisation. The European computer driving licence is helping to improve general skills across the NHS. The move to e-learning and development and the NHS University will both create more demand for computer and online skills and provide more channels and solutions to bring training to people.

<p>
<a name="40517w42.html_para4">
As we complete the more detailed plans for each&nbsp;geographical cluster and local service provider contract, we can map out the extent of IT support for clinical practice and patient care over the phased implementation of NPfIT. This will generate clearer training requirements and will enable us to consider the most appropriate ways of providing training and development and produce firmer costs.

 The expert patients programme (EPP) provides generic, lay-led, group based training for people in the self management of their long term condition.

The EPP is a generic course and teaches five core self-management skills: problem solving; decision making; resource utilisation; developing effective partnerships with healthcare providers and taking action.
