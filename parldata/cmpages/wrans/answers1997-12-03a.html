To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the estimated percentage change in the Probation Service budget in England and Wales for the next two financial years; and if he will make a statement. [18635]

<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 We are still considering probation service revenue grant for 1998-99 but expect to make an announcement very shortly. The level of funding in 1999-2000 and beyond will be considered in the comprehensive spending review.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what was the average annual case load per probation officer for the last two years for which figures are available; and if he will make a statement. [18638]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The average annual caseload per officer for 1995 and 1996, excluding community service, was 25 and 27.7 respectively.
<P>

<a name="71203w01.html_para0">These figures are given in table 8.13 of the Probation Statistics England and Wales 1996, a copy of which is in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what research his Department has undertaken on the degree of knowledge and awareness among the judiciary about community penalties and their effectiveness; and if he will make a statement. [18636]

<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Home Office Research Study 144, "Measuring the Satisfaction of Courts with the Probation Service", published in 1995, reported that 70 per cent. of the judges questioned thought that the probation service kept them very well or quite well informed about its work; 37 per cent. considered the quality of supervision for probation orders to be very good or quite good; and 45 per cent. were very satisfied or quite satisfied with current arrangements for enforcing probation orders.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many people <i>(a)</i> have notified the police in relation to the Sex Offender Register and <i>(b)</i> are yet to notify the police in relation to the register for the last date for which figures are available. [18639]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 On 2 October, the latest date for which figures are available, 2,170 sex offenders had notified the police of their details in accordance with the Sex Offenders Act 1997.
<P>

<a name="71203w01.html_para2">Police records indicate a further 567 sex offenders who had yet to notify the police of their details by this date. These include both those who are within the 14 day period allowed for registration and those who have gone beyond this period.
<P>

<a name="71203w01.html_para3">A survey of registrations over the first three months of the operation of the sex offender register is currently being carried out. The figures will be available in mid December.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if the measures under consideration for the forthcoming Crime and Disorder Bill for extended supervision of sex offenders will extend to all serious sex offenders. [18217]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 We envisage that the courts should have the power to require sex offenders to undergo an extended period of supervision, of up to ten years, to be added to whatever sentence the court would currently impose. The power will apply to all sex offenders who receive custodial sentences, including those imprisoned for less than 12 months, who are not liable, under the current law, to supervision following release. It will not, however, apply retrospectively to offenders already sentenced under the current or previous law.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_wqn5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is his Department's policy on the use of radar devices to avoid police radar speed traps. [18140]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The use of such detector devices without a licence is an offence under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949 and successful prosecutions have been taken out by the police against motorists who have used them. My Department has carried out tests which showed such devices to be largely unreliable and ineffective but we have asked the Association of Chief Police Officers' Traffic Committee to keep us informed of any significant increase in the use of these devices and of any difficulties which forces experience. In addition, where an advertisement for such a device is brought to my department's attention we lodge the papers with the Advertising Standards Authority so that the Authority can ensure that the advertising copy makes the legal position clear.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many police forces have suspended their use of CS gas sprays in the last six months; and if he will make a statement. [18344]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 None in England and Wales, so far as I am aware. Trials of CS sprays by Strathclyde Police and Tayside Police were suspended between 2 and 20 October but have since resumed. Responsibility for deciding whether to issue CS spray equipment rests with individual chief police officers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many ministerial announcements have not been made in the first instance to the House; and of those how many were <i>(a)</i> speeches to outside bodies, <i>(b)</i> press releases, <i>(c)</i> press briefings and <i>(d)</i> made by other means, since 1 May; and if he will make a statement about his Department's policy in respect of making public ministerial announcements. [18890]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Since 1 May, my Department has made 234 announcements by press release, including ones relating to public speeches. All major announcements are made to Parliament first when it is sitting. Such recent major announcements include a statement on Home Detention Orders, the White Paper on Youth Justice and the Bill to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into British Law. Press briefings are usually held to give further explanation to announcements, after they have been made public.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proposals he has to alter the law relating to vivisection; and if he will make a statement. [18681]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 An Order will be made shortly to add "pigs, if genetically modified" and "sheep, if genetically modified" to Schedule 2 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.
<P>

<a name="71203w01.html_para4">Following the recommendation made by the Animal Procedures Committee in its interim report on the review of the operation of the 1986 Act, the same Order will add ferrets and gerbils to Schedule 2. This will take effect from 1 January 1999.
<P>

<a name="71203w01.html_para5">An Order will also be made under the European Communities Act 1972 to make minor amendments to introduce into the face of the 1986 Act some controls which are currently exercised through administrative measures (such as standard licence conditions).

<a name="71203w01.html_sbhd7"><H4><center>Perjury</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will bring forward proposals for a new offence of aggravated perjury to apply where persons have brought an action in the courts and have lied on oath. [18532]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We see no need to bring forward proposals for a new offence of aggravated perjury. The law enables those who have brought a civil action and are then found to have lied to be liable to prosecution and conviction for perjury, which could result in a prison sentence for up to seven years. In addition, a person who intentionally swears a false affidavit could be charged with perverting the course of justice. As I indicated in my reply to my hon. Friend on 16 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>181</i>, the serious common law offence of perverting, or attempting to pervert, the course of justice is committed where a person acts or embarks upon a course of conduct which has a tendency to, and is intended to, pervert the course of justice. It is a matter for the prosecuting authorities to decide in any such case whether there is sufficient evidence to mount a 



<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 1997 : Column: 210</I><P>
prosecution and whether it would be in the public interest. As a common law offence, the maximum penalty for perverting the course of justice is at large, which means that the court would be free to impose any penalty that they considered appropriate.

<a name="71203w01.html_sbhd8"><H4><center>Hand Guns</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Rowe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what <i>(a)</i> timetable and <i>(b)</i> guidelines exist for compensating the owners of unusual hand guns; and what arrangements exist for paying interest on delayed compensation. [18619]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Those handguns not listed under options A and B of the Firearms Compensation Scheme will have been claimed for under option C, which required owners to attach evidence of value. These particular claims, because they require individual assessment of the evidence provided, are being deferred to allow faster processing of claims submitted under the first two options. Many option C claimants have also claimed under other options and so will receive a part payment of their claim first. It is expected that most, if not all, option C claims will have been dealt with by the end of 1998. This position is in accordance with our earlier expectations and was made clear in the information sent out to potential claimants in June. There are no arrangements in the Scheme for the payment of interest on claims.

<P>
<a name="71203w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 Access to the museums and galleries for which this Department is responsible is generally good, though some constraints are imposed by the historic buildings in which the collections are located. Many already allow full access to wheelchair users, and in most other cases nearly all of the collections are accessible. Among the facilities provided are: designated parking, ramps, lifts, specially designed lavatories, low-height telephones and low-height labelling of exhibits. Many institutions also have wheelchairs available for use and provide special training for staff.
<P>

<a name="71203w02.html_para2">However, there is no room for complacency. Recent advances in information technology have been used to provide visual displays where access to the actual display itself is not available.

<P>
<a name="71203w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Galbraith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 December 1997]:</i> The most recent national research study on smoking related diseases was the 1991 Report, "The Smoking Epidemic--Counting the Cost in Scotland", a publication produced jointly by HEBS and ASH (Scotland). It estimated that the costs to the NHS in Scotland were approximately &#163;69 million per year. There was no breakdown of this figure by sex, age, socio-economic class or health board area. The prevalence of all diseases in Scotland is monitored by routine ongoing surveillance rather than by specific research projects.

<P>

<P>
<a name="71203w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Galbraith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 December 1997]:</i> There is no simple classification of diseases into those which are smoking related and those which are not. Smoking is only one of several causative factors in many diseases. In 1991, the ASH (Scotland)/HEBS publication "The Smoking Epidemic--Counting the Cost in Scotland" estimated that the NHS costs of treating smoking related diseases were of the order of &#163;69 million per year. A more recent study, commissioned by ASH (Scotland) in 1994, estimated an annual cost to the NHS in Scotland of &#163;83 million. No information is held centrally on the breakdown of these figures by health board area.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will announce his plans for allocating total expenditure within his responsibility for 1998-99 including details of the 1998-99 Local Government Finance Settlement. [19298]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 The attached table outlines my plans for allocating the total expenditure for Scotland within my responsibility.
<P>

<a name="71203w03.html_para0">I have been able to improve significantly on the plans for the local government settlement. Following extensive consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, I propose to increase the level of Government Supported Expenditure by 2.2 per cent.--over &#163;133 



<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 1997 : Column: 216</I><P>
million--and the level of Aggregate External Finance by 0.6 per cent., or &#163;33.1 million, in both cases after adjustments for the transfer of responsibility for funding nursery education and the additional resources provided in the current year for policing the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.
<P>

<a name="71203w03.html_para1">Next year, Scottish local authorities will receive Government support through AEF of nearly &#163;5.3 billion, &#163;91 million greater than the published plans, which represents over 37 per cent. of the total Scottish Office budget. On top of that local authorities will receive a further &#163;75 million of support to fund pre-school education, &#163;9 million more than the published plans, &#163;7 million for Early Intervention and &#163;1 million for Alternatives to Exclusion, plus &#163;325 million of non-housing capital allocations.
<P>

<a name="71203w03.html_para2">I am also announcing today provisional capping principles which will allow local authorities to increase their capped expenditure by 3.4 per cent. or &#163;191 million, almost &#163;150 million more than the inherited plans. The proposed regime is tiered to allow councils spending close to GAE a greater increase in expenditure than those spending well above GAE.
<i>Government Supported Expenditure</i>
I propose that Government Supported Expenditure (GSE) for 1998-99 should be set at &#163;6,223.9 million. This compares with previous plans of &#163;6,132 million.
<i>Grant Aided Expenditure</i><i></i>
Local authorities will incur an estimated &#163;728.8 million on loan and leasing charges in 1998-99. After deducting this sum from the GSE total, &#163;5,495.1 million is available for allocation as Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE). This GAE amount is 3.7 per cent. or almost &#163;198 million higher than that for the current year (after making the above adjustments). I shall announce GAE figures for individual local authorities as soon as possible.
<i>Aggregate External Finance</i>
I further propose that Government support for local authority current expenditure-that is, Aggregte External Finance (AEF) which consists of Revenue Support Grant, Specific Grants and Non-Domestic Rate Income--for 1998-99 should be set at &#163;5,271.3 million, which compares with the previous plans of &#163;5,180 million. Proposals for the distribution of AEF to individual local authorities are likely to be isued to councils before Christmas. I announced yesterday that the National Non-Domestic Rate poundage would be 47.4p, the same as in England.
<i>Capping</i><i></i>
I have the power to cap a local authority either where I consider that its planned expenditure is excessive or where there is an excessive increase in its planned expenditure as compared with the previous year. My provisional capping principles for 1998-99 are:

<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w04.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Ernie Ross: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement about a third round under the Scottish Renewables Obligation. [19299]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 A consultation exercise held earlier this year by my Department showed broad support for the Government's approach to developing renewable energy. I am therefore proposing a third order under the SRO to oblige ScottishPower and Hydro-Electric to secure the availability of more capacity from new renewable sources in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="71203w04.html_para0">The first two orders led to 56 renewables projects with a combined capacity of 189MW securing contracts with ScottishPower and Hydro-Electric, although many of these have not yet been commissioned. I am very keen to see SR03, which will come into force in early 1999, again attracting technically sound yet innovative projects which must be extremely competitive on price, with the downward trend in prices seen under SRO2 being continued in so far as that is possible.
<P>

<a name="71203w04.html_para1">Capacity will be made available to those technologies that are able to demonstrate these qualities. On that basis I am minded that the third order should cover wind, small hydro, waste to energy and biomass projects, and that it should also make limited capacity available to small wind schemes and wave power projects. I hope that community-based projects will take advantage of this opportunity.
<P>

<a name="71203w04.html_para2">The Government is committed to a new and strong drive to promote renewables and a review of renewable energy policy is underway. I intend that the SRO3, which represents the culmination of the current programme in Scotland, should be for around 110-120MW in capacity, i.e. about the same size as SR02.
<P>

<a name="71203w04.html_para3">I am aware of certain concerns about the local environmental impact of particular renewables projects, and for that reason I expect prospective developers to consult interested parties, including local planning authorities, at an early stage. Evidence of having done so will be required as part of the application process. Developers are further reminded that the award of a contract under the SRO in no way implies preferential treatment when it comes to the planning process and planning permission will still have to be sought in the usual way.
<P>

<a name="71203w04.html_para4">My Department will shortly be writing to ScottishPower and Hydro-Electric setting out these proposals in more detail and will also issue detailed guidance to prospective applicants under SR03. Developers who are interested in bidding are invited to register their interest with my Department as soon as possible.

<a name="71203w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Chisholm: </B> 
 The National Radiological Protection Board report concludes that any doses of radiation from the past dumpings identified would be well within the International Commission on Radiological Protections's recommended limit and that further additional monitoring is not required. However, the Board recommended that advice should be drawn up against the possibility, which it acknowledges is remote, that two anti-static devices dumped off Arran in 1958 might be trawled up and washed ashore. My officials will be in touch with the fishermen's association once that advice has been finalised.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w04.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Cox: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the estimated acreage of contaminated land in England; and what proposals his Department has to encourage the reclamation of contaminated land. [18143]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w04.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Environment Agency has estimated that there may be some 300,000 hectares of land across Britain as a whole which is affected, to some extent, by industrial or natural contamination. However, much of this contamination will be relatively minor. In only a small proportion of cases will there be a need for detailed investigation, assessment or remediation either with respect to current risks to human health and the environment or to facilitate the redevelopment of the land.
<P>

<a name="71203w04.html_para5">A range of policy programmes are already in place to encourage the reclamation of derelict and potentially contaminated land. My Department, together with other public bodies including the Environment Agency and the research councils, funds research and development for site investigation and remediation techniques, as well as publishing technical advice and guidance. Planning policies and guidance seek directly to encourage the recycling of brown-field sites rather than permitting the development of greenfield sites, and also seek to ensure that contamination risks are properly dealt with as particular developments are taken forward. Significant sums of public investment in the regeneration of vacant, derelict and contaminated land are committed each year by the statutory regeneration agencies, such as English Partnerships.
<P>

<a name="71203w04.html_para6">My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment will be announcing shortly proposals for the implementation of legislation providing a statutory regime for the identification and remediation of contaminated land which is not necessarily subject to development proposals, but which is currently causing significant risks to human health or the environment.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what were the original projected costs to public funds and what are the latest forecast outturn costs of the Jubilee Line extension. [18221]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w04.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 At project commencement in October 1993, the estimated overall cost of the Jubilee Line extension was &#163;2.1 billion at cash outturn prices. This included &#163;1.9 billion ring-fenced cost, funded by Government grant, the rest being costs for associated works, funded by the London Transport core business. A further &#163;100 million in ring-fenced grant was later added to mitigate the rise in costs following the New Austrian Tunnelling Method collapse on the Heathrow Express project in 1994. London Transport now estimate outturn cost at &#163;2.76 billion. Of this total, &#163;2 billion will be directly funded by ring-fenced grant; the remainder will be met from London Transport's core resources (which include substantial Government grant) and from private sector contributions of over &#163;400 million, over &#163;100 million of which have already been received.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w04.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Government share my hon. Friend's concern about the increase in the number of fatal accidents at work in 1996-97. In July, I approved the Health and Safety Commission's Plan of Work for 1997-98. The Plan of Work sets out the actions that the Commission and the Health and Safety Executive have agreed with me should be taken now and in the longer term to reduce fatalities, and more generally to promote health and safety in the workplace.

 Yes. A copy of the report of the review, commissioned by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and undertaken by WS Atkins Science and Technology on the extendibility of local authority plans for responding to nuclear emergencies, will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="71203w04.html_para8">Extendibility was one of many issues considered by the Hinkley Point C Public Inquiry. In response to the recommendations, HSE's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate published in 1990 a quantified scenario against which extended plans could be drawn up and tested. The scenario was last used to drive the Heysham Level 2 emergency exercise "Madonna" in September 1997. The review report was part of a process of evaluation which, together with the experience of the Heysham exercise, will be fed into a paper on outline planning for extendibility which will be considered by the Nuclear Emergency Planning Liaison Group (NEPLG) for issue during 1998.

<P><I>3 Dec 1997 : Column: 224</I><P>
Environment Protection Agency in Scotland, and the Environment and Heritage Service in Northern Ireland). In addition, the Act also requires that the disposal of radioactive waste from nuclear licensed sites, and the accumulation and disposal of radioactive waste from all other sites, are authorised by the appropriate Agency. Certain classes of users and radioactive material are exempted from some or all of these requirements, by Exemption Orders which are Statutory Instruments made under the Act, or, in the case of certain Ministry of Defence sites, as a consequence of Crown Immunity.

 We are committed to establishing more effective and accountable regulation of the railways to ensure that the system is run in the public interest. As a first step towards improving public accountability, we have introduced new Objectives, Instructions and Guidance for the Franchising Director and a concordat with the Rail Regulator, designed to strengthen railways regulation. We are also conducting a wide ranging review which will look at all aspects of the rail industry, including the shortcomings of the sanctions already available to the regulators.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he expects to issue new guidance on the conduct of compulsory competitive tendering; and if he will make a statement. [19448]

<P>
<a name="71203w06.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 I have today published a new Departmental Circular No. 16/97 (Welsh Office 62/97) which gives authorities guidance on the conduct of compulsory competitive tendering (CCT).
<P>

<a name="71203w06.html_para3">The guidance reflects the new regulations on CCT laid before Parliament on 21 November. These amended the existing framework for CCT in England and Wales to make it more flexible and encourage local authorities to move to a Best Value-based approach to service delivery. The new guidance will allow authorities to pursue the principles of Best Value in a manner consistent with the purpose of the CCT legislation (that is that local authorities carry out work only if they do so competitively) and provide more flexibility to tendering.
<P>

<a name="71203w06.html_para4">A draft of the guidance formed part of a package of proposed changes to CCT which went out to consultation on 25 July. The new Circular takes account of the views of 112 local authorities and related organisations, professional bodies and private sector interests who responded specifically to the draft. A further 19 responses were received by the Welsh Office. Copies of the responses are held in the DETR's Library.




<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 1997 : Column: 228</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71203w06.html_para5">The guidance sets out the Government's views on how CCT should be carried out in the period before Best Value is implemented. It emphasises the importance of ensuring that competition is undertaken in an open and transparent manner and that service users and providers are consulted on the level and standard of services to be provided. Local authorities should secure services which are economic, effective and efficient and in which considerations of price and quality are properly balanced. Competing bids need to be evaluated objectively and authorities need to deal fairly with potential contractors to ensure that tendering practice does not advantage any one potential supplier or suppliers.
<P>

<a name="71203w06.html_para6">The new guidance applies immediately to those services currently subject to CCT. The Secretary of State will take into account the extent to which there has been a contravention of the guidance in determining whether or not authorities have acted anti-competitively.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The Berlaymont building was evacuated in 1991, after the discovery of asbestos. The cost of renovation is estimated at ECU 325 million. The cost of asbestos removal is estimated at ECU 90 million. These costs will initially be borne by the Belgian Government (which owns the building). The Commission will reimburse the renovation costs (but not the cost of asbestos removal) over 27 years and will pay ECU 50 million for the building's shell. Legal ownership of the Berlaymont will then pass to them.

<a name="71203w06.html_para8">The only Community institution in the process of relocating is the European Parliament, which recently moved into a new building in Brussels and is constructing new premises in Strasbourg.

<P>

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 1 December 1997]:</i> About 30 per cent. of the reduction in unemployment among young people in the last four years has been due to a decline in the overall population in this age group. The rest is due to a rise in the proportion of young people remaining in full-time education and to the economic upswing, which started earlier in this country than in other major European countries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what legal advice he has received over the challenge to the Protocol on asylum in Title VI of the Amsterdam Treaty based on Article 14(I) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and if he will make a statement. [17913]

<a name="71203w08.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="71203w08.html_para0">We are not aware of any formal legal challenge to the Asylum Protocol. As we have made clear, we will, in accordance with United Kingdom asylum law, continue to give individual consideration to asylum applications from European Union nationals as we do to other nationals. We do not therefore consider that any question arises as to the United Kingdom's adherence to Article 14(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what estimate she has made of the number of jobs which will be lost in <i>(a)</i> England, <i>(b)</i> Wales, <i>(c)</i> Scotland and <i>(d)</i> Northern Ireland as a result of the discontinuance of ATP. [18949] 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 As there has been no change in the overall volume or tying status of the aid programme we would anticipate that closing the ATP scheme would have no impact on UK jobs.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will list the aid and advice currently provided by her Department to countries which have street children. [18968]

<a name="71203w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 As most of Department for International Development's (DFID) bilateral projects cover the wider population it is not possible to isolate expenditure on specific target groups within them. Although data may be readily available for projects designed specifically for children, expenditure on all areas which impinge on children cannot be separated from more general expenditure.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) is supporting a very substantial number of NGO projects across a range of programmes.

A further 8 million ecu (&#163;5.7 million) is to be provided under a similar programme in 1998.

 My Department has not produced such a list. The impact the UK can have in a particular country depends on a number of factors including the nature and quality of the relationship and the extent to which we share policy objectives.

<a name="71203w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 I am pleased today to announce such a review. It will provide an early opportunity to seek views on one way in which the position of disabled people in society might be improved. A key aspect of the review will be a consultation exercise aimed at gleaning views and information from a wide range of disability and employer organisations, especially those representing small firms, as well as individual disabled people and employers. It will include meetings with interested parties.
<P>

<a name="71203w09.html_para1">The Act requires a review to be held, begun immediately after the fourth anniversary of the commencement of the exemption provision if not held sooner, and allows the threshold to be lowered, but not removed completely, following the review. Any change must come into force within a year of the review starting.
<P>

<a name="71203w09.html_para2">The Government will consider carefully the responses to the consultation before deciding whether the threshold should be lowered to extend the Act's employment rights to more disabled employees and job applicants and, if so, to what level. We shall take account of any problems which may particularly apply to smaller employers, as well as looking at the wider costs and benefits of change.

If the programme is agreed, the UK is prepared with some of our European and other G7 partners to consider, if needed, supplementary finance in support of the programme. The UK would consider an amount up to the equivalent of $1.25 billion. Any loan would depend on a financing need and would only be made with agreement by the IMF. Were such a loan to be made it would be advanced by the Bank of England to the Central Bank of Korea. The Treasury would provide to the Bank of England an indemnity under the International Monetary Arrangements Act 1983 .

 In August additional funding was made available, some of it for waiting list pressures. The Eastern Board approached the Trusts in its area to ask for proposals from them for waiting list work. The Royal Group put forward, inter alia a proposal for the treatment of seven additional patients requiring breast reconstruction to which the Board has agreed. The Ulster Hospital in its response indicated that it could undertake 100 additional plastic surgery procedures and 240 in general surgery. The appropriate consultants will consider the clinical priority of those waiting, including the one patient waiting for post mastectomy reconstruction on the plastic surgery list at the Ulster. The Board has also advised that it has not received any indication of concerns about this specific service from any of the Trusts providing it either in respect of waiting times or the level of investment in it.

<P>

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what plans she has to review the <i>(a)</i> mechanism and <i>(b)</i> responsibility for informing the public of a nuclear emergency; and if she will make a statement. [18369]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Currently, the legislative requirements for informing the public of a nuclear emergency are given in the "Public Information for Radiation Emergencies Regulations 1992" (PIRER). Guidance has been published by the Health and Safety Executive in support of the Regulations and further relevant guidance has been issued to the emergency response bodies concerned by the Nuclear Emergency Planning Liaison Group (NEPLG).
<P>

<a name="71203w12.html_para0">Consultative proposals are at present being developed on the new "Radioactive Emergency Preparedness and Public Information Regulations" (REPPIR) which will subsume PIRER and implement the Emergency Preparedness requirements of the European Council Directive 96/29 EURATOM laying down Basic Safety Standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation. These proposals will be published in a consultative document in Spring 1998.
<P>

<a name="71203w12.html_para1">In parallel with these activities, a National Steering Committee on Warning and Informing the Public is meeting to develop a view on the broad issue of informing the public in a variety of emergency situations.

 No figures on the proportion of eligible businesses successful in obtaining a loan are available.

Eligibility for the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme is considered only in cases where the lender would be prepared to lend but for a lack of available assets which could be used as security.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make a statement on the policy of Her Majesty's Government towards the proposed extension of the Seventh European Council Directive on aid to shipbuilding. [17905]




<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 1997 : Column: 253</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Government support the proposed extension of the Seventh Directive on aids to shipbuilding until the end of 1998 as it is conditional on the EU negotiating a tougher replacement regime. This will lead to an earlier reduction in EU state aids for this sector, which is a key Government objective.
<P>

<a name="71203w12.html_para2">The extension of the Seventh Directive is part of the EU contingency arrangements in the light of the continuing delay in US ratification of the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement and is accompanied by a Commission proposal for a replacement shipbuilding aids regime. The Government support the main thrust of this Commission proposal as its overall impact will be to reduce EU shipbuilding aids and it is a transitional regime leading to the final elimination of special shipbuilding aids after 5 years. It envisages the removal of contract related aid by the end of 2000 and switches the emphasis to improving the competitiveness of the shipbuilding industry. (Further details of these two proposals are contained in Explanatory Memorandum 11165/97 and 11167/97 which are available in the Library of the House).
<P>

<a name="71203w12.html_para3">The Government still believe that the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement offers the best multilateral basis for removing shipbuilding aids and for restoring normal competitive conditions to the world shipbuilding market and hopes that the US will be able to complete its ratification. However in the meantime it regards the EU contingency arrangements as the next best option.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 November 1997]:</i> The figures requested are not available because statistics are not collected in that form. Moreover, because of the number of different factors affecting retail activity at ports, airports, etc., I do not consider it would be possible to arrive at an accurate estimate.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make it her policy that fixed term contract staff <i>(a)</i> employed and <i>(b)</i> funded by research councils will not be required to sign waiver clauses in their employment contracts. [18628]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 December 1997]:</i> The Research Councils fund research in higher education institutions and other organisations in which the institution is responsible for the terms and conditions of employment of staff recruited to carry out the research. With very few exceptions, the Research Councils already make no requirement on institutions to include waiver clauses in the relevant contracts of employment. The Research Councils also employ research staff directly in their own institutes and units. The Management Statement and Financial Memorandum which sets the framework for the relationship between the Councils and the Office of Science and Technology requires the Councils to use waiver clauses in certain fixed-term employment contracts. We will keep that document under review.

 <i>[holding answer 3 November 1997]:</i> According to the Interdepartmental Business Register (IDBR) there are 3,328 SMEs in Staffordshire who fall into the 10-199 employee category.
<P>

<a name="71203w12.html_para5">VAT registration data suggest that new business generation in Staffordshire is slightly below the regional and national averages. In 1995 the Staffordshire business formation rate was 9.4 per cent., West Midlands 9.9 per cent. and the UK 10.3 per cent. However, there is evidence to show that Staffordshire Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are more likely to survive in business. Of the Staffordshire SMEs joining the VAT register in 1990, 43.4 per cent. were still registered 4 years later compared with 42.2 per cent. regionally and 41.9 per cent. nationally.

 The size of the fifth non-fossil fuel obligation order will be decided next year in the light of the quality and cost of the bids received.

<a name="71203w13.html_para0"><i>Letter from A. F. Cowan to Mr. John Heppell, dated 3 December 1997:</i>
<P>

<a name="71203w13.html_para1">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions, as their substance falls within my area of responsibility. The answers to each question are set out below. I am afraid they are not all in the precise format you have requested. I also need to place them into the broader context of College of Education Transfers.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Background</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>When NHS staff were moved to Colleges of Education it was agreed that the most favourable available transfer of pension rights should be given. For those transferring to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) a bulk transfer arrangement was agreed. Bulk transfers are more favourable than individual transfers because their transfer value is based upon movement in wages rather than prices. By its nature, however, a bulk transfer is not finalised until every case has been calculated. There have been many delays; while some of these have been unavoidable some were the result of poor performance by this Agency. With the benefit of hindsight we would have treated them differently. The bulk transfer of funds has not yet been completed; however the individuals pension entitlements are secured because the liabilities are accepted in full by the USS. To underpin this, significant payments on account have been made by the NHS Scheme to fund these liabilities. We are hoping, with the co-operation of the USS and their actuaries to be in a position within the next few weeks to be able to make the final payment to complete the transfers.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For those NHS staff who were transferring to the Teachers Superannuation Scheme (TSS) different arrangements were agreed, amounting to a 1:1 transfer of service. This involves no transfer of funds because both Schemes are notionally funded by the Exchequer. However the detailed work to complete the transfers has been undertaken on a case by case basis. To our knowledge all but a few of the 2,864 cases have been cleared.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Against this background the answers to your questions are as follows:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>What assessment has the Secretary of State made of the impact on requests for early retirement resulting fro the delays in processing requests for transfer from the NHS Superannuation Scheme to:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the USS; and
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the TSS.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>While there have been significant delays in finalising the bulk transfer payment to the USS, the pensions entitlements of the individuals concerned have been safeguarded between the USS and the NHS Pension Scheme. The Schemes are not aware of any direct impact that the delay in finalising the bulk transfer payment has had on transactions involving early retirements.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In administering early retirements from the TSS, where a transfer was outstanding, both schemes have given such cases priority treatment conclusion. Again, the Schemes are not aware of any retirees who have been adversely affected by delays in the transfer process.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>What is the average time limit for processing a transfer from the NHS Superannuation Scheme to:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the USS;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the TSS. 
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency only maintains figures for average clearance times for all transfers casework. We cannot distinguish between individual Schemes. Normal transfers go through two stages--provisional, covering an estimate and members option process; and final, which culminates either in a payment reflecting the capitalised value of the pension entitlement or confirmation of the service being transferred. The average times to clear, in working days over the past two years are:</FONT></UL>

In 1996-97 the equivalent of some 21 full-time staff were deployed on transfer cases, 22 in 1997-98. However at any one time the Agency can deploy many more staff than this, if it would help a particular situation. The delays in finalising the USS and TSS special exercises have not been attributable to staffing levels, but more to their complexity and difficulties with data. The TSS exercise is nearly completed. The USS exercise is expected to be completed by 31 December 1997.

<P>
<a name="71203w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The General Dental Council is the regulatory body responsible for dental treatment provided outside the National Health Service. The Department, which provides funding for the continuing education and training of dentists who have an arrangement to provide general dental services under the National Health Service, gets regular feedback from the Council on matters like professional conduct and fitness to practise. The great majority of general dental practitioners carry out some NHS work even if they also undertake private practice.

<P>

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Cancer Screening Evaluation Unit, which is funded by the Department of Health, is reviewing the advantages of two-view mammography. Recently published data suggest that for a woman's first screen, the use of two-view mammography increases by 45 per cent. the detection of invasive cancers of less than 15 millimetres, and for subsequent screens it increases the detection rate by 25 per cent.
<P>

<a name="71203w14.html_para0">All breast screening units currently take a second mammographic view of the breast at a woman's first visit to the screening programme. Breast screening units have discretion over the use of two view mammography at subsequent screening rounds. The case for requiring all units to take two views at every screening round will have to be assessed along with the outcome of research currently being carried out into other changes that might be made to improve the quality of the service offered to women, for example extending the screening programme to older women, and reducing the screening interval.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government are funding a pilot schemes in Northern and Yorkshire, Trent and South Thames regions to evaluate the effectiveness of extending the screening programme to include women aged 65-69. These pilots will run for three years to 1999-2000 to give a clear picture of likely uptake among older women, and effectiveness in terms of the number of cancers detected. We will base any changes to policy on the evidence emerging from these.
<P>

<a name="71203w14.html_para1">Screening every three years is currently available to older women on request. This is well publicised in a number of ways. Women who have already been screened through the programme are informed of their right to request screening after the age of 65. The booklet "Your Health: A Guide to Services for Women", which is widely available through general practitioner's surgeries, clinics, post offices and some shops, makes clear that women aged 65 and over will be screened free of charge three yearly if they request it.

 Dental students will make a means-tested contribution to their tuition fees for the first four years of their course. The Department of Health will pay the contribution from year five onwards. This will not be at the expense of patient care--a transfer of resources from the Department for Education and Employment is being agreed to meet the cost.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Priorities for funding research in the Department are set very carefully, based on the burden of disease and other criteria. Bids for conducting research into chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) are therefore always considered on that basis. The Department continues to fund research into the management and treatment of CFS/ME through the National Health Service Research and Development Programme.
<P>

<a name="71203w14.html_para2">It is currently funding an on-going research project, costing about &#163;60,000, which is looking at whether general practitioners are best placed to manage CFS/ME patients. A recently completed research project, costing over &#163;65,000, considered whether a particular type of psychological treatment was effective in reducing disability in CFS/ME patients. The main agency through which the Government support medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council. The Council currently provides support for one Small Project Grant in the area of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome entitled "The role of noradrenaline in the neuropsychological pathogenesis of the chronic fatigue syndrome". The total amount awarded was &#163;37,000.
<P>

<a name="71203w14.html_para3">There are no plans to commission a national epidemiological study into CFS/ME. A number of small studies of epidemiology have indicated that prevalence is around 1-2/1000 of the population with a peak incidence in the 20-40 age group and a slight female predominance. Obtaining accurate epidemiological information is particularly difficult in the case of CFS/ME due to variations in definitions and the difficulties in making an accurate diagnosis. There is no single diagnostic test for CFS/ME. It is usually diagnosed by testing for and eliminating other conditions. People with CFS/ME can experience any or all of a wide range of symptoms, but chronic fatigue is a key factor in the syndrome.
<P>

<a name="71203w14.html_para4">The Government have not carried out a consultation of people who suffer from CFS/ME. However, we have funded CFS/ME voluntary organisations who have close contact with sufferers. Since 1988, we have made over &#163;225,000 available to CFS/ME organisations and by 1998, this will have risen to over a quarter of a million pounds.
<P>

<a name="71203w14.html_para5">The NHS provides a wide range of services to which sufferers of CFS/ME have access and such patients are seen within a wide range of community services and hospital specialties. Patients can discuss the options available to them with their GP and they may also request an assessment of their needs by local authority social services departments. It is the responsibility of health authorities to decide how the needs of CFS/ME sufferers should be met and whether or not they should purchase dedicated services. All such decisions are made in the light of competing priorities and finite resources.
<P>

<a name="71203w14.html_para6">We consider that it is more appropriate for clinical guidelines to be produced by clinicians themselves or through their representative professional bodies. Establishing definitions of disease and the criteria for their diagnosis is also a matter for the professions. Furthermore, the Medical Royal Colleges point out that, whilst CFS/ME should be managed by GPs, it is inappropriate at present to issue clinical guidelines given

the lack of methodologically sound research. There is no single effective treatment for CFS/ME. The condition varies significantly from one patient to another and therefore individual patients benefit from different treatment regimes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the extra cost to the NHS would be if VAT was applied to home-delivered incontinence products at 17.5 per cent. [18978]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71203w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Under the Value Added Tax Act 1994, Schedule 8, Group 12, Item 2(g) incontinence products are zero-rated only when supplied to a disabled person or to a charity that makes them available to a disabled person. As the National Health Service falls into neither of these categories, it has always been the intention that supplies of these products by the NHS should have been standard rated and the NHS is funded on this understanding. Since there is no change to this intention, there will be no associated increased cost for the NHS. NHS trusts have been temporarily able to take advantage of a VAT reimbursement on these products due to a loophole which Customs and Excise are now seeking to close.

There will be opportunities for organisations and individuals around Wales to put their views to the advisory group. The group will include members from different political parties as well as individuals with expertise in a range of fields such as business, local government and the voluntary sector.

He has extensive experience of both the private and public sectors in Wales. I am sure he will make an excellent chairman of the group.

 Along with Emergency Admissions and ensuring that adequate intensive care facilities are available, cutting waiting lists and reducing waiting times continue to be a key priority for the Government and the NHS in Wales.

<P>

<a name="71203w16.html_para0">I expect the &#163;9.548 million of additional money allocated to the NHS this year, will significantly help to ease the pressures on the health and social care system during the winter period while also restraining the growth in waiting lists and waiting times.
