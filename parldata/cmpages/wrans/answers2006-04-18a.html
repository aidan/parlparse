 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what rights of appeal are available to parties to the Board of Inquiry into the USAF F-15 accident in Scotland on 26 March 2001.  [62826]</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60418w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 Normally the findings of a Board of Inquiry are not open to appeal and there is no statutory appeal mechanism within the Air Force Act 1955. However a person subject to air force law who thinks himself wronged in relation to any matter relating to his Service may, by virtue of section 180 Air Force Act 1955, submit a Redress of Complaint through the chain of command to the Air Force Board acting as the Defence Council. Any airman so affected, by the findings of a Board, could lodge such a Redress but the complaint must normally have been lodged within three months of the commission of the wrong complained of. A decision of the Air Force Board is susceptible to judicial review proceedings in the High Court.

<a name="60418w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Secondly, and extra-regulationally, if new and significant evidence became available, in relation to an accident, which might have a bearing on issues of causation, and at the sole discretion of the Convening Authority, it would be open to the Convening Authority to re-open the BOI for the Board to reconsider its findings in the light of any new and compelling evidence.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60418w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 Completion of the Board of Inquiry was delayed awaiting the outcome of Court Martial proceedings and to allow the air traffic controller to fully exercise his rights under Queens Regulations 1269 to comment on the Board report.

The proposal exempts products that have a recognised level of safety including those containing substances that have been entered into Annex II of Council Regulation EEC/2377/90.

 Under EU legislation, routine TB testing is carried out annually or biennially in parishes with a historically higher number of bovine TB incidents in cattle. This is reduced to testing every four years in parishes with historically low or no TB incidents. TB reactors are removed for slaughter and the owner is compensated using a new table-based valuation system, which was introduced on 1 February. The rest of the herd are placed under movement restrictions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w06.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_25">In addition, we introduced compulsory pre-movement testing of cattle in England on 27 March, which will help to reduce the risk of spreading TB through cattle movements. The legislation applies to cattle over 15 months of age moving from one and two-year tested herds. It will be extended to movements of cattle over 42-days-old on 1 March 2007.

<a name="stpa_26">Improved diagnosis of TB in cattle is a major objective of Defra&#039;s wide-ranging research programme. The laboratory-based gamma-interferon test is not sufficiently specific to replace the TB test but use of the two tests in parallel has the potential to significantly increase the detection of infected cattle in herds where TB has been confirmed. Preparations are being made for wider use of the gamma interferon test in prescribed circumstances.

<p>
<a name="60418w06.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_27">In this country, the main wildlife reservoir of bovine TB is in badgers. A public consultation on both the principle and method of a badger culling policy in areas of high TB incidence in cattle was launched on 15 December 2005. This has now closed and we received more than 35,000 responses. These responses will be analysed carefully over the coming weeks to inform decisions alongside other available evidence.

 There is no persuasive scientific evidence which either confirms or refutes the theory that some animals with mineral deficient diets might have increased susceptibility to tuberculosis, particularly those in areas where soils are deficient in trace elements such as selenium.

The former has now been addressed in the Waste Management (England and Wales) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006 No. 937) which were laid before the House on 30 March 2006.

 The Department for Constitutional Affairs is the Government Department responsible for upholding justice, rights and democracy. The Department&#039;s aim is to provide for effective and accessible justice for all, to ensure the rights and responsibilities of the citizen, and to modernise the law and constitution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w12.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_86">Currently, the Department has four strategic objectives, which cover the delivery of justice, civil and administrative law, protecting the vulnerable, modernising the constitution, increasing consumer choice and working in partnership with the independent judiciary. The Department also has five public service agreement targets to help deliver its strategic objectives, three of which are shared with the other criminal justice departments and agencies.

<a name="60418w12.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_87">It will be clear that the range of the Department&#039;s policies and actions is wide and the statistical information relating to it is not normally collected on a constituency basis. Consequently, the information requested in the question cannot be provided in the form requested except at a disproportionate cost. However, general statistical information about the Department&#039;s activities can be found at: http://www.dca.gov.uk/statistics/statfr.htm.

<p>
<a name="60418w12.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_88">An example of the information available on this site is statistical data on the speed with which persistent young offenders are brought to justice. The average number of days from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders sentenced during the period from October to December 2005 was 86 days in the Metropolitan police force area, and 72 days in the Islington Basic Command Unit (BCD) area. These figures compare with 160 days in the Metropolitan police force area in the 1997 calendar year.

 The Representation of the People Regulations 2002 provide that electors may opt out of the edited version of the register of electors if they do not want their details to be sold to anyone for any purpose. Any attempt to use legislation to impose a retrospective ban on the use of information derived from pre-2002 electoral registers, though, is likely to be impracticable and unenforceable since this may be provided by commercial organisations based outside of the UK against whom the sanctions of UK law cannot be applied. Electors who do not want their details to be used by commercial organisations may wish to approach the mailing or telephone preference services requesting deletion from company records or publicly

 No advice is issued centrally to EROs on prosecuting those who fail to return an electoral registration form.

EROs are aware of their powers under electoral law to initiate prosecutions against those who commit the offence of failing to give, or providing false, information required for the purposes of maintaining registers of parliamentary and local government electors. As this is a matter for local discretion, records of such prosecutions are not held centrally and therefore the information relating to prosecutions could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost.

 We know of six political activists in long term detention in Belarus. The Belarusian authorities announced on 29 March that approximately 500 people had been detained following the elections. Of these: 288 were sentenced to 10 days administrative arrest; 112 sentenced to 15 days administrative arrest; 53 were minors released without charge: and 21 were foreign nationals, 14 of whom were sentenced from 3&#150;14 days administrative arrest. Unofficial sources suggest however that the number of arrests may be significantly higher, with estimates for the total number of arrests ranging from 700&#150;1200, possibly including foreign nationals. It is not clear how many of these remain in detention. This number includes Aleksander Kozulin (now released), an opposition leader and presidential candidate, political activists, members of non governmental organisations, journalists and members of the public who were protesting about the results of an election which was not free and fair.

In October 2005, the EU General Affairs Council concluded that the adoption by the Colombian Congress of the Justice and Peace Law was a significant development, since it provides an overall legal framework for DDK in Colombia. The Council noted that it had many concerns over the law, but it believed that if the law was effectively and transparently implemented it would make a positive contribution to the search for peace in Colombia.

President Putin stressed at the time of the announcement that Russia would continue to meet all its delivery requirements to European customers. More generally, the agreement reflects strengthening trade, economic and energy co-operation and bilateral links between China and Russia. Diversification of China&#039;s energy portfolio towards greater use of gas as a cleaner energy source and as a substitute for coal is good for climate change reasons.

 The overall security situation in Sierra Leone is generally calm, but fragile. The situation had sufficiently improved to allow the full departure of the UN peacekeeping force, the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, at the end of 2005. There has been progress on improving the training, leadership and professionalism of the Sierra Leone Army and Police forces. A UK-led International Military Assistance and Training Team has aided much of this reform by close co-operation with the Army and will remain in Sierra Leone until at least 2010. They currently have
