 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs what the percentage of electoral registration rate for each local authority in the UK is in descending order; and if she will make a statement. [26409]</p>

 I have been asked to reply.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your question concerning the percentage electoral registration rate in each Local Authority area. (26409)</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">The Office for National Statistics is not able to calculate percentage electoral registration rates: the resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote. However, the Office for National Statistics does on occasion publish comparisons of the resident population of voting age (aged 18 and over) and the number of people who are registered to vote. These comparisons provide the closest available approximations to the information you requested.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">The tables, which will be placed in the House of Commons Library, give comparisons between the number of registered electors and the estimated mid-2004 population for local authorities in the UK. Table 1 shows a comparison against parliamentary electorate and Table 2 against local/European electorate. Please note Table 1 refers to Great Britain only as Northern Ireland are unable to provide Parliamentary electorates for local authority areas. In order to give an estimate of the number of electors at the mid-year point, 30 June 2003, a weighted average is taken of the 1 December 2002 and 1 December 2003 electoral data.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">The local/European electorate gives a better comparison than parliamentary electorate to resident population as EU citizens are included and UK citizens resident abroad are excluded from the local/European electorate. However, a number of other difficulties remain when comparing these sources. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible) and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. These factors may have a different impact from place to place.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">There is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate (both parliamentary and local/European) as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This is the main reason some areas show apparent rates in excess of one hundred per cent.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">Any comparison of these data with figures for previous years should be made carefully as electoral legislation and other changes (such as EU expansion) can change the size of the electorate.</p>
</ul>

 I have no information for the City of London that would allow the assessment of the contribution mobile communications has made to its productivity. The mobile network operator, O2 commissioned a study from the Centre for Economic and Business Research in July 2004 to assess how the contribution of mobile phones to the UK economy was likely to change over the next 10 years. A final report on the regional contribution of mobile communications, provided figures broken down by region. For the South East it found that mobile communications contributes 3.23 per cent. of GDP, which is &#163;1,573 per household per year. It also found that mobile communications accounts for 1.15 per cent. of all jobs in the South East.

 HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) have been receiving an increasing number of claims for repayment of VAT under the 8th and 13th EC VAT Directives which have not been supported by all the required documentation, including valid VAT invoices. HMRC have found that the previous controls for dealing with such claims are not sufficiently robust and are being abused. HMRC have therefore decided that they must tighten their procedures and have recently reminded businesses that claims must be supported by all the required documentation, and about what details a valid VAT invoice must contain. These rules apply equally to all businesses and are no different to the rules that apply domestically for businesses seeking to recover VAT incurred on their purchases.

<i>[holding answer 7 November 2005]:</i> Crowding on all London passenger services, including between Hastings-London Victoria and Brighton-London Victoria are measured against Passengers in Excess of Capacity Rules (PIXC) rules. This is against the number of seats on longer-distance services and against total capacity (seats plus, standing) for services where the first stop that passengers alight (or last stop where passengers board) is not more than 20 minutes from the terminal station. This allows for the scheduled stops within the 20 minute threshold at Clapham Junction and East Croydon in both directions.

<a name="stpa_36">The latest available count data (2004) show that all morning and evening peak Brighton to Victoria and Hastings to Victoria services are within their official passenger capacities, except for the 1632 Victoria to Brighton service. The Train Operating Company has allocated less carriages to the 1632 Victoria to Brighton train in order to provide longer trains to meet the greater passenger demand in the high peak period after 1700. However, an alternative service between Victoria and Brighton is scheduled shortly after this service at 1636, and this does provide spare capacity.

 The use of stone mastic asphalt materials (SMA) for road resurfacing was assessed by the Highways Agency in the 1990s. As a result of concern regarding the loss of surface texture required for high-speed skid resistance, its use was prohibited as a surfacing on trunk roads including motorways in England. Proprietary materials based on SMA, known as &#039;thin surfacings&#039;, have been developed to address the surface texture concern and these are now widely used on the trunk road and motorway network. The Department, on behalf of the UK Roads Board has commissioned best practice guidance for local authorities on how and where thin surfacings and SMA can be applied. The results of this research will be available early next year.

<a name="stpa_43">Having granted a licence, HSE expects the licence holder to comply with the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002 and the Asbestos (Licensing) Regulations 1983 as amended. In order to monitor the performance of licence holders, inspectors carry out a programme of site visits. If, during these visits, inspectors encounter work being carried out without using proper controls, such as wet injection, then they will take appropriate action to achieve compliance.

For example a national benefit review of disability living allowance was conducted in 2004 and the results published in July 2005 as &quot;Fraud, Error and other Incorrectness in disability living allowance&quot;, which is available in the Library.

 The percentage of looked-after children convicted or subject to a final warning or reprimand fell from 10.3 per cent. in 2001 to 9.3 per cent. in 2004. Our work to raise educational achievement and improve placement stability will contribute towards continued reductions in offending and improvements in other outcomes for looked after children. Funded by the Government, MACRO have recently published a good practice guide on reducing offending by looked-after children, which reinforces the message that looked-after children must be provided with constructive supervision and guidance to reduce the risk of offending, and that those who have offended must be offered appropriate services to minimise the likelihood of re-offending. This publication has been distributed to all Directors of Children&#039;s Services and all YOT managers. We intend to consult early in 2006 on further wide ranging proposals for transforming outcomes for looked-after children.

 We have not received any applications for permission to borrow. Guidance to schools sets out our policy that we think such borrowing will rarely represent value for money.

 The Counter Fraud and Security Management Service (CFSMS) risk measurement methodology is applied to accurately measure losses to fraud in areas of national health service spending in order to identify the scale of the problem and take firm action to prevent this from occurring. CFSMS is currently working on measuring losses in major areas of the NHS budget and has for example been actively involved in seeking to fraud-proof the new general practitioner contract. Continued measurements of losses to fraud will take place as weaknesses are identified and substantive budgets affected. This is and must be an ongoing process as spending areas and budget allocations will continue to change. As such, there can be no accurate overall estimate of the outstanding amount of fraud in the NHS, only a continuous effort to identify weaknesses as budgets and policies change and evolve.

Notes:<br>

1. A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

2. Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID. This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an 



agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

3. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data&#151;that is, the data are ungrossed. Hospital episode statistics, NHS Health and Social Care Information Centre.<br>

The recommendations from the Richardson Committee have, therefore, been subject to considerable discussion and development over the course of the last five years and it is not possible to assess each of the recommendations in terms of whether they have been adopted or rejected.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate she has made of the number of people likely to be eligible for placement under community treatment orders under proposals in the draft Mental Health Bill.  [23152]</p>








<p><a name="st_129"><a name="51111w15.html_spnew7"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s modelling assumption is that around 10 per cent. of treatment orders will be community-based in the early years of the new Mental Health Act. Ensuring that professionals use involuntary community-based treatment appropriately is more critical than arbitrarily specifying the number of people who will be subject to community treatment orders.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to her Department&#039;s press release dated 20 October, on capital investment in mental health services, whether capital investment will be made available to NHS mental health trusts which are anticipating year-end financial deficits on their income and expenditure account.

<p><a name="st_130"><a name="51111w15.html_spnew8"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 We expect the &#163;130 million capital investment in mental health services announced on 20 October to be distributed to national health service mental health trusts in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08, based on need and investment plans. Until this allocation process is under way, we cannot say which trusts will receive this funding.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action is being taken by the Government to improve the standards of mental health hospitals.  [26473]</p>








<p><a name="st_131"><a name="51111w15.html_spnew9"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 We published the national service framework for mental health (NSF) in 1999, which sets out a comprehensive vision for transforming mental health care in England to 2009. Since 1999, we have increased spending on mental health services by more than &#163;1 billion, from &#163;4.07 billion in 1999&#150;2000 to &#163;5.09 billion in 2003&#150;04. On 20 October, we announced a &#163;130 million capital investment programme, which will be allocated to strategic health authorities from 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51111w15.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_112">This funding will help to update acute in-patient wards and psychiatric intensive care units (PICUs). Standard five of the NSF, &quot;Hospital and Crises Accommodation&quot;, is dedicated to mental health hospitals and it signals our determination to improve the experience of service users who require hospital or PICU admission. This has been followed by departmental guidance, &quot;National Minimum Standards for General Adult Services in PICUs and Low Secure Environments&quot; (2002). The National Institute of Mental Health in England is implementing this guidance as one of its core programmes.

Notes:<br>

1. Registration data include personal dental service counts of patients seen in the past 15 months as a proxy for registrations for some schemes. This is to give greater consistency with registrations data for the GDS, which has a 15 month re-registration period. Many PDS schemes use longer periods and some, such as dental access centres, do not require patients to register.<br>

2. Registration rates (the percentage of the population registered with a dentist) have been estimated by including registrations in the area of the dentist, that is according to the postcode of the dental surgery and not the patient&#039;s address. So the registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live. The figures were calculated using population estimates for the primary care trust areas for the nearest year for which data is available.<br>

<a name="stpa_160">The Regional Housing Strategy also sets out other options for local authorities and their partners to consider in order to provide affordable homes, such as alternative sources of funding and capacity through the planning system. We have approved a PFI (Private Finance Initiative) scheme in Kirklees which is intended to provide 550 affordable housing units up to 2010. There will be 400 units for small households and 150 units for people requiring extra care housing. Kirklees council are also delivering around 100 affordable units a year through the planning system and section 106 agreements.

On 19 September, a day of fast moving events, the Ministry of Defence was consulted throughout. The acting commander of British forces in MND (SE) was able to take the difficult decision to mount the operation to enter the police station in the knowledge that he had the full support of the chain of command. The two British soldiers arrested in Basra on 19 September by the Iraqi Police Service are both UK nationals and were not carrying the passports of any other nation.

<a name="stpa_182">The Iraqi Government have said that the two soldiers were arrested because the Iraqi Police Service initially believed them to be terrorists and they were not able to immediately confirm their status as British soldiers.

<p><a name="st_205"><a name="51111w26.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The British high commissioner in Colombo, accredited to the Maldives, has raised our concerns on the trial of Mohamed Nasheed and current political events on several recent occasions. He did so on 26 September with President Gayoom of the Maldives and on 31 October with the Foreign Minister, Ahmed Shaheed.

<p>
<a name="51111w26.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_193">The deputy high commissioner also raised these issues with Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed in August 2005, shortly after Mr. Nasheed&#039;s arrest, and on 27 October, following his first court appearance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51111w26.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_194">The British high commission is active in co-ordinating EU action locally. It led an EU fact-finding mission to the Maldives in August that met Government Ministers, officials and detainees, including Mohamed Nasheed. An EU statement was issued on 2 September, emphasising the responsibility of the Maldivian authorities to uphold the right of political parties to meet freely and to carry out peaceful political activities. It noted the seriousness of the charges against detainees, called for due process, and made clear that the credibility of such trials would be scrutinised closely. We will continue to underline to the Government of the Maldives its democracy and human rights obligations, both bilaterally and with our EU partners.

 Each new member state will pursue a strategy for adoption of the Euro appropriate to its circumstances, and in line with its obligations under the Treaty establishing the European Community. The new Polish Prime Minister, Mr. Marcinkiewicz, has said that his Government will not seek to adopt the Euro during the current Parliament. Polish President-elect, Lech Kaczynski, has said that he favours holding a referendum before adoption of the Euro.

 There have been several reports of clashes between Government forces and rebels known as &quot;Ninjas&quot; before and since the return to the Republic of Congo of Bernard Kolelas. The Bacongo district of the capital, Brazzaville, was most affected by the violence. Several people are reported to have died in these clashes including Government security forces, rebel fighters and civilians.

<a name="stpa_195">On 20 October, the Congolese army said that the rebels had been forced to flee the Bacongo area. Brazzaville is now said to be calm, although we continue to monitor the situation.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations he has made to the Government of Sudan on coordinated offensive operations undertaken by the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed Arab militia in Darfur <i>(a)</i> on 18 September in Khartoum Djadeed, Sandego, Khasantongur, Tary, Martal and Djabain and <i>(b)</i> on 28 September, in Arusharo, Acho and Gozmena.

<p><a name="st_208"><a name="51111w26.html_spnew3"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 On 18 and 28 September respectively, Arab Militias attacked the towns and surrounding areas of Khartoum Djadet and Aro Sharrow. We also received unconfirmed reports that the Government of Sudan&#039;s airforce acted in co-ordination with the militias during these attacks. The African Union is investigating these incidents and we await their report. Offensive military overflights by the Government of Sudan would constitute a breach of its obligations under the Abuja Security Protocol and, under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1591, those responsible are liable to be targeted with a travel ban and assets freeze.

<a name="stpa_196">We have made clear that the recent increase in violence is unacceptable, and that those responsible must be held to account. During the recent EU Ministerial Troika meeting in Sudan on 8 October, both my noble Friend Lord Triesman, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister for Africa, and the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union, Javier Solana, raised recent attacks with the Sudanese Government. The UK, as EU Presidency, has also issued three statements condemning the recent increase in violence and calling on all sides to
