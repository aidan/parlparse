 Dredging in the Dee estuary is regulated by the Environment Agency in Wales with additional consents being required from both the Welsh Assembly Government and the Department for Transport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w01.html_para0">
As there is an English component to the conservation interests on the Dee, I would expect to be consulted regarding any decision to allow dredging to take place should it affect English interests.

<p><a name="40624w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b>

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Jun 2004 : Column 1466W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>

 I regret that the Department is unable to provide such detail because of the many different ways in which representations are made, including by letter, e mail, petitions and postcard campaigns.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w01.html_para2">
There has been a large number of representations on greyhounds this year, encouraged, no doubt, by a campaign run by a major animal welfare organisation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w01.html_para3">
It is not possible to identify those prosecutions under the Abandonment of Animals Act 1960 that relate to greyhounds because details of the circumstances of the offences are not collected centrally.

<p><a name="40624w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Defra funds projects based on a published priority score system which applies equally to all projects, coastal or otherwise. The score takes account of the number of people protected, benefits as compared to costs, and environmental protection and enhancement. Eligible projects which score at or above the announced threshold will be funded. The threshold score for projects to start in 2004&#150;05 is 20.

 Information on the shortage of affordable houses specifically for rent in London is not held centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

We are calling on the Government of Sudan to consider suspending all regulations relating to humanitarian access to Darfur for a period of three months.

 The Government of Iraq established the public food distribution system in 1990.

This has resulted in new international NGO registrations. They also agreed that medical supplies that were on an approved list did not need testing before being brought into Sudan.

Following my visit, the British Ambassador wrote to the Minister for Humanitarian Affairs and the State Minister for Humanitarian Affairs highlighting specific instances of on-going bureaucratic difficulties about access to Darfur faced by NGOs.

An inter-agency technical committee on Darfur meets regularly to discuss questions of humanitarian access and is attended by the British Ambassador.

 The Department has not carried out a formal assessment of the economic impact of obsolete EU regulation.

This type of obsolete legislation would therefore not have an economic impact once it is no longer applicable. The European Commission is currently taking steps to remove such legislation,, along with other measures to secure a reliable, up-to-date and user-friendly body of EC law as described in its February 2003 Communication, &quot;Updating and Simplifying the Community Acquis&quot; (COM (2003) 71).

<p><a name="40624w11.html_spnew0"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) is a statutory independent body established under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (MDA 1971) to advise the Government on drug related issues within the UK. Two of the ACMD&#039;s subcommittees&#151;the Technical Committee (TC) and the Statistics, Information and Research Committee (SIRC) held several joint meetings in relation to discussing the reclassification of cannabis. The TC has the broad remit of reviewing the MDA 1971 and the Misuse of Drugs Regulations. As part of this it has responsibility for advising the full Council as to the appropriate classification and scheduling of drugs. SIRC, which was dissolved on completion of the cannabis work, was responsible for monitoring and providing advice on research bearing on drug misuse in the UK and drawing attention to the full Council features which appeared most significant. Included at Annex A, is a list of all SIRC members between 2001 and 2003 with their backgrounds and the organisation which they represented. Also included is a list of all Technical Committee Members during the discussions on cannabis reclassification and their respective background and the organisations that they represented.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w11.html_para0">
The ACMD&#039;s minutes and agendas are not public documents. The published report&#151;&quot;The Classification of Cannabis under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971&quot;, published in 2002 represents the considerations and conclusions of the TC, SIRC and the full Council on the reclassification of cannabis. This includes a list of published research material which was taken into consideration. As indicated above, SIRC was disbanded on completion of the cannabis work. However, the articles featured in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> published on 23 November 2002 were closely considered by Professor David Nutt (chair of the ACMD Technical Committee), Sir Michael Rawlins (chair of the ACMD) and Department of Health officials who were content that the advice given by full council to reclassify cannabis was not compromised by the content of the articles.

Please note therefore that much of the increase in reported self-harm in 2003 may result from the change in reporting procedures rather than reflect an actual increase in incidence of self-harm.<br>

In 2004 to 16 June, there have been two apparently self-inflicted deaths at Holloway; the number of incidents of self-harm is not yet available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w14.html_para3">
My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, visited Holloway in April 2004, and I visited the establishment in October 2003. We both had the opportunity to talk with the Governor, with a number of prison staff from a variety of disciplines, and with groups of prisoners. It was clear from our wide-ranging discussions that Holloway is dealing with a large number of vulnerable women, many of whom enter custody already struggling to cope with a wide range of difficult issues that increase their likelihood of suicide and self-harm. These include mental health, drug and alcohol problems; histories of abuse, troubled relationships and social exclusion; as well as past experiences of self-harm.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w14.html_para4">
Both my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I were impressed with Holloway&#039;s First Night in Custody Project, which focuses on the needs of women at the vulnerable stage of entry into prison. The Project was set up in October 2000 and is run by the Prisoner Advice and Care Trust. It employs a full-time project worker and two link workers to help identify women at risk of self-harm or suicide. The project sees over 100 prisoners a month and makes referrals to services in and outside the prison on housing needs, mental health problems, drug or alcohol problems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w14.html_para5">
Holloway is also one of the three prisons currently piloting Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), an innovative programme developed for women with &#039;borderline personality disorder&#039; who also self-harm or engage in suicidal behaviours.

20 safer cells are to be installed at Holloway by October 2005. Safer cells, which are manufactured and installed to make the attachment of ligatures very difficult, have been found effective in preventing impulsive suicide attempts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w14.html_para7">
Across the prisons estate, women prisoners are to benefit from a specifically targeted and separate suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy being developed for them. This draws upon specialist knowledge of suicidal behaviour among women prisoners, and builds upon a number of interventions including: individual crisis counselling for women prisoners who self-harm; the continued development and evaluation of DBT; investment and planning to ensure progress on the detoxification strategy in women&#039;s prisons; and the introduction of a new training pack for all staff working with women in custody, which includes a module on the health and well-being of women prisoners. &#163;1 million from the Department of Health has been allocated to women&#039;s prisons to be spent on the recruitment of psychiatric nurses.

Along with the majority of other member states I supported the report on intelligence capacities by the Secretary General Javier Solana.

Thirdly, that all member states should be actively involved with the European Borders Agency. Fourthly, that all member states need to include biometrics in passports and, finally, that the EU needs to find a way of taking action on security measures on ID cards.

Commissioner Vitorino then presented the Communication on the implementation of measures agreed at the Tampere Council in 1999 and highlighting the positive work done, notably on migration and counter-terrorism. Emphasising that the new College and JHA Commissioner would have their own views on the future JHA programme, Vitorino identified integration of the new member states into Schengen, and action at the EU&#039;s external border to combat illegal immigration and trafficking as important areas for future JHA action. He also saw a need for further work on common standards for criminal procedural law, on data protection and on rules on evidence in cross-border prosecutions. Finally, he identified the need for better evaluation and implementation of adopted legislation.

I welcomed the Communication and made clear that although our earlier proposals on zones of protection had been a useful contribution to the debate, our thinking had moved on and we were no longer pushing them.

During the Mixed Committee the Presidency sought views on whether the draft Regulation on standards for security features and biometrics in passports should require one or two mandatory biometric identifiers, and whether the second identifier&#151;be it mandatory or optional&#151;should be fingerprints. I pointed out that the UK is currently running trials of the different technologies and that it would be better to wait for the results before deciding what the second identifier should be. Although two other member states supported me, a majority supported fingerprints as a second indicator although there was no consensus as to whether this should be mandatory. The Presidency concluded that further work should proceed on the basis of one mandatory biometric identifier, the facial image, and a second optional indicator, namely fingerprints.

<p><a name="40624w16.html_wqn7"><b> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the reasons are for the proposals <i>(a)</i> to remove the requirement for an inspector to be in charge of searches under code B of the Police and Criminal Evidence codes and <i>(b)</i> to remove the requirement for the arresting officer presence to justify arrest or detention under code C of the codes.  [177778]</p>









<p><a name="40624w16.html_spnew7"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The information is as follows:
</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w16.html_para3">
<i>(a)</i> In the August 2004 edition of the Codes it is proposed to remove the legislative requirement for an officer of Inspector rank to be in charge of searches under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Schedule 1 or the Terrorism Act 2000, Schedule 5. This change will provide consistency with other parts of the Codes whereby the officer in charge of the search is the senior officer present (See Code B, 2F). Searches in the categories specified will not always require supervision by an officer of Inspector rank and judgements about the necessary level of supervision need to be made in each individual case.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w16.html_para4">
<i>(b)</i> It is proposed that the following paragraph be inserted into Code C, paragraph 3.4: &quot;If the arresting officer is not physically present when the detainee is brought to a police station, the arresting officer&#039;s account must be made available to the custody officer remotely or by a third party on the arresting officer&#039;s behalf&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w16.html_para5">
This new provision will enable officers to remain on front-line duties without being taken &quot;off the street&quot; to travel to and from the police station. It will also enable greater use of designated detention officers under sections 38 and 39 of the Police Reform Act 2002. The Code does not currently require the arresting officer to be present at the point at which the suspect is brought before the custody officer.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w17.html_para2">
As regards vehicles registered within the European Union, this exemption stems from Directive 83/182.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the average <i>(a)</i> amount and <i>(b)</i> proportion of working days spent on scrutiny of new drug applications that is accounted for by examination of raw data from Phase 3 clinical trials.  [179575]</p>








<p><a name="40624w24.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Companies are required to submit, for review and assessment, summaries of all the clinical data and these are much more useful than the examination of the actual raw data for helping to determine the quality, safety and efficacy of products. The average amount of time spent by all assessors assessing a new drug is approximately 50 working days, only a small proportion of which is spent on review of raw data.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what proportion of the fees charged for the licensing of a new drug is typically earmarked for post-marketing surveillance; and what his estimate is of the average amount payable for each new drug made available for that purpose.  [179719]</p>








<p><a name="40624w24.html_spnew5"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Initial application fees for new drugs cover the work associated with the assessment and evaluation of an application prior to granting a marketing authorisation. Fees for post-marketing surveillance of authorised drugs are charged through an annual service fee for each live marketing authorisation. This service fee covers a number of activities, including enforcement, renewals and post-marketing surveillance activities and it accounts for around 36 per cent., of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&#039;s annual budget.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w24.html_para1">
The service fee is tiered according to the type of application, to reflect the increased post-marketing activity in newer drugs, compared to well established generic drugs. A newly authorised medicine attracts an annual service fee of &#163;14,768, compared to &#163;1,521 for an established prescription only medicine, or &#163;275 for a general sale list product. Because the service fee covers a number of activities, it is not possible to estimate the amount available purely for post-marketing surveillance for each new product.

 The chief executive&#039;s report, published in May 2004, highlighted a number of areas where the national health service is becoming more productive including:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Productivity improvements in the ambulance service and cardiology.</p>

The Department has been undertaking work on productivity measurement including the development on an interim measure of NHS cost efficiency that takes account of expenditure on improving the quality of NHS services. Although this measure is still under development and not yet finalised, initial results suggest that cost efficiency in 2002&#150;03 improved by over 1 per cent.

Further work by the Department to improve productivity measurement is now being undertaken in conjunction with the Office for National Statistics and with the review of measurement of Government output and productivity commissioned by Len Cook. Two aims of this review, led by Sir Tony Atkinson, are to improve the way health outputs are measured in the national accounts and to support improved measures of health productivity.

 Professor Sir Alistair Breckenridge was appointed as chairman of the Pharmacovigilance Sub-committee of the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) from 1 January 1996 and served in that post until 31 December 1998. Until the end of 1997 he had declared personal interests in SmithKline and Beecham as a member of its Scientific Advisory Committee. It is acceptable for members of medicines advisory committees, and chairmen and members of sub-committees to hold interests in the pharmaceutical industry so long as they are declared publicly.

<p>
<a name="40624w28.html_para0">
Members of all of the Medicines Act Advisory committees are required to follow a code of practice on declarations of interests in the pharmaceutical industry. Both the code and the individual details of members&#039; interests are published annually in the advisory bodies&#039; reports. Copies are available in the Library and are also available on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&#039;s web site (www.mhra.gov.uk). The code of practice sets out the types of interests that should be declared and also provides a framework for ensuring that conflicts of interests are avoided in the course of the advisory bodies&#039; work. A legal adviser attends every meeting of the advisory bodies and ensures that the code is complied with.

The overall NHS sickness absence rates have changed little over the last five years.

 Guidance on prescribing and use of Zyban, including possible side effects, is provided in the authorised summary of product characteristics for health professionals and patient information leaflet. Key prescribing information is also included in the British National Formulary which is sent by the Department to doctors and pharmacists within the national health service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w28.html_para3">
Since marketing, the safety of Zyban has been closely monitored by the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The CSM has looked at the accumulating evidence from Yellow Card reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs), received in association with its use. In accordance with their advice, a number of steps have been taken to optimise the safe use of Zyban and to minimise the risk of side effects, particularly seizures. This includes advice to general practitioners and smoking cessation clinics, which was issued in March 2001, reminding them of the safety profile of Zyban and of information posted on the CSM website.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w28.html_para4">
In May 2001, the CSM issued new guidance strengthened warnings particularly about potential interactions with other medicines and advised a slower increase in the dose of Zyban in order to minimise the

risk of side effects, the lower 150mg dose should be prescribed for the first six days, increasing to 150mg twice daily on day seven rather than day four. This new guidance was issued in order to allow more time for the drug levels to stabilise, to help minimise the risk of adverse reactions, particularly seizures. Since this guidance was issued, the reporting rate of suspected ADRs has fallen significantly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w28.html_para5">
A total of 8,466 reports of suspected adverse reactions have been received via the Yellow Card scheme in the United Kingdom. The most commonly reported reactions are urticaria, insomnia, rash, headache, dizziness and nausea, which are recognised reactions and are listed in the product information provided to prescribers and patients. It is important to note that these suspected reactions are not necessarily caused by the drug and may relate to other factors such as nicotine withdrawal, other illnesses or other medicines taken concurrently.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40624w28.html_para6">
The safety of Zyban continues to be monitored closely by the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority/CSM. The CSM has advised that the balance of the effectiveness of Zyban in helping people to stop smoking, and the health benefits that this brings, compared with the risk of adverse effects remains favourable.
