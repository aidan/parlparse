 We are now measuring the level of fraud and error by means of a monthly rolling programme of reviews in each Benefits Agency area. A regular, random sample of cases is investigated thoroughly to establish how much fraud and error they contain.

 The Department's statisticians have not made a detailed assessment of whether any Households Below Average Income (HBAI) statistics could be robustly produced on a quarterly basis. However, past experience raises doubts as to whether any robust results could be produced on a quarterly basis.

 It is not possible to make estimates at a local level of the numbers of children who will be taken out of poverty.

 "An Organisation with a Memory", the report of an expert group chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, was published on 13 June 2000. The group examined the extent to which the National Health Service and its constituent organisations had the capability to learn from untoward incidents and service failures so that similar occurrences are avoided in future. The report's main recommendation is the introduction of a mandatory reporting system for adverse health care events and specified near misses. We are taking steps to implement such a system and expect to have made significant progress before the end of the year.

 We are setting standards through the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and the national service frameworks. We are ensuring local delivery through clinical governance and monitoring delivery through the performance assessment framework and the Commission for Health Improvement. On 14 July we published a second set of performance indicators which will enable the local health service to identify where their performance falls below that of the best and we expect measures to be taken to improve poorly performing services. We are working with relevant parties, utilising the record increases in National Health Service funding to improve NHS performance and tackle health inequalities.

 Investment in neonatal hearing screening over the last five years is estimated to be in the region of &#163;18 million per annum: that is &#163;3 million per annum on targeted neonatal hearing screening and &#163;15 million per annum on health visitors performing the infant distraction test.
<P>

<a name="00725w02.html_para0">The United Kingdom National Screening Committee (NSC) has recommended that a universal neonatal hearing screening (UNHS) programme should replace the infant distraction test to screen for hearing impairment. This was based on a report by the health technology assessment programme 'A critical review of the role of neonatal screening in the detection of congenital hearing impairment'.
<P>

<a name="00725w02.html_para1">An expert group, which included representatives of professional groups, National Health Service bodies, voluntary organisations, Government Departments and other interested bodies, was convened by the NSC and undertook further detailed work on the benefits, cost-benefits and feasibility and service issues of developing a UNHS programme. The committee took existing and emerging research findings into account in making its recommendations.
<P>

<a name="00725w02.html_para2">We have recently agreed to conduct a pilot programme to evaluate the optimum way in which this change in service delivery might be achieved. The pilot programme will run for 12 months at a cost of &#163;750,000. The pilot will help us gain a better understanding of the operational implications of running a national programme, including its potential cost.
<P>

<a name="00725w02.html_para3">Project and steering groups will be established shortly to oversee the development of the pilot programme. Key professional, voluntary, NHS and policy stakeholders will be appropriately involved. The Department will be writing to the NHS about participating in the pilot project and the timescales later in the autumn.

 A central special assistance fund has existed since 1996-97. It provides financial assistance to some health authorities to facilitate strategic change, such as reconfiguring patient services at NHS trusts. Special assistance helps fund some of the short-term non-recurrent costs of change, for example double running or redundancy costs. Within London, the London Fund also provides non-recurrent transitional funding to support strategic changes.
<P>

<a name="00725w03.html_para1">Capital funding is approved on the basis of information contained in a business case which is considered by regional offices. Access to funding is dependent on competing investment priorities in the region.

For the schemes at Rochdale and Central Sheffield PFI was identified as unsuitable early in the procurement process and not pursued further. Comparative figures are therefore unavailable. The figures for the schemes at Royal Berkshire and Guys and St. Thomas's are shown in the tables.

<P>
<a name="00725w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 I have no plans to establish an inquiry into the role of SCOPE under section 81 of the Children Act. I understand that allegations concerning a school run by SCOPE near Leeds were thoroughly investigated by the police and child protection services in 1995. They concluded that there was not sufficient evidence for criminal prosecution. The Department for Education and Employment subsequently considered the allegations and, as a result one former care worker was barred from working in relevant employment and placed on List 99.

1. Population estimates are mid-year estimates based on 1991 census data<P>

2. For 1996 and the first half of 1997 data have been amalgamated to the approximate boundaries of the new Regional Office areas. This allows for comparison with subsequent years<P>

3. Data for 2000 are incomplete, therefore the rate per 100,000 cannot be calculated<P>

4. An incident is three or more patients infected or colonised by the same strain of MRSA in the same month from the same hospital<P>

5. The criteria for submission of isolates of MRSA (and other isolates of staphylococcus aureus) to the PHLS for specialist tests have been revised twice since 1996 (in January 1998 and in January 2000). <P>

 <i>[holding answer 21 July 2000]:</i> Fertilisers and soil improvers are regulated in Great Britain by the Fertilisers Regulations 1991, SI 1991/2197 (as amended by SI 1995/16, SI 1997/1543 and SI 1998/2024). The regulations implement EU Directives 76/116/EEC, 80/876/EEC, 88/183/EEC, 89/284/EEC, 89/530 and 93/69/EEC. A Commission-led working group is examining consolidation of the existing Directives into a single Directive, but it is unlikely to propose any decrease in regulation in this area.

[131899]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 July 2000]:</i> Discussions about the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) have taken place between EU Environment Ministers. Measures to comply with the requirements of the IPPC Directive will be based on Best Available Techniques reference (BREF) documents, which will be agreed at Community level. These documents aim to ensure all member states adopt measures that offer equivalent environmental protection.
<P>

<a name="00725w05.html_para1">Under the Action Plan for Farming, announced by the Prime Minister following the Agriculture Summit on 30 March, the Government are committed to implementing environmental legislation that impacts on the farming industry in the least bureaucratic and burdensome way.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The measures that we expect will apply to most of the poultry industry in England under the IPPC Directive will be set out in general binding rules. These are currently under discussion between the Environment Agency, the Government and representatives of the poultry sector and will be put out for public consultation shortly. Poultry farmers with existing installations will not be required to implement these measures until 2007.
<P>

<a name="00725w05.html_para2">Some member states already impose environmental controls similar to those required to be put in place under IPPC.

It was also the organisation's first year as a Trading Fund.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to attract to the United Kingdom entrepreneurs offering exceptional economic benefit but who do not meet the current criteria under the immigration rules.  [133025]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 There are already specific categories in the Immigration Rules designed specially for entrepreneurs. These ensure that those who wish to make significant personal investments in creating employment can enter to engage in business. There are also clear routes for corporations wishing to establish branches and subsidiaries here. But the Government's Competitiveness White Paper signalled the economic importance of a dynamic approach to building a knowledge driven economy and the need to attract people with scarce skills and those willing to set up businesses which create jobs. That paper included a specific commitment to examine the scope for further encouraging certain entrepreneurs to consider migrating to the United Kingdom.




<P>
<P><I>25 Jul 2000 : Column: 511W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00725w06.html_para3">In the light of that commitment, we have assessed the current Immigration Rules for business and entrepreneurs and have concluded they may not always fit well with a knowledge driven economy since they require minimum levels of investment and do not focus on innovation. Moreover, the current routes for entrepreneurs do not enable us to focus on those applications with the greatest potential of economic benefit.
<P>

<a name="00725w06.html_para4">We have, therefore, decided to introduce a scheme, which will be piloted as a concessionary arrangement outside the Immigration Rules in the first instance, aimed at attracting entrepreneurial innovators to the United Kingdom.

 We attach particular importance to protecting young persons from those who would do them harm.

The highest level of certificate that will be available under these arrangements will relate principally to those regularly caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of persons under the age of 18. In such cases, in addition to information about criminal convictions, police forces will be required to disclose any other information which, in the chief officer's opinion, might be relevant, and, under a "one-stop shop" arrangement, checks will also be made of a Department for Education and Employment list of persons who are

 Xenotransplanatation includes the transplantation of organs, such as hearts and kidneys, between different animal species and from animals into humans. Organ transplantation is a hugely successful medical procedure--one that has transformed the lives of tens of thousands of people across the world. The critical shortage of human donor organs has led scientists to investigate xenotransplantation as an alternative potential source of organs. This is a policy on which the Department of Health leads.

 To meet section 5(4) of the 1986 Act, any application to use protected animals in research must be subjected to a detailed cost/benefit assessment by Home Office Inspectors. The likely adverse effects on the animal concerned must be weighed against the benefits likely to accrue as a result of the proposed programme of work. In making this assessment, the general categories of potential benefits that are currently considered are: human, animal and ecological benefits: improved health or welfare, plant protection, food hygiene, safeguarding of the environment; scientific benefits: resolution of controversies, increasing scientific knowledge; educational benefits: meeting educational objectives which cannot be satisfied using non-animal methods; and other benefits: including forensic inquiries.

<a name="00725w07.html_para0">Cheaper health care for everyone can be considered a benefit, but not the profitability of a company which sets out to provide cheaper health care nor the implications for employment arising from the programme of work in the project licence application. The technical expertise of the project licence holder and the personal licence holders may affect the outcome of the cost/benefit assessment. This can be relevant either to the cost (in terms of the standard to which work can be done) or the benefit, when the likelihood of success may be affected. But the involvement of individuals is regulated by the controls applying to personal licences.
<P>

<a name="00725w07.html_para1">Following its review of the operation of the 1986 Act, the Animal Procedures Committee concluded that the cost/benefit assessment provided a workable and flexible framework in which to decide whether the use of animals is justified (Chapter 2 of Appendix F of the Committee's Annual Report for 1997). However, the Committee felt that there were some areas where further discussion and consideration were needed and it has set up a working group to take this forward. The group plans to issue a public consultation paper later this year and to produce an authoritative statement on how the present cost/benefit system can be improved. The Government will consider what changes are necessary to the operation of the arrangements in the light of the Committee's report.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w08.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce the Review of ECGD's Mission and Status, which I announced to the House on 27 July 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 305-06, is now complete and the Government have accepted its conclusions.
<P>

<a name="00725w08.html_para13">When I announced this Review, I referred to a number of other concurrent reviews of ECGD's activities. These are also complete and I refer my hon. Friend in particular to a separate announcement on the outcome of the Risk Management Review, in answer to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna) today, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 519-20W. The Report of ECGD's Mission and Status (Cm 4790), and all other Reports connected with this fundamental scrutiny of ECGD's role, have today been placed in the Library of the House, including the Report of a study by National Economic Research Associates (NERA) on the Economic Rationale for the Public Provision of Export Credit Insurance by ECGD (Cm 4791) and a Report on the provision of ECGD's Reinsurance for Exports Sold on Short Terms of payment (Cm 4793). This now means that all the Government's current reviews of ECGD's activities are at an end.
<P>

<a name="00725w08.html_para14">The Mission and Status Review was informed by a wide-ranging public consultation exercise and Reports by the Trade and Industry Committee, in its Third Report on ECGD: "The Future of the Export Credits Guarantee Department" published by the Committee on 20 January this year (Third Report, HC 52) and the International Development Committee's Report: "ECGD--Development Issues" published 20 December 1999 (First Report, HC73).

support in the future--the conclusions of the Review published this afternoon set out a new direction for ECGD. It says ECGD should:
<P>

<a name="00725w08.html_para16"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Introduce greater openness and transparency to its operations. This includes greater consultation with customers and interested parties together with the appointment of outside Directors to ECGD's Management Board. The Export Guarantees Advisory Council's remit and membership should also be changed to advise on policy and principles, not individual risk decisions.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00725w08.html_para17"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Seek to attract more medium-sized exporters and investors as direct customers; offering a package of products geared to light capital goods and services and smaller projects. ECGD should work with the Small Business Service, Regional Development Agencies and British Trade International to increase understanding of ECGD services amongst smaller exporters.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00725w08.html_para18"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Support the Government's objectives of promoting sustainable development, human rights, good governance and trade throughout the world, by ensuring its activities are consistent with these wider international policies. ECGD will publish further details of how it plans to assess project impacts by the end of 2000.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00725w08.html_para19">We need to ensure that UK firms remain able to compete effectively against exporters and investors supported by Government-backed Export Credit Agencies in other countries. The changes will ensure speedier decision making, giving greater certainty to firms and new efforts to attract smaller exporters who may be looking to export to unfamiliar areas of the world.
<P>

<a name="00725w08.html_para20">The Report recommends that ECGD should be reformed and strengthened to ensure it is able to meet the challenges of the years ahead. From today ECGD will be working to a new Mission Statement.
<P>

<a name="00725w08.html_para21">ECGD's financial targets will be maintained, as will its overall risk appetite. It will be strengthening its risk management systems and establishing a capitalised framework and a Trading Fund, this should lead to ECGD having complete operational autonomy.
<P>

<a name="00725w08.html_para22">Further development of its systems for assessing sensitive projects and publication of more information on these, together with a statement of Business Principles to guide and inform its business policies and practice will help increase transparency and understanding.
<P>

<a name="00725w08.html_para23">The Reinsurance Review, which is also published today, concludes that, without withdrawing its present reinsurance arrangements, ECGD should work to transfer 100 per cent. of its short-term credit insurance risk to the private sector.
<P>

<a name="00725w08.html_para24">The Report sets out an ambitious reform agenda for ECGD which it needs to take forward in consultation with its customers and other interested parties. I am confident that ECGD will be able to continue to give first-class support to UK firms to compete for business opportunities abroad--thereby bringing economic benefit to the UK and countries in which it is supporting projects.

[131441]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w09.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 On 1 June 2000, some 240 temporary workers were engaged within DTI headquarters. This is equivalent to 5.7 per cent. of the number of staff in post. Information on vacant posts is not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="00725w09.html_para0">In 1999-2000, around &#163;6 million was spent on the hiring of temporary workers. It is not possible to estimate the difference in cost between permanent and temporary staff, given the wide variation in the cost of the latter. The cost of temporary workers is carried on salary cost budgets: it is not, therefore, possible to anticipate the likely expenditure on the hiring of temporary workers during the current financial year.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry expects to announce the allocations of the Science Budget to individual Research Councils, including the Natural Environment Research Council, in the autumn, after taking advice from the Director General of Research Councils.

 There are currently two high profile disputes between the EU and US involving agricultural products--bananas and hormone-treated beef. A number of sectors are currently affected by US retaliation over the banana dispute, with further sectors threatened by the US move to carousel retaliation. The only way to alleviate the burden being borne by the companies facing US sanctions is to find a solution to the banana dispute that is satisfactory to all parties. UK companies are not affected by the hormone-treated beef dispute. I have no plans to make a statement on this issue.

But the matter is fundamentally for the UN to resolve, and we have given them our full support in their efforts to do so. We understand that despite the restrictions UNFICYP are still able to carry out their mandate and the people of Strovilia are able to travel freely.

<P>
<a name="00725w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 On 30 June, the OSCE adopted measures to improve its capability to respond more quickly and effectively to crises through the despatch of Rapid Expert Assistance and Co-operation Teams (REACT). The aim is for the OSCE to be able to deploy civilian personnel, with a range of conflict prevention and resolution skills tailored to the requirements of a particular crisis, anywhere in the OSCE area, when required. As part of this, the OSCE is to create an Operations Centre to plan and co-ordinate the rapid, as well as regular, deployment of international staff to OSCE missions. The success of this initiative, agreed at the Istanbul Summit, will depend on the commitment and will of OSCE participating states to provide the necessary personnel within the requisite timescale. In line with our current policy, the UK aims to provide about 10 per cent. of the OSCE's overall deployment of personnel in the field.

 The scale of the HIV/AIDS crisis in Zimbabwe is enormously serious. Twenty five per cent. of adults are HIV positive. Fifteen-year-olds have a one in two risk of dying from HIV/AIDS in their lifetimes. It is sinking countless families further into poverty.

 The HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa is a major development policy priority for the UK Government. I myself hold regular discussions with other Whitehall Departments on a wide range of development issues, including HIV/AIDS. My Department has an on-going dialogue with FCO and other Whitehall Departments concerning HIV/AIDS policy both at the international level and within the African region. Recent examples include co-ordination with FCO for the UN Security Council Resolution on HIV/AIDS, the EU-Africa summit in April and on preparation of briefing for last week's G8 summit. My Department, with DTI and FCO, is also involved in developing UK policy on the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, this has been raised as one issue in the debate surrounding access to essential drugs for HIV/AIDS.

<P>
<a name="00725w12.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 No information is held centrally to allow such an estimate to be made. Clearly it is regrettable when companies take decisions to relocate manufacturing operations from Scotland, as in the recent case of Philips Lighting Hamilton. The Government are committed to continuing the work of providing a sound and stable economic environment for business and making a long-term investment in skills. As a result, Scotland remains attractive for inward investment. Indeed the latest figures released by Locate In Scotland show that in the year to March 2000 Scotland successfully attracted a total of 91 projects involving planned investment of &#163;650 million and planned creation or safeguarding of over 19,000 jobs.

<a name="00725w12.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The United Kingdom's membership of the European Union has delivered to Scotland tangible economic benefits through such measures as the Common Agricultural Policy, delivering direct funding in 1999 of &#163;475.9 million, and structural funds worth &#163;1 billion in 1994-96 and &#163;1.1 billion for 2000-06. Membership of the European Union also delivers to Scotland access to the biggest market in the world with some 375 million consumers--63 per cent. of Scottish manufacturing exports in 1998 went to Europe. These tangible benefits are in addition to the benefits Scotland enjoys from the peace and security brought about through the collaboration of member states in the Union. UK membership of the Union also affords Scotland a role and position of influence on the European and global stages that could not be achieved by Scotland acting on its own.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am pleased to say that the MoU for the UK's participation in the United States Co-operative Engagement Capability (CEC) programme was signed on 18th July 2000. The application of CEC technology will improve the RN's ability to detect, monitor and counter current and future air threats, reducing the risk of losing high value warships, as well as reducing the risk of casualties and fratricide. UK participation in CEC will also increase considerably the interoperability of UK and US Naval Forces. Royal Navy Type 23 Frigates are planned to be the first RN warships equipped with CEC. Other major surface warships will also be fitted with CEC in due course.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The estimated total procurement cost of integrating CEC into Type 23 and Type 45 is &#163;174M and the whole life costs are estimated at around &#163;250M. Both these figures are at 1999 prices.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked what steps are being taken to eliminate the slippage in the Nimrod MRA4 programme. The Nimrod MRA4 contract was let with BAE SYSTEMS in December 1996 with an In-Service Date (ISD) of April 2003. Following technical and resource problems, BAE SYSTEMS advised the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) in late 1998 that they could not meet this date. In May 1999, following extensive negotiations the contract was re-baselined with an ISD of March 2005, a delay of 23 months and with the MoD securing various benefits in compensation.</FONT></UL>

The Ministry of Defence's remit is to examine all options for disposing of this material including its conversion into civilian MOX fuel. However, as the quantity of weapons grade plutonium which is surplus to Defence requirements is a very small percentage of the overall UK plutonium stocks, we shall be taking account of civil industry's plans for disposal of their much larger amounts. Disposal of such materials is, of course, a very complex matter and final decisions are unlikely for quite some time.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will set out the quantities of <i>(a)</i> precursors for chemical weapons and <i>(b)</i> chemical weapon agents held at Porton Down research establishment, used for prophylactic research; on what dates the United Kingdom disposed of its chemical weapons; and what amount was disposed of on each occasion, in the last 10 years.  [130852]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w17.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) permits the retention of toxic chemicals and their precursors, where they are intended for purposes not prohibited under the Convention. Such permitted purposes include research, medical, pharmaceutical and protective purposes. Toxic chemicals and precursors are classified according to three Schedules, primarily on the basis of their usability as chemical weapons, the risk they pose to the Convention, and their commercial utility.
<P>

<a name="00725w17.html_para0">The UK, as a State Party to the CWC, is permitted to hold up to an aggregate of 1 tonne of Schedule 1 chemicals. The Chemical and Biological Defence Sector of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency at Porton Down is licensed by the CWC National Authority to hold Schedule 1 chemicals for permitted purposes and is required to make an annual declaration of holdings and usage.
<P>

<a name="00725w17.html_para1">The declaration is not made public for reasons of national security and so I am withholding information about specific quantities under Exemption 1 of the Code Of Practice on Access to Government Information.

<P>

<a name="00725w17.html_para3">The UK abandoned its offensive chemical weapons capability in the 1950s. The bulk of residual stocks of munitions and agents were disposed of at that time. Approximately 4,500kg of bulk chemical agent dating from before 1946 was destroyed between 1993 and entry into force of the CWC in 1997. In addition, from time to time, munitions suspected of containing chemical agent dating from before 1946 are found in the UK, for example, during land remediation, and brought to Porton Down. Disposal takes place throughout the year as operational constraints permit. Over the last 10 years, 3,418 items of this type have been disposed of.

<a name="00725w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2000]:</i> In the short time available it has not been possible to establish whether, at the time of their investigation into the crash of RAF Chinook ZD576, Sir William Wratten and Sir John Day knew the extent of the Department's claim against Textron Lycoming. This litigation sought redress for faulty test procedures that caused a Chinook helicopter undergoing tests on the ground at Wilmington, USA to be severely damaged. We know that in their report to the RAF Board of Inquiry, the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) states:

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Strip examination of the engines indicated that both were running at high speed with turbines hot at the time of impact, and revealed no signs of pre-impact failure or malfunction that could have affected the operation of either engine.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00725w17.html_para7">Thus, as the evidence available indicated that the engines were working normally up to the point of impact, it was reasonable to conclude that FADEC could not have been a factor in the accident. The action taken by MOD arising out of faulty test procedures in the early days of the system's development programme had no relevance to the accident under investigation. It is therefore irrelevant whether Sir William and Sir John were aware of the litigation against Textron Lycoming. Similarly it is irrelevant whether the engineering member of the RAF Board of Inquiry into the Chinook ZD576 accident advised the other members of the Board about the test at Wilmington.

 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2000]:</i> The Defence Manual of Security mandates the baseline security requirements, which must be met before Communications and Information Systems are allowed to handle official information.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his Department's policy is on sourcing food supplies for the armed forces; and if he will make a statement.  [132878]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w18.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The supply of food for our armed forces is contracted to "3663". A key requirement of the contract, as with other procurement programmes, is that it should deliver value for money. 3663 are required to seek the best prices in the open market for the products we need. I am as keen, however, on seeing our Servicemen and women eating British products as I am for our contractor to secure the best value for money, and 3663 are required specifically to give full consideration to British products which we look to them to buy wherever they are competitive. 3663 are currently supplying a range of over 1,300 different products for our armed forces, including fresh, chilled and frozen commodities, a number of which are not made or grown in this country. The company advise that almost 1,000 of these are presently British.
<P>

<a name="00725w18.html_para0">We have given particular attention to meat procurement. We are currently sourcing 100 per cent. of our pork and 50 per cent. of our gammon and bacon from the UK, and I am pleased to announce that with effect from July our supplies of bacon and gammon have been 100 per cent. British sourced. Since the autumn of 1998 we have been supplying 100 per cent. British beef to our Service personnel based in the UK, following agreement by the EC to release British intervention beef, at competitive prices, for our use. Our supplies of British intervention beef will, however, start to run out progressively later this year and current market prices are likely to lead to a mix of British and imported beef for future supplies. We will, however, be working closely with farmers' representatives to ensure that we maximise the amount of British beef that can be supplied competitively. In the case of lamb, our efforts to source British products at competitive prices have so far been unsuccessful. The market has been unable to take up our offer of a substantial forward buy which we hoped might attract competitive prices. The main difficulties have included capacity issues (in particular butchery and blast freezing) and the narrow range of cuts we require, as well as price. Our efforts to source more British lamb are, however, continuing.

 My Department does not collect statistics identifying children with special educational needs by specific categories. The total special needs population was shown as 1,700,000 on the last full return in 1999--just over 20 per cent. of the total school population.
<P>

<a name="00725w19.html_para2">This Government have demonstrated their commitment to improving education for all children with special needs. Schools are educating children with a wide range of needs, and so need a range of programmes and advice. We are supporting schools with a broad package of measures, including the SEN Programme of Action, the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies and our Excellence in Cities programme.

We do not expect teachers to keep troublemakers in the classroom at any cost, and have written to all headteachers so that they know they have our full support if they have to exclude such pupils permanently. The Secretary of State also announced at the National Association of Headteachers' conference on 1 June that he would be changing the guidance to exclusion appeal panels to indicate that where there has been violence or severe threat of violence it is inappropriate for a permanently excluded child to be re-instated to the same school.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what investigations his 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jul 2000 : Column: 564W</I><P>
Department has conducted into allegations of child abuse at Hawksworth Hall; what the results of the investigations were; and what actions he proposes to take.  [131968]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w19.html_spnew4"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The allegations of abuse at Hawksworth Hall were thoroughly investigated by the police and by child protection services in 1995. They concluded that there was not sufficient evidence for criminal prosecution. My Department subsequently considered the allegations, and as a result one former care worker was barred from working in relevant employment and placed on the Department's List 99.
<P>

<a name="00725w19.html_para11">We feel there are no grounds for any further action in the case of Hawksworth Hall, which closed in 1998. We are however fully committed to measures to safeguard children's welfare and protect them from unsuitable people. The Government recently published "Learning the Lessons," its response to "Lost in Care:" the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Abuse of Children in the former county council areas of Gwynedd and Clwyd since 1974. This sets out many of the measures being taken to protect the welfare of children in residential schools, or in the care of local authorities.
<P>

<a name="00725w19.html_para12">The Protection of Children Act 1999 makes provision for a new list of people who are unsuitable to work with children to be kept by the Secretary of State for Health, and further measures to protect children from unsuitable people are proposed in the Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill.

 The education element of the Home Office's Section 11 Grant scheme ceased on 31 March 1999. It was replaced by a new grant, the Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant, administered by my Department. For 2000-01 &#163;162.5 million will be available nationally to improve the attainment of ethnic minority, Traveller and refugee pupils. This represents an increase of 7 per cent. on the amount available for the same purposes in 1999-2000. The details requested are set out in the table. They include, separately, allocations under the Adult Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant which was also previously funded under Section 11.

<a name="00725w20.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The introduction of Baseline Assessment from 1998 in all primary schools helps teachers plan to meet the learning needs of all pupils, including those with learning difficulties. The National Curriculum also provides a framework within which teachers have the flexibility to deliver programmes of study appropriate to the needs and abilities of the children they are teaching, and the assessment arrangements associated with it provide schools with a reliable and consistent analysis of pupil performance, enabling teachers to assess pupils' progress and develop their teaching strategies accordingly. More generally, the "Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of Special Education Needs" contains practical guidance for schools, local education authorities and others on how to identify, make provision for, and to monitor the progress of children with special educational needs, including those with learning disabilities. A variety of assessment procedures and ways of tracking pupils' progress are used, depending on the type and extent of a child's special educational needs.

<P>
<a name="00725w20.html_spnew4"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 It is for Local Education Authorities and schools to determine how to provide best for deaf children in the light of local circumstances. The Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of Special Educational Needs includes guidance on the steps to be taken to identify and meet the needs of children with sensory impairments, including hearing difficulties.
<P>

<a name="00725w20.html_para1">The Department does not provide guidelines specifically on the use of British Sign Language. The Teacher Training Agency has set standards towards which teachers involved in the teaching of deaf children are encouraged to aim. These include standards on the use of British Sign Language as a means of teaching deaf children. In addition, teachers of whole classes of deaf children are required to gain a mandatory qualification, approved by the Secretary of State. Providers of courses leading to such a mandatory qualification are now required to bid against a national specification in order to run courses beginning in September 2001. The national specification requires that all participants completing the mandatory qualification for teaching deaf children should have a minimum competence in signing, equivalent to the Stage 1 qualification from the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People.
<P>

<a name="00725w20.html_para2">We have also supported the National Deaf Children's Society's quality standards in the education of deaf children, which do not favour any single approach to deaf education, but which do provide practical guidance to LEAs and schools on ways of educating deaf children, including the use of British Sign Language.

 As part of our commitment to the achievement of equal opportunity targets, and for monitoring purposes only, appointees to DfEE Non- Departmental Public Bodies voluntarily disclose whether they have a disability. However, information as to the nature of the disability is not requested so data on deaf appointees are unavailable. Of the 410 DfEE NDPB appointments and re-appointments since 1 May 1997, 30 applicants indicated they have a disability.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w21.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Department is not directly responsible for the procurement of schools PFI contracts, and therefore does not hold comprehensive information about the use of school facilities out of school hours. Provisions for any third party use are a matter for negotiation between the school, local education authority and the contractor and, as such, vary from contract to contract. Within schools PFI contracts, however, it is open to the local education authority and the schools concerned to permit their private sector partner to charge for the use of the facilities by others when they are not being used by the schools. There is no requirement, or expectation, that a school must make its facilities available to the wider community on a commercial basis, but allowing such use may encourage lifelong learning, help to reduce vandalism, and have the added benefit of reducing the cost of the scheme overall.

 Water cannon were used on three occasions in Portadown and provided an effective resource in creating distance between police and military lines and those threatening and using violence. The ability to deliver water in differing modes and at a varying pressure enabled a flexible and graduated response to the violence. While it was considered to be effective, it was one of a range of tactics and equipment used to counter serious violence.

 As aggregates are the largest tonnage of onshore minerals extracted, they generate the largest environmental impact, costed at around &#163;380 million per annum in research conducted for DETR in 1997-99. The aggregates levy will send a permanent price signal about this damage, and provide an incentive for the construction industry to reduce waste and make more use of recycled material as substitutes. The scope of the levy was determined following extensive consultation with interested paries, which suggested that certain non- aggregate minerals should not be taxed. These minerals are not open to the same degree of substitution as aggregates. In some cases they are constituents of products subject to significant international competition, so the application of the levy to these materials would raise difficulties over the international competiveness of UK producers.

 There have been no individual studies undertaken to look at the value for money and sustainability of funding to the Mersey Partnership from the public sector. For each Objective 1 bid a full appraisal has been undertaken which include assessments of value for money and the level of public sector contributions. Also, the Mersey Partnership's performance has been monitored primarily on a quarterly basis as Objective 1 claims are submitted; and a separate but connected process has been established for monitoring the use of the Merseyside Development Corporation's residual funding. In addition, the Regional Director of Government Office for the North West has been a member of the Mersey Partnership Board which is provided with quarterly progress reports.

The responsibility for ensuring that these questions comply with the guidelines rests with the Joint Aviation Authorities' Flight Crew Licensing Committee through its Sub-Committee for Examinations and with the individual member states' subject expert teams.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for what reasons the Joint Aviation Requirement-Flight Crew Licensing Committee is not minded to accept the proposals of the European Association of Airline Pilot Schools to review the central question bank and the learning objectives of the JAA ATPL theoretical knowledge examinations.  [132004]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 I understand that this proposal was rejected because review by the European Association of Airline Pilot Schools would infringe the confidentiality of the central question bank. The Association has two representatives on the committee and should be fully aware of the reasons for the rejection of these proposals.

 Between 1996-97 and 1999-2000, Shropshire county council was allocated funding through the Transport Policies and Programme (TPP) system towards local safety schemes, integrated transport packages and minor works. Any funding for child safety schemes and safe routes to school would have been made from the local safety scheme element of these allocations. The table gives details of the total TPP allocations to Shropshire from 1996-97 to 1999-2000.

 The necessary closure of the PIP scheme, following a European Commission decision, is not helpful to us in achieving the 60 per cent. target. However, this funding mechanism was only one method of achieving a target to which a number of programmes and policies contribute. We are determined to achieve that target. As announced in the Spending Review last week, we are making additional substantial resources available to the RDA's programmes, including &#163;60 million this year and &#163;150 million next year for physical regeneration.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the environmental impact of the extraction of minerals other than aggregates.  [131923]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w26.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Part 1 of the London Economics study "The Environmental Costs and Benefits of the Supply of Aggregates", published in 1998, examined how far the estimates of the value of environmental impacts of aggregates could be transferred to the surface extraction of other minerals. It was found that extraction of other surface minerals does not create any specific or additional environmental impacts that were not identified in the case of aggregates. However, the estimates of the value of the costs cannot generally be transferred directly, because the size of the environmental impacts of different types of extractive operations vary, and there may also be specific local factors.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w26.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. David Heath: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what the constituent elements are of the average environmental cost of &#163;1.80 per tonne associated with the extraction and transport of aggregates quoted in HM Customs & Excise press release Number 5 of 21 March.  [131915]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w26.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Total environmental cost was estimated as at least &#163;380 million tonnes per annum for 208 million tonnes of land-won primary aggregate. Just over half of the total estimated costs relate to local impacts of quarrying. The remainder relates to the non-local impacts of quarrying in National Parks and AONBs, generated by the application of the national survey results to such areas. It was assumed that quarries outside these areas have an impact only on those who live locally.

<P><I>25 Jul 2000 : Column: 589W</I><P>
16 crushed rock and sand and gravel quarries surveyed in the London Economics report into the supply of aggregates.  [131916]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w26.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The quarries were selected in order to provide a coverage that was representative of all aggregate quarries in Great Britain in terms of source type, scale of output and population density. The methodology used could not generate robust estimates of environmental costs at the level of the individual quarry.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w26.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. David Heath: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for what reason the report he commissioned from London Economics into the supply of aggregates does not include a valuation of benefits.  [131920]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w26.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government fully recognise the importance of aggregates to the economy. While there is a substantial body of information on the value and uses of aggregates, there had not previously been a valuation of the environmental effects of extraction.
<P>

<a name="00725w26.html_para3">The first phase of the research, published in April 1998, identified that the principal potential environmental benefits of aggregates extraction lie in the restoration of former quarries. Restoration could only be considered an externality--a benefit not reflected in the price of aggregates--if the value of the site was better after restoration than before operations began. It was not possible to identify any such sites in the time available. Most quarries are restored to a level in keeping with the surrounding landscape.
<P>

<a name="00725w26.html_para4">More generally, the survey method used assessed the value that respondents placed on the environmental impacts of quarries. This value therefore reflected the balance of perceived environmental benefits and costs of the quarry remaining open for its permitted lifespan.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w26.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. David Heath: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the research he commissioned from London Economics into the supply of aggregates included survey questions designed to value the cost of aggregate supply from areas of outstanding natural beauty.  [131922]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00725w26.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The research included a national survey to evaluate the costs of quarrying in areas of special environmental value. To elicit such values, respondents were asked about attitudes to quarrying in the Yorkshire Dales and Peak District National Parks. While attitudes to quarrying in other national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty were not examined directly, the results of the national survey can be used to inform judgments about the values placed on quarrying in such areas. National planning policies for minerals are identical in the national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty, reflecting the equivalent value society places on landscape protection in the two types of area.

<P>
<a name="00725w27.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Government's 10 Year Transport Plan announced last week by the Deputy Prime Minister envisages that an east-west rail link will go ahead. The shadow Strategic Rail Authority is currently undertaking a review of the possible east-west cross-London links and expects to report its findings to Ministers by the end of the year. Crossrail is one option for providing through services which will be considered and funding for preparatory work for an east-west rail link, such as Crossrail, was included in London's settlement under the spending review announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor last week. The Mayor will wish to consider Crossrail in the light of his priorities for an integrated transport strategy for London. A number of options exist for the westerly connections to the Crossrail option, including the Chiltern lines.

 The use of public service obligations (PSOs) is governed by European Regulation 2408/92.

Those standards relate to the continuity, regularity, capacity and pricing of services.

<BR>
It is estimated that in March 1999 there were 180,000 lone-parent households living in RSL accommodation; about 17 per cent. of the total. (note 2)
<BR>
There were 204,168 new RSL lettings between April 1999 and March 2000, comprising 143,135 general needs lettings and 61,033 supported housing lettings. Lone-parent households accounted for 39,534 lettings (19 per cent. of the total). (note 3)
<BR>
<i>Local Authorities</i>
<BR>
At the national level, there is less information available for local authority households than for RSL households. (note 4)
<BR>
In 1998-99 there were an estimated 503,000 local authority households headed by lone parents; about 15 per cent. of the total.
<BR>
Of these, 81,000 had been resident for less than a year (21 per cent. of the local authority households that had been resident for less than a year).
<BR>
<i>Notes:</i>
<BR>
1. A lone parent with dependent children is defined as any person who is not married or cohabiting and who has their dependent children (aged under 16 or 16-18 and still in full-time education) living with them. Lone parents might be single (never married), widowed, divorced or separated.

The reporting period corresponds with the BBC's financial year (1 April to 31 March) and the Director General's report is usually published towards the end of the calendar year. The delay has been caused by the need to reach agreement on some issues of legal interpretation arising from the introduction of digital channels.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, pursuant to his answer of 2 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 21W, if he will provide a breakdown of the &#163;23.4 million cost of administering the concessionary television licence scheme for people aged 75 years and over.

<a name="00725w29.html_spnew4"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2000]:</i> The estimated costs of administering free television licences for people aged 75 or over in 2000-01 are &#163;24.3 million rather than &#163;23.4 million as stated in my reply to the hon. Member of 2 May 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 20W, a transposition error for which I apologise. &#163;3.3 million of these costs represent a carry over of set-up costs incurred in 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="00725w29.html_para3">These costs will be met by the Department of Social Security, via payments to the BBC. The BBC is responsible for the administration of the scheme and has advised that a detailed breakdown of these costs is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost and by diverting resources which would otherwise be devoted to the successful implementation of the scheme.

 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2000]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him on 19 October 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column 427W, giving details of costs up to mid October 1999. Since that date English Heritage has spent; (i) no money on design work, (ii) &#163;23,758 on public consultation and inquiries, and (iii) &#163;778,570 which includes consultancy fees relating to the new visitor centre, the World Heritage Site Management Plan and contributions towards the cost of the A303 improvement scheme at Stonehenge.
<P>

<a name="00725w29.html_para4">My Department and its predecessor Departments have not incurred any directly attributable costs in connection with Stonehenge. It is not possible meaningfully to apportion the cost of official time spent in respect of consultations and correspondence.

 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2000]:</i> The site for the new visitor centre at Countess Farm East has not yet been purchased. English Heritage is currently in negotiations with the owners so it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage. Countess Farm West was purchased by the National Trust and no public money was involved.

 I am pleased to announce that, as part of a regular programme of reviews of non-departmental public bodies, my Department is commencing a review of the British Tourist Authority.
<P>

<a name="00725w29.html_para5">The terms of reference for the review, which will be conducted in two stages, are as follows:
<P>

<a name="00725w29.html_para6"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To review the continuing need for the services and functions carried out by the British Tourist Authority (BTA) and consider how they can be provided more effectively in the future.

<BR>
<i>Stage One: Getting the organisation right</i>
<BR>
To determine whether there is a continuing need for the services provided by the BTA and to assess whether these services are best delivered by an NDPB.
<BR>
To consider specifically:
<BR>
the role and functions of the BTA, how its role has been affected by devolution and how and to what extent its functions contribute to the delivery of wider DCMS and governmental objectives;
<BR>
the links BTA has or should have with other parts of the public sector and with private and voluntary sectors;
<BR>
BTA's past performance against its aims, objectives, key targets and quality standards;
<BR>
what BTA's customers and other interested parties (including their staff and trade unions) think about its role, performance and responsiveness to their needs; and whether there are any groups whose needs should be, but are not being addressed;
<BR>
how the BTA should be organised to deliver responsive, efficient and quality services in future, and whether there is scope for other organisational options, such as abolition, market testing, merger, rationalisation, privatisation or strategic contracting out; and
<BR>
examples of good practice in how BTA has delivered its services.
<BR>
<i>Stage Two: Improving performance</i>
<BR>
Taking account of the Stage One report, to consider how the BTA might make improvements in efficient, effective and responsive service delivery.
<BR>
To consider specifically:
<BR>
the BTA's aims and objectives and the part they play in delivering wider DCMS and governmental objectives;
<BR>
performance targets and whether they are sufficiently comprehensive and stretching, and properly reflect the BTA's aims and objectives;
<BR>
the structure and effectiveness of BTA's organisation and how it involves staff, including those at the front line, and their trade unions in the way it works;
<BR>
partnership arrangements and opportunities for joint working with other bodies to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery;
<BR>
how the BTA can make better use of new technology to improve the delivery of its services and functions;
<BR>
the BTA's relationship with its stakeholders and the stakeholders' views on how it can best meet their needs, and the way BTA could improve its responsiveness;
<BR>
whether the BTA needs different freedoms and flexibilities to improve the delivery of its services;
<BR>
the scope for increasing the current level of efficiency savings and income and to improve the utilisation of assets; and
<BR>
whether the roles and reporting arrangements of the BTA, the Department and Ministers need clearer definition and whether they provide proper support for operational and policy work.
