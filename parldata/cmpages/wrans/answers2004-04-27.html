 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what provisions are in place to enable mistakes following the initial registration of common land to be rectified.  [168651]</p>








<p><a name="40427w02.html_spnew0"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The provisions of the Commons Registration Act 1965, and subsequent regulations which set out the detailed registration procedures, make only very limited provision for an amendment to the registers to be made to resolve minor clerical errors or omissions. Additionally, in certain cases, errors may be rectified by the High Court. The Common Land Policy Statement, published in July 2002, contains an outline proposal to make further provision in new legislation for the correction of errors. It is also intended that the scope of this provision will be wider than before. Although we hope to bring forward measures as soon as Parliamentary time permits, I can give no guarantee at this stage either about the timing of legislation, or its scope.

Any proposal to prohibit or restrict the sale and use of any device should be based on scientific evidence.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Apr 2004 : Column 862W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
she has made of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the additional volume of food industry waste that is disposed of in landfill, the sewage system or otherwise as a result of the ban on swill feeding and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the change this represents in terms of the risk of spread of communicable animal diseases; and if she will make a statement.  [165941]</p>








<p><a name="40427w02.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The disposal of catering waste to landfill is a longstanding practice and only 1.4&nbsp;per cent. of the national pig herd was swill fed. The increase in the amount of catering waste going to landfill following the ban on 93 swill users for about 82,000 pigs was therefore very small compared to the total amount of catering waste generated from the 260,000 restaurants and other catering outlets across the UK, which as a matter of course, currently goes to landfill.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w02.html_para1">
It is not possible to give a definitive picture of the disposal methods for the relatively small amount of catering waste that was formerly fed to pigs but it is not considered to be ending up down sewers as has been&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggested. There are day-to-day problems with blockages to drains and sewers which are dealt with by the various authorities, but the main stream of catering waste is collectable and is not in a form that can be easily disposed of down the sewer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w02.html_para2">
In common with all methods of disposing of animal by-products disposal to landfill does carry some risks to animal health. Among the measures in place to minimise such risks landfill operators work to specific conditions of their licence or permit including covering waste with inert material and maintaining a strict pest control programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w02.html_para3">
No comparative risk assessment has been made of the risks of swill feeding and landfill when exotic diseases are absent from the national herd. However, when a disease such as foot and mouth is present, the level of virus circulating increases the risk from swill feeding.

<p><a name="40427w02.html_spnew6"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Between the launch of the scheme in June 2000 and the end of March 2004, approximately 7,290 households in Liverpool, Walton received assistance from the Scheme, which is now marketed as Warm Front.

 Progress with the Voluntary Initiative on pesticides is reviewed regularly and Government report their broad conclusions in the Budget and Pre-Budget Report.

Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The reality is that we will not raise the $50 billion needed every year to meet the MDGs unless every bilateral donor reaches 0.7&nbsp;per cent. immediately. If even just two or three of the biggest bilateral donors fail to reach 0.7&nbsp;per cent. now, we will fail to raise the funds required. That is why the Government has proposed an International Finance Facility (IFF) in order to deliver these resources. The IFF provides a realistic and feasible way of front-loading aid to meet the immediate need.

 Prospects for the Scottish economy are good. The labour market continues to perform robustly with employment close to a historic high and unemployment around its lowest level since the 1970s. Growth figures have recently been revised upwards to better reflect real changes in the economy. Interest rates and inflation are historically low. Business surveys are pointing to a continued strengthening of business activity in Scotland in both services and manufacturing and independent forecasters predict that growth will be above-trend in 2004 and 2005.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the effect of electronic application to land searches and registration on the speed of housing market transactions; and what further improvements in the speed of these transactions will result from the introduction of sellers&#039; packs.  [168376]</p>









<p><a name="40427w08.html_spnew0"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to him on 23&nbsp;April 2004. For electronic searches of land registers to be possible, local authorities must first have set up electronic Local Land and Property Gazetteers (LLPGs). Such gazetteers form an integral part of local e-government, and the benefits arising from them have not been separately estimated or assessed. The&nbsp;overall savings from local e-government, and in particular achieving the Prime Minister&#039;s target of all priority services being electronically enabled by 2005, were estimated by local authorities themselves in 2003 as being about &#163;80&nbsp;million per annum by 2005&#150;06. As well as efficiency savings, there will be significant benefits to authorities&#039; customers, through improvement of service delivery including quicker land charge searches.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w08.html_para0">
Electronic processing of local land search inquiries offers the prospect of securing search information in minutes and hours rather than days and weeks. To maximise the benefits for housing transactions, local search and other information that is important to home buying and selling decisions needs to be available at the start of the transaction process. Home information packs will secure this. They will enable buyers and sellers to negotiate from an informed position and help them commit more quickly to the transaction. This will increase certainty, reduce failure and wasted costs, and help shorten the overall transaction timescale.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what criteria in the planning system are used to ascertain whether an environmental impact assessment is necessary.  [168326]</p>








<p><a name="40427w08.html_spnew6"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is required for development which is likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue of factors such as its nature, size or location. All development listed in Schedule 1 to The Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 1999 is assumed to have such effects, and EIA is mandatory for such development. For development listed in Schedule 2 to the Regulations, local planning authorities have to determine whether EIA will be required. In doing so they must take account of prescribed selection criteria relating to the characteristics, location and potential impact of the development. As an aid to determining whether Schedule 2 development is likely to have significant environmental effects, indicative thresholds and criteria are included in DETR Circular 02/99 which gives guidance on the operation of the 1999 Regulations.

<p><a name="40427w08.html_spnew7"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The need for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has to be assessed for every planning application, on the basis of whether the proposed development is likely to have significant effects on the environment. The Government&#039;s published advice on multiple applications, based on existing case law, is at paragraph 46 of DETR Circular 02/99. This states that, for the purposes of determining whether EIA is required, a particular planning application should not be considered in isolation if, in reality, it is properly to be considered as an integral part of an inevitably more substantial development.

 The investigation carried out by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) into cabin air quality focused only on substances found in air conditioning ducts of a certain type of aircraft. The study was commissioned to investigate the safety implications arising from potential incapacitation in flight crew as a result of contaminated cabin air. As such the CAA did not consider the presence of other substances and effects on low-level exposure. This was a specific piece of scientific research; therefore it was not appropriate for the CAA to seek views, either from medical experts or other stakeholders. The Aviation Health Unit is currently considering the extent to which further research should be commissioned into the presence in the cabin air of organophosphates and their effect on passengers and crew.

 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what data protection safeguards are available to UK citizens whose detailed private information is made available to private companies in the US.  [168250]</p>








<p><a name="40427w11.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 The general rule established by the Data Protection Act 1998 is that, subject to exemptions, personal data may only be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area if they provide an adequate level of data protection. Adequacy of protection is determined on a case by case basis having regard to all the circumstances. The US Department of Commerce have established a set of data protection rules (generally known as the &quot;safe harbour&quot;) to which certain organisations receiving personal data from the EU may subscribe. The European Commission have made a formal finding that the &quot;safe harbour&quot; provides adequate data protection for the purposes of the EC Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) to which the Data&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protection Act 1998 gives effect. About 450 organisations currently subscribe to the &quot;safe harbour&quot;.

 The Prospectus will be published in the summer. The first round of consultation last year produced a number of valuable contributions.

My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State agreed with industry leaders that a new framework document for tourism should be produced, at the third Hartwell seminar in February 2003. This was to follow the Government&#039;s major reforms of April 2003, which created VisitBritain and passed strategic responsibility for tourism in the English regions to the Regional Development Agencies. I outlined the likely timescale for publication to the All Party Parliamentary Group on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourism on 5&nbsp;November 2003. At that time, I&nbsp;anticipated the publication of the Prospectus in early 2004.

 Utility companies are subject to the range of consumer legislation governing the sale of goods and services. The specific regulation of utility companies is a matter for the individual sectoral regulators. The Government have no plans to prohibit cold-calling or door-to-door sales. In respect of gas and electricity, during 2002, the industry agreed both the EnergySure scheme, to improve the training and oversight of sales staff, and a Code of Practice on doorstep selling. In that year, we also provided OFGEM with the power to levy financial penalties on companies that breached their operating licences. OFGEM subsequently used that power to fine London Electricity &#163;2&nbsp;million for mis-selling under its own brand and that of Virgin Energy.

 The Government will not introduce legislation to prevent the disconnection of utility supplies because of non-payment of bills. Gas and electricity suppliers have, as a matter of last resort and

subject to a range of safeguards, the right to disconnect customers who have not paid their bills and have ignored repeated requests to do so. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM), has been in discussion with the energy industry about measures to improve arrangements surrounding disconnections, particularly as they affect vulnerable customers, and will shortly issue an industry consultation paper on the revised arrangements. In electronic communications, disconnection is a matter for the regulator, the Office of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communications (OFCOM). All communications providers must have disconnection procedures that are proportionate and not unduly discriminatory. In water, companies cannot disconnect a domestic customer&#039;s supply for debt.

<p><a name="40427w19.html_wqn0"><b> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment he has made of the equity of resource allocation studies by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board and what conclusions he has drawn, in relation to the provision of services for those residing in the Newtownards and North Down Region; and if he will make a statement.  [167725]</p>








<p><a name="40427w19.html_spnew0"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 In line with departmental policy, the Eastern Board is responsible for the equitable distribution among its local populations of the resources provided to it by the Department. In doing so, the Board 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Apr 2004 : Column 922W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
has developed a locality equity strategy which has, and will continue to, skew additional resources towards those local populations assessed as being underfunded in relation to their target share of resources determined by an evidence based formula. Resources skewed towards the North Down and Ards locality in 2004&#150;05 have resulted in a reduction of the relative under investment position by &#163;0.329&nbsp;million. In addition, a further &#163;0.6&nbsp;million has been provided to support Family and Child Care services in North Down and Ards. The locality equity assessment will be revised next year as the latest research into needs-based allocations becomes available.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will appoint an experienced individual or group <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;to conduct a Province-wide appraisal of the course of hospital admissions and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;to suggest means of enhancing efficiency from the primary care assessment stage through to ward discharge; and if he will make a statement.  [167605]</p>








<p><a name="40427w19.html_spnew1"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 Improving the flow of emergency hospital admissions is a key priority for my Department. A target has been set to reduce by a third the number of patients waiting more than two hours in an accident and emergency department between the decision to admit and admission to a ward, by 31&nbsp;March 2005 compared to 2003&#150;04 levels. Boards and trusts are required to submit proposals to streamline processes relating to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emergency patients flows to the Department by 31&nbsp;August 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w19.html_para0">
The Department plans to take forward a regional initiative during 2004&#150;05 to improve the flow of emergency patients through hospital. This regional programme, which will ensure that recognised best practice is implemented across all hospitals, will be overseen and directed by a Regional Steering Group comprising people with a wide range of experience in this area. It will build on work undertaken in the Eastern Board area over the past year which examined the way hospitals admitted emergency patients, how those patients moved through the hospital system and how they were discharged, and the experiences of similar programmes developed by the Modernisation Agency in England.

<p><a name="40427w19.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 While there are no specific properties made available for first time buyers, price being the main factor in determining whether or not a specific property is appropriate for a first time buyer, the vast majority of new houses constructed in Northern Ireland are affordable to first time buyers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w19.html_para1">
The Housing Executive&#039;s house sales scheme and my Department&#039;s Co-ownership scheme also make a vital contribution in providing a stock of suitable properties for first time buyers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w19.html_para2">
The Housing Executive&#039;s house sales scheme has enabled over 105,000 tenants to become home owners while the Co-ownership scheme has, since its inception in 1978, helped over 17,500 participants to become homeowners on an equity sharing basis, with over 13,000 of these eventually moving to full home ownership.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w19.html_para3">
According to lending sources 13,000 mortgages were advanced to first time buyers in 2003, and DSD and NIHE statistics indicate that almost half of these applied to NIHE house sales and Co-ownership transactions.

 Recruitment and retention of nursing staff is a matter for individual employers. In recognition of recruitment difficulties the annual number of pre-registration nurse training places was increased from 580 to 680 in 2001 and 750 in 2002 and these increases have been maintained.

In March 2003 the Government published a Community Safety Strategy&#151;Creating a Safer Northern Ireland through Partnership. One of the nine key issues specified in the strategy related to car crime. The Strategy has an aim of reducing car crime by 10&nbsp;per cent. by 2007, using 2001&#150;02 as a baseline year. A number of activities were defined in the Strategy document and many of these have commenced.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w19.html_para10">
During the period March to May 2002 the PSNI implemented Operation Clean Up in the Greater Belfast area, an operation that removed unlicensed vehicles from public roads. In that period 940 vehicles were removed with 83&nbsp;per cent. of them being destroyed. This operation had a major impact on crime with the reported crimes of domestic burglary, theft of vehicles and &quot;drive offs&quot; from petrol stations significantly reduced; road traffic accidents were also down by 13&nbsp;per cent., vehicle arsons were down by 23&nbsp;per cent. and the number of vehicles removed by Councils down by 32&nbsp;per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w19.html_para11">
Since then further similar exercises have been completed in Londonderry, Tyrone, Ballymena and Larne.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w19.html_para12">
Funds have now been secured to deliver an extended car crime project, based upon Operation Clean Up, and discussions are currently on going with the PSNI, DVLNI and Belfast city council.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w19.html_para13">
In a partnership of organisations led by the Probation Board and funded by the NIO the IMPACT project was established in West Belfast. The aim of the project is to reduce the level of car crime related incidents by targeting those involved and those who are vulnerable to involvement to such activity, through the provision of structured preventative, diversionary and interventionist programmes. This project has recently been given funding for the period up to March 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w19.html_para14">
The PSNI have undertaken a number of specific initiatives to tackle offenders. A special Auto Crime Team has been established which operates mainly in the West Belfast area, to tackle the problems associated with &quot;joy riding&quot;. This has proved to be very successful with a significant number of arrests being made and individuals prosecuted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w19.html_para15">
In addition a number of local initiatives have been undertaken throughout Northern Ireland which are supported by advice and leaflets from local crime prevention officers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w19.html_para16">
Since 2003 the Government have introduced legislation which brought in some new offences and tougher penalties for offences such as aggravated vehicle taking, dangerous driving, causing death by dangerous driving, causing death by careless driving while under 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Apr 2004 : Column 928W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the influence of alcohol or drugs and causing death or grievous bodily injury by aggravated vehicle taking. The PSNI will have powers of arrest for drivers who drive while disqualified. Many of these legislative proposals are currently published for consultations. It is anticipated that any new offences and changes to the maximum sentences available will be in place and operational by autumn 2004.

 The responsibility to ensure regular attendance at school rests primarily with parents.

The Department of Education has recently made funds available to the Education and Library Boards for a computerised database for the Education Welfare Service aimed, among other things, at tracking and monitoring pupils whose attendance is a cause for concern. In addition a pilot project aimed at promoting the habit of regular attendance at an early age is currently under way in a number of primary schools. Following a full evaluation of this project the Department will consider if it could usefully be extended to other schools.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what cost/benefit analysis has been conducted regarding animal experimentation.  [165891]</p>









<p><a name="40427w20.html_spnew3"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The Home Office has not itself conducted a general cost/benefit analysis regarding animal experimentation. Various competent bodies have considered whether animal experimentation is valid and justified, including the Animal Procedures Committee and the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures. They have concluded, in line with the consensus within the scientific community, that there is a continuing need for animal research and testing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w20.html_para3">
A form of cost benefit assessment of individual programmes of work has to be undertaken before the Home Office grants licences under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to authorise the use of animals. Such licences can accordingly only be granted where, among other considerations, the likely benefits of the work are expected to outweigh the welfare costs to the animals involved. No animal procedures are therefore lawfully carried out which have not been fully justified.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w20.html_para4">
More information about the statutory cost benefit assessment used in particular cases can be found at Appendix I of Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (HC321).

<p><a name="40427w20.html_spnew4"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Heterotopic transplants of organs are those in which the transplanted organ is not located at the same anatomical position as the animal&#039;s own organ, for example, where a third kidney is implanted into the abdomen. We are not aware of any research carried out in the United Kingdom, or elsewhere, exclusively to study the effects of such transplants on the welfare of the animals concerned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w20.html_para5">
Such transplants have been carried out under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to investigate aspects of the performance of the transplanted organs, and causes of transplant rejection and methods of overcoming this problem. Significant scientific findings have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The effects on the welfare of the animals would be reported in records maintained by the researchers.

Project licences are assigned severity bands reflecting the average overall level of suffering likely to be experienced by the animals used on authorised programmes of work.

There are four severity bands and four severity limits:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unclassified, mild, moderate and substantial. Definitions of these categories are provided in paragraph 5.42 of the published Home Office Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act1986(HC321).

 The Imutran Limited research licensed by the Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 involving pig to non-human primate xenotransplantation studies was carried out between 1994 and 2000 under three project licences all of which were allocated an overall severity band of &#039;moderate&#039;. In addition, of the 28 separate protocols of regulated procedures authorised under these licences, two were allocated substantial severity limits, 16 were classified as moderate, seven were classified as mild, and three were unclassified.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w20.html_para11">
The administrative system under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 distinguishes between the &#039;severity limit&#039; of a protocol and the &#039;severity band&#039; of a project. The severity limit of a protocol is determined by the upper limit of the expected adverse effects that may be encountered by the animal involved, taking into account the measures specified in the licence for avoiding and controlling adverse effects. It represents the worse potential outcome for any animal subjected to the series of regulated procedures in the protocol, even if it may only be experienced by a small number of the animals to be used. Severity limits are categorised as unclassified, mild, moderate and substantial. Definitions of these categories are provided in paragraph 5.42 of the published Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (HC321).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w20.html_para12">
The allocation of a severity band to a project reflects the number of animals used on each protocol and the actual suffering likely to be caused as a result. It is based on the overall level of cumulative suffering to be experienced by each animal, not just the worst possible case. It takes into account the proportion of animals expected to reach the severity limit of the protocol and the duration of the exposure to that severity limit, the nature and intensity of the adverse effects, and the actions to be taken to relieve the suffering.

<p><a name="40427w22.html_spnew5"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 This information is not held centrally but the recent report by the National Audit Office, &quot;The Drug Treatment and Testing Order (DTTO): early lessons&quot; reported that the unit cost of an order in 2002&#150;03 in the areas they visited varied from &#163;5,258 to &#163;7,592. Nottingham Probation Area has advised us that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the approximate average cost of a DTTO in Nottinghamshire was &#163;5,363.

<p><a name="40427w22.html_wqn6"><b> Mrs. Gillan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prisoners in 2003 began training, education or offender behaviour programmes but were unable to complete these courses due to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;transfer to another establishment and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;release from custody.  [168028]</p>








<p><a name="40427w22.html_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 In 2003 approximately 8,300 prisoners began accredited offending behaviour programmes. Of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the 6,946 commencements of general offending behaviour programmes&#151;Enhanced Thinking Skills and Reasoning and Rehabilitation&#151;95 prisoners (1.4&nbsp;per cent.) did not complete because they were transferred and 16 (0.2&nbsp;per cent.) did not complete because they were released. The percentage of prisoners not completing other accredited programmes for these reasons would have been similar or lower.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w22.html_para1">
Equivalent information on non-completion is not collected centrally for prisoners&#039; training and education.

</p>







<p><a name="40427w22.html_wqn7"><b> John Mann: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prisoners were assessed as having drug-related problems on <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;entry to and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;exit from each (i) HM Prison Service establishment and (ii) privately run prison establishment since January 2003.  [168206]</p>








<p><a name="40427w22.html_spnew7"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Figures on the number of prisoners assessed on entry as having a drug-related problem are not recorded centrally, but epidemiological studies show around 54&nbsp;per cent. of new receptions to be problematic drug misusers and that around 80&nbsp;per cent. of prisoners had used drugs at some point before coming into custody. All prisoners receive a healthcare assessment on reception. This resulted in detoxification being provided to 50,701 prisoners in 2002&#150;03, 4,085 of whom were in the contracted estate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w22.html_para2">
All prisons employ drug counselling, assessment, referral and throughcare (CARATs) teams, who, among other tasks, are responsible for putting problematic drug using prisoners in touch with community support on leaving prison. CARATs teams dealt with 52,000 prisoners in 2002&#150;03 at all stages in their sentence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w22.html_para3">
No separate assessment of drug-related problems is made at the point offenders leave prisons. There will always be a heightened risk of relapse on return to the community and a key aim of the Criminal Justice Interventions Programme is to strengthen continuity of treatment and reduce that risk.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether, under future market tests of publicly run prisons, staff transferred to a private sector operator will be protected by the two tier workforce provisions applicable to local government employees in a similar position.

<p><a name="40427w22.html_spnew8"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Home Office complies with policy for Central Government Departments and Agencies on the handling of staff transfers. The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 (&quot;TUPE&quot;) govern the majority of such staff transfers and contractors are normally also required to apply the principles set out in the Cabinet Office Statement of Practice &quot;Staff Transfers in the Public Sector&quot; and its annex &quot;A Fair Deal for Staff Pensions&quot;. The Home Office does not propose to extend this further to mirror the two-tier workforce provisions contained in the Local Government Code of Practice on Workforce Matters.

 DFID has been an early and leading bilateral supporter of work on microbicides, spending nearly &#163;18&nbsp;million to date.

The programme is implementing research studies to investigate the effectiveness of promising microbicide products, involving research centres in five African countries. DFID also provides support to the International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) to accelerate the discovery, development and accessibility of microbicides, and International Family Health (IFH) and the Population Council to develop policy dialogue, advocacy and networking around microbicides development and access.

<p><a name="40427w23.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 In 2003, the United Nations Mine Action Service established the United Nations Mine Action Co-ordination Centre (UNMACC) in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The UNMACC is now undertaking local surveys to determine the extent of the land mine problem in the Congo and providing expertise for the coordination of assistance to tackle the problem. In 2003, DFID provided a sum of &#163;65,333 via its global grant to UNMAS to help fund these activities.

<p><a name="40427w23.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of the implications for global development assistance of current UN projections for world population in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;2100 and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;2150.  [167206]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Apr 2004 : Column 942W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40427w23.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 Many assessments of world population only stretch as far as 2050, and DFID&#039;s development assistance policy is largely geared towards 2015, the target for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, the UN&#039;s Population Division has carried out a series of long-range population projections at regional level with a time horizon of 2150. These projections include assessments of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible future fertility, mortality and migration scenarios.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w23.html_para1">
It is difficult to state the implications of these projections on global development assistance because the high, medium and low scenarios result in projections of very different sizes. According to the medium scenario, the world population will have stabilised at 9.7 billion by 2050. The low scenario indicates that population will drop to 3.2 billion by 2150 and the high scenario indicates a rise to 24.8 billion by the same year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w23.html_para2">
The substantial differences in these scenarios make it very difficult to base any firm development assistance plans on long-range population projections. In the meantime DFID will focus our efforts on achieving the MDGs by 2015 and will then continue to consider the&nbsp;scale of poverty and population projections before setting targets for future milestones.

<p><a name="40427w23.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assumptions about population inform his Department&#039;s country plan for Ethiopia.  [167207]</p>








<p><a name="40427w23.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID Ethiopia&#039;s country assistance plan is based on the Government of Ethiopia&#039;s Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Programme (SDPRP). On the basis of current population growth rates, Ethiopia&#039;s population will reach 73&nbsp;million by 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w23.html_para3">
The SDPRP recognizes that population plays a decisive role in national development. Through the National Population Policy (1993), the Government seeks to maintain a balance between population size and the resource base through, in part, heightened availability and use of contraceptives. A key focus to achieve this is through increasing girls&#039; access to education.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w23.html_para4">
While DFID does not provide specific sector support to the population programme, in 2003&#150;04 we provided &#163;3&nbsp;million to the education sector specifically and &#163;30&nbsp;million for the implementation of the SDPRP.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will make a statement on water shortages in Mauritania.  [167827]</p>








<p><a name="40427w24.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Mauritania is a low-income food deficit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country which is vulnerable to drought and desertification. A large proportion of the population relies on agricultural production to satisfy its food and income needs. During drought periods, people have severe difficulties in meeting their food requirements, either through direct production or through recourse to alternative sources of income.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w24.html_para3">
DFID has provided significant humanitarian assistance to Mauritania in recent years in response to the severe drought and resultant food shortages. In 2002&#150;03 DFID contributed &#163;1&nbsp;million to the World Food Programme&#039;s regional appeal, which covered five countries in the region, but was mainly focused on Mauritania where the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drought situation was most severe. DFID also contributed &#163;0.5&nbsp;million to an Oxfam appeal focused on the most badly affected areas in the South of the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w24.html_para4">
According to the latest FAO reports the overall food security situation in the country remains satisfactory. However there is a desert locust outbreak currently under way in northern Mauritania which may mean that crop production figures will have to be revised downwards to take account of the impact of possible pest damage.

The table also includes cost figures by country; these are limited to the cost of representation and hence exclude costs associated with external secondments and projects.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w24.html_para6">
Comparable expenditure figures for 2001 and 2002 are not available because in 2003&#150;04 DFID introduced a new definition of administration costs to include costs for staff, travel and allowances that were previously paid from the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;programme budget. The change in definition will increase transparency and enable DFID to manage its administrative costs more effectively, but it precludes providing comparable figures for earlier years.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what estimate his Department has made of the future food aid requirements in Southern Africa.  [167824]</p>









<p><a name="40427w25.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 UN Crop and Food Supply Assessment teams arrive in Mozambique, Malawi, Swaziland and Zimbabwe this week to analyse the food supply situation with a view to establishing future food aid requirements in these countries in the coming year. A team will arrive in Lesotho in mid-May to undertake similar work. Final reports are expected in early June.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w25.html_para0">
The Southern African Development Community&#039;s (SADC) Vulnerability Assessment Committees, supported by DFID, have already started fieldwork in these countries. Their results will also feed into the UN analyses. Linking these two assessments of food insecurity will provide a clearer picture of supply and demand for food in affected countries, and a more accurate assessment of household food shortages and the levels of food aid needed to respond to acute needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w25.html_para1">
DFID is also working at both country and regional levels to address the longer-term causes of regional food insecurity in Southern Africa. These programmes take a developmental approach to food insecurity, and aim to improve information on vulnerability and response, coupled with measures that enhance poor people&#039;s access to food in the longer-term.

<p><a name="40427w25.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s position on maintaining access for St. Helena was set out in my Written Statement to the House on 19&nbsp;April 2004,<i> Official Report</i>, column 1WS. As part of planned feasibility and other investigatory work, the possibility of a private finance initiative will be included among options that will be considered.

<p>
<a name="40427w25.html_para2">
The position regarding docking facilities for ships in St. Helena is different. At present, as the hon. Member will know from his own visit to the island last year, visiting ships anchor in Jamestown Bay and all passengers and cargo are transferred in smaller craft to and from the wharf. In recognition of St. Helena&#039;s continuing concern over these arrangements, we have agreed to support further investigatory work to review the options for improving them. The St. Helena Government is preparing terms of reference. We cannot yet speculate on whether a private finance initiative might or might not have a role in any solution that eventually may prove to be technically and financially acceptable.

<p><a name="40427w25.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 A Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement between the Government of Sudan, the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement was signed on 8&nbsp;April. Humanitarian and Security Assessments in Darfur are being carried out at present by our UN and non-governmental organisation (NGO) partners. However, access is still limited in Darfur due to general insecurity and travel restrictions. It is therefore still too early to be able to give precise humanitarian indicators, as agencies have not yet been able to access large parts of the population. However the situation is clearly extremely serious.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w25.html_para3">
In response to the crisis in Darfur DFID has committed about &#163;9.5&nbsp;million, through United Nations (UN) agencies and international NGOs.

<p><a name="40427w25.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Large numbers of Zimbabweans continue to be in humanitarian need. This is largely the result of the Government of Zimbabwe&#039;s misguided economic policies, including the poorly implemented fast track land programme, exacerbated by the HIV/AIDS epidemic and erratic rainfall. At least eight million Zimbabweans, over half the population, have been receiving donor-funded food aid in recent months, in advance of the imminent harvest, which should improve food security for the majority of Zimbabweans.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Apr 2004 : Column 950W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w25.html_para4">
The crop forecast is not yet finalised, but the harvest may cover less than half of the country&#039;s food needs over the next 12 months. The Government of Zimbabwe has stated its intention to import grain to meet the national food deficit. Given, the Government&#039;s economic difficulties, this may be unrealistic. In the meantime, the Government say that they will not decide for some months whether to ask for further international food aid after June. Households most likely to be in need of assistance, either food or other resources, will be those with no access to land or income that are also affected by HIV/AIDS or include orphans, disabled children and the elderly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w25.html_para5">
DFID Zimbabwe provides financial support to the UN system for rigorous monitoring and evaluation of donor-funded humanitarian programmes, including both the effective targeting of those in the most need, and ensuring that there is no political interference in the process. Monitoring and evaluation reports are regularly provided to donors and discussed at meetings with the United Nations, non-governmental organisations, civil society and other donors. DFID remains confident that the humanitarian relief provided by the UK reaches those members of society who are most in need of assistance.

<a name="40427w25.html_para6">
According to the latest figures from the Ministry of Health, there have been 77 cases of cholera and 9,860 cases of dysentery since January. However, the number could be much higher due to the decline in surveillance. Many cases are not reported as people cannot afford to go to hospitals or hospitals are failing to report reasons for death.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w25.html_para7">
DFID has provided funds to Save the Children UK to respond to cholera outbreaks. The aim is to ensure that the disease does not spread further and that the communities at risk are assisted with soap and other hygiene items, as well as water purification tablets and oral dehydration supplies to treat diarrhoea.

 Jobcentre Plus and the Pension Service are modernising the services we provide to our customers.

All decisions made about the centralisation or relocation of work are informed by the particular needs of their customers; nationally, regionally and at district level. For example, the Pension Service have centralised and relocated benefit processing based on customer feedback that pensioners prefer to make contact by phone rather than calling at an office.

<p><a name="40427w29.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) issued in March 2004 a new law governing the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI). A copy of this law, and the Order to which it is attached, has been placed in the&nbsp;Library of the House. The new law provides for an independent central bank whose objectives are to achieve and maintain domestic price stability, foster and maintain a market-based financial system and promote sustainable growth, employment and prosperity. The CBI is required to maintain its independence from the Government of Iraq and, except for the provisions set out in the law, will not take instructions from any other persons or entity, including government entities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w29.html_para5">
The Governor, Deputy Governors, and other members of the board of the CBI are nominated by the Appointing Authority (which until the transfer of sovereignty on 30&nbsp;June is the CPA in consultation with the Iraqi Governing Council) and their appointments confirmed in the legislature. The CBI is required to report to the Appointing Authority, the Ministry of Finance and the legislature on its operations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w29.html_para6">
The new CBI law has been reviewed by the Iraqi Governing Council, acting on the recommendation of its Economic and Finance Committee. The law has also been reviewed by the International Monetary Fund and was promulgated pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483, which calls upon the CPA to promote economic reconstruction and the conditions for sustainable development in Iraq.

<p><a name="40427w29.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 The Kurdistan Regional Government Administered Areas (KRG Administered Areas) currently have a separate court system from the rest of Iraq. However, the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL), produced by the Iraqi Governing Council, establishes a Federal Supreme Court. The Court will consist of nine members, chosen from individuals nominated by the Higher Judicial Council which under the TAL will supervise the judiciary outside the KRG Administered Areas, in consultation with the regional Judicial Councils in the KRG Administered Areas. The Federal Supreme Court will have original and exclusive 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Apr 2004 : Column 964W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
jurisdiction in legal proceedings between the Iraqi Transitional Government and the regional governments and governorate and municipal administrations. It will also have jurisdiction to review and declare as inconsistent with the TAL any law, regulation or directive issued by the federal or regional governments, the governorate or municipal administrations, or local administrations. This is of course an Iraqi led process although the UK is providing assistance for the training of judges, prosecutors and lawyers and will continue to consider requests for assistance in building the capacity of the Iraqi justice sector.

<p><a name="40427w29.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 The Coalition is holding around 9,000 detainees. (Precise figures vary as people are released and arrested daily). They include prisoners of war, security detainees and criminal detainees (held under Iraqi court order). Detainees are held at a number of locations throughout Iraq. The main US administered facility is at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. The Coalition Provisional Authority is working to ensure a better flow of information to the relatives of detainees through recently established information centres. The Detainee Review and Appeal Board reviewed the cases of more than 3,000 detainees in February and March and released more than 2,000. This process is continuing. POWs and security detainees are visited regularly by the International Committee of the Red&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cross (ICRC) in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.

<p>
<a name="40427w29.html_para7">
As of 1&nbsp;April the UK was responsible for 85 detainees at an internment facility near Basra. UK forces inform the families of interned persons within 24 hours of an arrest. The case of each security detainee is reviewed after 10, 28 and thereafter every 90 days to determine whether they continue to pose an imperative threat to security.

He is due to return to Iraq in coming weeks to continue his consultations and to develop his proposals. We welcome these proposals and look forward to working with the

<p><a name="40427w34.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 My Department does not issue guidelines about the disciplinary action that might be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriate to particular issues. The disciplinary sanctions that can be applied against staff in schools are governed by employment law in the same way as for any other employer, and each case must be considered on its merits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w34.html_para7">
Guidance about procedures for dealing with allegations against teachers, and other staff, including guidance about conducting disciplinary investigations, is annexed to my Department&#039;s Circular 10/95: &quot;The protection of children from abuse: The role of the education service&quot;. However, the guidance also makes it clear that allegations involving a possible criminal offence, and allegations of possible child abuse must be investigated by the police and the social services respectively because those are the agencies with statutory responsibility for such matters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w34.html_para8">
An inappropriate relationship between a teacher and a pupil has always been regarded as professionally wrong, and as misconduct that is grounds for disciplinary action, including dismissal, by an employer. That kind of behaviour is also grounds on which the Secretary of State will consider exercising his powers under section 142 of the Education Act 2002 to prohibit the person from future employment as a teacher and other work involving regular contact with children and young people in the education service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w34.html_para9">
The Government also introduced a new criminal offence of abuse of trust in the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 to protect young people under 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Apr 2004 : Column 989W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
18 years of age who are in full time education, or looked after by a local authority, or resident in NHS or other institutions, or in detention under an enactment. As well as teachers it applies to any adult working in one of those settings who is regularly involved in caring for, training, supervising, or being in sole charge of children under 18. As far as teachers it is an offence for a teacher to have relationship that involves sexual intercourse, or any other sexual activity, with a young person under 18 who is a pupil at the teacher&#039;s school. That offence is punishable by up to five years imprisonment, and it is repealed and re-enacted in the Sexual Offences Act 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40427w34.html_para10">
In addition, cross departmental guidance &quot;Caring for Young People and the Vulnerable?&quot; about preventing abuse of trust was published jointly by the Home Office, my Department, and the Department of Health in 1999. The guidance aims to help organisations create their own codes of conduct to prevent abuse of trust, either as part of wider codes to prevent abuse, or separately.
