 Ministers, the National Offender Management Service and the Prison Officers' Association are collectively committed to ensuring that violence in prisons is not tolerated in any form and since 2004, a national strategy has directed every public sector prison to have in place a local violence reduction strategy. Since 2007 this has been applied to the contracted out estate. Under the national strategy, prisons are instructed to implement a local violence reduction strategy aimed at dealing with all forms of violence in their establishment. Strategies based on reducing violence rather than focusing specifically on bullying help to ensure a more holistic approach to antisocial behaviour that recognises the complexities of managing violence in prisons.</p>

All establishments, except open prisons, are required to undertake a cell-sharing risk assessment to inform cell allocation. The violence reduction strategy is due to be reviewed during 2009.</p>

Recycling is the generally preferred option because the energy saved from avoiding the use of virgin material is greater than that contained in the waste, although there are some exceptions. Residual waste for which no practical re-use or recycling opportunities exist will therefore be a candidate for energy from waste treatment. In 2007, 5,172,000 tonnes of waste were incinerated for energy recovery purposes. These figures are not available for 2008.</p>

Over the period covered by these statistics, there has been an increase in military operational tempo. This has led to an increase in patient activity overall and a more complex patient cohort requiring repeat admission to Headley Court. There have also been changes in the balance between the numbers of patients requiring a ward bed and those who do not, including an increase in specialist clinics such as consultant-led visiting clinics and prosthetic clinics. However, it continues to be the case that most cases treated at Headley Court have not resulted from current operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

 It is for local authorities and the national health service to decide how to provide care in their areas, either through direct provision or by contracting with independent sector providers.

1. The average in the Total column is the total of "Total Fines" divided by the total of "Persons Fined<br>
 2. The statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with and disposals were primary disposals handed out. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe an offender could be issued with more than one disposal for a committed offence.<br>
3. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

 Recorded offences of possession of cannabis have been collected separately since 2004-05 and the available figures are given in the table.

It has not been considered necessary to record more detailed breakdowns on other drug possession offences as overall detection rates for these offences are high.</p>

It is estimated that 13.3 per cent. of profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates and therefore the number of individuals on the NDNAD is approximately 13.3 per cent. less than the number of subject profiles; an estimate of the number of individuals in each category has been included in the tables.

 We intend to build on the significant developments already accomplished in improving the police response to protective services in the round through the tri-partite Protective Services Improvement Programme. Particular emphasis has been placed on serious organised crime and the focus of that work has been above the level of individual police forces. We are continuing to support the ten Regional Intelligence Units, set up in each region to analyse, assess and develop information and intelligence held by police forces and other law enforcement agencies on serious organised crime; we are continuing to fund the work of the office of the National Co-ordinator for Serious Organised Crime, whose role includes ensuring that there is a co-ordinated response to cross-border serious organised crime across the country and that improvements needed in tackling cross-border organised crime are identified and addressed; and we are continuing to support and fund the work of the East Midlands Special Operations Unit&#151;a region highlighted by Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Constabulary in 2005 as having significant needs in addressing serious organised crime. In addition to maintaining these resources, in 2009-10 we are will be match-funding pilots in the West Midlands and North West regions to build multi-agency serious organised crime capability to strengthen the operational response and build on existing collaboration in those regions. &#163;1 million in matched funding will also be used to target forces with specific gaps in organised crime.</p>

 As part of an examination of each of the protective services policing areas, we have asked Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to conduct a thematic review into each police force's capability and capacity for dealing with serious organised crime. Its report is expected to be published in redacted form shortly. Her Majesty's Inspectorate has also conducted a review into the planning undertaken by forces and authorities for identifying gaps and making improvements in protective services, which includes serious organised crime, and the report &#145;Get Smart&#151;Planning to Protect&#146; is available on the Inspectorate's website at the following address:</p>

 The general police grant is provided to police authorities by the Home Office and allocated within each force to the different areas of policing. Serious organised crime is not funded separately. However central funding is provided to address this crime area above the force level. This includes running the Serious Organised Crime Agency for which funding has been &#163;426 million in 2006-07, &#163;445 million in 2007-08 and &#163;474 million in 2008-09. &#163;8 million of additional funding was also provided nationally in each of the years 2006-07 and 2007-08 to establish Regional Intelligence Units in each of the 10 ACPO regions in England and Wales and to strengthen the response to serious organised crime in the east midlands through the creation of a Special Operations Unit. In 2008-09 &#163;5 million has been allocated for continuing support to the Regional Intelligence Units and &#163;2 million to the east midlands Special Operations Unit. A number of protective services collaboration demonstrator projects, each involving more than one force area, have also received start-up funding since 2007-08 out of a &#163;5 million budget, several of which include serious organised crime workstreams.</p>

 Police officers are expected to demonstrate the highest level of personal and professional standards of behaviour. The Standards of Professional Behaviour contained in the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2008 reflect the expectations that the police service and the public have of how police officers should behave. Any breach of these standards may result in disciplinary action being taken, which in the most serious cases can result in dismissal from the service.</p>

 We have taken a number of steps to improve the enforcement of confiscation orders. For example, we issued a &#145;Best Practice Guide to Confiscation Order Enforcement&#146; to all relevant agencies and set up a new database to monitor and provide management information on confiscation performance. We set up a multi-agency enforcement task force for two years ending 2005-06; their work was subsequently subsumed by HM Courts Service and other enforcement agencies. HM Courts Service have established nine dedicated regional confiscation units, two of which have been co-located with the Home Office-funded regional asset recovery teams. The enforcement of Crown Prosecution Service confiscation orders for which CPS branches have lead enforcement responsibility is co-ordinated on a group basis, so as to benefit from economies of scale and to encourage the development and optimum use of specialist enforcement skills. In addition, the prosecution agencies and other bodies are making greater use of restraint orders.</p>

We are also giving the authorities powers in the Bill to sell seized property to satisfy a confiscation order. These new measures will help to further improve confiscation enforcement rates.</p>

In November 2008, the Government announced their decision to proceed with the clearance of selected mined areas. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is now taking forward the procurement process to carry out this de-mining, and has established a National Mine Action Authority (which includes representatives from the Falkland Islands Government) to oversee this. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office issued a Prior Information Notice on 20 February 2009 for the contract which we will put out to tender.</p>

In recent months the frequency and indiscriminate nature of the attacks that target citizens has had a highly damaging impact on people's everyday lives in these areas. The extent of the psychological damage, especially to children, is clear. In addition to the psychological damage to children, the need to shelter from attacks while at school has had a disruptive effect on education.

 It would not be appropriate to comment in detail on the contents of an internal report that was leaked to the press. We have made clear our position that we believe that a lasting peace between Palestinians and Israelis will mean, among other things, the creation of a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital. We are strongly opposed to any attempts to change the facts on the ground in East Jerusalem by excluding Palestinians from the city and by increasing the number of settlers living there. Such acts raise tensions and undermine prospects for peace. We have made these concerns known to the Israelis both in private and in public, most recently in the form of statements by the EU on the threat of house demolitions in Silwan village and house evictions in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood.</p>

<i> [holding answer of 24 March 2009]:</i> The UK is still engaged in the Durban Review process and we will keep our position under review. A new draft outcome document was tabled on 17 March 2009. The Government are considering its position on this document.</p>

 We continue to be concerned by the detention of political prisoners in Uzbekistan. The recent releases from jail of prominent human rights activists Saidjahon Zainabitdinov (February 2008), Mutabar Tojibayeva (June 2008) and Dilmurod Mukhitdinov (October 2008) constitute positive steps by the Uzbek side in response to international concerns. Set against this, however, is the ongoing lack of progress in resolving other prominent cases of persons imprisoned on political grounds&#151;most notably the dissident poet Yusuf Juma and opposition politician Sanjar Umarov, as well as two individuals jailed more recently on politically-motivated grounds: Akzam Turgunov (human rights defender sentenced to ten years imprisonment in October 2008 for &#147;extortion&#148;) and Salijon Abdurahmanov (human rights defender also sentenced to ten years for alleged drugs-related offences).</p>

 The primary source of assistance for the insulation of solid walled homes in Great Britain is the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT), which requires energy suppliers to meet targets by encouraging households to take-up energy efficiency measures. The suppliers are free to decide how to meet their targets, and will tend to focus on the most cost-effective measures, such as loft and cavity wall insulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="90327w0021.htm_para2"><a name="09032765003714">We recognise that the high up-front cost of solid wall insulation makes it difficult for suppliers to justify the investment when more cost-effective measures are available.

 The EU ETS sits at the centre of our long term strategy to deliver progressively lower emissions from electricity generation over time. From 2013, the EU ETS cap on carbon emissions will reduce by 1.74 per cent. of 2005 emissions each year, delivering an overall reduction of 21 per cent. below 2005 verified emissions by 2020. Also from 2013, all emissions allowances will be auctioned to the power sector in the UK which will provide further incentive to the sector to reduce emissions.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) is supporting a farm inputs subsidy programme in Malawi through our &#163;22 million per annum budget support as well as a further &#163;20 million commitment for agriculture over four years (2007-11). These efforts have delivered affordable seed and fertiliser to 1.5 million smallholder families, and led to a strong harvest for a fourth successive year. As a result, Malawi's economic growth reached 8.7 per cent. in 2008, and food security has significantly improved. For example, in the current lean season, 670,000 people are at risk of hunger; compared to 5 million in 2005. Despite the high fertiliser prices during 2008, we expect that our support will still help the same number of people.</p>

At a global level, prices reached a high of almost $900 per tonne in late 2008 but the price of urea has now fallen to around $300 per tonne. However, the availability of foreign exchange, which has become even scarcer in the current economic downturn, means that fertiliser use will still be limited in many countries.</p>
