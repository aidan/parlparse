<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 Currently, 40 civil servants work in the Better Regulation Unit. This number includes 17 civil servants who previously worked in the Deregulation Unit.

<P>
<a name="80601w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster how many members of the Better Regulation Task Force are representatives of <i>(a)</i> business, <i>(b)</i> enforcement agencies and <i>(c)</i> consumer and other non-Government organisations; and if he will publish a comparable breakdown for the composition of the Deregulation Task Force in April 1997.  [43625]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 I appointed 15 members of the Better Regulation Task Force in September 1997 and one further member in February 1998.
<P>

<a name="80601w01.html_para0">Members of the Task Force are appointed for their experience in different areas of regulation. They should not be categorised as business, enforcement or consumer representatives. A number of those with business backgrounds are active in the voluntary sector or with non-government organisations. Ten members come from

a business background, and in line with our manifesto commitment, eight of these are drawn from the small business community. Two members come from the enforcement community and four have a consumer or a non-governmental organisation background.
<P>

<a name="80601w01.html_para1">The Deregulation Task Force had 11 members in April 1997. Of those all came from a business background except one from the voluntary sector.

 The Government welcomed the Committee on Standards' Fourth Report, which reviewed progress on the implementation of the Committee's First and Second Reports. Government have prepared an Action Plan setting out the work to take forward the observations made by the Committee. My right hon. Friend, the Prime Minister, has sent this to Lord Neill, and copies have been placed in the libraries of the House. The Action Plan is also available on the Cabinet Office website, on www.open.gov.uk/co/cohome.htm.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what arrangements are being made to ensure that the management groups for candidate marine special areas of conservation incorporate the views of the advisory groups in developing their conservation objectives and management schemes.  [42617]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w01.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The nature conservation agencies are responsible for advising relevant authorities as to the conservation objectives of such sites. Relevant authorities have the statutory responsibility for establishing management schemes. The Government consider that it 



<P>
<P><I>1 Jun 1998 : Column: 2</I><P>
is essential that owners and occupiers, rightholders, local interests, user groups and conservation groups, in the form of an advisory group, should all be encouraged to participate in the process of implementing the objectives and developing the scheme at the earliest opportunity. Relevant authorities should consult widely and regular cycles of meetings should be established, the frequency of which would be dependent on the particular needs of each site. This advice will be contained in a guidance document to be published very shortly. The formation of advisory groups is at various stages among the marine sites.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Ainger: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many and which of the United Kingdom's candidate marine special areas of conservation have begun to draft (i) conservation objectives and (ii) management schemes.  [42618]

<P>
<a name="80601w01.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Government's nature conservation bodies, whose duty is to advise relevant authorities of an SAC's nature conservation objectives, have undertaken a considerable amount of work in preparing the way for drafting objectives, and some sites have a draft in preparation. The statutory requirement for a management scheme does not arise until sites are agreed as Sites of Community Interest. However, we are encouraging relevant authorities to establish shadow schemes in anticipation of the formal requirement. I will write to my hon. Friend shortly explaining more fully the position on each of the sites in the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many and which of the United Kingdom's candidate marine special areas of conservation have established management and advisory groups.  [42622]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w01.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Establishing advisory groups is dependent on having a management group in place so, while many of the sites now have a management group established, the advisory groups are at different stages of formation. I will write to my hon. Friend shortly, setting out the position on each of the marine sites.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w01.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Some board members of non- departmental public bodies give their time and services voluntarily and receive no payment other than normal travel and subsistence expenses. Where members do receive remuneration, this can be an annual salary or an attendance fee. Individuals' remuneration therefore is not directly comparable. Full details of all payments to board members of non-departmental bodies, by gender, are given in the Cabinet Office publication "Public Bodies". Copies of "Public Bodies 1997" are available in the Library of the House.

 The Local Government Association estimated the total additional costs to local authorities in preparing for millennium compliance in its paper for the Department on cost pressures facing local authorities in England in 1998-99. Their estimate of &#163;100 million for the current financial year was taken into account in the 1998-99 local government finance settlement. The Association has again highlighted the cost pressures faced by councils during preliminary discussions between officials on pressures in 1999-2000, and we will again be taking its estimate into account in the settlement for the coming financial year.

 My Department supports and is developing a range of measures at European and national levels, including mandatory energy labelling, promotional initiatives, negotiated agreements with manufacturers to encourage the increased availability and purchase of energy efficient domestic appliances and lighting. Estimating the impact of such measures is complicated but some experts put the potential UK savings from an integrated programme of measures to be as high as 2 million tonnes of carbon emissions. In April my Department launched a series of published discussion papers and formal consultation rounds, starting with the lighting sector, as part of a market transformation strategy to build a consensus on what practical and acceptable measures could deliver those savings.

 Legislation has already been introduced to set minimum standards of energy efficiency for central heating boilers, which came fully into effect on 1 January 1998, and for domestic refrigeration appliances, which will come into force on 3 September 1999, to enforce European Directives applying to these products. There are no immediate plans for further legislation. However, my Department is pressing the Commission to develop an action plan of common and co-ordinated measures, as part of its response to the legally binding Kyoto climate change targets, which could include measures to require manufacturers of domestic appliances to improve the energy efficiency of their products.

 The treatment for tax purposes of the costs of the Heathrow Terminal 5 Inquiry is a matter for BAA plc. Under the CAA's regulatory regime, the costs estimated as being incurred during the current quinquennium (1997-98 to 2001-02) are included in the total allowable investment costs which are taken into account in calculating the cap imposed by the CAA on the charges to airlines levied by BAA. The cap will however be reviewed by the CAA before the end of the quinquennium if Terminal 5 does not go ahead, or if, for reasons connected to the planning permission granted, it proceeds on a significantly different scale.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will review the Monopolies and Mergers Commission decision to accept BAA's figures on expenditure on Terminal 5 at Heathrow, allowing BAA to keep profits to pay for Terminal 5; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w03.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Civil Aviation Authority determined, on the basis of recommendations from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, that the calculation of the price cap to be applied to BAA plc's London Airports for the period 1997-98 to 2001-02 should take into account the costs estimated as being incurred in the planning of Terminal 5 at Heathrow. The Government have no power to instruct the CAA to reopen its decision, nor has the CAA the power to do so unilaterally. However, with BAA's agreement, the price cap is to be reviewed by the CAA before the end of the five-year period if Terminal 5 does not go ahead, or if, for reasons connected to the planning permission granted, it proceeds on a significantly different scale.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w05.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Government require sewage discharges to inland waters to meet the requirements of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. This means that all relevant discharges to inland waters serving a population equivalent of 15,000 or more must receive at least secondary treatment by 2000. Those serving between 2000 and 15,000 population equivalent must reach this standard by 2005. Discharges below 2000 population equivalent must receive "appropriate treatment" by 2005. In fact the vast majority of discharges of all sizes to inland waters already receive at least secondary treatment.
<P>

<a name="80601w05.html_para0">Discharges to sensitive areas designated under the Directive must receive more stringent treatment, typically tertiary treatment to remove nutrients, by the end of 1998. The Government intend to set out more fully its policy on this and related matters, first in its response to the second report of the Environment sub-committee of the House of Commons Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee, due shortly and, later in the summer, in guidance to the Director General of OFWAT on priorities for investment in environmental improvement within the current Periodic Review of water company price limits.

 A number of commercial systems are available which allow the re-use of rainwater and waste water from baths and sinks for WC flushing and external use. The Government continue to monitor the development of such systems and customer acceptability, but are supportive of the more widespread use of recycled water where it poses no threat to public health.

 This is primarily a matter for the British Railways Board (BRB), which has held discussions with Railtrack, EWS and others about general sales and individual sites.

Other closed lines are the subject of discussions about transfer to local authorities or railway preservation societies, or have been leased to Sustrans, the cycling charity, for the National Cycle Network (with the potential for future rail use preserved). That leaves BRB with about 70 miles of trackbed in more than 100 separate sites.

 Since 1996 the Rough Sleepers Initiative has been extended to 27 areas outside London. Following guidance issued by my Department three local authorities in the West Midlands carried out single night street counts of rough sleepers and found a significant problem. As a result, strategies to tackle rough sleeping were drawn up by the authorities in consultation with the voluntary sector and bids for funding were made to my Department. We have offered almost &#163;200,000 in pump-priming funding in 1998-99 for outreach and resettlement services to four voluntary sector organisations working in Birmingham, Stoke on Trent, and Newcastle-under-Lyme.

 The present accident reporting system does not identify whether a driver was at fault. However, some information on blood levels of drivers and motor cycle riders killed in road accidents is available from data supplied to the Department by Coroners in England and Wales and the Procurators Fiscal in Scotland. The table shows the percentage of drivers and motor cycle fatalities above given blood alcohol levels for a sample of 963 of the 1,612 riders and drivers who died in road accidents in 1995.

<P>
<a name="80601w07.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Department offers no assistance to train operating companies towards the cost of new railway lines or stations but train operators are free to contribute towards the cost if they wish to do so on a commercial basis. Last November, my right hon. Friend, the Minister of Transport announced new Objectives, Instructions and Guidance for the Franchising Director. These require him to offer local authorities (including Passenger Transport Authorities) and other potential promoters of railway investment, clear and well publicised guidance on securing finance for new projects and on how the benefits of these can be maximised. He also announced the interim criteria that the Franchising Director will use to appraise proposals to support new services which would not be commercially viable. Copies are available in the Library of the House. Capital resources are available to local authorities, including Passenger Transport Authorities, for local rail infrastructure proposals from the Department's local transport budget.

<P>
<a name="80601w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Two pieces of guidance have been published by the Government so far. The first is the policy document, "Planning for the Communities of the Future", which was published in February. The second is an explanatory note, "Transitional Arrangements for Regional Planning Guidance and Development Plans", which was published in March.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w07.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Tom King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the guidance in Planning Policy Guidance note 3 Housing permits local planning authorities to make an allowance for windfall sites over one hectare when preparing <i>(a)</i> housing land availability studies and <i>(b)</i> development plans.  [43825]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Since "windfall" sites are unexpected, it is, by definition, difficult to predict future supply levels. The current guidance in PPG3 advises local authorities to assess the future supply of windfall sites of less than 1 hectare on the basis of past trends. The guidance advises that authorities should not make assumptions about sites over 1 hectare. Authorities should strive to identify these sites individually in consultation with developers, who will have a reasonable idea of sites likely to come forward over the plan period. To attempt to make a generalised 



<P>
<P><I>1 Jun 1998 : Column: 25</I><P>
allowance for larger windfall sites in the forward assessment of land supply is likely to introduce too great an element of uncertainty in the planning process.
<P>

<a name="80601w07.html_para0">As was made clear in the recently published policy document, "Planning for the Communities of the Future", the Government are aware that local planning authorities differ in their approach to the assessment of the potential contribution of windfall sites. They are also aware that in some areas windfall sites can make up a large proportion of the overall land used for housing. The Government will therefore look again at the guidance in PPG3 with a view to reassessing the potential contribution of this source of housing land.

 The information requested is not currently collected centrally by the Department and would involve disproportionate cost to compile. However, the Department's recently announced National Land-Use Database should provide the basis for compiling this sort of information in the future.

 A new system to assess and cascade housing provision figures was set out in "Planning for the Communities of the Future" (Command 3885). The transitional arrangements which will apply where RPG is already being revised or where development plans are being replaced or altered before Regional Planning Guidance is revised are set out in paragraphs 33 and 34 of that document.

<a name="80601w08.html_para0">Most landspreading of waste is carried out under the terms of the exemption from waste management licensing in paragraph 7 of schedule 3 to the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. We have given a commitment to review this exemption in the light of the findings of the research project to which I referred on 13 March. That research project was completed on 30 April and copies of the report on the "Investigation Of The Criteria For, And Guidance On, The Landspreading Of Industrial Waste" have been placed in the Library of the House. The report's findings are now under consideration by my Department and the Environment Agency. On conclusion of this consideration, our proposals to revise the current exemption will be the subject of a public consultation exercise.

<a name="80601w08.html_para4">The remediation includes the removal or treatment on-site of contaminated soils, to depths of up to 14m in selected areas. Contaminated soil which cannot be reused on site is disposed of at licensed landfill sites. The contractors employed by English Partnerships are responsible for selecting the location of the landfill sites and a number of different sites have been used.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w09.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Department has not commissioned any such studies relating to sewerage leakage. In 1996, a report produced by Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA) on behalf of various interests, including the National Rivers Authority, found no conclusive evidence that leaking sewers are a common cause of groundwater contamination.

<P>
<a name="80601w09.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 There are no plans at present to review the law relating to sewers and drains.

 The Department for International Development's aim is to improve access to justice, especially for poor and disadvantaged peoples. We also work to create an enabling environment for economic growth in states committed to poverty elimination. The ability to resolve disputes through the legal system with reasonable speed and without corruption has been shown to be an important factor in stimulating domestic and foreign investment. We support these activities where there is need and commitment and where we have a comparative advantage. We are also increasingly working to strengthen traditional systems and ways of settling disputes which can help provide a cheaper and more accessible justice and strengthen alternatives to custodial sentences.

 We support education on human rights as part of our support for human rights generally. For example, we support measures to raise awareness through education on the rights of the child. In Russia, we are piloting civic and human rights education in secondary schools. In Guyana, we are promoting a rights-based approach to children's education among AmerIndian populations. We also help to raise knowledge and awareness of democratic rights and responsibilities. In Zimbabwe, we are contributing to a four-year project of civic education, leading to the general election in 2000. As part of this, churches and leading human rights organisations are conducting a programme of education on democratic and electoral rights. We also support measures to educate and raise awareness about international humanitarian law (IHL). In the Commonwealth of Independent States, we provided funds to the ICRC to develop IHL materials, train IHL trainers and establish a lecture series in IHL at key law institutions.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of <i>(a)</i> the effectiveness of existing aid programmes, <i>(b)</i> future aid opportunities and <i>(c)</i> the conditions under which aid workers are operating following the visit in April of a European Union delegation to Afghanistan; what response Taliban made to the delegation's outlining of the European Union's Common Position on Afghanistan; and if she will make a statement.  [43175]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w11.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 As a result of the EU mission to Afghanistan and the subsequent Afghan Support Group meeting in London, chaired by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes), donors have concluded that the existing assistance programmes to Afghanistan are in need of revision. While valuable support has been provided to vulnerable groups, past assistance may have made it easier for other resources to be channelled towards the war effort, and certain types of relief programming may be deepening dependency and reducing local incentives for self-reliance.
<P>

<a name="80601w11.html_para1">The present situation poses difficult policy, strategic and operational dilemmas and makes it vital for agencies to adopt a common programming approach with a strong focus on human rights. Participants in the Afghan Support Group meeting agreed that future assistance should be better targeted and co-ordinated, and based on clear principles, with the aim of providing balanced and impartial support for the different ethnic groups and vulnerable populations, especially women and children. The problem of opium poppy production should also be addressed through the common programming approach. The aid and political processes should be in close synergy, and contribute to the common goal of sustainable peace.
<P>

<a name="80601w11.html_para2">Aid workers in Afghanistan continue to face difficult conditions. In the North they have to cope with an unstable security situation, and in some Taliban- controlled areas they have been subjected to harassment--restrictions placed on female staff are a particular problem. These difficulties forced the UN to withdraw international staff from Kandahar earlier this year, and to suspend its programmes in southern Afghanistan. Recent negotiations between the UN and the Taliban have produced an agreement which may improve matters, but some issues (notably the ban on foreign Muslim women from entering Afghanistan unless accompanied by a close male relative) have not been resolved, and it remains to see how effectively the agreement will work in practice.
<P>

<a name="80601w11.html_para3">The EU delegation made clear to the Taliban and other factions that they remained willing to assist Afghanistan but only on the basis of globally accepted principles. The delegation also expressed its full support for the UN. These messages were endorsed by the Afghan Support Group. This demonstration of solidarity helped to bring about the successful conclusion of the negotiations between the UN and the Taliban referred to.

At last month's G8 Summit in Birmingham, leaders agreed to support the speedy and determined extension of debt relief to more countries, under the terms of the Initiative. They also recognised the particular difficulties of post conflict countries, and the need to consider debt relief mechanisms to release more and earlier resources for essential rehabilitation.

 We made it clear in our manifesto that Britain, like every country, must have firm control over immigration. However, we are also determined that applications should be dealt with speedily and fairly. All staff applying the Government's immigration and nationality policy will observe these central principles of being fair, fast and firm; and will carry out their duties without regard to the race, colour or religion of any person seeking to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, or applying for citizenship.
<P>

<a name="80601w14.html_para1">The main elements of our policy are to: welcome genuine visitors and students who wish to come to the United Kingdom; support family life by admitting the spouses and minor dependent children of those already settled in the United Kingdom; ensure that asylum decisions are both swift and fair and fully meet the United Kingdom's obligations towards refugees under international law; grant entry to those who qualify for periods of work in the United Kingdom; maintain a fair, fast and effective entry clearance operation at United Kingdom posts overseas; give effect to the "free movement" provisions of European Community law while retaining controls at frontiers, operated by a civilian Immigration Service; detect and remove those entering or remaining in the United Kingdom without authority and take firm action against those profiting from abuse of the

<a name="80601w14.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Prisoners (Incentives and</center></H4>


Earned Privileges Scheme)
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w14.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Fiona Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what new initiatives are planned to increase the effectiveness of the incentives and earned privileges scheme which encourages responsible behaviour by prisoners.  [44090]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w14.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The national framework for Incentives and Earned Privileges was introduced in 1995 and has been operating in all prisons since mid 1996. These schemes seek to reward good prisoner behaviour and performance and penalise bad prisoner behaviour and performance. In a few prisons, one of the "Key Earnable Privileges" has been television in-cell and the Government now intend to extend the availability of this as an earned and forfeitable privilege more generally across the Prison Service. This will build on the previous Government's introduction of the privilege in 1991, adding slowly to the approximately 2,500 sets already in place. Prisoners will pay for the privilege themselves. The weekly charge is likely to be about &#163;1 against average weekly prisoner earnings of &#163;7.50.
<P>

<a name="80601w14.html_para3">Prisoners' normal access to television is out of the cell in association with others. Television in cells was introduced in 1991, following a White Paper in response to Lord Justice Woolf's Report on the disturbances at Strangeways prison (Manchester). About 1,000 prisoners in four establishments initially had this privilege; under the previous Government the numbers had risen by 1997 to the current levels of about 2,500 (four per cent. of the prison population), mostly in five establishments of varying types. At present, it is largely a matter of chance whether a prisoner will find him or herself in a prison with the prospect of in-cell television.
<P>

<a name="80601w14.html_para4">Experience of in-cell television in recent years suggests considerable benefits. As an earned privilege it can be a powerful incentive to good behaviour and regime participation, and can help with order and control, reducing tension on the landings. Its loss is feared. It helps prisoners keep in touch with the outside world to which all but a few must eventually return. It has potential as a means of providing information and enhancing prison regimes.
<P>

<a name="80601w14.html_para5">The Government have taken into account the views on this subject expressed in a variety of contexts, including the Learmont Report on Prison Service security following the escape from Parkhurst in 1995, the Home Affairs Committee in March 1997, and in reports by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons and Boards of Visitors. The Learmont Report recommended the wider

introduction of in-cell television and pointed to its potential benefits as an information, as well as a recreational, medium. The Home Affairs Committee recommended it in March 1997
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"given the potential of TV in-cell as a means of contributing to good order in a prison; so long as the availability of television in this way is clearly an earned privilege rather than a right".</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="80601w14.html_para6">Successive Chief Inspectors have urged the previous and this Government to make wider use of in-cell television and have reported on its existing successful use, most recently at Garth prison. Boards of Visitors of establishments with in-cell television frequently report favourably on its value. There is already extensive use of in-cell television in other European prison systems and in the United States and Canada.
<P>

<a name="80601w14.html_para7">In-cell television will be liable to be forfeited in a number of ways: when a prisoner is moved to the basic privilege level of the incentives and earned privileges schemes; when an adjudicating governor awards a disciplinary penalty of forfeiture of privileges; if local rules governing the use of in-cell television are broken; and if a judgment is made in a particular case that its availability appears to be damaging a prisoner's treatment or increasing the risk to the public on his or her release.
<P>

<a name="80601w14.html_para8">The Prison Service will be considering further the scope to use internal channels as an additional means of communicating information to prisoners and helping with education and regimes generally. In-cell television can help deliver educational courses, for example through Open University and other relevant programmes. Garth prison--one of the first prisons to have in-cell television--uses an internal information channel to help communication with prisoners and to show videos.
<P>

<a name="80601w14.html_para9">A procurement process for televisions--which will receive terrestrial channels only--is starting with a view to the extension of this privilege from later in 1998. The option of in-cell television will initially be targeted on prisoners on the enhanced privilege level or in other priority groups, such as those who are "drug free". Those on the standard privilege level will not be precluded but the extension of in-cell television will be gradual and monitored closely. This is partly to maximise its benefits as an earned privilege and partly because in-cell electricity is not available in about forty per cent. of accommodation and this is unlikely to change significantly for some time.
<P>

<a name="80601w14.html_para10">Extension of in-cell television will be broadly self-financing, with the costs of Prison Service-owned televisions and their replacement, warranties and wall brackets recovered from prisoners allowed the privilege. At present, licence fees are not payable in respect of prisoners because of Crown exemption. The Government propose to consider the practicability of a licensing arrangement for prisoners later on in the context of licensing arrangements more generally.

 My right hon. Friend indicated in his statement to the House on 23 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 21-37, in response to the Home Affairs Committee report into police disciplinary and complaints procedures, that he would consider the scope for greater openness in respect of investigation reports into deaths in police custody. This is expected to be completed later this year. A similar situation applies in the Prison Service.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action was taken as a result of the review of suicide and self-harm in prison, conducted by Judge Tumim in 1990; and if he will make a statement.  [43184]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w16.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Judge Tumim's report on suicides and self-harm in prisons in England and Wales made wide-ranging recommendations with implications across prison regimes. The Prison Service's response was shaped through a newly created central unit which was set up to develop suicide awareness strategies. Following detailed examination of the recommendations in the report, a revised strategy on caring for the suicidal was introduced in 1994. A further review by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons is now underway and will help to refine strategies further.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if the advice contained in Section Two: Board report of Form HDC (4) in the draft guidance to governors on the eligibility of prisoners for early release on home detention curfew applies in the case of prisoners required to register under Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997;  [42356]
<P>
<UL>(2) if prisoners required to register under Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 will not be eligible to apply for early release on home detention curfew;  [42353]
<P>
(3) pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey) of 12 May 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>70</i>, if he will define the exceptional circumstances in which prisoners who are required to register under Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 would be released on home detention curfew;  [42372]
<P>
(4) if prisoners who are required to register under Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 and who apply for early release under home detention curfew are to be evaluated by any criteria under the enhanced assessment procedure which are not used in the case of other categories of prisoner required to go through the enhanced assessment procedure before early release under the home detention curfew.  [42354]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w16.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Any prisoner serving a sentence of four years or more will not be eligible for home detention curfew. Clause 91 of the Crime and Disorder Bill [<i>Lords</i>] sets out the other categories of prisoner who will be ineligible for home detention curfew, including prisoners who are serving extended sentences for sex offences under clause 55 of the Bill. My right hon. Friend has also decided that prisoners serving between three months and four years who are required to register under Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 should not be tagged on home detention curfew, save in exceptional circumstances.
<P>

<a name="80601w16.html_para0">Specific guidance on the assessment of prisoners required to register under Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 is given in paragraph 3.2 of the draft guidance on the risk assessment for home detention curfew (placed in the Library on 12 May). This states that prisoners who are convicted of an offence to which Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 applies should not be placed on home detention curfew, save where there are exceptional circumstances.
<P>

<a name="80601w16.html_para1">This reflects our overall objective of protecting the public. Each case will be considered on its merits and only where there are exceptional circumstances will release be approved. Factors which will be considered include the circumstances of the offence, the prisoner's risk to the public and the potential supervision arrangements.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prisoners <i>(a)</i> are currently eligible for release on home detention curfew and <i>(b)</i> will be released following (i) a standard assessment and (ii) an enhanced assessment.  [42355]

<P>
<a name="80601w16.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The latest estimate indicates that, were the scheme in force, around 7,200 prisoners would currently be eligible for home detention curfew, subject to their passing a risk assessment and having a suitable address.
<P>

<a name="80601w16.html_para2">All eligible prisoners will have to be considered under the standard assessment before they can be granted home detention curfew. The number of prisoners referred for further consideration under the enhanced assessment will depend on the judgment of those conducting the risk assessments in the individual cases. It is estimated that around 4,000 prisoners might be on home detention curfew at any one time.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the training consultants commissioned by the Metropolitan Police during 1997 and 1998 to date.  [42806]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w16.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Commissioner tells me that training in the Metropolitan Police is delivered on three levels: centrally; area; and divisional. He tells me that, because of the devolved nature of the Metropolitan Police, the majority of training activities and consultants are arranged at a local level in one of its Divisions or Branches. This is to allow local training or consultation to be bought according to need. As a result, the information requested is not readily available centrally and can be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="80601w16.html_para3">However, the Commissioner tells me that contracts for the value of &#163;10,000 and above, and those contracts which may generate particular difficulties, are let in consultation with the Metropolitan Police's Department of Procurement and Commercial Services. He tells me that the formal contracts for training have been placed by the unit over the last year in regard to the following topics:

<a name="80601w16.html_para4"><P>

<a name="80601w16.html_para5">The Commissioner also tells me that a number of companies have asked that confidentiality clauses be included in their contracts so that they cannot be identified. The reasons given were generally security or commercial grounds, I am told. As the Metropolitan Police have agreed to include such clauses in their contracts, the Commissioner is unable to provide me with the information requested. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary is currently undertaking a thematic inspection of training, which will include the Metropolitan Police, and I have asked that contractual arrangements for training be included in that inspection.

 Probation service budgets for 1997-98 were decided by the previous Government and announced to services before that financial year began. We adhered to those budgets after the General Election in line with our commitment to maintain public spending in 1997-98 and 1998-99 in accordance with the previous Government's spending plans.

 It is too early for final decisions to be made about the future of individual exhibits beyond the year 2000, but the Government, in confirming their determination to ensure a legacy from the Millennium Experience, hope that it might be possible for elements of the exhibits to be displayed elsewhere after 2000.

 The New Millennium Experience Company estimates that 12 million visits will be made to the Millennium Experience. Between 8 and 10 million of those are likely to be from the UK, and I hope that many of those will come from Altrincham and Sale, West. I also hope that as many people as possible from the greater Manchester area and across the country participate in the associated Challenge and Millennium Festival programmes.

<P>
<a name="80601w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 There is no new funding available specifically for community hospitals in 1998-99. However, almost &#163;50 million has been made available for major capital investment in the NHS in Wales for projects ranging from the removal of asbestos at the University of Wales Dental Hospital, to the new Cancer Treatment Centre at Glan Clwyd NHS Trust. Another &#163;47 million discretionary capital has also been made available to NHS Trusts and Health Authorities, to maintain existing facilities, including community based services.

<a name="80601w18.html_para0">In February this year, we were very pleased to announce a new community hospital for Chepstow, which will be built and serviced by a private company under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI).

 It is primarily for general practitioners (GPs) as independent contractors to look after their own health and that of their staff. However, the Welsh Office has been involved in discussions with the Welsh Council of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and the Welsh General Medical Services Committee (WGMSC) about this issue. We are also aware that some health authorities in Wales are exploring ways of setting up a service on a local basis.

 Information on the net ingredient cost of prescription items dispensed specifically for asthma could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. 



<P>

However most prescription items dispensed for the treatment of asthma fall into one of three therapeutic classes (bronchodilators, corticosteroids and cromoglycate & related therapy) and figures for these are given in the following table. It should be noted, however, that some

<P>
<a name="80601w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 As in England and Wales, where the provision of infertility services is a matter for the health authorities, the provision of infertility services in Northern Ireland is a matter for the Health and Social Services Boards, which are at present engaged in reviews of the services provided to their local populations. Abortion is illegal in Northern Ireland except where necessary to save the life of the mother or where continuation of the pregnancy would involve risk of serious injury to her physical or mental health. It would therefore not be lawful to grant access to abortion services on the same grounds as in England and Wales, where the law is different.

 Both the Court of Protection and the Public Trust Office treat each case on its merits, and endeavour, using the information available, to try and do what the client (the mentally incapable person) would wish. If this involves close liaison and involvement with the next of kin, this is done.
<P>

<a name="80601w19.html_para1">However, the Mental Health area is not required to keep next of kin involved in each case on the grounds of confidentiality. If the individual was not suffering from a mental illness which meant that they were unable to manage their own financial affairs, they would not necessarily wish their next of kin to be informed of the current position regarding their finances. In some cases people would not, under any circumstances, wish next of kin involved in any way whatever. Each case must be judged on its individual merits.

 The exercise by the Court of Protection of its discretion in approving a loan is a judicial matter and its exercise varies according to the circumstances of each particular case.

 The information requested is not available in the form requested and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. All solicitors' firms undertaking legal aid work are required to hold a Legal Aid Board account number to which payments are made. However, the payment records do not provide an accurate figure for the number of firms doing legal aid work, since a single firm may have more than one office, and therefore account number.
<P>

<a name="80601w20.html_para1">Information on the range of payments for various categories of legal aid made by the Legal Aid Board to solicitors offices are published in its annual report each year. In the 1996-97 annual report, Table General 5 relates to payments made, within each range, to the number of solicitors' offices by each legal aid area. The payments are inclusive of VAT and disbursements as these are not recorded separately.
<P>

<a name="80601w20.html_para2">However, it should be noted that the tables published prior to 1996-97 will not be comparable with those published in preceding annual reports as the tables were revised to make them more relevant to current developments in legal aid (paragraph 4.5 to Section 4 of the 1996-97 report refers).

 The information is not readily available and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Payments made to counsel for legal aid work are recorded by the 



<P>
<P><I>1 Jun 1998 : Column: 71</I><P>
Legal Aid Board by range of payments and category of work only. This means that the statistics contained in the Board's Annual Report do not accurately reflect the number of barristers undertaking legal aid work, as each barrister may appear in a number of categories and ranges of payment.
<P>

<a name="80601w20.html_para3">Information on the range of payments for various types of legal aid made by the Legal Aid Board to counsel are published in its annual report each year. In the 1996-97 annual report, Table General 9 relates to payments made to counsel (Table General 7 in preceding annual reports). The payments are inclusive of VAT and disbursements as these are not recorded separately. However, it should be noted that the tables published prior to 1996-97 will not be comparable with those published in preceding annual reports as the tables were revised to make them more relevant to current developments in legal aid (paragraph 4.5 to Section 4 of the 1996-97 report refers).

 The majority of board members of non-departmental pubic bodies give their time and services voluntarily and receive no payment other than normal travel and subsistence expenses. Where members do receive remuneration, this can vary between an annual salary, an honorarium or an attendance fee (which itself can be a daily rate or a half-daily rate, or calculated on a per meeting or per case basis). Individuals' remuneration therefore is not directly comparable. Full details of all payments to board members of non-departmental bodies, by gender, are given in the Cabinet Office publication 'Public Bodies'. Copies of 'Public Bodies 1997' are available in the Libraries of the House.

 The laboratory at Burnham-on-Crouch is part of the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), an Executive Agency of the Department. As part of its obligation to provide an efficient and effective scientific service, CEFAS is reviewing its long-term requirements for sites and specialist research facilities. The objective of the review is to ensure that CEFAS has appropriate facilities to support first class science, whilst recognising the need for the Agency to recover its full costs and offer affordable services. It is essential to develop flexible facilities, so that CEFAS can respond quickly to changing work opportunities.
<P>

<a name="80601w21.html_para4">The current work programme at Burnham fully occupies the site, and staff numbers have been increasing. There is no expectation that this situation will change significantly in the near future. The estate review will aim to establish the long-term costs and benefits of maintaining all CEFAS sites, including that at Burnham. It will assess the need for future investment in facilities, taking account of the views of the MAFF customers who commission work at CEFAS on their likely requirements, and on the prospects of acquiring new non-MAFF business.

 No such estimates have been made.

 The information by health board and Scotland for financial years 1993-94 to 1997-98 is set out in the table. The costs shown are based on the value of ingredients dispensed by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors before the addition of dispensing fees or deduction of any discount or patient charges. The cost of drugs used in hospital treatment of asthma is not available centrally.

<a name="80601w23.html_para6">The costs shown relate to drugs used in the treatment of asthma contained in British National Formulary sections 3.1 (Bronchodilators), 3.2 (Corticosteriods) and 3.3 (Cromoglycate and related therapy). Some of the drugs may be used in the treatment of other conditions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 It is estimated that abolishing payment of dividend tax credits in respect of all non taxpaying individuals will save the Exchequer about &#163;50 million in a full year. About half of this relates to payments to non taxpaying individuals aged 65 and over. These estimates do not take into account any behavioural effects which might result from abolishing the payment of tax credits.

 Agreement was reached at both the Foreign and Finance Ministers meeting on 9 May and at the Birmingham Summit itself on issues raised in the Mauritius Mandate. Both meetings agreed to the speedy and determined implementation of debt relief to more countries under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, and encouraged all poor countries to have begun the process of securing debt relief by the year 2000. The meetings also urged all countries that have not already done so to forgive aid-related bilateral debt or to take comparable action for reforming poor countries, and to use export credits to countries eligible for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative only for productive expenditure.

 G8 leaders were very conscious of the serious impact of the Asian crisis on the poor and most vulnerable. They agreed that economic and financial reform needs to be matched with actions and policies by the countries concerned to help protect these groups from the worst effects of the crisis. G8 leaders welcomed the support for this by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and bilateral donors and the increased emphasis on social expenditure in programmes agreed by the IMF. At the Summit there was also a full discussion of the challenges of poorer developing countries throughout the wider world and a number of steps were agreed to help them. The conclusions on this are contained in the G8 Communique in the Library of the House.

To ask the Prime Minister what United Kingdom public funds were made available to President Kabbah of Sierra Leone during his exile; and what reports he has received on what the money was used for.  [42803]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w25.html_spmin5"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The total financial value of United Kingdom assistance to President Kabbah and his government representatives while they were in Conakry, Guinea was &#163;342,711. This comprised direct support from the Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for: the basic services of President Kabbah's government in Conakry; President Kabbah and a Sierra Leone delegation to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Edinburgh in October 1997; a workshop and seminar in the United Kingdom to help President Kabbah restore the legitimate Government of Sierra Leone; and communications equipment.
<P>

<a name="80601w25.html_para6">The expenditure has been monitored by the British High Commissioner to Freetown, who worked alongside President Kabbah's government in Conakry, and by periodic reports to the Department for International Development from the government of Sierra Leone.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w25.html_spmin6"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 May 1998]:</i> I took the decision in consultation with the Foreign Secretary on the day the letter was received. President Kabbah himself wrote in the letter that he had no objection to its contents being released to the media. When the letter was made public my Press Secretary made clear to journalists that there were interpretations in the letter which the British Government did not agree with--both in relation to interpretation of Security Council Resolutions and in relation to named individuals--but that we saw it as helpful in providing the perspective of the democratically elected and legitimate government of Sierra Leone on events which led to their restoration after the military coup.

 The United Kingdom, in our Presidency role, led a European Union Technical Mission to North Korea from 8-17 May to assess the present humanitarian situation and consider future needs. The UK participated in the United Nations Development Programme Round Table on 28-29 May to discuss plans for agricultural rehabilitation.

<a name="80601w26.html_spmin3"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The second Asia Europe meeting made a significant contribution towards reinforcing the bonds between Asia and both Britain and Europe as a whole.

<a name="80601w26.html_para1">There was a strong message on the financial crisis in Asia: how we can work together to restore confidence and stability.

 There is no such document as a Captain's log. HMS Cornwall's ships logs for the last year are either onboard the vessel, which is currently off Southern Africa, in the post to the UK, or in storage. The logs are not therefore readily available. However, as I told the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) in my reply of 18 May 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>257</i>, the logs for the period 1 January 1998 to 1 April 1998 are being collected and I will then consider their possible release. They cover the period that HMS Cornwall was off West Africa.

<a name="80601w27.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the Royal Navy vessels which have <i>(a)</i> carried out and <i>(b)</i> attempted to carry out shore operations in Sierra Leone since May 1997; if he will make a statement on the operations concerned; and what involvement there was of private companies.  [42709]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 May 1998]:</i> Since May 1997, with the exception of HMS Cornwall which, between 1 and 20 March 1998, provided humanitarian assistance to the people of Sierra Leone, supported our diplomatic efforts there and assisted in the return of the British High Commissioner, no Royal Navy vessels have carried out shore operations in Sierra Leone.
<P>

<a name="80601w27.html_para6">As far as involvement with private companies is concerned, the ECOMOG air operations centre, run by Sandline personnel, regularly briefed HMS Cornwall during her deployment to Sierra Leone on the security situation and the possible threat posed by rebels. This information was essential to ensure that HMS Cornwall's helicopter could safely carry out its humanitarian relief flights within the country. In addition, on 6 March, HMS Cornwall personnel spent two hours ashore repairing a Sandline helicopter, operating in support of ECOMOG, that had landed at a heli-port alongside the ship following a bird strike. While the helicopter was being repaired, the Sandline pilot and two others accompanying him were invited on-board. On 13 March, HMS Cornwall assisted Sandline personnel with some minor maintenance of the helicopter when it was at the same heli-port. On 19 March, the pilot and 11 others employed by, or connected with Sandline, were invited into the Wardroom for drinks.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w27.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence under what authorisation assistance was rendered to a Sandline helicopter by HMS Cornwall; what ship stores 



<P>
<P><I>1 Jun 1998 : Column: 100</I><P>
and spares were used during this operation; and under what head of charge these items were accounted for by the supply officer, HMS Cornwall.  [42309]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w27.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The decision to assist with the repair of the helicopter operating in support of ECOMOG was, quite properly, taken locally by HMS Cornwall. No ship's stores or spares were used, apart from five litres of degreasant and 40 rivets. Both these items were routine consumables which were accounted for when they were issued to the ship's Flight by RNAS Culdrose prior to the Flight's embarkation in February 1998.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w27.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Sayeed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 18 May 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>258,</i> to the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key), what payment was made for the assistance provided for Sandline International's helicopter by the crew of HMS Cornwall; if prior approval was sought and obtained from his Department by the Captain of HMS Cornwall; if Ministers were informed; and what other assistance was given by British military personnel to Sandline, and when.  [43293]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w27.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb). No other assistance was provided to Sandline in addition to that detailed in my answer to the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) on 18 May 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>258</i>. This was properly a matter for the local commander; ministers were not informed of, nor were charges raised for, the assistance provided.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w27.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Wilshire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list those visitors to HMS Cornwall since 1 January 1996 who were employees of or connected with Sandline International indicating <i>(a)</i> the names of the visitors, <i>(b)</i> the dates of the visits, <i>(c)</i> the names of the persons met, <i>(d)</i> the purpose of the visits and <i>(e)</i> the location of the ship at the time of the visits.  [41817]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w27.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 May 1998]:</i> Information on visitors going back to January 1996 is not available. While HMS Cornwall was providing humanitarian assistance in Sierra Leone there were two occasions on which the ship was visited by identified Sandline personnel. On 6 March the pilot of the helicopter operated on behalf of ECOMOG, Mr. Juba Jubert, and two others accompanying him, identified as Mr. Farr and Mr. Ashworth, were invited on board while the helicopter was being repaired at the heliport alongside HMS Cornwall after a bird strike. On 19 March, twelve persons employed by, or connected with Sandline, were invited into the Wardroom for drinks. The group comprised Mr. Jubert, Mr. Farr, Mr. Ashworth, Mr. Bowen, and eight others for whom full names were not given.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the role of HMS Monmouth in Sierra Leone since May 1997; what requests were received from that vessel with respect to acquiring additional (i) personnel and (ii) equipment for land operations; and if representatives from Sandline International were in contact with that ship.  [42710]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w27.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 May 1998]:</i> The instructions to HMS Monmouth (and later HMS Cornwall) were to deploy to the vicinity of Sierra Leone to be prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance to the people of Sierra Leone, to support our diplomatic efforts there, and to assist in the return of the British High Commissioner, should the democratically elected Government be restored.
<P>

<a name="80601w27.html_para7">No requests were made by HMS Monmouth to acquire additional personnel or equipment for land operations. As far as we can ascertain at no time, nor in any way, did representatives from Sandline International have any contact with the ship.

<a name="80601w29.html_para8">The use and handling of depleted uranium are governed by a number of different regulations, none of which requires specific "authorisation" as such.

<a name="80601w29.html_para10">The time limit for completion of member-nominated trustee exercises ended in May 1998 and research is currently underway to obtain information along the lines requested. It will be published as part of the 1998 Employers' Pension Provision Survey. The National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) Annual Survey 1997 provides some early indications from data collected from 613 of their member organisations in the last quarter of 1997. This shows that 83 per cent. of schemes adopted employers' alternative arrangements. This is commonly referred to as opting-out although it does not necessarily mean that a scheme does not have member trustees. The NAPF data shows that the vast majority of schemes, including those who used employer proposed arrangements, do, in fact, have one-third or more member trustees, although these trustees have not been nominated and selected under sections 16 or 18 of the Pensions Act 1995.

 The majority of board members of non-departmental public bodies responsible to my Department give their time and service voluntarily, and do not receive payment other than normal travel and subsistence expenses. Where members do receive remuneration, this can vary between an annual salary, an honorarium, or an attendance fee--which can be a daily or half-daily rate, or calculated on a per meeting or per case basis. Individuals' remuneration therefore is not directly comparable. Full details of all payments to board members of non-departmental public bodies--by gender, are given in the Cabinet Office publication 'Public Bodies'. Copies of 'Public Bodies' 1997 are available in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="80601w31.html_para3">It should be noted that the previous Government gave the go-ahead for some 23,000 MW of new gas-fired capacity, mostly combined cycle gas turbine stations but some combined heat and power (CHP). We inherited 21 applications for new gas-fired projects, totalling some 10,500 MW. Since coming into office we have given approval to 9 projects, 7 of which were industrial CHP totalling some 600 MW with another having an element of CHP.

<P>
<a name="80601w31.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 May 1998]:</i> The construction, extension, or operation of a gas-fired power station with a capacity of more than 50 megawatts requires the President of the Board of Trade's consent under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989. The President's approval is also required under section 14 of the Energy Act 1976 to use gas as the fuel for power stations over 10 megawatts. In addition, the President's consent under section 37 of the Electricity Act 1989 may also be required if the proposed station is to be connected to the transmission system via an overhead electric line. Other consents and approvals also need to be obtained from other statutory bodies, for example an Integrated Pollution Control licence under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 has to be sought from the Environment Agency. It is for the applicant to determine when and in which order to seek the necessary approvals.

The duties of the new energy regulator will need to acknowledge the convergence of the gas and electricity markets. It will also be necessary to ensure that the creation of a joint energy regulator is underpinned by the proper integration of the supporting regulatory regimes.

The costs (&#163;122,000) of two directors have already been paid after proceedings against them were discontinued in May 1996. Following the request by the judge that I personally consider the handling of the case, and my subsequent decision to abandon the proceedings against the remaining four directors (three of whom are legally aided) my Department will meet their costs, to be taxed on the standard basis, unless previously agreed. It is too early accurately to predict what those costs might amount to.

<a name="80601w33.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 May 1998]:</i> Transfers of nuclear materials from the UK to other countries are subject to strict controls. The requirements in the case of separated plutonium and uranium enriched in the isotopes 235 or 233 to more than 20% (highly-enriched uranium or HEU) are particularly stringent.
<P>

<a name="80601w33.html_para0">The UK's export controls on nuclear and nuclear- related goods are derived from international nuclear non-proliferation commitments and membership of international nuclear export control regimes, in particular the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) whose members have agreed common guidelines for the transfer of nuclear and nuclear-related goods and technology. The NSG guidelines are reproduced as International Atomic Energy Agency document INFCIRC 254 Parts I and II as amended. In addition, the UK was among a group of nine countries which recently adopted a set of Guidelines for the Management of Plutonium published as INFCIRC 549 which adds a further requirement in the case of transfers of plutonium.
<P>

<a name="80601w33.html_para1">These commitments are given effect in the relevant legislation, which in this case is Council Regulation (EC) No. 3381/94 on the export of dual use goods and the related Council Decision 94/942/CSFP as amended. Separated plutonium and HEU require an export licence--even in the case of transfers to other EU Member States.
<P>

<a name="80601w33.html_para2">Before such a licence could be issued certain conditions would have to be fulfilled which include assurances from the recipient Government as set out in the NSG guidelines in relation to peaceful use, physical protection and retransfer of the materials. Transfers to non-nuclear weapon States (NNWS) are only authorised once the receiving State has brought into force an agreement with the IAEA requiring the application of safeguards on all source and special fissionable materials in its current and future peaceful activities. In the case of separated plutonium and HEU, the UK's consent would be required for any retransfer.
<P>

<a name="80601w33.html_para3">Moreover, pursuant to our adoption of the Guidelines for the Management of Plutonium and in addition to the foregoing, before any shipment of separated plutonium exceeding 50 grams to one recipient country in any period of 12 months is undertaken, we require the recipient to provide a certificate containing details including the end-use and timetable for utilisation. The correctness of the information in the certificate has to be confirmed by the Government of the recipient country. This builds on the existing requirement within the EU for a similar certificate to be completed in the case of transfers of plutonium and HEU.
<P>

<a name="80601w33.html_para4">In addition to these governmental assurances an end-use undertaking would also be required from the consignee explicitly excluding uses that might result in 



<P>
<P><I>1 Jun 1998 : Column: 120</I><P>
any weapon of mass destruction and an assurance that the goods would not be used in any unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle activity.
<P>

<a name="80601w33.html_para5">As noted, the controls that we have in place on transfers include requirements for the application of IAEA safeguards. The purpose of these safeguards is to ensure that nuclear materials are not diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.

 <i>[holding answer 18 May 1998]:</i> I have been advised by the UKAEA that the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), during the past month, have issued one direction which requires the UKAEA to shut down all processing activities in the Dounreay Fuel Cycle Area facility other than those operations and activities which are necessary to maintain the safe condition of the facility. In addition, and following on from the formal direction, the NII have issued the two following oral instructions. Firstly, no excavation permits may be issued until further notice and all excavation permits currently in force must be suspended until further notice. The only exception is the work to repair the damaged cable. Secondly, evidence must be preserved for the NII investigation into the power failure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w33.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 May 1998]:</i> The UKAEA's expenditure plans at Dounreay are described in the 1996-97 UKAEA Annual Review, which is available in the Library of the House. Such plans are reviewed at least annually by my officials. It is normal practice to withhold precise details of expected project costs to protect UKAEA's ability to subject the work to competition. The only significant revision in the last six months was the decision to retrieve waste from the Shaft which was reported to Parliament on 31 March 1998. We are currently waiting for UKAEA to complete their proposal for investment in a replacement dissolver in the Prototype Fast Reactor fuel reprocessing plant. This expenditure by UKAEA is aimed at discharging their main function which is removal of their existing nuclear liabilities safely, with due regard for the environment and at minimum cost to the taxpayer.

 <i>[holding answer 19 May 1998]:</i> The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has undertaken a study into the effects on the transport sector of the abolition of intra-EU duty and tax free sales in 1999. The European Union has not undertaken a survey to establish the effect upon jobs of the proposed abolition of duty and tax free sales within the EU. The Government's position remains that they would not oppose a study should there be a consensus amongst Member States in favour of such a study. However, when these matters were discussed at 19 May EFOFIN Council, there was no consensus amongst Member States to call for a Community-wide study of the impact of abolition.

The Defence Export Sales Organisation of the Ministry of Defence is primarily responsible for assisting the British defence industry to promote its goods and services overseas.

 The Director General of Fair Trading has recently agreed a revised code of practice for holiday caravans with the two main site owners' organisations which give clear rights to those buying and selling holiday caravans. Buyers of holiday caravans also benefit in the same way as other consumers from general consumer protection legislation, such as the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994. The responsibility for legislation covering residential caravans lies with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.

 None. The January 1998 report by the Department's Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants, "Quantification of the Effects of Air Pollution on Health in the UK", copies of which are in the Library, illustrated that air pollution has a substantial effect on people's health. It included estimates of the numbers of people affected by different air pollutants. The Committee concluded that deaths and hospital admissions and readmissions were likely to be brought forward as a result of exposure to air pollution. That is why we are committed to reduce air pollution both in this country and in Europe.




<P>
<P><I>1 Jun 1998 : Column: 129</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80601w35.html_para7">However, there is no guarantee that reducing air pollution by particular amounts would lead to a corresponding reduction in the health effects nor in treatment costs associated with such illnesses. For instance, not all air pollutants affect people with asthma. Also, because some pollutants have no threshold of effects--that is, effects can be detected even when concentrations of particular pollutants are low--there will clearly be an effect at any level for some people.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many cases have been recorded since 1987 of brain damage or blood poisoning which <i>(a)</i> have been attributed to the pertussis vaccine and <i>(b)</i> are claimed to be attributable to the pertussis vaccine but are yet to be determined.  [43204]<P>

 There has been one suspected adverse drug reaction (ADR) report of mental handicap made via the United Kingdom spontaneous reporting scheme since 1987 associated with the multiconstituent diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) vaccine. There have been no such reports of blood poisoning since 1987. Doctors are asked to report suspected adverse drug reactions via this scheme and therefore it is not possible to attribute causality definitely. When ADRs are reported with multiconstituent vaccines such as DTP it is not generally possible to know which, if any, component of the vaccine was responsible.

 On 13 May the European Parliament voted through unamended the common position on the tobacco advertising Directive agreed by European Union Health Ministers last December. We hope that it can now be adopted during the United Kingdom Presidency. Following this, member states would have three years to implement the basic provisions of the Directive; a further 2 years are available beyond that for sponsored events; sponsored events organised on a global basis could be exempted for up to three further years, subject to diminishing advertising visibility and sponsorship expenditure. All forms of tobacco advertising and sponsorship covered by the Directive must cease by 1 October 2006. The timescale for implementation of the Directive in UK law will be set out in the tobacco control White Paper to be published later this year.

 While none of the regulations laid by the Department have specifically targeted small businesses, all which impact on business generally take account of the needs of small businesses. For example, Statutory Instrument 1998/574, The Medicines for Human Use and Medical Devices (Fees and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1998, reduced fees for all businesses involved in the manufacture and sale of medicines for human use. It also extended a small business concession to a greater number of companies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80601w37.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Referrals under the Abortion Act are part of the general medical services provided by general practitioners. Guidance issued by the British Medical Association states that practitioners with a conscientious objection to abortion who fail to refer on to another practitioner quickly could be alleged to be in breach of their terms of service. In these circumstances public statements about the GP's personal views on abortion are neither necessary nor appropriate.

 My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State has a power under Section 1(3) of the Abortion Act to approve non-National Health Service premises for termination of pregnancy. The assurances were introduced to combat abuses of the Act and to ensure that approved places provide an appropriate standard of care.

 The capitation grant for 1998-99 is &#163;4,680. The cost of supported placements in 1998-99 can be calculated on a retrospective basis only once the financial year has ended and supported employment providers have sent the Department their audited accounts. Providers have been given a deadline of December 1999 for this.
<P>

<a name="80601w39.html_para0">Uprating the capitation grant in line with the GDP deflator of 2.9 per cent. would result in a level of &#163;4,815.
