<a name="01120w01.html_wqn0"><B> Ms McCafferty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on her Department's contributions to the provision of contraceptives in the developing world.  [138526]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 We are committed to the International Development target to attain universal access to reproductive health services before 2015. We have substantial involvement in efforts to ensure women and men in developing countries can access contraceptives and other reproductive health commodities.
<P>

<a name="01120w01.html_para0">Our recent pledge to contribute an additional &#163;25 million to the United Nations Population Fund, on top of our annual core contribution of &#163;15 million, will help meet immediate and short-term needs, and assure continued access to essential reproductive health commodities, including condoms for family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention, in a number of countries which are facing shortages.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w01.html_wqn1"><B> Ms McCafferty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what representations she has made to other donor Governments about the supply of contraceptives in the developing world.  [138527]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 The recent pledges by this Department and the Government of the Netherlands, to contribute an additional &#163;51 million to the United Nations Population Fund to help fund immediate and short-term needs in developing countries for reproductive health commodities, is a further demonstration of the commitment of both Governments to the health of poor people.
<P>

<a name="01120w01.html_para1">We will continue to encourage other donors and developing countries to make every effort to meet the rising demand for contraception in the developing world.

<P>
<a name="01120w01.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Gibson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of the effects of recent decisions within the WTO on patents and intellectual property rights in technological developments in the developing world.  [138552]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Foulkes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2000]:</i> The UK Government believe that intellectual property rights (IPR)--for instance, conferring copyright, patent or trade mark protection--provide an important incentive for private investment. Developing countries have an important interest in providing intellectual property protection, as a way of encouraging more foreign investment, research and innovation from which they should benefit.




<P>
<P><I>20 Nov 2000 : Column: 2W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01120w01.html_para2">The Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement was introduced into the WTO in the Uruguay Rounds and sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights (IPR) protection.
<P>

<a name="01120w01.html_para3">Developing countries agreed to implement TRIPs consistent legislation by January 2000. The least developed countries have until 2006 to comply. Therefore the real impacts are not yet visible and no conclusion can be drawn as to the effect of these rules on technological developments or otherwise in developing countries.
<P>

<a name="01120w01.html_para4">The precise details of IPR regimes can and should be tailored to the particular circumstances of individual countries. The UK Government believe that the TRIPs agreement allows WTO members sufficient flexibility to implement domestic IPR regimes which take adequate account of their national circumstances. But governments and the international community do need to support improved arrangements to monitor the impacts of the current agreement to make sure that this is the case.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will list the GM research funded by her Department which incorporates genetic systems designed to prevent seed germination.  [138721]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Foulkes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2000]:</i> This Department is not funding research which incorporates genetic systems designed to prevent seed germination.
<P>

<a name="01120w01.html_para5">We have funded a study to examine the likely costs and benefits to the livelihoods of the poor in developing countries from the application of so-called "terminator genes" and similar technologies. The results of this work are being prepared for publication and will be disseminated widely.

<P>
<a name="01120w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Hood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what was the outcome of the Development Council held in Brussels on 10 November; and if he will make a statement.  [138452]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w01.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The main achievement was the adoption by the Council and the Commission of a Declaration on the European Community's Development Policy. This was a milestone for the EC. The Declaration provides the EC, for the first time, with a clear operational framework for all EC development assistance, with poverty reduction as the principal objective. This was an important UK objective in our published strategy for working with the EC. The Development Commissioner, Poul Nielson, also presented a comprehensive Action Programme for implementing the Declaration. He emphasised the multi-dimensional nature of poverty, the need to work within a country's own poverty reduction strategies, the importance of focusing EC development assistance on fewer areas and the need for further progress in ensuring that other EC policies such as fisheries, trade and agriculture do not undermine our development efforts.
<P>

<a name="01120w01.html_para6">I strongly welcomed the Declaration and the Commission's plans for implementing the new policy. It remains essential to turn the operational framework into reality on the ground. My Department will be reviewing how we can help ensure that this is achieved.




<P>
<P><I>20 Nov 2000 : Column: 3W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01120w01.html_para7">The Council also adopted an important new framework for preparation of EC Country Strategy Papers. This clarifies the need to collaborate closely with other donors and to focus on poverty reduction strategies developed by the partner country.
<P>

<a name="01120w01.html_para8">The Council briefly reviewed the actions that have been taken to follow up the overall evaluation of EC programmes which had been discussed in May 1999. These included the adoption of an overall statement of EC development policy.
<P>

<a name="01120w01.html_para9">The Council adopted a Resolution on Communicable Diseases which welcomed a recent Commission Communication and called for an Action Programme to implement it. The Council agreed on the need for a coherent approach to tackling these diseases which threaten poor people and hinder efforts to reduce poverty. Conclusions on the 6th Conference of the Parties on Climate Change were also adopted.
<P>

<a name="01120w01.html_para10">During the pre-Council dinner there was an informal exchange of views on Liberia, Ethiopia/Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and Zimbabwe.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many British school children participated in ski lessons in <i>(a)</i> the UK and <i>(b)</i> Europe in each of the last three years as part of school organised sport.  [138663]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w01.html_spnew5"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 Figures for the number of children participating in school organised skiing lessons are not centrally held. However, Crystal Holidays Industry Report 2000 estimates that in 1999-2000, 119,000 British children took part in school organised skiing holidays. These figures are not broken down between the UK and Europe.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many pensioners will receive free television licences in Cheltenham in 2000. [139283]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w01.html_spnew6"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 Everyone aged 75 or over will be entitled to benefit from a free television licence, but licences cover households rather than individuals. Estimates of the number of households which will receive a free licence are not available at constituency level and TV Licensing, which administers the concession as agent for the BBC, is not able to provide geographical breakdowns of free licences issued. However, estimates of the over-75 population based on the 1991 Census indicate that there were approximately 7,400 people aged 75 or over in the Cheltenham constituency.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if his Honour Gerald Butler QC has completed his review of arrangements for the instruction of Treasury Counsel at the Old Bailey.  [139708]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w01.html_spnew8"><B> Solicitor General: </B> 
 His Honour Gerald Butler QC delivered his report to the Attorney-General on 18 August 2000. The report recommends the retention of the Treasury Counsel system but makes important recommendations to open up and modernise the Treasury Counsel arrangements. The Government will be accepting most of the recommendations without modification.
<P>

<a name="01120w01.html_para11">The system of selecting barristers to be monitored for appointment as Treasury Counsel will be reformed with the aim of encouraging applications from a broader cross-section of the bar (and solicitor advocates) and there will be a higher quality of monitoring so that able barristers have the best chance of an appointment.
<P>

<a name="01120w01.html_para12">There will be clear rules as to the maximum permitted length of service of Junior and Senior Treasury Counsel. There will be new criteria governing the ambit of work sent to Treasury Counsel with the aim of reducing their considerable workload and giving other barristers more opportunity to be instructed in cases being prosecuted at the Old Bailey. Murder and manslaughter cases, not falling within the criteria, will not normally be prosecuted by Treasury Counsel at the Old Bailey in the future.
<P>

<a name="01120w01.html_para13">Consideration will be given to instructing Counsel from the provinces in cases at the Old Bailey and, with a reduced volume of work, Treasury Counsel will be freed up to prosecute some cases in the provinces and to be instructed to defend in some cases. The practice whereby Junior Treasury Counsel are paid a brief fee of two thirds of that of Senior Treasury Counsel leading them, whatever work is to be done or not to be done, will cease. I believe these reforms will be of considerable benefit to the criminal justice system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what investigations have been carried out by his Department into Gulf War syndrome; what are the causes of Gulf War-related illnesses; and if he will make a statement.  [138454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 In July 1997, the Government published a detailed policy statement: "Gulf Veterans' Illnesses: A New Beginning", which set out how we proposed to address veterans' health concerns, including 20 key points on which the Government are taking specific action. Progress against the 20 key points has been reported and published, the most recent occasion being as part of the Defence Committee's Eleventh Special Report, Session 1999-2000. Further details of the Government's work to date can be found in the Library of the House and on my Department's website at: http://gulfwar.mod.uk. The Government accept that since returning from the Gulf conflict, some British veterans have become ill. Many believe that this ill-health is unusual and directly related to their participation in the conflict. Research published so far shows that Gulf veterans report more health problems than comparable military personnel who were not deployed to the Gulf.
<P>

<a name="01120w02.html_para0">However, the findings also support the view that Gulf veterans were not suffering from a single illness or "syndrome", and that the illnesses identified were not unique to the veterans. There is still no medical or scientific consensus on this subject. My Department remains open minded about the various causes of illness which have been suggested and important research continues.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 At the Submarine Centennial Conference (27-29 September 2000), the Ministry of Defence's Equipment Capability Customer organisation outlined the research programme to inform new equipment capabilities that will improve our ship, submarine and aircraft operational effectiveness, in support of littoral operations contributing towards a more joint defence capability. Rear Admiral Rob Stevens, Flag Officer Submarines, and members of his staff, also addressed the conference.
<P>

<a name="01120w02.html_para1">The research programme includes work relevant to operations in littoral zones: hull-mounted sonar arrays; communications technologies; Recoverable Tethered Optical Fibre buoys; and mine detection and avoidance.
<P>

<a name="01120w02.html_para2">We are also conducting research related to a network-centric concept of operations, and to improve connectivity and advanced intelligence, surveillance, targeting and reconnaissance capabilities. The aim is to integrate underwater assets fully with wider maritime, air and land forces. There is a large programme of research and development work under way specific to the underwater battlespace. Some highlights include research into multistatics, allowing ships, submarines and maritime aircraft to exploit each other's sensors; remote sensor active acoustics; long-range acoustic communications; remotely deployed sensor systems; static sensors and Underwater Unmanned Vehicles. These technologies have wide military utility, and commercial applications, which are also developing rapidly, will be taken into account.

 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2000]:</i> Troops on EU-led operations could be deployed outside Europe. The European Union has resolved to establish the capability, where NATO as a whole is not engaged, to launch and conduct military operations in response to international crises.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Over the last six months, military experts of EU member states assisted by NATO planners, have carried out a detailed assessment of the forces and capabilities required by the EU to enable it to carry out by 2003 the full range of crisis management ("Petersberg") tasks envisaged in the Headline Goal set at Helsinki. The UK has identified a pool of forces and capabilities which would enable it to make a powerful contribution to such options in support of the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy, where NATO as a whole is not engaged. UK participation in any particular operation, and the nature of our contribution, would be matters for decision by the UK Government in the light of circumstances at the time.
<P>

<a name="01120w02.html_para12">In the maximum scale operation envisaged at Helsinki--a corps level of deployment of up to 60,000 troops--the UK component could be around 12,500 strong. Maritime and air deployments of up to 18 warships and 72 combat aircraft could be made in addition.

<a name="01120w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The UK submarine Rescue Service has the capability to deal with rescue from any submarine without the use of outside agencies. However, every rescue attempt from a submarine trapped on the sea bed, regardless of nationality, has to be evaluated to determine the optimum solution taking into consideration speed/time and distance. This may mean that it is quicker to rescue distressed submariners using the assistance of other nations' submarine rescue assets.

 The next docking period of HMS Ocean is planned for early 2002 and is likely to span about four months. This is the first routine docking since acceptance, as required to meet Lloyd's survey standards, and is expected to cost in the region of &#163;5 million. During this docking period, the opportunity will be taken to make modifications to the hull to improve the safety of the deployment of some of the landing craft.
<P>

<a name="01120w03.html_para1">In addition, when HMS Ocean returns from her current deployment, routine maintenance will be undertaken at her base port. During this maintenance, defect repair will also be undertaken; the most significant of these will be modifications to the landing craft davit arrangements, enhancements to the replenishment-at-sea facilities and changes to the main engine governors. These repairs are expected to cost in the region of &#163;2 million.
<P>

<a name="01120w03.html_para2">HMS Ocean has been deployed on operations and exercises throughout the last two years and is currently on deployment with an amphibious ready group. As in all first of class ships, operating the vessel has indicated the need for improvements in some areas. These are being addressed in the programmed support periods.

 "Transport 2010: The 10-Year Plan" published by the Government in July contained details of historic and planned future levels of public investment in transport. Between 1997-98 and 1999-2000, DETR funded public capital investment in transport totalling &#163;7.8 billion in cash terms. In the same period DETR funded public expenditure on transport totalling &#163;22.4 billion in cash terms. The table provides a breakdown of these figures by mode of transport and year and illustrates how spending on transport is due to increase as a result of the Spreading Review 2000 settlement announced by the Chancellor in July. Copies of the 10-Year Plan have been placed in the House Libraries.

 This is an operational matter for London Underground (LUL) but they have provided the following information.
<P>

<a name="01120w04.html_para2">LUL keep a range of records of incidents on the London Underground system. They do not use the term "major breakdown" as such, but the most appropriate measure to refer to is the record LUL have of operational or mechanical incidents which give rise to delays to passengers of over one hour. For the purpose of answering this question a "major breakdown" is therefore taken to be an incident which gives rise to delays to passengers of over one hour on the system, and is related to a failure of infrastructure or assets on the system.
<P>

<a name="01120w04.html_para3">The table sets out, by line and by main categories of infrastructure or asset failure, the number of such incidents during the 12 months to 14 October 2000. The incidents are in practice very varied, and categories may inevitably overlap to some extent: for example, track failures may be closely linked to signal problems, and train or track failures may be linked to power problems.
<P>

<a name="01120w04.html_para4">The table excludes incidents which are not related to a failure of infrastructure or assets on the system. These include a wide range of instances: for example delays due to passengers reporting the smell of burning, or water on platforms, or broken glass roof panels at a station.

[138164]<P>

 On 9 November, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister met senior rail industry representatives to discuss progress with the national track recovery plan, including the need to provide better information to passengers during the current disruption to services. Train operators have, among other things,

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will discuss with Ofwat proposals to encourage water companies to offer support to farmers who are committed to methods of cultivation and land management which reduce pesticide usage.  [138302]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Diffuse sources of pollution, including from the inappropriate use, mis-use or run-off from agricultural pesticides, fertilisers and cultivation (erosion) can increase the cost of purifying drinking water. The regulatory regime provides an incentive for water companies to adopt the most cost-effective way of delivering clean water to their customers. In some cases, there will be scope for innovative approaches to cutting treatment costs by reducing diffuse pollution. This could include supporting farmers in reducing their usage of chemicals, and I very much welcome the efforts of those water companies who have chosen to do this.
<P>

<a name="01120w04.html_para5">However, water companies are not responsible for the environmental quality of water more generally. The Government therefore believe that the principal channel for financial support for environmentally friendly farming practice should continue to be agri-environment measures. Expenditure on these measures will more than double in England over the seven year period of the England Rural Development Programme. The Government have published Codes of Good Agricultural Practice to help farmers protect water, air and soil, and also the Green Code for the safe use of pesticides. We are also encouraging the Environment Agency to focus more regulatory effort on the causes of diffuse pollution, particularly where bathing waters or river water quality objectives are threatened.

 Nature conservation areas in England are generally notified as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) because they host the best examples of our national heritage of wildlife habitats, geological features and landforms.

 I am not aware of any local authority requiring school buses to meet the UN ECE Regulation 66 standard, which applies to the strength of superstructure of coaches. This standard is required for single-deck coaches first used in the UK on or after 1 April 1993. However, local authorities can specify the age and type of vehicle used for school transport and could require ECE Regulation 66 compliance by specifying coaches first used after April 1993 in their contracts.

The final strategy will show separate projections for radioactive discharges into the relevant OSPAR sea areas, one of which is the Celtic Seas, which includes the Irish Sea. Statutory guidance to the Environment Agency, which is about to be issued in draft for consultation, will ensure that future discharge authorisations are consistent with the discharges strategy. The strategy will also contain environmental concentration data for a key set of indicators designed to monitor progress in implementing our OSPAR commitments and will be updated every four years.

In Santiago we met with the Chilean British Chamber, the Minister of Justice, the Under-Secretary for the Economy, Energy and Mining, the Under-Secretary for Finance and the Director General of the Ministry for Public Works and participated in a seminar to promote the use of Public-Private Partnerships to facilitate greater investment in public infrastructure. A large number of UK construction companies are now pursuing the opportunities opened up during this mission.

Negotiations will continue, and if all goes well we expect to exchange contracts during February. Progress will be reviewed regularly.

 Following consultations with this Department and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry recently issued a licence for the export of Military Listed mine-clearance equipment for use by OMAR International, a UN funded NGO, to aid their demining activities in Afghanistan. This licence was granted for humanitarian purposes and it does not affect the Government's continued support for the EU Common Position on arms exports to Afghanistan.

 Prior to October 1998 there was nothing to prevent a local authority selling a school playing field if it wanted to. An estimated 40 playing fields a month were sold in this way under the previous Government. Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced, with effect from 1 October 1998, to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields. Local authorities and governing bodies of all maintained schools, including foundation schools, are now required to obtain the Secretary of State's consent before disposing of playing fields, or any part of a playing field.

 The changes to the work permit skills criteria, which came into effect on 1 October 2000, are in part a response to concerns raised by the catering industry about the lack of skilled, professional staff. Where it can be shown that UK or European Economic Area workers are not available, the process for employers to obtain the necessary work permit for overseas staff is now more transparent, straightforward and relevant to the needs of employers.
<P>

<a name="01120w10.html_para3">If we wish key sectors in the economy to grow, we must ensure that that growth is not inhibited by lack of relevant and appropriate skills. At the same time we are investing &#163;6 billion a year in training and education for adults to encourage more people to develop the skills needed in the modern economy.

 The Government published their interim response on many of the Task Force's non-legislative recommendations in March 2000. The SEN and Disability Rights in Education Bill, which will be presented to Parliament next Session, implements the Task Force's recommendations on civil rights in education. We have been considering the remainder of the Task Force's recommendations in the light of negotiations on the European Commission's Employment Directive, brought forward under Article 13 of the European Community Treaty. The Directive, which was agreed at the Council of Ministers on 17 October, has implications for many of the Task Force's recommendations on the definition of disability and discrimination in employment. We hope to be in a position to publish a final response to the Task Force around the end of February 2001.

 The number of appointments in recent years has ranged from 60 to 78. The number appointed in each year merely reflects the number of applicants who meet the criteria to the required degree.
<P>

<a name="01120w10.html_para4">The number appointed in each year shows little correlation with the number of applicants. The number of applicants in recent years has varied little (from 472 to 553), and the success rate of those applicants has varied from less than 12 per cent. to more than 15&#189; per cent.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what the average time taken was between an asylum appeal and (b) a non-asylum immigration appeal being referred by the Home Office to the appellate authorities and the determination of that appeal in (i) 1997-1998, (ii) 1998-1999, (iii) 1999-2000 and (iv) 2000-01 to date; and if he will make a statement.  [139372]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w10.html_spnew5"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Waiting time information is available from 1999-2000. The waiting time for asylum and non-asylum appeals from receipt by the IAA to promulgation of the adjudicator's decision, in 1999-2000 was 10.7 weeks and 12.3 weeks respectively. The waiting time for 2000-2001 to 31 October is 19 and 18.8 weeks respectively.
<P>

<a name="01120w10.html_para5">The increased waiting times are as a consequence of the increase in asylum appeals. The Lord Chancellor expects to meet his target to dispose of 65 per cent. of appeals through both tiers of the system within four months from April 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w10.html_spnew6"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 For the current financial year, the Immigration Appellate Authority's target is an average waiting time for appeals before adjudicators of 16 weeks. The Lord Chancellor's Departments Service Delivery agreement sets a different target covering both ties of the appeal process. The target is to dispose of at least 65 per cent. of appeals within four months from April 2002. The Lord Chancellor expects this target to be met.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w10.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many adjudicators are available to hear asylum and immigration appeals; what plans he has to review that number; and if he will make a statement.  [139374]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w10.html_spnew7"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 There are currently 75 full-time and 311 part-time adjudicators available to hear asylum and immigration appeals. This represents an increase of 27 full-time (64 per cent.) and 121 part-time adjudicators (64 per cent.) since 1 April 1999. A further 26 full-time adjudicators are in the process of being appointed and recruitment is under way to appoint a further 200 part-time adjudicators. The Lord Chancellor keeps the numbers under constant review to ensure that sufficient judiciary are available to hear asylum appeals.

 The table shows appeals at the Immigration Appellate Authority at 1 April and 31 October 2000 (the most recent date for which information is available).
<P>

<a name="01120w10.html_para6">Asylum workload has increased by 181 per cent. over that period to a level of broadly 3,600 cases a month. The number of outstanding cases is consistent with the number of cases that will inevitably be in the system at any one time, given the higher workload and an average disposal time of around four months.

 General practitioners order their supply of flu vaccine direct from manufacturers. This year there are five suppliers of flu vaccine. Unfortunately one of the manufacturers, Solvay, has encountered problems in growing a strain of the vaccine which has led to delays in some deliveries. Solvay have been in touch with the affected GPs to tell them details of any delays, but have confirmed that all ordered vaccine will be delivered by the end of November, in time to protect people this winter.
<P>

<a name="01120w12.html_para0">Latest figures as at 8 November, show that 9.8 million doses of vaccine have already been distributed. This, along with the amount of vaccine still to be delivered, is a sufficient amount to exceed our immunisation target of 60 per cent. uptake in those aged 65 and over, and to achieve a substantial rise in uptake among those at risk.

 This year, we have extended the recommended groups for influenza immunisation to include everyone aged 65 and over, irrespective of their underlying health, as well as younger people in established high risk groups.

 <i>[holding answer 13 November 2000]:</i> Contingency plans for dealing with an epidemic or outbreak of flu are part of the detailed planning process to manage winter pressures.

<P>
<a name="01120w12.html_spnew6"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The incidence of newly acquired hepatitis C infections is not known, as the virus is usually acquired without symptoms. Nevertheless, it is possible that the incidence is falling. Transmissions of hepatitis C through contaminated blood and blood products have now been virtually eliminated. There is also some evidence that the prevalence of hepatitis C among younger injecting drug misusers is less than among those who started injecting before harm minimisation strategies (e.g. needles exchange schemes) were put in place.
<P>

<a name="01120w12.html_para6">While the number of new infections may be falling, we expect an increase in the number of people diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C over the next 10 years, as individuals who have carried the virus for some time are identified through wider testing of groups who have been at risk.

<a name="01120w12.html_para7">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence has recently published recommendations on the use of alpha interferon combined with ribavirin for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C, and National Health Service funding includes resources for implementing this guidance.

 <i>[holding answer 14 November 2000]:</i> Referral for specialist genetic counselling is normally only appropriate for women at high familial risk of breast cancer. Genetic testing for mutations in the breast cancer predisposition genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) may be appropriate for some of these women. In 1998-99, 1,173 tests were undertaken in United Kingdom regional genetic centres for BRCA1 and BRCA2. This compares to 856 in 1997-98 and 458 in 1996-97.

 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2000]:</i> All research on human embryos is strictly regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. This Act was introduced following detailed consideration by the Warnock Committee in the early 1980s of the issues raised by developing technologies in this area. The provisions in the Act were subject to considerable debate in both Houses.
<P>

<a name="01120w13.html_para1">Following the recommendations in the Chief Medical Officer's expert group report: "Stem Cell Research: Medical Progress with Responsibility", the Government announced their intention to introduce regulations to extend the purposes for which human embryos may be used in research.

 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2000]:</i> The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority operates a systems and data audit programme. This is used to monitor the standard of IVF and donor insemination treatment records and provide assurances for the National Audit Office regarding the collection of licence fee income. The HFEA audit is in the fourth year of its five-year programme and has identified areas where errors could be avoided by licensed clinics. It has also provided information and guidance to clinics on improvements in the quality of their information.

 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2000]:</i> In February 1996 the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority issued a two-year research licence for a project entitled "Culture of Multipotential Human Embryo Cells" at the Centre for Genome Research, University of Edinburgh. The objective of the proposed research was to establish cell lines from human embryos with a view to analysing the factors that affect the development of embryos fertilised and grown "in vitro" and to assess their development potential. An application was made for renewal in February 1998 and a licence was granted in May 1998 for a further two years.
<P>

<a name="01120w13.html_para5">The objectives of this research are (i) to promote advances in the treatment of infertility; (ii) to increase knowledge about the causes of congenital disease; and (iii) to develop methods for detecting the presence of gene or chromosome abnormalities in embryos before implantation.

In 1992, and again in 1994, the NRPB's independent advisory group on non-ionising radiation examined the evidence for an association between the incidence of cancer and exposure to electromagnetic fields and concluded that there was no clear evidence of an adverse health effect at the levels of electromagnetic field to which the public is normally exposed. The advisory group monitors the relevant research and will be publishing a comprehensive review of the more recent studies including those on electric fields in the next few months.

 Section 118 of the Medicines Act is one of a number of pieces of legislation that the Government are currently reviewing to see whether or not it is appropriate to repeal them, once new freedom of information legislation is in place, and a final decision has still to be made.
<P>

<a name="01120w14.html_para3">Section 118 does not place an absolute restriction on the disclosure of information. The Medicines Control Agency, as the executive arm of the licensing authority, acts on the basis that section 118 allows it to disclose information where to do so is in the performance of its duty to protect public health. Therefore, where there is a risk to public health or safety, the agency has an overriding obligation to remove or reduce that risk even if confidentiality is broken. The agency also complies with the current administrative Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his statement on NHS resources and priorities of 14 November 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 805-08, how many people have been waiting for outpatient treatment for 13 weeks or more; and if he will estimate how many will be waiting by 2002.

<a name="01120w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 At the end of September, 435,768 patients were waiting over 13 weeks for a first outpatient appointment. The number of those waiting more than 13 weeks fell by 80,000 over the past year and we expect further falls next year.

<P>
<a name="01120w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We proposed in the National Health Service Plan that a United Kingdom Council of Health Regulators should be established to provide formal co-ordination between the health regulatory bodies which would, in the first place, act as a forum in which common approaches across the professions could be developed for dealing with matters such as complaints against practitioners. Its role will depend on the willingness of the regulatory bodies to reform. We are therefore still considering the proposed form, functions and cost of this new body.

<P>
<a name="01120w15.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The National Health Service Plan sets out a programme of investment and reform to modernise NHS. Chapter 10 of the Plan announced the introduction of a new system of public and patient involvement to

<P><I>20 Nov 2000 : Column: 59W</I><P>
strengthen the voice of the patient at every level of the NHS. As a consequence, Community Health Councils are to be abolished, subject to legislation.
<P>

<a name="01120w15.html_para3">The aim of the new system is not to cut costs, but to transform the NHS, so that health care services are built around the needs of the patients who use it and citizens that pay for it. The current CHC budget is &#163;23 million per annum, and an additional &#163;10 million per annum has been made available from 2001-02 specifically to assist with the introduction of a Patient Advocacy and Liaison Service.

 <i>[holding answer 9 November 2000]:</i> Between 1 May and 31 October 2000, MAFF arranged for 611 samples to be taken and tested from seed offered for sale. These were tested to ensure compliance with the minimum standards for analytical purity and 'other seeds content' required by the EU seeds directives. Of the samples tested, two failed to reach these minimum standards due to excessive presence of ergot or other seeds.

[137624]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w16.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 No work has been commissioned to demonstrate directly that cow dung used as fertiliser could transmit BSE to humans as CJD. In studies commissioned by MAFF, BSE infectivity has been found in the wall of the gut of cattle that were given BSE infected cattle brain by mouth, but none has been seen in the gut of natural cases of BSE. Analysis of data from the epidemic (by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) and other groups) suggests that horizontal transmission between animals does not occur, by any route. It has proved difficult to test faeces directly for infection, as it is highly toxic to mice, but no infection has been transmitted to mice from the faeces of cattle experimentally infected with BSE.

 The Independent Tribunal Service (ITS) was a tribunal non-Departmental Public Body under a Presidential system. The President was responsible not only for judicial functions but also for the administration of the five tribunals.

The number of comparable crimes measured by the British Crime Survey (BCS) rose by 4 per cent. The divergent trend is consistent with two results from the BCS. The first is that the proportion of offences reported to the police victims fell between 1993 and 1995. The second is that the proportion of the reported crime that was recorded by the police also fell, according to BCS evidence.

 The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 provides powers for the police and local authorities to remove travellers who are camping on unauthorised sites. Section 61 allows the police to direct them to leave, and failure to comply with a direction is an arrestable offence. Section 77 allows the local authority to direct unauthorised campers to leave; failure to comply is a criminal offence, and the local authority may apply to the magistrates court for an order allowing them to take reasonable steps to achieve compliance. The Home Office/DETR guidance document "Managing Unauthorised Camping" has recently been revised to reinforce the message that unauthorised camping which involves criminal or antisocial behaviour should not be tolerated.

<P>
<a name="01120w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 There are no direct measures of the availability of drugs in prisons. Random mandatory drug testing figures provide an indirect measure--the latest figures indicate that on average 12.5 per cent. of prisoners test positive for drugs (down from 24.4 per cent. in 1996-1997).

<a name="01120w23.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The parenting order under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 was implemented nationally on 1 June 2000 following successful pilots. Reinforcing parental responsibility is a key objective of the Government's youth justice reforms and the order provides a new means of supporting parents in exercising proper responsibility for their children's behaviour.
<P>

<a name="01120w23.html_para5">Information from the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales indicates that between 30 September 1998 and 31 March 2000, 284 parenting orders were made in the pilot areas.

 Not all European Union member states currently impose financial penalties on carriers for the carriage of third country nationals who arrive without the required documents. Where member states do impose such provisions, the systems for imposing penalties and deciding the amount to be charged differ. The definitive position could only be obtained by direct reference to the authorities of each individual State--therefore I regret that the information requested could only be ascertained at disproportionate cost.

 It has always been the intention that, when the Criminal Records Bureau comes on stream, it will be expected to recover its costs through charges that it makes in relation to the certificates that it issues, on application, to individuals. Voluntary organisations, and employers, will be able to reimburse applicants if they so wish. Waiving charges in respect of those applying from the voluntary sector, or from part of the sector, would inevitably increase the cost to the public purse or for other applicants. We have made clear our determination to keep fees as low as possible. An impact assessment will address the implications for the voluntary sector and others.

The exercise will be carried out before regulations are made which prescribe such matters as the level of fees, in advance of the Bureau becoming operational in around July 2001. Officials will

<a name="01120w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Over the past four years, the Home Office has received only two formal requests for assistance in connection with funds appropriated illegally from Pakistan. However, these were requests for evidence relating to the misappropriation of funds, not requests for confiscation of assets.
<P>

<a name="01120w24.html_para5">The first request, issued in October 1997, asked for evidence relating to Senator Asif Ali Zardari, the husband of Benazir Bhutto, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, in connection with allegations of drug trafficking. A large amount of evidence was gathered, but its transmission to Pakistan was hindered by legal challenges both before and after the coup of 12 October 1999. The Secretary of State has taken a decision to transmit the evidence, but this is still subject to an appeal against a decision of the court that leave to apply for a judicial review should not be granted.

 One of the recommendations on firearms licensing made in Lord Cullen's Report into the Dunblane tragedy was that the police should be able to seek and consider information on the medical history of any person applying to possess firearms.
<P>

<a name="01120w24.html_para10">In order to implement this and other recommendations, the Firearms Rules were amended in 1998 to require applicants for the grant or renewal of a firearm or shot gun certificate to declare whether they suffer from any medical condition or disability including alcohol and drug related conditions, and if so to give details.
<P>

<a name="01120w24.html_para11">It is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of conditions or disabilities that might have a bearing on this issue. Were any such list to be attempted, there is a real risk that it would exclude conditions that might affect an individual's fitness to possess a firearm, if only because of the medication which may have to be taken. It is for the police to consider each applicant on an individual basis, seeking medical advice where appropriate. It is open to any applicant aggrieved by the refusal of a chief officer of police to grant or renew a certificate to appeal to the Crown Court or in Scotland, the Sheriff's Court.

<a name="01120w24.html_para15">The comparable cost in 1999-2000 to the Home Office budget of supporting asylum seekers in the United Kingdom was &#163;537 million. The Department of Health incurred an additional cost of &#163;52 million for supporting unaccompanied asylum seeking children, bringing the total cost in 1999-2000 for supporting asylum seekers to &#163;590 million.

 The specific information required is not available. However, as at the end of 1999, 15,720 nationals of the Former Yugoslavia, which includes the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, were awaiting an initial decision.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the average unit cost in 1999-2000 was and what the average unit cost is for 2000-01 of <i>(a)</i> asylum after-entry casework, <i>(b)</i> nationality casework and <i>(c)</i> enforcement casework, expressed in (i) cash and (ii) real terms.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01120w24.html_spnew15"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 For the purposes of monitoring the performance of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate under the terms of the Casework Programme contract with Siemens Business Services, the unit cost of a basic casework decision is determined each month. The unit cost excludes some overheads. The costs of more complex decisions may be estimated by combining the cost of the basic decision was &#163;38.66 for the period April 1999 to March 2000 and &#163;34.75 for the period April 2000 to September 2000. The costs of more complex decisions may, therefore, be expressed as given in the table.
