 The UN estimates that there are at least 5.3 million vulnerable people inside Afghanistan. This is expected to rise by a further 2.2 million in coming weeks, bringing the total of vulnerable people in need of assistance inside the country to 7.5 million. In addition, there were already some 4 million Afghan refugees in neighbouring countries due to over 20 years of conflict and four years of harsh drought conditions.
<P>

<a name="11015w01.html_para0">The UN and their non-governmental organisation (NGO) partners have launched an appeal for $584 million to cover the period October 2001 to March 2002. Donors, including the UK and the EU, have so far responded with commitments of $301 million. $29 million has also been pledged to humanitarian agencies outside of the UN Donor Alert. In addition, donors announced pledges of a further $407 million in support for humanitarian assistance for Afghans. However, it is not yet clear how these additional funds will be allocated. Information is not available on what proportion of funds have actually been released to humanitarian agencies.
<P>

<a name="11015w01.html_para1">My Department has set aside a sum of &#163;40 million to respond to the current crisis affecting Afghans in Afghanistan and in neighbouring countries. We have also set aside a further sum of &#163;11 million for immediate short-term support to the poorer communities of Pakistan, especially those most directly affected by the influx of refugees from Afghanistan. Our top priorities are to help meet immediate life-saving needs (food, water, health care, shelter) within Afghanistan, as best as possible and for as

long as possible, through the national staff of relevant agencies; support refugee needs in neighbouring countries; help host populations through programmes which benefit them, for example in health care, food, water and sanitation provision; and strengthen international humanitarian agency capacity and co-ordination.
<P>

<a name="11015w01.html_para2">These funds are being made available now through UN agencies, the Red Cross movement and NGOs. Their programmes include particular emphasis on children. For example, &#163;3 million has been provided to the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) for disease control, nutrition supplementation, safe water and sanitation, and psychosocial support to traumatised children.

<a name="11015w01.html_para4">Since 1997, my Department has provided over &#163;32 million of humanitarian assistance to Afghans. This has included help to refugees in Pakistan and Iran who have themselves been so generous to millions of refugees over many years. Since 11 September, we have set aside an additional sum of &#163;40 million to respond to the current crisis affecting Afghans in Afghanistan and in neighbouring countries; as well as a further &#163;11 million for immediate short-term support to the poorer communities of Pakistan, especially those most directly affected by the influx of refugees from Afghanistan.

Our funding for assistance to Afghan refugees has been channelled through the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) for protection and education activities, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) for emergency feeding programmes, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) for education and primary health care programmes, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) for improving the reproductive health status of refugees, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for education and livelihood building programmes.
<P>

<a name="11015w01.html_para5">Since 1991, the European Commission has committed some euro 430 million in humanitarian assistance to Afghan populations in need (approximately euro 81.7 million or &#163;51 million of which is the UK share).

<a name="11015w01.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Co-ordination for humanitarian assistance is the responsibility of the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) who have appointed a Regional Humanitarian Co-ordinator based in Islamabad. My Department has provided &#163;1 million to OCHA to support these co-ordinated efforts. This contribution will also be used to increase the capacity of the Offices of the UN Resident Co-ordinators in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Pakistan and Tajikistan. This includes the provision of technical personnel to set up a Humanitarian Information Centre (HIC) that will collate and communicate humanitarian information on the needs and programmes, to all concerned agencies.

 If members of the public wish to help Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran, the best way is to donate cash to a humanitarian agency, such as the British Red Cross, or other NGOs, working in the region. Although some people may have collected goods that they would like to give to those in need, it is better to find some way of turning collected or donated goods into cash, and then to donate the proceeds to a humanitarian agency's public appeal. The logistics involved in despatching donated goods (cleaning, sorting, packaging and freighting) are time consuming and expensive, and cash donations are a faster and more economical way to provide assistance to those in need.

There is some evidence that in those areas where there is good humanitarian access, malnutrition rates have eased recently, but this represents only temporary respite for a limited number. There remains a pressing need for a negotiated and inclusive end to the conflict. The UK has contributed &#163;2.82 million this year to the humanitarian relief effort through UN agencies and NGO's as well as our contribution through the EC. We continue to monitor the situation through the UN, NGOs, the Red Cross societies, and by undertaking regular visits.

 My Department, with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, are working to implement the Government's three-year &#163;19.5 million strategy on small arms under our global conflict prevention pool. Under the auspices of the strategy the Government have been looking at ways of providing long-term support to UN agencies for comprehensive arms control and reduction measures, including weapons destruction. To date, we have committed &#163;120,000 to the UN Regional Centre in Lima, Peru to assist in the practical implementation of regional and international agreements to combat illicit weapons trafficking. Also, under the strategy we are planning to commit &#163;7.5 million to supporting the UN Development Programme in a global programme for weapons collection, management and destruction. The strategy will continue to look at areas where support for UN agencies will help to meet our objectives of reducing the number of lives affected by violent conflict through the uncontrolled availability of small arms and light weapons.

 It is for each Government to apply the European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (known as the Valetta Convention 1992) in ways that fit in with national practice and legislation.

Much archaeological work is already controlled through existing mechanisms.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment has been made of the implications of the Valetta Convention on archaeology for the licensed activities of metal detector groups.  [4251]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w02.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (revised) (known as the Valetta Convention 1992) came into effect in the UK on 31 March 2001. The Explanatory Report on the Convention makes it clear that
<P>

<a name="11015w02.html_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'a State however, may only require mandatory reporting of finds of precious metal or on already listed sites'.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11015w02.html_para4">This falls within the provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the Treasure Act 1996. Further, article 3 might seem at first glance to require states to institute a system of licensing metal detectors but, as the Explanatory Report points out,
<P>

<a name="11015w02.html_para5"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'prior authorisation of the use of metal detectors or "any other detection equipment" applies only to "archaeological investigation" and therefore not to the normal use of metal detectors'.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11015w02.html_para6">Therefore in the Government's view the current measures in place in England and Wales already meet the requirements of the Valetta Convention as regards portable antiquities. The impact on the activities of legitimate metal detector groups should be minimal.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment has been made of whether the provisions of the Valetta Convention would be in contravention of the Human Rights Act 1998.  [4247]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w02.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (known as the Valetta Convention 1992) is one of a family of Council of Europe Conventions dealing with the protection of the historic environment. The Human Rights Act 1998 gives further effect in the UK to the rights guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The Act itself does not have any force outside the UK, but clearly the ECHR does. Both the Valetta Convention and the ECHR are treaties of the Council of Europe with many of the same signatory states. We have no reason to believe that the two conventions are incompatible.

<P>

<a name="11015w03.html_para3">The funding system for the arts will be reformed to create a single funding organisation with regional arts councils and considerably enhanced levels of local government involvement. The new system will enable the regions to be active drivers of the funding system, rather than merely clients of a national body. It will result in a more streamlined organisation which will offer up savings that can be ploughed back into the arts, as well as providing a structure that is simpler and more consistent for those applying for funds and support. The Arts Council of England is currently consulting on the detail of the proposed changes.

 Sport England has decided that the remaining 18 Sport Action Zones will be designated following a bidding process which it proposes to launch in January next year. The bidding process will focus on the top 20 per cent. of deprived areas in the country and the criteria to be taken into account in assessing the applications will relate to the degree of socio-economic deprivation; the scope for working with other partners and initiatives in the area; and the level of sporting need and deprivation. It is anticipated that each region will have at least one zone and a maximum of five. Sport England expects to announce its decisions in October 2002.

The BBC and ITC, who are responsible for the digital terrestrial television (DTT) network, are considering, in consultation with the digital broadcasters, manufacturers, consumer groups and Government, how to improve the core coverage of all digital television multiplexes across the UK. Maps showing the current predicted DTT coverage from each of the UK DTT transmitter sites have been placed in both Houses on CD-ROM and maps are also available on the Digital Television Group website: www.dtg.org.uk.

This is in addition to the ETC's annual grant-in-aid allocation of &#163;9.6 million, approximately half of which is allocated to the regions, including the RTBs.

 Our best estimate to date is that the loss of revenue in 2001&#150;2002 by the English tourism industry is likely to be about &#163;3.3 billion in "value added" terms over the 8-month period under consideration (March to October). We will continue to revise the model on which this estimate is based in the light of the latest available data.

 No specific funding was provided by the DCMS for publicising the closure and subsequent lifting of restrictions in the countryside.

 At the regional, national and international level, new tourist websites and visitor hotlines have provided reassurance and a clear picture that Britain is open.

Much of the &#163;18 million in additional funding provided by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to the British Tourist Authority (BTA) and English Tourist Council (ETC) has been used in strategic advertising and marketing campaigns to motivate potential customers and provide information on what is open.

 This Department has not been consulted by the Department for Education and Employment, or its successor, on the implications for the tourism industry of proposed changes in the duration and number of school terms. Last year the Local Government Association established the Independent Commission on the Organisation of the School Year, whose report "Rhythms of Schooling" was published in September 2000. The Commission's remit was to consider the wide-ranging effects of current arrangements and it made various recommendations, including about the duration and number of school terms. It has since received feedback from an extensive consultation and published its response earlier this month. Tourism bodies have been involved throughout the process and were included among the consultees, as was the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Decisions about the number, length and dates of school terms and holidays are taken by each local education authority and not by central Government, and we have no plans to change this. The Government will look carefully at the LGA's final recommendations (expected in December). However, we would need to be convinced that there was widely based support for a change before considering legislating to impose a new uniform format.

Until the consultation process has been completed we are not in a position to make an informed assessment of the financial and other consequences for clubs; and we do not propose to take decisions on the report before then.

 Under the Accommodation for Residential Care concessionary television licence scheme, a &#163;5 concessionary fee is already available for disabled people and retired people aged 60 or over living in residential or nursing homes or in sheltered housing which meets specific qualifying criteria. As announced on 9 April this year, we propose to introduce preserved rights to this concession for existing beneficiaries, in cases where changes to the social mix or the level of warden cover mean that the accommodation no longer meets the full qualifying criteria. Consultations between officials and the BBC about the necessary amendments to the television licence fee regulations are currently underway. We intend to bring forward these amendments as soon as we can but it is important that in doing so we do not create any new anomalies or unnecessary administrative burdens.

 I met my G8 colleagues in Genoa from 20 to 22 July. The summit was an important opportunity to discuss a wide range of international issues. The conclusions of the summit were placed in the Libraries of the House at the time.

<P>

<a name="11015w07.html_para10">We welcomed the readiness among African leaders to take responsibility for resolving the problems in their continent.

<P>

<a name="11015w09.html_para2">We are further improving the services available for the hardest to help, such as a &#163;40 million package of help for unemployed drug mis-users, and a further package for a wider group including ex-offenders and the homeless.
<P>

<a name="11015w09.html_para3">We have also introduced Action Teams for Jobs and Employment Zones which are targeting the most deprived areas. Between them they have already helped over 26,000 people into jobs. We are increasing the number of Action Teams from 40 to 53 this month, and to 63 in January 2002. We have also extended Employment Zones until March 2003.

 Our welfare to work initiatives have helped people into work in all parts of the country. Our New Deals have been a success, playing an important part in reducing claimant unemployment in West Yorkshire by almost 40 per cent. since 1997.

<a name="11015w09.html_para5">This year's report demonstrates that we have continued to make real improvements, improving the lives, prospects, and opportunities of children and young people. Over the past four years, we have taken action to raise the incomes of families, especially for those on the lowest incomes.

<P>

<a name="11015w09.html_para6">We have introduced a range of tax and benefit reforms to give help at the time when families need it most, whether they are in work or not.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The Government have introduced stakeholder pensions as part of our long-term reforms to ensure that everyone has the chance to save for a decent income in retirement. They provide a new pension option for moderate and higher earners who do not have access to a good occupational scheme, or a good group personal pension with an employer contributing.
<P>

<a name="11015w09.html_para10">The suitability of a stakeholder pension for any individual is a matter for them to decide in the light of their particular circumstances. Figures from the insurance industry show that in the first four months since their introduction almost 300,000 people had taken out stakeholder pensions.

 Stakeholder pension funds will be subject to the same rules as other occupational and personal pensions. Where a pension scheme is not able to pay a pension, a fund must be used to buy an annuity by age 75 so as to guarantee a pension income throughout retirement.

 Stakeholder pensions are primarily intended for those with moderate and higher earnings who do not have access to a good occupational pension, or a good personal pension with an employer contributing.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) of 10 July 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 501W on public service agreements, what the <i>(a)</i> percentage and <i>(b)</i> absolute savings from PFI projects would have been if all projects examined up until June had been examined by the NAO; and if he will make a statement.  [4614]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Information of this nature, which would require judgments to be made about the potential savings and VFM improvements available from very different types of projects across government, is not held centrally. However, a great deal of central guidance and support are available to Departments contemplating the use of PFI&#151;from the Treasury, the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) and Partnerships UK (PUK). This draws upon reports by the National Audit Office and Parliamentary Select Committees.
<P>

<a name="11015w11.html_para1">As with other elements of their business, it remains the responsibility of individual Departments and agencies to ensure that value for money for the taxpayer is demonstrated before any PFI deal is signed. In carrying out investment and option appraisals, Departments are required to follow Treasury guidance contained in the Green Book "Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government". For PFI deals, Departments are also required to construct a Public Sector Comparator (PSC), which is a costed estimate based on the assumption that the required service would be acquired through conventional funding. Guidance on PCSs is contained in Policy Statement No.2: Public Sector Comparators and Value for Money, and Technical Note 5: How to construct a Public Sector Comparator. The latter notes that the PSC should not be regarded as a pass/fail test, but as a quantitative way of informing judgment. These documents and a list of signed PFI deals are available in the Library of the House and are accessible on the website of the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) www.ogc.gov.uk.
<P>

<a name="11015w11.html_para2">By June 2001 some 450 PFI deals had been signed by central, regional and local government authorities in the United Kingdom. To date the NAO has published 20 value for money reports on PPP/PFI deals. A list of these reports is available on the NAO website www.nao.gov.uk.
<P>

 The Barnett formula provides the devolved Administrations with population-based shares of increases in comparable spending of UK Departments. Beyond the period covered by the 2000 spending review, changes in spending will depend on the outcome of future spending reviews. Information on public expenditure was published in Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses in April 2001. Any convergence would be affected by a number of factors, such as the rate of increase of comparable UK Departments' programmes, changes in population relativities, and changes in spending in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland not determined by the Barnett formula.

<P>
<a name="11015w13.html_spnew3"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Financial Action Task Force, of which the UK is a member, carries out regular assessments on the financial regimes of countries and territories which it suspects may be used for laundering money related to drug trafficking, arms running and terrorism. Those countries and territories which are listed as non-co-operative are required to put in place adequate systems to prevent money laundering before they can be considered for removal from the list. So far four countries and territories have made sufficient improvements that they can be de-listed.

<P>
<a name="11015w13.html_spnew4"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The international standards against money laundering are set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The UK has promoted these standards and sought the maximum international exchange of information and judicial co-operation. We have also pressed the International Monetary Fund to recognise the FATF 40 recommendations as the international standard, which it has now done; and we have promoted a new European Union directive to strengthen community obligations to combat money laundering.

 On 7 September 2001, the Financial Action Task Force, of which the UK is a member, identified 19 non-co-operative countries or territories&#151;Cook Islands, Dominica, Egypt, Grenada, Guatemala, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Lebanon, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Nauru, Nigeria, Niue, Philippines, Russia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Ukraine.

 The Government's strategy to encourage saving, published in November 2000 in "Helping People to Save", is to create the right environment for saving, including the right macro-economic environment, create the right incentives for people to save, and provide information and education to help people make the right saving choices. Government policies on means-tested benefits and tax credits target assistance to those most in need.

<P>
<a name="11015w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The circumstances of the National Bus Group pension fund are not the same as those of the Scottish Transport Group pension fund. However, while there is no legal entitlement for STG pension scheme members to share in the pension surplus at wind-up, the Scottish Executive have announced that they will make ex gratia payments to members, to achieve an outcome broadly comparable to that secured in England.

The application of national insurance contributions to the exercise of share options is part of the Government's general policy of aligning income tax and national insurance. However, in response to concerns from business about the uncertainty of their national insurance liability, we introduced an easement in July 2000. This allows companies to pass their liability on share options to their employees with their agreement. So far 900 companies have taken advantage of this measure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Customs officials did not meet on this specific issue. The law requires that the value on which value added tax is calculated is the total amount of money to be given in exchange for a supply. This amount includes tax, and since the inception of VAT it has been calculated on the excise duty inclusive value of sales of goods such as petrol, alcohol and tobacco. The levy follows this long-established principle.

 The Lear's Macaws were seized together with a number of other birds in May 1998.

He appealed against conviction and sentence, the conviction was upheld but the sentence was reduced to 18 months. In September this year a Confiscation Order was made reflecting Mr. Sissen's benefit from criminal activity in the sum of &#163;150,000.

 The Government gave a commitment in the House of Commons during the passage of FSMA that there would at any time be a single RAO. This commitment could be interpreted as meaning that we should remake the RAO each time we needed to change it.
<P>

<a name="11015w17.html_para5">The normal practice when amending a statutory instrument is to make textual amendments only to the particular provisions affected, unless the changes are so substantial or widespread as to justify revoking the original instrument and re-making it (with amendments) in its entirety. Re-making the entire RAO every time we need to amend it (however minor the changes) would differ from that usual practice. From time to time we will need to adjust the RAO, for example to reflect developments in the market, or changes to European legislation. If we remade the entire RAO each time, this would impact on the numerous other Statutory Instruments, together with rules made by the Financial Services Authority, which refer to the RAO, and would be likely to necessitate consequential changes to these. The overall effect might be to make the body of law of which the RAO is a part less rather than more clear to the regulated community.
<P>

<a name="11015w17.html_para6">Another disadvantage of re-making the entire order is that it would be difficult for readers to tell readily what had changed. Each time the order was remade the general reader would have to buy the complete new version.
<P>

<a name="11015w17.html_para7">Having consulted the industry and received its general support, we intend following standard practice and amending the RAO rather than completely re-making it, 



<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2001 : Column: 860W</I><P>
for changes to the RAO that do not involve a wholesale revision of the order. This will reduce the number of consequential amendments to other legislation (including FSA rules) as compared to remaking the entire order. To aid users of the order further we will provide an "unofficial" consolidated version on the HMT website, which will give the up-to-date version of the complete order as amended, at any given time. We will consider re-making the RAO only in the event of a wholesale revision of the order, and in such circumstances we would then take the opportunity to consolidate earlier orders amending the RAO.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what his Department's responsibilities are in relation to the environmental impact of <i>(a)</i> transport infrastructure development and <i>(b)</i> house building proposals.  [7879]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w20.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Proposals for transport infrastructure and housing development, which are likely to have significant effects on the environment come within the scope of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive (85/337/EEC as amended). The DTLR is the lead Department responsible for implementation of the Directive. The EIA procedure requires a developer to compile an Environmental Statement, which includes detailed information about the proposed development, the main effects it is likely to have on the environment, and the mitigation measures envisaged to deal with adverse effects. This information must be taken into account by the competent authority in reaching a decision on the proposal. For most projects falling within the scope of the Directive, for which planning permission is needed, the local planning authority is the competent authority, though in cases that are called in or subject to appeal the Secretary of State has to ensure compliance with EIA requirements. For some projects, for example proposals for new national roads, the Secretary of State is the competent authority.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what representations he has received regarding existing planning constraints on the development of farmers' markets.  [7864]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w20.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Department has received a range of representations on planning arrangements for the temporary use of land for purposes including farmers' markets. Part 4 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (GPDO) SI 1995 No 418 grants a general planning permission for the temporary use of land for up to 28 days in any calendar year, subject to a number of restrictions and conditions. In the case of markets, the permitted use is limited to a total of 14 days in recognition of the parking, litter and noise problems that often arise from such uses.
<P>

<a name="11015w20.html_para0">Guidance to planning authorities in PPG6 "Town Centres & Retail Developments" and PPG7 "The Countryside" encourage farm diversification and acknowledge that farm shops can help meet the demand for fresh produce as well as providing new sources of jobs and services in rural areas. Farmers' markets can also provide such a service. Farmers' markets have been established successfully throughout the country in recent years.

 The Commission, which is directly answerable to Parliament, has placed a copy of its full report on the 2001 parliamentary general election in the Library of the House and has provided all hon. Members with a summary copy of the report. The full report, as well as the Commission's overview of the election campaign, is also available on the Electoral Commission's website. It would not be appropriate for the Government to supplement the independent Commission's measures, which in any event it could do only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="11015w20.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 Earlier this month, I, together with the chairmen of the Electoral Commission and the Local Government Association, jointly invited local authorities to apply to run a wide range of innovative electoral pilot projects&#151;including all-postal voting and on-line voting&#151;to test new electoral procedures designed to increase the accessibility of voting and make it suit modern lifestyles more appropriately. Such changes to the method of voting should help to increase turnout, but only if, as the Electoral Commission has stated in its report on the 2001 general election,

 Vehicle excise duty evasion currently stands at 3.9 per cent. of revenue due (down from 4.1 per cent. in 1994). We have a number of measures in hand further to improve performance in this area.
<P>

<a name="11015w20.html_para2">As a result of the success of the wheelclamping scheme for VED evasion there are plans to expand this operation. In addition, last week the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency launched a scheme involving the use of mobile Automatic Number Plate Reader systems to detect and deter unlicensed vehicles on the move. DVLA is also working very closely with the police and local authorities to develop new methods for tackling the evasion problem.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what powers local authority planning officers have to require those proposing to convert existing buildings into flats to provide new shop fronts, pay for repairs to pavements and make a contribution towards local educational provision; and what powers local authority planning officers have to fix rents in respect of the new flats.  [7675]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w21.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as substituted by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991, a planning obligation may be agreed between a Local Planning Authority and a developer. A planning obligation may require or restrict specified activities to be carried out and may require payments to be made to the authority either in a single sum or periodically. Such obligations could therefore cover provision of new shop fronts; payment for repairs to pavements; contributions towards local education provisions; and the fixing of rents, if this amounted to a restriction on the use of land. However, planning obligations should only be sought where they are necessary to make a proposal acceptable in land-use planning terms. In addition, they must be: relevant to planning; directly related to the proposed development; fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the proposed development; and reasonable in all other respects.

 The information requested is not available. Planning applications and appeals are decided taking into account all of the relevant planning issues&#151;one of which may in some cases be human rights. The introduction of the Human Rights Act means that all public authorities, including central Government and local authorities, must act compatibly with convention rights. It is ultimately for the courts to decide whether an individual's human rights have been unfairly interfered with in a particular case.

 No planning applications were called in 1998 or 1999 in Hampshire on grounds relating to housing densities. In year 2000, two planning applications in Hampshire relating to the provision of housing were called in for the Secretary of State's decision. In both cases the Secretary of State indicated that he wished to be informed, among other things, about the relationship of the proposed development to Government policy in Planning Policy Guidance Note PPG3, in particular in respect of the proposed density of the development, the advice in the PPG on a sequential approach to brownfield/greenfield sites, car parking provision and the provision of affordable housing.

 In 1998 two planning appeals arising in Fareham borough council area were recovered for decision by the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. The average time taken for the Inspector to report to the Secretary of State was 78 days. The average time taken by the Secretary of State to decide the appeals once the Inspector had submitted his report was 46 days.

 We will study the judgment carefully before deciding what action may be necessary. The judgment cannot become final for at least three months. There will be no immediate changes to the present situation.

<a name="11015w21.html_para1">The Government are already in the process of commissioning a major study to reassess attitudes to aircraft noise, which will include further research into subjective responses to annoyance by night and by day. I refer my hon. Friend to the answer given by my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) on 8 May 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 41W, to the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Andy King). It would be premature to initiate further studies into any other aspects of night flights while we are considering the implications of this judgment.

 The average expenditure on capital improvements by council landlords in each year since 1997 are 1997&#150;98: &#163;446 (22 per cent. of dwellings received work), 1998&#150;99: &#163;490 (23 per cent. of dwellings received work), 1999&#150;2000: &#163;479 (23 per cent. of dwellings received work). 2000&#150;01 is &#163;627 (this is a provisional figure based on authorities planned expenditure). Corresponding data are not collected centrally from Registered Social Landlords. We announced our intention to end direct control of local authority borrowing as part of a wider move to reform the local authority capital finance system.

 The Secretary of State has considered whether to call-in the planning application at Ebley Wharf, Stroud district, against his policy for the use of call-in powers.

 The Supreme Court of Appeal of the Republic of Austria reported its decision on a case between Wulf-Dietrich Rose and Max Mobil on 26 April 2001. The case involved a claim for defamation and centres around the rules for freedom of expression. Planning Policy Guidance Note 8, 'Telecommunications' (PPG8) does not prevent freedom of expression. It is not therefore necessary to review PPG8 in the light of this case.

<a name="11015w22.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 &#163;52 million has been allocated in 2001&#150;02 to local authorities in England and the Audit Commission to cover the cost of best value audit and inspection. No reliable estimates exist as to the other administrative costs incurred by authorities in complying with their duty under the Local Government Act 1999. It is for individual authorities to decide how to allocate their resources to achieve improvements in performance and cost efficiency, sufficient to meet the 2 per cent. per annum cost efficiency target for local government as a whole against an annual budget in 2001&#150;02 of &#163;57 billion.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w22.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The introduction of local transport plans has been widely welcomed by local authorities. The Government expect that the move to five year plans, and the need to take a broader, more holistic view of planning transport in the context of related issues such as land use planning could produce cost savings and efficiency gains compared with the previous system of annual bidding.
<P>

<a name="11015w22.html_para8">Our Ten Year Plan for Transport provided a step change in investment for the implementation of local transport plans. Over the period of the Ten Year plan some &#163;19.3 billion of capital resources are available.

 National Air Traffic Services (NATS) remains committed to investing in the New Scottish Centre (NSC) at Prestwick as part of its two-centre strategy. However, the events of 11 September have led to a review of the phasing of NATS' capital investment plan, and my officials have been in close and continuing discussion with NATS and the Airline Group on these matters.
<P>

<a name="11015w23.html_para2">As a result of this review, and in the light of reduced traffic demand, the Government have agreed to a proposal to delay work on the NSC, which will result in a later operational date than originally planned. Work on the building will be suspended, following completion of the building design and piling contracts at the end of 2001. However, work will continue on evaluating systems solutions for this new centre. NATS will keep the position under review, and launch further work as soon as traffic forecasts make it prudent to do so.

 The local planning authority already has a statutory duty to advertise major development in a newspaper and either issue a site notice or notify neighbours.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w24.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 "Crown development" is the common usage term for development by or on behalf of the Crown on Crown land, and as such is not defined in statute.
<P>

<a name="11015w24.html_para1">"Crown land" is defined in section 293 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as land where there is a Crown interest or a Duchy interest. "Crown interest" means an interest belonging to Her Majesty in right of the Crown or belonging to a Government Department or held in trust for Her Majesty for the purposes of a Government Department. "Duchy interest" means an interest belonging to Her Majesty in right of the Duchy of Lancaster or belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall.
<P>

<a name="11015w24.html_para2">There is no special meaning attached to "crown development" in relation to infrastructure projects.

 The regional chambers were designated by the Secretary of State following the establishment of Regional Development Agencies in 1999. They have been established voluntarily by bodies representing the interests of each region. Their running costs are a matter for the chambers and their members. The Government have however, allocated &#163;500,000 this year to each regional chamber, with an additional &#163;1 million for chambers to use collectively, to help them establish a stronger strategic and scrutiny role within the regions.

 My Department has undertaken a review of the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre, which has been an Executive Agency since 1989. The review considered all the organisational aspects for the agency, taking into account its role and past performance, its fit with wider objectives, and the relationship with other bodies in the public and private sectors. Staff and trade unions have been consulted as part of the review.

However, the Government have held regular meetings with both sides of the bus and coach industry to discuss the impact of the proposals on those parts of the industry which they will affect.

 From our regular meetings with industry, we are fully aware of the problem that an eight-hour limit for night workers is likely to have on daytime congestion. That is why the Government support the 10-hour limit included in the Council's common position.

<P>
<a name="11015w25.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In March of last year, the Government published their road safety strategy and casualty reduction targets for 2010 with the document "Tomorrow's roads: safer for everyone". At the same time, the Highways Agency published a Strategic Plan for improving safety on the trunk road network in England. The documents describe the measures to improve road safety that will be a mixture of education, engineering and enforcement measures.
<P>

<a name="11015w25.html_para2">The Government's current targeted programme of improvements to trunk roads contains proposals for some 25 bypasses that will remove through traffic, particularly heavy goods vehicles, from towns and villages. Additional schemes may well be added as a result of the programme of multi-modal studies currently being undertaken. The Government have also given the go-ahead for a further 23 bypass schemes on local authority roads in the last two years as part of the Local Transport Settlement. Bids for further schemes are currently being considered and decisions will be announced in December.

 As set out in our manifesto, we will make it easier for people buying and selling homes through a seller's pack. This will provide at the very start of the process information needed to enable home buyers and sellers to make informed decisions, and assist transactions to proceed smoothly. The seller's pack will reduce significantly the period between offer acceptance and exchange of contracts, thereby narrowing the window during which gazumping, gazundering and other problems can occur.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what measures are in place to ensure that a harbour authority's powers and duties are not exercised to the detriment of other users or otherwise unfairly, where that harbour authority is also the dominant user of a harbour.  [7192]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w25.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Harbour authorities derive their duties and powers from local and national legislation. Parliament has conferred those duties and powers in a way that strikes a balance between the two and it is incumbent upon harbour authorities to exercise them reasonably. There is no special provision for ports where the harbour authority is also a shipping operator. Parliament has not given my Department any general powers of oversight in respect of harbour authorities' functions.
<P>

<a name="11015w25.html_para6">One important duty, almost invariably incorporated in local legislation, is commonly called the "the open port duty". This provides that upon payment of ship, passenger and goods dues the harbour shall be open to all persons for the shipping and unshipping of goods, and the embarking and landing of passengers. Although these dues may be set as the authority sees fit, they are subject to a statutory right of objection under section 31 of the

 It is already open to sellers and buyers of homes in England to follow the Scottish arrangements if they wish. This does not require a change in the law. It is also worth noting that these arrangements are not mandatory in Scotland, but have become established by custom and practice.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (1) if he will list those local authorities which have applied to HM Treasury for moneys to pay off overhanging housing debt; and if he will list those local authorities which <i>(a)</i> have received such moneys since May 1997 and <i>(b)</i> will receive such moneys pending residents' voting in favour of housing stock transfers;  [7739]

<P>
<a name="11015w27.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 A stock transfer proposal from a local authority with overhanging housing debt is required to meet the same criteria as other applicant authorities in order to obtain a place on the Large Scale Voluntary Transfer (LSVT) Programme and, if tenants support the proposal, the Secretary of State's consent to transfer. The receipt from the transfer must be sufficient to meet the premium payable to the Public Works Loan Board (PWLB) for early repayment of the authority's PWLB debt.
<P>

<a name="11015w27.html_para3">To date, four one-off payments have been made by the Exchequer to meet overhanging housing debt. In 1999&#150;2000 a payment was made to Burnley borough council. In 2000&#150;01 payments were made to Coventry city council, Calderdale borough council and Blackburn with Darwen borough council.

I have held open a place on the 2001&#150;02 Programme for Birmingham city council, subject to agreeing its stock valuation. If Birmingham is accepted onto the programme, it too will require a one-off payment from the Department.

 Second home owners are presently entitled to a 50 per cent. council tax discount. If all had been required to pay the full council tax in 2001&#150;02, we estimate that an additional amount of approximately &#163;80 million would have been raised. Accurate figures for individual local authority areas are not available.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what discussions his Department has had with the Department for International Development on policies to support the rural economy in Kosovo to help reduce the pressure of economic migration to <i>(a)</i> the UK and <i>(b)</i> other countries in the European Union.

 Our Departments have engaged in extensive discussion on all aspects of the Kosovo crisis. In 1999&#150;2000 the United Kingdom committed &#163;110 million to humanitarian assistance, including support to Kosovan refugees in neighbouring countries. In January 2000 it was agreed the UK would commit a further &#163;5 million a year to a longer-term programme of technical assistance, including mine clearance and improvements to community infrastructure. We also participate in the work of the European Commission, which focuses on helping to restart the rural community, including by providing agricultural inputs and audits for farmers and other rural workers.
<P>

<a name="11015w28.html_para1">The aim of the Government's engagement in the Balkans is to promote peace and stability and alleviate poverty in the region. Providing stability and economic opportunities for the people of Kosovo is an essential pre-requisite to reducing emigration pressures.

 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> Provisional information shows that on 31 August 2001 there were 30 life sentence prisoners in prisons in Wales, and 4,925 in prisons in England. Of the 30 in prisons in Wales, provisional information shows that 21 were committed at courts in England, and of those in prisons in England 193 were committed in courts in Wales.
<P>

<a name="11015w28.html_para3">There are no data held centrally of the last place of residence for a prisoner before they were sent to prison in England and Wales. Offenders tend to be sentenced in a court nearest to their place of residence so the numbers give an approximation of whether the last place of residence was in England or Wales. Data on requests for transfers are not held centrally by the Prison Service.

 We have no current plans to modify the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 following developments in genetic modification. The Act provides that all use of the animals covered by its licensing controls must be justified, and that consequent animal suffering should be minimised. The terms of the Act are sufficiently broad and flexible to take account of scientific developments, without compromising the protection it affords to the animals concerned.
<P>

<a name="11015w29.html_para0">No specific guidance has been issued on the assessment of applications under the 1986 Act to produce animals by nuclear transfer cloning, though general guidance to applicants applies as much to this area of scientific research as to any other. All such applications are however considered at a central point within the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate. This ensures consistency of approach and identifies any cases that may need to be drawn to the attention of Ministers, who may seek further advice as required from the Animal Procedures Committee (APC), external assessors and others.
<P>

<a name="11015w29.html_para1">We have no plans at present for consultation on the subject of genetic modification of non-human primates. No applications to conduct such work have so far been made under the 1986 Act&#151;either to produce such animals in the United Kingdom or to use such animals imported from elsewhere. Any applications would be considered in the light of advice from the Inspectorate and the APC.

 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> The only capital project currently under way at Her Majesty's Prison Swansea is the replacement of the central heating boilers.

 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> The contractors running privately managed prisons are financially penalised in the form of deductions from the fee payable to them by the Prison Service. There have been 36 occasions on which deductions have been made; these are listed in the tables for each of the five prisons which have incurred deductions, together with the amounts, reasons and dates. The five remaining privately managed prisons have not incurred deductions: Ashfield, Doncaster, Dovegate, Forest Bank and Rye Hill prisons. Buckley Hall prison transferred to Prison Service management on 26 June 2000; a fine of &#163;526 was deducted in February 1997 for performance points while under private management.

<a name="11015w29.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> There are three ways in which contractors can incur financial penalties. The contracts for privately managed prisons require the contractor to operate to a range of standards measuring the performance of the prison. Failure to reach any of these standards results in the accumulation of penalty points; the number of points incurred depends on the seriousness of the failure. If these accumulated penalty points exceed a specified threshold, financial penalties are imposed by means of deductions from the fee payable to the contractor. There is an upper limit to the level of financial penalties that can be imposed. In some contracts an escape attracts a fixed fine.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the management of the Prison Service facilities for juveniles and young adults.  [6376]<P>

<P>
<a name="11015w30.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 From April 2000, the Youth Justice Board took responsibility for commissioning and purchasing all secure accommodation including Prison Service accommodation for children and young persons sentenced to custody.
<P>

<a name="11015w30.html_para2">The creation of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales sees for the first time a single organisation with oversight and responsibility for the care and well-being of 10 to 17-year-old offenders. The board's purpose is to monitor the operation of the youth justice system, to identify and promote good practice and to advise the Home Secretary how to deliver the statutory aim of preventing offending by children and young people. The board is also responsible for commissioning services for young offenders in secure facilities.
<P>

<a name="11015w30.html_para3">In response to these changes the Prison Service has created a new distinct estate for 15 to 17-year-old boys, comprising both designated juvenile units in young offender institutions. For the first time, the vast majority of under-18s are held in dedicated under-18 establishments, or in dedicated under-18 living units within other establishments.
<P>

<a name="11015w30.html_para4">As part of the Juvenile Estate three special units have been opened at Castington, Huntercombe and Hollesley Bay offering enhanced regimes for the more vulnerable boys who have been convicted of serious offences and have been given longer sentences under section 90 or 91 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (formerly section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933).
<P>

<a name="11015w30.html_para5">Improvements are being made to the quality of accommodation, the level of care and to regime standards. The new regimes are underpinned by a Prison Service Order (PSO 4950), which defines the principles upon which governors must build and operate regimes.
<P>

<a name="11015w30.html_para6">From 1 April 2001, a new Operational Manager (Assistant Director, Juveniles) has taken direct responsibility within the Prison Service for the operational management of four establishments holding juveniles (Ashfield, Huntercombe, Werrington and Wetherby) and for the regimes and performance of the juvenile side of young offender institutions holding both juveniles and young offenders.
<P>

<a name="11015w30.html_para7">There is a manifesto commitment to build on the Government's youth justice reforms to improve the standard of custodial accommodation and offending programmes for 18 to 20-year-olds. I am currently considering with others what is needed for young adult offenders and how best to deliver it.

 Two key objectives of the police reform programme are to ensure modern working practices and the highest standards of detective capability.

Issues about how the reform process might be used to develop the part civilians play within policing remain under discussion with representatives of the service.

 In a report published on 26 July, the then Chief Inspector of Prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham, rightly criticised the poor regime at Feltham B and compared it to that for under 18-year-old prisoners at Feltham A, which had benefited from major investment to meet Youth Justice Board standards.

 Following extensive consultation with the police, communities and other key stakeholders, we have agreed in principle to accept recommendation 61 of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report, which was that all police "stops" and "searches" should be recorded and a record given to the person stopped. We have asked the stop and search sub-group of the Lawrence Steering Group to draw up detailed implementation plans for this recommendation and to finalise the definition of a stop for recording purposes. We have particularly asked them to have regard to minimising the burden on police officers.

 Meditation is one of a limited number of complementary therapies which Prison Service establishments were instructed in 1998 could be made available to individual prisoners on the recommendation of the prison doctor, strictly for health reasons. When drawing up the relevant instruction the Prison Service took advice from the Department of Health. The Prison Service has made no formal assessment of the benefits to prisoners of meditation practices since that instruction was issued.

 The production of genetically modified animals (as well as their use in experiments or other scientific procedures) is controlled under the terms of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The production and use of such animals allows new areas of medical and other scientific research to be explored; provides the potential for investigating a wide variety of conditions including cancer, cystic fibrosis and multiple sclerosis; and allows the quality of the science in many areas of research and testing to be improved.
<P>

<a name="11015w33.html_para0">Table 3 of the Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals Great Britain 2000 (Cm 5244) provides comprehensive data on scientific procedures by species of animal, primary purpose (including breeding) and genetic status. Paragraph 12 of the Introductory Notes to the statistics explains that details of procedures on animals in foetal, larval or embryonic form are collected but not enumerated because it may be impracticable in some cases to count such procedures.
<P>

<a name="11015w33.html_para1">Foetal deaths in the species that are commonly genetically modified are difficult or impossible to enumerate as a result of resorption of the foetal material and there may be no outward sign that this has happened. It may never have been established that the animal was pregnant, it will not have been known how many embryos were conceived, nor how many reached halfway through gestation. It would not therefore be feasible to collect the information in question. Embryonic forms do not become protected animals under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 until they are beyond halfway through gestation.

 The Government intend to bring forward proposals to amend the law on incitement to racial hatred, as my hon. Friend suggests, to remove the existing limitation in the law which means that only hatred directed at a group of persons in Great Britain is covered by the offences.
<P>

<a name="11015w34.html_para0">The Government have also announced their intention to propose this change as part of a package of measures to strengthen the incitement to racial hatred provisions contained in Part III of the Public Order Act 1986 and in particular to extend those provisions to the incitement to religious hatred.

 The efficiency of the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) in delivering its operations is kept under review by its senior management who report to Ministers as necessary.

<P>

<a name="11015w34.html_para1">As a part of the Home Office, NASS is accountable to Ministers for what it does. It also is open to scrutiny by the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee.

 A major refurbishment of older prisoner accommodation at the prison will begin early next year. This programme of work is due for completion in late 2003. Long Lartin has recently been granted Department of Health funding to allow a small unit to be constructed within the prison to cater for the mental health needs of prisoners. Funding has also been provided to allow Long Lartin to designate a small number of cells in the segregation unit for monitoring and support of prisoners who have refused to co-operate with the Close Supervision Centre system for disruptive prisoners.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what recent changes have been made to the method of calculation of compensation to be awarded to victims of miscarriages of justice; if he will place a document setting out the Independent Assessor's approach in the Library; what measures he will take to ensure that victims may benefit proportionately from these changes; and how many people are awaiting settlement of compensation claims.  [7081]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w34.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 In calculating the amount of compensation to be awarded to victims of miscarriages of justice, the independent assessor applies principles analogous to those governing the assessment of damages for civil wrongs. He must, therefore, give effect to any developments which may occur in the law and have regard to such judicial authority as there may be at the time of making an assessment. To that extent, the background against which he has to assess compensation 



<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2001 : Column: 928W</I><P>
is changing all the time. There has recently been a change of assessor (Lord Daniel Brennan succeeded Sir David Calcutt with effect from 27 July) but that does not mean that there has been a change in how compensation is calculated because, whoever is the assessor, the same principles will be applied.
<P>

<a name="11015w34.html_para4">The basis on which compensation is assessed is made clear in statute (section 133(4A) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988); in the Home office "Compensation for Miscarriages of Justice&#151;Note for Successful Applicants" (copies of which have already been placed in the Library); and in individual Assessments.
<P>

<a name="11015w34.html_para5">As at 20 September 2001 there were 112 cases where a decision had been made to pay compensation but for a variety of reasons the claim had yet to be settled. These range from the many cases where successful applicants have yet to submit the details of their claims to the few where a final assessment has been made but not yet accepted.

<a name="11015w34.html_sbhd8"><H4><center>Strip Searches (Holloway)</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w34.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department by what method the number of strip searches is recorded at HMP Holloway; how many searches carried out in <i>(a)</i> the last year and <i>(b)</i> each of the previous five years; and what items of (i) contraband and (ii) other confiscated items have been recorded in each year.  [7080]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w34.html_spnew9"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The available information on the number of searches is set out in the table. Prisoners are required to undergo strip searches in a number of circumstances, including whenever they pass through reception on their way into or out of prison establishments; prior to providing a sample of urine for a mandatory drugs test (MDT); and in connection with routine and targeted strip searches. A percentage of prisoners are strip searched before and after visits, and prisoners may also be strip searched at any time when it is believed that they may be concealing unauthorised articles. Prisoners in the Health Care Centre and Detox Units at Holloway prison may also be strip searched if staff believe they may be concealing articles which could be used to harm themselves or others.
<P>

<a name="11015w34.html_para6">In my written answer on 3 July 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 99W, to my hon. Friend, I referred to the consideration being given to upgrading the prisoner database to provide statistical recording and monitoring of strip searches. That work is still continuing. In the meantime, the position at Holloway is that a register is maintained of strip searches associated with visits. A separate register is maintained of prisoners undergoing MDT. Cell searches are recorded on the appropriate form. However, while movement through reception will be recorded against the individual prisoner's record on the Local Inmate Database System, there is no requirement to record strip searches conducted in reception.
<P>

<a name="11015w34.html_para7">It is not possible to identify the unauthorised articles for every find, but the principal finds at Holloway have been of drugs and tablets, tobacco, jewellery, telephone cards, cash, confectionery and unauthorised correspondence. In 1998 and 2000, there were also instances of weapons being discovered in searches prior to MDT.

No reliable information is available on the achievement of National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) specifically, or for qualifications achieved in the period before 2000. The Prisoners' Learning and Skills Unit located in the Department for Education and Skills will be implementing new procedures next year to capture this kind of information.

 We do not know of any research that has been conducted specifically to identify the incidence of drug-induced psychosis among mentally ill prisoners in England and Wales. Information about rates of psychosis in the prison population as a whole is contained in the report, "Psychiatric Morbidity Among Prisoners", published by the Office For National Statistics in 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what arrangements are in place to plan and monitor the prison career of non-life-sentenced prisoners.  [7188]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w35.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 In 1992, the Prison Service introduced the current sentence planning arrangements for non-life-sentenced prisoners. Sentence plans are now prepared for all adult prisoners serving sentences of 12 months or more (with at least six months to serve post sentence) and all young offenders with at least one month to serve post sentence. Life sentenced prisoners have their own sentence planning system. Juveniles (under 18s) have equivalent training plans.
<P>

<a name="11015w35.html_para16">The Prison Service sentence planning system is designed to co-ordinate the efforts of different individuals and agencies involved with the prisoner. It is used to help prepare prisoners for safe release and to make best use of the prisoner's time. It does this by encouraging them to address the reasons for their offending behaviour and by giving planned experience of work, training and education. Targets are set and progress reviewed at specified intervals. All prisoners involved in sentence planning are subject to a period of supervision under licence by the probation service after release.
<P>

<a name="11015w35.html_para17">Short-sentence prisoners, not covered by sentence planning, are still subject to various assessments. All prisoners have a health care assessment on reception and then, during induction, staff will begin to assess prisoners for drug treatment needs, education and resettlement needs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the costs and benefits of <i>(a)</i> maintaining the courts martial system and <i>(b)</i> maintaining services disciplinary processes while transferring criminal cases to the ordinary courts.  [7405]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w37.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The system of military law, delivered through the Services' disciplinary processes which include courts martial, upholds the discipline structure inherent throughout the armed forces, and underpins tri-Service doctrine and the military chain of command that are both necessary for good order and operational effectiveness to be maintained. The military courts martial system has the statutory power and capability to deal with all but the most serious of criminal cases in the UK, subject to discussion over jurisdiction rights with appropriate civilian law agencies. Overseas, the military courts martial system has the power to deal with all military and civilian criminal cases, subject to agreement with the local authorities over jurisdiction rights. The benefit of transferring the most serious criminal cases to the ordinary courts allows a balance to be maintained between the military and civilian judicial systems. The costs of service courts martial accrue across the entire military system and are part of the running costs of each of the Services. It is therefore not possible to quote a figure separately for the military courts martial system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w37.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The system for administering discipline in the armed forces is kept under review, with the principal vehicle for any legislative changes that may be necessary being the five-yearly Armed Forces Acts. The Armed Forces Act 1996 made substantial changes in order to reinforce the independence of courts martial, and these came into effect on 1 April 1997. Further changes on this scale were not considered necessary as a result of the most recent review, which led to the Armed Forces Act 2001, not least because the procedures introduced in 1997 have worked very well.
<P>

<a name="11015w37.html_para0">We have announced the intention to replace the present legislative framework for the armed forces, particularly the separate discipline Acts for each of the three services, with a single tri-service Act.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence who decides the priority of need in <i>(a)</i> the upgrade programme and <i>(b)</i> the routine maintenance programme at the Larkhill married quarters estate.  [7371]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w37.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The assessment of need for routine maintenance is undertaken at Defence Housing Executive (DHE) Area level. In-house teams are advised by our professional establishment works consultants and works services managers in formulating the forward maintenance plan. DHE staff also undertake regular discussions with local families through the Larkhill Resident's Association and through our regular meetings with the Garrison staff.
<P>

<a name="11015w37.html_para1">Assessment of upgrade requirement is undertaken on a DHE regional basis (Larkhill is within DHE South West Region covering all properties west of Andover) by the regional controller and her team. Regional recommendations are then judged by DHE HQ staff against competing priorities across the entire married quarter estate in Great Britain. The services are consulted throughout.

 The condition of married quarters is assessed against the criteria of standards, one to four. At present the core long-term estate at Larkhill has 67 properties at standard 1 for condition, 314 at standard 2, 142 at standard 3 and 49 at standard 4.

[7366]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w37.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Planned maintenance programmes extend to 10 years and with the help of Establishment Works Consultants and Works Services Managers, Defence Housing Executive's property managers determine comprehensive schedules of work. These items are then categorised for relative priority against other maintenance requirements (with health and safety issues given highest priority). If gutters, downpipes, underground pipes, drain covers and garden fences, among other items, are not assessed as requiring attention for health and safety reasons they will not necessarily attract high priority although they will be included in planned maintenance programmes for the future.

<a name="11015w37.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 DHE's overall works budget of &#163;155 million in 2001&#150;02 is negotiated within the Department's overall process for future planning and resource allocation. Funds are bid for against (a) upgrade projects and (b) planned and response repairs. DHE's Areas and Regions produce planned maintenance programmes for a minimum of three years ahead and funds secured are delegated to Regions and thence the Areas according to a number of factors including numbers and condition of properties and levels of statutory and mandatory work. Area Property Managers manage expenditure using the services of a commercially contracted Works Services Management company. However, upgrade funding is managed from defence Housing Executive HQ and delegated with final approval of upgrade projects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w37.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 In 1996, its first year of operation, the Defence Housing Executive (DHE) estimated that the upgrade programme could be completed by 2003, subject to a full housing survey. The subsequent survey, completed in 1998, revealed that the extent of the work required was considerably more than originally estimated. It was therefore agreed that DHE would be set an achievable but challenging key target of achieving Standard 1 for Condition for core properties by November 2005. This target has been in place since 1998&#150;99.

The latest figures available, for August 2001, indicate that 529 properties were overdue for testing. This is due to problems with gaining access to carry out the necessary inspections.

The matter was reviewed in 1998 by the then Minister for the armed forces who found no evidence that he believed would enable him to persuade the Committee on the Grant of Honours Decorations and Medals to overturn their policy of non-retrospection, or to revoke any of the decisions made at the time or following various departmental reviews since 1990. No such evidence has since come to light.

 Ministry of Defence employees work in some 200 grades which are grouped together into five bands for pay, promotion and career development purposes. Normal retirement age is dependant upon grade, and an extract from MOD's Personnel Manual follows which lists them.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your questions to the Secretary of State for Defence on the British Army's next generation anti-armour weapon programme. The programme to which you refer is the Next Generation Light anti-Armour Weapon, known as NLAW. These matters fall within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The companies, which have submitted bids to meet this requirement, are SAAB Bofors Dynamics AB and Matra BAe Dynamics (UK) Ltd. Neither are wholly UK owned companies, however, Matra BAe Dynamics (UK) Ltd. is a UK registered company jointly owned by BAE Systems and EADs. BAE Systems also have a shareholding in SAAB Bofors Dynamics parent company.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The final cost of the NLAW contract is subject to negotiation, but it is expected to be in the order of &#163;400m. The tender closing date was 21 September 2001 and it is anticipated that the contract will be let next year. The contract could run for up to 25 years, if all the in-service support options are selected, but it is expected that the Development and Production elements will be complete by 2009.</FONT></UL>

 MBT-LAW is one of the competitors to meet the Next Generation Light anti-armour weapon (NLAW) requirement. The preferred bidder will be announced next year, and a contract let shortly afterwards. We currently anticipate this system being ready for service in 2006&#150;07. The final cost of the NLAW contract is subject to negotiation but it is expected to be in the order of &#163;400 million.

<a name="11015w39.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many soldiers have <i>(a)</i> died and <i>(b)</i> been injured as a result of firearms discharged on army property since the IRA ceasefire; on what dates; what the results were of (i) internal investigations and (ii) coroner's inquests in each case; where other soldiers were involved, what disciplinary measures were taken; where papers were passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions, how long he took to reach a decision on prosecution and what the result was.  [7082]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w39.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There were no deaths or injuries in 1994 as a result of firearms discharged on Army property in Northern Ireland since the IRA ceasefire of 31 August.
<P>

<a name="11015w39.html_para2">In 1995 there were three deaths which occurred on 21 June, 13 September and 25 September. The Coroner's verdict was that each soldier died as a result of a gunshot wound to the head. One injury occurred on 26 December. It is not normal practice to comment on the result of internal investigations or any resultant disciplinary action as this is a personal matter for the parties involved. However, I can confirm that one other soldier was involved in this injury and the matter was resolved under military jurisdiction. No papers were passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
<P>

<a name="11015w39.html_para3">In 1996 one death occurred on 20 July. The Coroner's verdict stated that the death was consistent with a bullet wound to the chest. There were no injuries in that year. It is not normal practice to comment on the result of internal investigations. No papers were passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions.




<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2001 : Column: 948W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11015w39.html_para4">There was one death in 1997 which occurred on 3 September. The verdict of the Coroner was that death was consistent with a bullet wound to the chest. There were also two injuries that year. These occurred on 9 and 16 August. It is not normal practice to comment on the result of internal investigations or any resultant disciplinary action as this is a personal matter for the parties involved. However, I can confirm that two soldiers were questioned regarding the incident on 9 August under military jurisdiction. No papers were passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
<P>

<a name="11015w39.html_para5">There were no deaths or injuries in 1998.
<P>

<a name="11015w39.html_para6">In 1999 there were no injuries but one death occurred on 23 November. The circumstances surrounding the death have yet to be heard in the Coroner's Court. It is not normal practice to comment on the result of internal investigations. No papers were passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
<P>

<a name="11015w39.html_para7">There were no deaths or injuries in 2000.
<P>

<a name="11015w39.html_para8">Up until 31 September 2001 two deaths were recorded. These were on 25 January and 30 July. The circumstances surrounding the first death is under consideration by the Director of Public Prosecutions and both deaths are awaiting a Coroner's Inquest. It is not normal practice to comment on the result of internal investigations. There were no injuries during that period.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w39.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will publish, for every year since the first paramilitary ceasefires for which it is possible <i>(a)</i> figures on the frequency and duration of (i) military and (ii) other helicopter flights, <i>(b)</i> the number of civilian complaints and amount of compensation paid during this period in relation to such flights and <i>(c)</i> the steps taken to scale down military presence according to perceived terrorist threat; and if he will set out the means by which he informs himself of the nature and purpose of each helicopter flight and monitors the progressive reduction of flights.

<sup>(48)</sup> This figure differs from that which was given on 3 November 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 442W. It has become clear that, due to the wide variety of agencies dealing with helicopter complaints, there was an element of duplication in the figures provided earlier. The number of complaints has been revised to take account of this. <P>

<a name="11015w39.html_para11">Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement a number of steps have been taken to scale down the level of helicopter activity. Since March 1999 Chinook and Sea King helicopters have been rear based on the Mainland. The operational profile has been altered to minimise intrusion, which includes operating at greater altitudes to reduce noise and modifying approach paths to avoid built-up area where topography and weather conditions permit. Also no helicopters are flown between 2300 hours and 0600 hours, except when operationally essential.
<P>

<a name="11015w39.html_para12">The General Officer Commanding Northern Ireland keeps the use of helicopters constantly under review and steps are taken, where possible, to reduce the helicopter profile. However, this is dependent on the security situation and the threat posed by terrorists. As can be seen from the table on flying hours there has been an increase in the year 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2001 which can be attributed to the increased terrorist threat from Dissident Republicans.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what response he has made to the 8th annual report of the Independent Assessor of Military Complaints with particular reference to the recommendations of the report <i>(a)</i> to take steps to reduce the number of complaints about helicopters and to make pilots aware of the costs of compensation claims, <i>(b)</i> to carry out an independent evaluation of community awareness training and <i>(c)</i> to take steps to promote the informal resolution of complaints.

 The Independent Assessor of Military Complaints submits his report to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland as required by Section 98 and Schedule 11 to the Terrorism Act 2000. In the last couple of his reports the Independent Assessor has concentrated on helicopter complaints which is understandable given the continued need for the use of helicopters owing to the terrorist threat from Dissident Republicans.

compensation awards as a result of helicopter activity are now sent to the Commander of the Joint Helicopter Force (Northern Ireland) so that pilots can be made aware of the financial impact their actions can have. Headquarters Northern Ireland (HQNI) are also considering how best the Community Awareness Training might be evaluated by an independent body and are looking at a number of agencies that may be able to carry out this task. The emphasis on informal resolution of complaints remains a priority for HQNI and they continue to work closely with the Civil Representatives from the Northern Ireland Office in achieving this goal.

<P>
<a name="11015w40.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 19 July 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 334&#150;5W, to my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones) in which I advised the House that, in parallel with the work on the Defence Training Review, the Naval Recruiting and Training Agency had conducted a comprehensive review of its training estate. As a result, work has been started on the development of the Integrated Maritime Warfare School at HMS Collingwood, in Fareham, which will deliver maritime warfare training from a single site and encompass the warfare training currently undertaken at HMS Dryad. Under this programme, as I advised the House at the time, HMS Dryad will become surplus to requirements.
<P>

<a name="11015w40.html_para1">The target date for closure is no later than 2011, but it is planned to transfer elements of training from HMS Dryad to HMS Collingwood progressively over the next few years, with a view to achieving an earlier closure if possible. This will help us to maximise the operational and financial benefits from the Naval Recruiting and Training Agency's estate rationalisation programme. While the closure of Dryad is expected to result in a reduction of some 70 Service and 40 MOD civilian posts in the NRTA, this will be more than offset by the proposed move of elements of Fleet to HMS Excellent, which will take place before the closure of HMS Dryad. Taken together these two proposals are expected to produce a net increase of about 25 Service and 60 civilian posts in the Portsmouth area.
<P>

<a name="11015w40.html_para2">Detailed proposals for all the above measures will be subject to normal consultative procedures at the appropriate time.

 The Ministry of Defence research contracts currently account for 35 per cent. of QinetiQ's income. A further 44 per cent. of QinetiQ's income comes from other non-research work such as project support work for the Defence Procurement Agency and technical advice to the operational commands. The balance of QinetiQ's income is from non-MOD sources including commercial customers. It would not be in the commercial interests of the company, or the Government as future vendor, to release detailed financial information at this stage in the PPP process.

 The medium-wave infra-red telescope is part of a Ministry of Defence research programme begun in the early 1990s designed to understand the phenomenology of aircraft infra-red signatures and investigate detector technologies. The telescope is owned by the MOD and operated by QinetiQ.

 The centre cost in the order of &#163;462,000 to set up and was formed by co-locating existing research capabilities, facilities and equipment from QinetiQ laboratories at Winfrith and Bincleaves into one building on the Winfrith site. The figure does not include the past investment in equipment which has been co-located.

 The Ministry of Defence has no special plans to agree compensation provisions for fishermen excluded from the fishing grounds in Luce Bay, Wigtownshire.

Where there is a legal liability to pay compensation, we do so.

<a name="11015w42.html_para0">One claim for compensation has been received from a fisherman alleging a loss of earnings caused by his exclusion from fishing grounds in Luce Bay. On investigation, it was determined that in excluding this individual from the area for reasons of safety, the range authorities were acting within their legal rights as laid down in the relevant local bye-laws. As a result, liability was denied and no compensation has been paid.

Prior to the establishment of the RAF Prosecuting Authority in 1997, some legal officers, particularly in overseas locations, combined a small amount of court martial work with other duties. It is estimated that the number of RAF legal support staff has remained constant at approximately 13 (one NCO and 12 civilians) for each of the dates requested.

Safety is managed by trained staff using GPS, cellular phone and terrain data base technology. Any death or injury is, of course, a matter of great regret, but our safety record in Canada&#151;as elsewhere&#151;is good.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what discussions he has had with his counterparts in <i>(a)</i> NATO and <i>(b)</i> the European Union on the United Kingdom's response to the events in the USA on 11 September; and if he will make a statement.  [7170]<P>

<a name="11015w43.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We are committed to pursuing concrete steps to counter terrorism in a number of international forums, and continue to meet overseas colleagues as part of the effort to build a strong international coalition against terrorism. In particular, I have met with NATO and EU colleagues on a number of occasions since 11 September, including during the NATO and EU informal ministerial meetings in Brussels on 26 September and 12 October respectively, to discuss measures to be taken in response to the attacks on the United States.
<P>

<a name="11015w43.html_para9">For the first time in its history, NATO has invoked article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty, which states that an armed attack on one ally is an attack on all. Allies have now agreed material assistance to the US in response to the 11 September outrages, including the deployment of AWACS early warning aircraft and the Standing Naval Force Mediterranean.
<P>

<a name="11015w43.html_para10">The EU Special Council on 21 September agreed to co-operate with the US in bringing to justice and punishing the perpetrators of the 11 September attacks, and approved a set of measures to combat terrorism, including enhancing police and judicial co-operation, developing international legal instruments, putting an end to the funding of terrorism and strengthening air security. The General Affairs Council on 8 October confirmed that all partners strongly support the US and UK military action.

 NATO, as an organisation, has not participated in attacks on terrorist targets in Afghanistan. The alliance has, however, invoked article 5 of the Washington treaty, which states that an armed attack on

one ally is an attack on all, in response to the 11 September terrorist attacks. This is the strongest possible message that NATO allies stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States in response to these outrages. Further to a request from the US, allies have agreed to take 8 measures in support of the US response to the terrorist attacks, including deployment of AWACS early warning aircraft to the United States.

 Ministers have made no formal assessment. However, the Independent Monitor for entry clearance refusals without the right of appeal has a remit to review refusals of family visit visas up to 2 October 2000, when the right of appeal for this category of visitor was reintroduced. He will present his conclusions later this year in his annual report to my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, who will lay a copy of the report in both Houses.

 We are committed to pursuing concrete steps to counter terrorism in a number of international fora, including the UN, NATO and the European Union. As the Prime Minister said in the House of Commons on 4 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 671&#150;75, he and the Foreign Secretary have been in intensive contact with foreign leaders from every part of the world over the past few weeks. The Prime Minister visited Berlin, Paris, New York and Washington on 19&#150;21 September; Moscow, Islamabad and New Delhi on 4&#150;6 October; and Oman and Cairo on 10&#150;12 October; and the Foreign Secretary visited Jordan, Iran, Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt on 24&#150;27 September as part of the effort to build a strong international coalition against terrorism.
<P>

<a name="11015w46.html_para3">We are also taking action in international institutions:
<P>

<a name="11015w46.html_para4">UN Security Council resolution 1368 was adopted on 12 September. The Council unanimously expressed its readiness to take all necessary steps in response to the attacks. The resolution also stated that the Council would hold accountable those indirectly responsible for these acts&#151;those who aid, support or harbour the perpetrators&#151;as well as those directly responsible. On 28 September, the Council adopted resolution 1373, which contained a series of measures to tackle the roots of terrorism. In particular, it stated that all countries should target terrorist finances and ensure that no safe haven is provided to any known terrorist organisations.
<P>

<a name="11015w46.html_para5">Also on 12 September, the North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed that if the attack against the US was directed from abroad it should be regarded as an action covered by Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Article 5 is the collective self-defence commitment at the core of NATO, under which the Parties agree that an 



<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2001 : Column: 973W</I><P>
armed attack against one or more of them shall be considered an attack against them all. On 2 October the US briefed the NAC on the results of their investigations. Lord Robertson, the NATO Secretary General, concluded that it was now clear that the attack had been directed from overseas and that Article 5 was therefore now operational. This is the first time in the history of NATO that Article 5 has been invoked, and is the strongest possible signal of Allied solidarity in the face of the attacks on the US. NATO's North Atlantic Council has now agreed material assistance to the US, including the use of AWACS early warning aircraft.
<P>

<a name="11015w46.html_para6">The Heads of State and Government of the European Union at the Special European Council on 21 September expressed their total support of the American people in the face of the deadly terrorist attacks. They agreed to co-operate with the US in bringing to justice and punishing the perpetrators, sponsors and accomplices of such barbaric acts. The Council also approved a concrete set of measures to combat terrorism, including enhancing police and judicial co-operation, developing international legal instruments, putting an end to the funding of terrorism and strengthening aviation security. The General Affairs Council on 8 October confirmed the EU's strong support for US and UK military action.

 My right hon.

I frequently raise the importance of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy with European Union and other Governments, as do other members of the Government including the Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
<P>

<a name="11015w47.html_para2">Our goals are reduction of the costs of the Common Agricultural Policy and better delivery of policy outcomes. We want to reduce the overall burden of the Common Agricultural Policy, align European Union and world prices more closely, and target support measures on the rural economy and the environment. These are also important for our ambitions for a new World Trade Organisation round for enlargement of the European Union.
<P>

<a name="11015w47.html_para3">There has been progress. In the 1980s spending on the Common Agricultural Policy was over 60 per cent. of European Community budget. In 2001 it will be around 45 per cent.

The Government's objective is to secure changes that benefit consumers, taxpayers, the rural economy, the farming community and the environment. There is increasing recognition within the European Union of the need for reform.

 On 1 March 1999 a new IT system named ELATE was introduced to process Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL) applications in the DTI's Export Control Organisation (ECO). Data can therefore be given in the form requested from March 1999 and are included in the table. Prior to that date information on SIELs was not stored in a format which allows us to retrieve the data without incurring disproportionate cost.

 Officials from the Radiocommunications Agency (RA) of my Department and Dolphin Telecommunications Ltd. first discussed television interference affecting residents adjacent to Dolphin's mast at Deptford, Wiltshire on 23 February. Subsequently, the RA carried out a detailed investigation into the problem which established that the interference was due to the use of masthead amplifiers fitted to the affected TV installations. The mast head amplifiers were intended to improve reception from the Rowridge TV transmitter but were also inadvertently picking up signals from the Dolphin transmitter.
<P>

<a name="11015w49.html_para8">RA tests showed that a suitable filter fitted between the amplifier and the TV aerial could resolve the interference and the affected residents were recommended to have such filters fitted to their TV installations. The RA established that Dolphin were operating within licence conditions. If any residents still have interference problems they should consult an aerial contractor for advice on fitting a suitable filter.

We have established the Learning and Skills Council to drive this forward and have put in place a number of measures which provide the support and incentives young people need to take up and succeed in learning. We are introducing the new Connexions Service to provide advice and guidance to young people on the full range of learning options open to them and to help them progress within their chosen learning environment. We are also addressing the financial barriers to participation through piloting the Education Maintenance Allowance Scheme; providing Discretionary Funding targeted at specific learner needs, and the Connexions Card, which offers discounts on transport and learning materials.

 Maintained schools having a religious character receive recurrent funding in accordance with sections 45 to 51 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 in the same way as other maintained schools. There may be slight variations in funding according to their status as voluntary or foundation schools, but such differences do not arise from their religious character as such. It is not possible to state the cost of maintaining such schools because they are not separately identified for funding purposes.

 The Department does not collect this type of information. It is the responsibility of LEAs to set term dates and to ensure that schools must deliver a minimum of 380 half day sessions in the school year and that they must open for at least 190 days in each year. Under exceptional circumstances where school opening has been delayed for a short time, as a result of delayed building works or other urgent health and safety related grounds, we would expect LEAs to encourage schools to use training days to avoid defaulting on the number of sessions delivered. We expect LEAs and schools to programme building works in a way that minimises disruption; however, building work can still be delayed through unforeseen problems or inclement weather.

 Our network of 685 specialist schools shows that applicant schools across the country, including those from rural and inner city areas, have raised the sponsorship required, but we are aware some schools find this more difficult than others. It would not be practicable to make an estimate of the number of schools that have been unable to raise the funds but we have taken steps to ensure all schools have reasonable opportunity to do so. In 1999, the sponsorship requirement was halved to &#163;50,000 and my Department grant-aids the Technology Colleges and Youth Sport Trusts, to provide advice to schools about raising sponsorship and raise funds themselves to support applicant schools. In addition we will continue to keep the sponsorship criteria under review.

 The General Teaching Council (GTC) is the professional body for qualified teachers. Registration will be a requirement if a teacher wishes to be employed in a maintained school or non-maintained special school; those who are not registered will be unable to teach in these categories of school. The GTC is responsible for regulating the conduct of teachers, an important element in raising the profession's self esteem and standing with the general public and promoting the profile of teaching. The GTC also provides advice on a range of professional issues to Government and others. In framing advice, we expect it to consult its members, thus providing an opportunity for registered teachers to influence education policy development. The GTC's advice on teachers' professional development and workload has already proved valuable.

The work we have done with these groups has shown that we need more time to get the formula right. We have therefore decided to implement reform in 2003&#150;04 rather than 2002&#150;03, allowing us to see the impact of all the changes we will be making to local authority finance, not just those which affect education.

 The conduct of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service in respect of Mr. Sweeting is as follows. On 16 April 2001, at 0220 hours, Mr. Sweeting was arrested after being found in possession of an air rifle in a public place. The police charged him with an offence, contrary to section 16A of the Firearms Act 1968, of possession of a firearm with intent to cause another to believe that unlawful violence would be used.
<P>

<a name="11015w53.html_para2">Mr. Sweeting appeared before Torbay magistrates court later that morning. The police provided the Crown Prosecution Service with a file relating to the arrest of Mr. Sweeting. The Crown Prosecutor, in accordance with his duties under the code for Crown Prosecutors, determined that there was not a realistic prospect of a conviction in respect of the offence charged, and the charge was accordingly replaced with one under section 4A of the Public Order Act 1986, using threatening behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress.
<P>

<a name="11015w53.html_para3">Mr. Sweeting's case was adjourned until 15 May 2001, and the Crown Prosecutor requested further information from the police. Upon receipt of that information, the file was reviewed again, and the Crown Prosecutor decided that there was no realistic prospect of convicting Mr. Sweeting of the offence contrary to section 4A of the Public Order Act. After discussion with the police, it was decided that the case should, therefore, be discontinued, and formal discontinuance was effected by a letter of 14 May 2001.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will list the compulsory retirement ages which apply to employees of his Department and of executive agencies and other public sector bodies for which it is responsible, broken down by grade or job title.  [7226]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w56.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Information on the normal retirement age and on compulsory early retirement or severance for my Department and for the executive agencies and public sector bodies for which it is responsible is as follows:
<P>

<a name="11015w56.html_para0">The normal age of retirement for staff in all grades below the Senior Civil Service is 60 years. This is also the minimum age at which there can be retirement with full superannuation benefits. Retention beyond age 60 is possible subject to departmental needs and the continued health and efficiency of the individual member of staff.
<P>

<a name="11015w56.html_para1">Staff in the most junior grades who satisfy these criteria may continue in service until they reach the age of 65 years. Others who have not completed 20 years' reckonable service at age 60 may continue in post until they reach the age of 65 or complete 20 years' service, whichever occurs first.
<P>

<a name="11015w56.html_para2">Service beyond these limits to a maximum of 70 years is possible at management discretion. The Cabinet Office does not retain permanent employees beyond age 70 although it may be willing to consider a case in exceptional circumstances to meet an essential departmental need.
<P>

<a name="11015w56.html_para3">The Senior Civil Service has a common compulsory retirement age of 60 years in all departments. Retention beyond this age may be allowed if in the public interest and subject to departmental needs and the continued health and efficiency of an individual.
<P>

<a name="11015w56.html_para4">Government Office regional staff continue as members of their parent Departments and as such remain subject to their retirement policies in respect of age, compulsory early retirement or severance.




<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2001 : Column: 1012W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11015w56.html_para5">Retirement policies in the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Government Car and Despatch Agency and the Central Office of Information closely follow the Cabinet Office model, with analogous discretions allowing for extensions of service.
<P>

<a name="11015w56.html_para6">As a pre-redundancy measure volunteers may be offered retirement on compulsory terms to avoid compulsory redundancy procedures. Staff may also be retired on compulsory early retirement or severance terms on grounds of structure, and on compulsory early retirement terms on grounds of limited efficiency. Early retirement applies to staff aged 50 or over; early severance applies to staff aged under 50.

 Buildings used, owned or rented by the Department fall into two categories: those managed by the Court Service and those managed centrally by the Department. The Court Service manages the estate of all of the Crown Courts, county courts, the Supreme Court estate and probate estate, the Tribunal buildings and also regional administration buildings. Magistrates' courthouses are owned or leased by the local paying authority on behalf of Magistrates Courts Committees.
<P>

<a name="11015w56.html_para7">The running costs and average costs per square metre of Court Service buildings by nation are contained in Table 1 and the running costs and average costs per square metre by region are contained in Table 2.
<P>

<a name="11015w56.html_para8">Properties managed centrally by the Department include central administration buildings and associated offices. The running costs and average costs per square metre of these buildings by nation are contained in Table 3 and the running costs and average costs per square metre by region are contained in Table 4.
<P>

<a name="11015w56.html_para9">The estimate of the average cost per square metre for properties used by the Lord Chancellor's Department is contained in Table 5.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will list the number, value and location of properties newly leased in each of the last five years by her Department, broken down by those leased by the Department itself, its next steps agencies and its non-departmental public bodies, differentiating between purchases made as a result of the creation of new bodies and those purchases made by established bodies.  [7819]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w56.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor's Department has leased 34 additional locations over the past five years for various parts of the organisation and for varying lease terms. Five of the locations are occupied by the Department or its associated offices (the Legal Services Ombudsman's Office); 24 for its executive agencies (The Court Service and the Public Guardianship Office) and five for its NDPBs (CAFCASS and the Public Defender Service Offices). The creation of CAFCASS and the Public Defender Service offices prompted the acquisition of new properties; expansion of the organisation and/or rationalisation of the departmental estate drove the remaining acquisitions. Full details of the acquisitions are set out in the schedule.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what <i>(a)</i> building and <i>(b)</i> refurbishment projects are planned by his Department in (i) the current and (ii) the next financial year; and what the costs will be of each project.  [6589]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w58.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 There are no new build or refurbishment projects for the HQ estate in the current year (excluding general fit out and maintenance work). There is however, one project due to start in the next financial year, this will be to refurbish Clive House in London. The contract is due to be let in May 2002, with works to be undertaken between November 2002 and November 2003. The budget for this refurbishment is &#163;24 million, including works, fees and VAT, although this is being funded by the landlord under a private developer scheme.
<P>

<a name="11015w58.html_para5">Within the Court Service and associated offices, building and refurbishment schemes planned for the current financial year are in table 1.
<P>

<a name="11015w58.html_para6">The programme for 2002&#150;03 has yet to be determined but schemes that will be carried forward from this financial year are listed.
<P>

<a name="11015w58.html_para7">Financial support is also provided to local authorities who have procured Private Finance Initiative contracts for the delivery of new and refurbished magistrates courthouses. During the current year, six new courthouses (arising from two contracts signed in 1999&#150;2000) have already, or will be, opened at Beverley (new build); Kidderminster (refurbishment); Worcester (new build). During 2002&#150;03 the extensive refurbishment of Redditch Magistrates Court will be completed. The total capital investment by the private sector in these facilities is &#163;48 million.
<P>

<a name="11015w58.html_para8">The Department also provides funding to local authorities in the form of capital grant to undertake maintenance and necessary refurbishment works within magistrates courts. This funding is allocated to local authorities, so the Department does not undertake the works, nor are they directly benefited. The funds allocated in the current year for refurbishments in magistrates courts in England and Wales are in table 2.




<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2001 : Column: 1022W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11015w58.html_para9">The capital allocations for 2002&#150;03 have yet to be determined, however there is a further &#163;427,000 allocated to support the schemes approved in 2001&#150;02.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how her Department will report to Parliament on progress with the Government's commitment to use alternative dispute resolutions where possible in resolving their own disputes.  [7709]<P>

<P>
<a name="11015w58.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor intends to make an announcement at the beginning of the next financial year, and has asked Departments to collect the following information: the number of disputes that have been notified during the 12 month period from April 2001 to March 2002; the number of those disputes where alternative dispute resolution (ADR) was used or attempted; the number of disputes where litigation was started; and the number of disputes where an offer of ADR was rejected.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what progress has been achieved under the provisions of the Access to Justice Act 1999 in persuading suppliers of legal services to try mediation in appropriate cases in place of litigation.  [7708]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w58.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Legal Services Commission continues to support mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) for both family and non-family disputes. The number of mediations has 



<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2001 : Column: 1024W</I><P>
been increasing steadily, and there were 9,076 family mediations in the period April 2000 to March 2001. The Funding Code's decision-making guidance encourages the use of ADR, especially where it avoids lengthy, contested proceedings in court.
<P>

<a name="11015w58.html_para11">The Legal Services Commission has worked with Mediation UK and other bodies to develop a quality standard for both family and community mediation services. The Mediation Quality Mark standard has been published for consultation. The closing date for responses is 2 November 2001.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what assessment he has made of the compatibility of the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701 with Articles 9 and 14 of the Human Rights Act 1998.  [6484]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w59.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Government do not consider that the Act of Settlement 1701 contravenes Articles 9 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Act does not, for example, interfere with a person's right to practise the religion of his or her choice. The Court of Human Rights has consistently held that it considers only the facts of a particular case and does not give judgment on hypothetical situations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w59.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The review will be taken forward in the context of relevant recommendations of Lord Justice Auld's report, which was published on 8 October, and in the light of the results of public consultation on its recommendations. In the meantime, the Lord Chancellor has decided to implement some administrative improvements in the lodgings network, including the use of more cost-effective transport, and to close the lodgings at Mold on the Wales and Chester Circuit. These decisions will save over &#163;300,000 per year once implemented.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make a statement on recruitment, retention and training and service obligations for the lay magistracy.  [7143]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w59.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 In general there are no particular problems recruiting or retaining enough magistrates. Over 5,000 applied to be Justices last year. However, it is harder to recruit or retain people in some areas than in others and it is necessary to encourage people from all walks of life to apply. That is why my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor's officials are considering how to develop a national strategy that will encourage more people to apply from as wide a cross section of the community as possible. Advisory Committees try to be flexible to accommodate magistrates having difficulties and considering resigning, and the Lord Chancellor 



<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2001 : Column: 1025W</I><P>
expects courts to try to accommodate Justices who may be seeking to combine public service with family or work commitments. The minimum requirement is for 26 half- day sittings, that being the minimum number of sittings to ensure magistrates keep their knowledge and skills current.
<P>

<a name="11015w59.html_para0">Training is of course necessary to equip magistrates to discharge their responsibilities effectively. The amount of training required differs from person to person and depends on identified needs but there is a core syllabus delivered to all magistrates locally.

[7373]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w59.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 There is no assistance available which relates to the particular venue. Defence and private prosecution witnesses may be paid certain expenses of attendance, at the discretion of the court. Other prosecution witnesses, including the victim, are paid their reasonable expenses by the prosecuting authority. An acquitted defendant may be granted a defendant's costs order to cover any out of pocket expenses.
<P>

<a name="11015w59.html_para1">The location of courthouses is a matter for the individual Magistrates Courts Committee. The committee will take account, among other things, of the requirements of the Human Rights Act, although nothing in that Act requires cases to be heard in a particular type of location. Other relevant legislation, for instance, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, may require the Magistrates Courts Committee to consider questions of accessibility and the best way of providing a high standard of facilities to the population of the committee area as a whole.

 Sir Robin Auld's report on the Criminal Courts Review was published on 8 October. The Government are grateful to Sir Robin for his very substantial and important review of the criminal courts at every level. The Government will seek views from the public and from those working in the criminal justice system so as to gain a broad consensus for effective reform. The period for comment ends on 31 January 2002. In the light of those comments, the Government hope to make early decisions on whether to adopt the Recommendations, and to announce them in a White Paper. The full report of the review has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and is on the Criminal Courts Review website: http://www.criminal-courts-review.org.uk, and the CJS website at www.criminal-justice-system.gov.uk.

 We embarked on a radical programme of modernisation to improve access to effective treatment and care, reduce unfair variation, raise standards, and provide quicker and more convenient services. The mental health National Service Framework published in 1998 draws attention to the needs of people with eating disorders in Standards two and three.
<P>

<a name="11015w60.html_para8">The NSF implementation plan demands that health authorities have protocols for referral in place for those needing psychological therapies, and in February the Department published an evidence-based guideline to assist them. It includes coverage of eating disorders www.doh.gov.uk/mentalhealth/treatmentguideline.
<P>

<a name="11015w60.html_para9">We have commissioned the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to develop a guideline on eating disorders. It will cover primary and secondary care and children as well as adults. Information about this work is available on the NICE website at www.nice.org.uk.

<a name="11015w61.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 A health needs assessment tool (HNAT) was developed by Parkside Health national health service trust for use by health visitors to assist in the prioritisation of workload. An initial stage of development included focus groups that included both health visitors and their clients, prior to its piloting with 452 clients.
<P>

<a name="11015w61.html_para0">The HNAT does not require the recording of a client's name and address; instead it uses a master patient index number to link information gathered using this tool with the client's case notes, with which it is retained. No information from the HNAT is entered on Parkside Health NHS trust's electronic Community Information System. For a five-month period, a paper-based report which included master patient index numbers was compiled for monitoring purposes. In April 2000 this practice was identified locally as a potential breach of patient confidentiality and was discontinued immediately, and all documentation destroyed. All NHS trusts have been issued guidance relating to patient confidentiality and to the Data Protection Act 1998 and in upholding the Act are accountable to the Data Protection Registrar.
<P>

<a name="11015w61.html_para1">Parkside Health NHS trust commissioned an independent evaluation of the HNAT from Professor Sarah Cowley of the Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery, King's College, London. Professor Cowley presented her findings to the trust and its staff on 15 March 2001. The trust established a working group of health visitors that informed the development of an action plan to address issues identified by Professor Cowley; the NHS London Regional Office is monitoring implementation of this action plan.
<P>

<a name="11015w61.html_para2">As part of that action plan, Parkside NHS trust and its partner organisations are planning a conference for staff and clients that will explore the health visitor's role including needs assessment issues.
<P>

<a name="11015w61.html_para3">Any specific evidence of poor management practice at an NHS trust not being resolved through local policies and procedures brought to the Department's attention would elicit prompt, appropriate action to remedy the situation. I have asked the NHS London Regional Office to follow up with Parkside Health NHS trust whether there are any identifiable issues within what I understand to be one of Professor Cowley's working papers rather than a formal report and to advise me whether such action is necessary.
<P>

<a name="11015w61.html_para4">Following Professor Cowley's report, Parkside NHS trust wrote to all health visitor staff on 26 April 2001 indicating that HNAT was still in a developmental stage and that they may choose to use it as part of their assessment and prioritisation of client needs but are under no compulsion to do so.
<P>

<a name="11015w61.html_para5">The trust has a policy on violence in the workplace that specifically addresses safety on home visits; this has recently been updated. There have been no reports made to the trust of violence connected with use of the HNAT; any such report would be taken seriously and investigated as required under trust policies.

 In 2000&#150;01, 11.4 per cent. of patients failed to keep their first out-patient appointments in England. We are tackling this by introducing booking systems throughout the national health service. By the end of 2005 all out-patient appointments and elective hospital admissions will be pre-booked, with patients agreeing the date (and time) for out-patient appointments in advance. Booking systems have been proved to reduce missed appointments significantly.

 The level of healthcare cost inflation for the financial year 1999&#150;2000 was 4.5 per cent. The figures are taken from the national health service hospital and community health service (HCHS) pay and price inflation index. The latest year for which data are available is 1999&#150;2000. Assumptions for future years are based on our inflation target and possible recommendations from the pay review bodies.

<P>
<a name="11015w63.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The better hospital food programme, announced in the NHS Plan, is designed to improve the quality and availability of food in hospitals. It is a long-term programme, the first stage of which requires hospitals, by 31 December 2001: to ensure that their meal

services meet or exceed required standards and meet nutritional requirements; to provide a 24-hour catering service so that patients can obtain food when they need it; to adopt the national design for menus; and to provide on their menus dishes designed for the national health service by the team of leading chefs.
<P>

<a name="11015w63.html_para9">&#163;401,334 has been paid to outside organisations in connection with the better hospital food programme. This has covered design costs for the new menu and implementation support pack, the establishment and full nutritional analysis of the NHS dish selector, recipe development and testing work and the development and management of the website. This equates to slightly more than &#163;1,000 per NHS trust, and is a fraction of the NHS budget for catering. Additionally, central arrangement of much of this work will save the costs of duplicating work across the NHS.

 The information is not collected. Collection of data on waiting times from general practitioner referral to treatment for breast cancer will be rolled out in 2002, as stated in the NHS Cancer Plan. By 2005 full implementation of monitoring will be in place for lung cancer and lower gastrointestinal cancer.
<P>

<a name="11015w63.html_para11">We are determined to reduce waiting times for cancer treatment. By December 2002 there will be a maximum waiting time of two months from urgent GP referral to treatment for breast cancer.

<a name="11015w63.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 On 12 July the European Court of Justice ruled on joined cases C-157/99 Geraets-Smits and Peerbooms and case C-368/98 Vanbraekel that some hospital services may fall within European Community single market rules if they are provided for remuneration.

<a name="11015w63.html_para12">Following this ruling, the Government have announced that National Health Service commissioners will be able to commission care for NHS patients from providers in other member states of the European Union, as part of their wider efforts to reduce waiting times.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w64.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 In reaching our view of what to include in the comprehensive spending review 1998 we consulted widely and took into account the views of the Local Government Association (LGA) and other stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="11015w64.html_para0">The LGA report "Removing Barriers", which was published in 1997, highlighted the need for an active dialogue between the Department and the Department of Social Security (Department for Work and Pensions) on the interaction of the benefit system, and the local management of statutory welfare duties.
<P>

<a name="11015w64.html_para1">Departmental Ministers and officials regularly meet their opposite numbers in DWP, and with LGA representatives to discuss issues of mutual interest.
<P>

<a name="11015w64.html_para2">In the 1998 CSR we secured increased resources for social services averaging 3.1 per cent. a year in real terms for the years 1999&#150;2000 to 2001&#150;02.

 The NHS Plan set the target of an extra 5,000 intermediate care beds by 2003&#150;04. These will be provided in a range of settings&#151;in existing acute and community hospitals, in redesigned nursing homes or in purpose built facilities. The precise arrangements will be a matter for local decision. As part of our funding for intermediate care over the next two years, around &#163;65 million will be for capital investment to support this development.

 There is much published information to show that the successful treatment of anaemia in renal disease can improve patients' well-being and their quality of life. The majority of renal patients require epoetin to attain recommended haemoglobin levels. Data on the availability of epoetin are collected in surveys commissioned by the Department of Health. The last survey was conducted in 1998 and the results were published last year in the 3rd annual report from the United

 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> The Government's assessment is that bringing together responsibility for the environment, food and farming and rural affairs in a single Department will make a major contribution to the promotion of sustainable development in rural areas. DEFRA's remit includes the promotion of sustainable development across Government. The planning system remains a key instrument in delivering the Government's sustainable development objectives, and we are putting in place mechanisms to ensure continued close working with the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions.

<P>
<a name="11015w65.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 July 2001]:</i> The climate change levy, including climate change agreements, is expected to deliver reductions of 5MtC per annum by 2010. The levy is, overall, revenue neutral in that the receipts are being recycled to business through a 0.3 percentage point reduction in national insurance contributions and a programme of assistance to business to improve energy efficiency. The levy was introduced on 1 April 2001 and it is therefore too early to monitor impact. The operation of the levy will be kept under review.

The UK's baseline projections, that include the effect of some policies that have been introduced since Kyoto in 1997, estimate that the UK's emissions could be about 15 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. We estimate that the additional policies outlined in the programme could reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to 23 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010.

It has not been possible to identify separate carbon savings from aviation, although action is being taken to tackle the rising emissions from this sector.

<a name="11015w65.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Royal Society's report is a valuable contribution to the debate on how to respond to the threat of climate change. In particular we share the Society's view that, because of the finite size, uncertainty and potential reversibility, sink enhancement should not divert resources from technologies which reduce emissions. We also agree with the Society that steps should be taken to manage forests and crops in a way that protects and enhances their role as a carbon sink in a manner compatible with other goals of sustainable development, and accept the need to increase accuracy of monitoring and verification of land sinks. The Society's conclusions are consistent with the policy that the UK pursues in the international climate negotiations, and with UK policies for sustainable agriculture and forestry. We congratulate the Society on timely publication of the report shortly before the successful resumption of the climate change negotiations in July.

 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2001]:</i> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) documents published on 12 July were approved earlier in the year and the summaries from each of the three volumes have been available on the IPCC website (http://www.ipcc.ch) since then. The 12 July launch was of the final printed version by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the IPCC. The Government have taken a close interest in the preparation and approval of these reports and have drawn on earlier drafts in preparing the United Kingdom's Climate Change Programme published last November. The Government strongly support the IPCC and regard these reports as providing an authoritative view on the scientific and technical aspects of climate change. The Government with the EU have pressed for consideration of the implications of the IPCC reports at the 7th Meeting of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be held in Marrakesh in October/ November.

 We have put in place statutory performance standards on recycling that all local authorities must achieve by 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06. We have also said that we would look again at longer-term targets in the light of what local authorities are able to achieve and in the light of any technological developments.
<P>

<a name="11015w66.html_para1">The Spending Review 2000 announced the framework for the Government's support to local authorities for the next three years up to 2003&#150;04. This included an annual increase in the revenue support to local authorities for Environmental Protection and Cultural Services (EPCS), which includes waste management efforts. By 2003&#150;04 this support will have risen by &#163;1.1 billion over the 2000&#150;01 provision. Consistent with the general local authority financial framework, it is for Essex County Council to decide the proportion of their budget that should be directed to waste management work.
<P>

<a name="11015w66.html_para2">In addition to general support to local authority revenue expenditure, the spending review provided &#163;140 million of Government grant for waste management work and &#163;220 million for Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) resources, for waste projects. We will shortly consult on how the &#163;140 million grant should be distributed. At this stage it is not possible to identify what funding Essex County Council might receive from this source.
<P>

<a name="11015w66.html_para3">Local Public Service Agreements also provide opportunities for authorities to commit themselves to exceeding the statutory recycling targets and to be rewarded with additional resources for doing so.
<P>

<a name="11015w66.html_para4">We have also established the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to promote sustainable waste management by working to create stable markets for recycled materials and products and remove barriers to waste minimisation, re-use and recycling. A stable and efficient market for recycled materials will help local authorities in their efforts to meet their statutory performance targets.

 Under the Local Government Act 1999, the Government have set statutory performance standards for each English local authority for the composting and recycling of household waste. Overall, these standards require a doubling of recycling in 2003&#150;04 and a tripling by 2005&#150;06 compared to the 1998&#150;99 baseline.
<P>

<a name="11015w66.html_para6">We will increase further the targets for household waste recycling and composting once these initial targets have been achieved.

<P>

<a name="11015w66.html_para7">Blisters or vesicles are normally caused by the foot and mouth disease virus. It is the presence of ulcers and other mouth lesions that may cause difficulties in diagnosis. This is because lesions caused by the foot and mouth disease virus heal quickly in sheep and may not be present to aid a diagnosis whereas lesions due to other causes take longer to heal. To aid the diagnosis of foot and mouth disease, descriptions of some of the more common mouth lesions found in sheep, not caused by the foot and mouth disease virus, have been published in recent months in the veterinary literature.
<P>

<a name="11015w66.html_para8">Because of the need to cull animals believed to have foot and mouth disease within 24 hours to prevent the spread of disease, cases of foot and mouth disease must be confirmed on clinical grounds, without the benefit of laboratory results. A veterinary officer may order the slaughter of susceptible livestock on suspicion of disease in circumstances where the symptoms are suggestive of foot and mouth disease but not sufficiently consistent to confirm disease on clinical grounds.

 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2001]:</i> There is no evidence on which to base a level at which dioxins are potentially lethal to humans. Studies on humans who have been exposed to high levels of dioxins as a result of accidents or occupational exposure have reported a range of effects such as chloracne, an increased risk of cancer, changes in biochemical parameters such as enzyme levels and increases in mortality from cardiovascular disease, although there remains uncertainty about the direct causal link with dioxins.

Disposal of material contaminated with dioxins&#151;such as fly ash&#151;is normally to special landfill where they are contained, do not leach, and will pose no risk to health or the environment.

We are therefore learning from this dialogue, in terms of how to work with stakeholders&#151;including the importance of openness and trust&#151;and in relation to any conclusions that are reached on the safe management of radioactive materials and wastes. We have asked the Council about the possibility of quoting sections of the Waste Working Group's report in our consultation paper.

 <i>[holding answer 13 July 2001]:</i> The Secretary of State and I have had several discussions since June on nuclear issues including radioactive waste. The UK Government and the devolved Administrations will soon publish a consultation paper setting out detailed proposals. This will begin the process leading to the implementation of a radioactive waste management policy capable of inspiring broad support across the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what targets her Department has set for reductions of <i>(a)</i> carbon dioxide and <i>(b)</i> greenhouse gas emissions for (i) 2010 and (ii) 2040; and if she will make a statement.  [4011]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w68.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 July 2001]:</i> The UK's target under the Kyoto Protocol is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels over the period 2008&#150;12. The UK Government have an additional domestic goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. The Government have not yet set any targets for later years.

<a name="11015w68.html_wqn8"><B> Ms Bridget Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what part the UK Government intend to play to meet the royal commission report on Environmental Pollution recommendations of a global 60 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide by 2050.  [6228]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w68.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The report from the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution recommends that the Government should now adopt a strategy that puts the UK on a path to reducing carbon dioxide emissions by some 60 per cent. from current levels by about 2050. The UK Climate Change Programme recognises that emissions reductions of 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. globally may 



<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2001 : Column: 1061W</I><P>
be needed to avoid dangerous climate change, and that developed countries may eventually have to make even greater emissions reductions. Emissions reductions of this magnitude can only be achieved by international action involving a series of commitments of which the Kyoto agreement is but the first step. The Government have provided a clear signal of the UK's intentions by setting a domestic goal of reducing CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions by 20 per cent. below the 1990 by 2010. This goal goes well beyond the UK's obligation under the Kyoto Protocol and signals the UK's commitment to the long term process. The measures that could achieve the 20 per cent. CO <sub>2</sub>  reduction are set out in the UK's Climate Change Programme published in November 2000. The Government are currently conducting a wider review of energy policy which 



<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2001 : Column: 1062W</I><P>
encompasses technologies for emissions reduction in the longer term. The energy review is due to be completed at the end of 2001 and will contribute to the Government's response possibly early in 2002 to the specific recommendations in the report from the Royal Commission.

 The Farm Scale Evaluations are an ecological experiment specifically designed to study the effects of the weed control regimes associated with four genetically modified herbicide tolerant (GMHT) crops on farmland food-webs and in particular the food resources available for farmland birds. The experiment is based on the ecology (that is, interaction of living organisms with each other and their environment) of the soil weed-seed bank and a number of selected invertebrate indicator species that feed on farmland weeds or animals living on the weeds. The study includes a direct investigation of the effects of the herbicide management systems associated with the GMHT crops on soil-dwelling invertebrates such as spiders, beetles and Collembola, and indirect investigation of the effects on the activity of some species of earthworms.

 <i>[holding answer 20 July 2001]:</i> Liability for any loss that might arise as a result of the use of GM crops is an important issue, which is being addressed at both European and UK levels.

damage that creates serious harm to human health. Given the support expressed at last December's Environment Council by member states to the principle of a directive in this area and to the idea of including GMOs, it is likely that GMOs, and therefore the cultivation of GM crops, will be covered by any new directive.

 <i>[holding answer 20 July 2001]:</i> The powers to intervene on disposal arrangements for the GM crops in the farm-scale evaluations depend on the approval status of the GM crop concerned.
<P>

<a name="11015w69.html_para14">The GM rape and beet in the evaluations are being grown in England under research (Part B) consents issued by this Department. The consents specify the disposal arrangements. The GM Inspectorate act on behalf of the Secretary of State to monitor compliance with these conditions. They have powers to require applicants to comply and to take remedial action to safeguard human health and the environment if necessary. There are also powers to prosecute where it seems an offence has occurred.

 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2001]:</i> The Government have set challenging statutory recycling targets for local authorities.

<a name="11015w70.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 July 2001]:</i> In August 2001 the Environment Agency imposed conditions on municipal waste incinerators that required the operators to sample and analyse the ash streams arising from their processes for dioxins. These data will be placed on the relevant public registers. In addition, the Agency is presently trialling a process to track the initial destination of ash generated by municipal waste incinerators. Should the trial be successful, the Agency plans to implement the system throughout England and Wales.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what criteria the Environment Agency applies in deciding to apply the legally binding sanctions available to them to locate the final destinations of construction materials containing dioxins from toxic fly ash.  [5853]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w70.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 July 2001]:</i> Fly ash containing air pollution control residues is generally classified by the Environment Agency as a "special waste". This means that its consignment from an incinerator, and any subsequent transfers as a waste, are subject to the requirements of the Special Waste Regulations 1996 and the duty of care imposed by section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
<P>

<a name="11015w70.html_para0">Under the Special Waste Regulations, each consignment of special waste must be pre-notified to the Environment Agency and must be accompanied by a consignment note which describes its hazardous properties.
<P>

<a name="11015w70.html_para1">The Environment Agency does not have a legal duty to enforce the duty of care under section 34 of the 1990 Act but has a right of access to the records held by those subject to it. The guidance in DOE Circular 19/91 (paragraph 35) envisages that the Agency will pursue breaches of section 34 and seek access to these records where it suspects (a) that waste has not been transferred to an "authorised person" or (b) an actual or potential breach of section 33 of the 1990 Act.
<P>

<a name="11015w70.html_para2">However, there are circumstances in which waste may cease to be a waste (eg it is used in the manufacture of building products) and at this point the Environment Agency's responsibilities for the enforcement of waste management controls also cease.

 The tables set out the available information for the percentage of municipal waste recycled, incinerated and landfilled for each of the four years, 1996&#150;97, 1997&#150;98, 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 taken from the Department's Municipal Waste Management survey. The data are available for municipal waste but not for household waste separately. Household waste accounts for around 80 per cent. of municipal waste for London as a whole with the remainder coming from commercial and other sources. The available breakdown is by waste disposal areas. Data for 1995&#150;96 are not available at local authority level.

 The Government have put in place strict controls to ensure that all waste, including waste tyres, is disposed of safely and the penalties for contravention of these controls are severe. The action being taken by the Government on fly-tipping, and other forms of illegal waste disposal, was set out most recently in the Government's response to the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee's Report on the Environment Agency (Cm 4832&#151;paragraphs 55&#150;60). The Environment Agency is also developing a long-term programme to encourage the proper disposal of waste tyres.

 Waste disposal sites operate under the terms of waste management licences and are subject to the controls set out in Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. The licence for each site sets out the types and quantities of waste which can be accepted for disposal at that site. The licence for the South Ockendon site is available for inspection on the public register which the Environment Agency is required to keep under section 64 of the 1990 Act.

 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2001]:</i> The Department maintains a close watch on the performance of both scheme managers&#151;Eaga Partnership Limited and Eastern HEES Limited. This includes both regular management reports, and the use of an external contractor&#151;White Young and Green&#151;to audit the systems operated by the two scheme managers to ensure their effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="11015w71.html_para13">The introduction of the radically improved Home Energy Efficiency Scheme in June 2000 represented a difficult challenge for both scheme managers. The national shortage of gas heating engineers has led to severe delays in some areas in the installation and repair of central heating systems. This problem is being tackled through the recruitment of additional installers and the training of 800 new engineers to work under the scheme. These measures have led to major improvements in the speed of work with over 2,800 boiler installations completed in June 2001, compared to 590 in January.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the cost has been to UK public funds of subsidising the export of live cattle from the EU to the middle east and North Africa in the last five years.  [5281]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w72.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 During the 1999&#150;2000 EU budget year, the EU spent approximately 110 million euros on export refunds for live cattle to all destinations. We do not have data for specific destinations. The UK Exchequer does not contribute directly to the cost of any agricultural expenditure from the EU budget, but contributes to the budget as a whole. The UK position is to argue for a reformed CAP and an end to such export subsidies.

<P>
<a name="11015w72.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We are very conscious of the need to reduce bureaucracy. While some regulation is unavoidable if the Government are to safeguard public and animal health, environmental matters or public funds, the aim is to keep regulation to a minimum. A major programme of work to streamline processes has been under way for the last 18 months since my right hon. Friend the former Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food asked the industry to identify particular problem areas. In Europe, too, we continue to seek greater simplification of regulations affecting farmers.
<P>

<a name="11015w72.html_para2">Money has been saved in direct costs to industry as well as time saved in paperwork&#151;for example, by implementing a simplified procedure for granting "own-use" approvals for imports of pesticides with a reduced fee, by streamlining intervention procedures and by better co-ordinated cattle inspections. We continue to implement the remaining recommendations from the Red Tape Reviews and the Better Regulation Task Force report on Environmental Regulation and Farmers.

The Second Annual Report of the Green Ministers Committee, published in November 2000, included a list of free-standing environmental appraisals (Table 4.2). Since publishing this report, the Inland Revenue has carried out one further appraisal, published in 2001: DEFRA has received notification of a further 18 appraisals carried out in DETR up to February 2001.

<P>
<a name="11015w73.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The development and testing of fish deterrent systems has been carried out by those interested in the operational side of power station cooling plants. The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science has not therefore been directly involved. Neither are we aware of the extent to which mitigation measures are applied around the country. This is a matter for the power station operators themselves.
<P>

<a name="11015w73.html_para5">The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science has worked with staff of the former CEGB and the Environment Agency in monitoring fish impingement in a number of coastal power stations since the early 1970s. In general, this monitoring has indicated that the mortality caused in marine fish by power stations is small by comparison with the widespread distribution of these species and the overriding impact of natural mortality and additional fishing mortality.
<P>

<a name="11015w73.html_para6">In 1983, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science conducted an investigation to estimate the losses of commercial fish species (sprat, herring, cod, whiting, dab, sole and plaice) at Sizewell 'A' power station. These fish kills were calculated to the between 0.01 and 0.08 per cent. of commercial catches in the southern North Sea. A further study of the mortality of juvenile bass at Kingsnorth power station in the Medway Estuary in 1987&#150;88 concluded that the mortality of first year bass during peak impingement in autumn and winter was around 15 per cent. of the population in the immediate vicinity of the power station. This is significantly less than the percentage of juveniles which die as a result of predation, disease and even starvation in their first winter. The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science has since withdrawn from such monitoring.
<P>

<a name="11015w73.html_para7">To date, the Secretary of State has not held any meetings with her international counterparts about this particular problem.
<P>

<a name="11015w73.html_para8">The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science is not responsible for enforcement of the legislation relating to bass nursery areas. This is conducted by the Sea Fisheries Inspectorate, Sea Fisheries Committees and the Environment Agency.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w74.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 When the Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme was opened in March, the Intervention Board said it would aim to make payments within 21 days of slaughter. There has been enormous demand for the scheme, with over 1.5 million animals having been slaughtered and over 15,000 claims amounting to &#163;175 million paid. The number of applications far exceeded all forecasts at the time the scheme was introduced. In addition, the increasing complexity of the eligibility rules as movement restrictions were lifted and the large number of points in the disposal chain from which documentation had to be returned have contributed to delays in payments of claims. These delays are regrettable but in the circumstances unavoidable.
<P>

<a name="11015w74.html_para3">I am pleased to say that the Intervention Board has now cleared its backlog of claims and is making payments on over 90 per cent. of claims which do not require any further investigation within 28 days of slaughter.

 The Government have taken steps to avoid welfare problems being developed by lambs that have no market outlet&#151;principally light lambs, nearly all of which go to the export trade. The livestock welfare disposal scheme has been extended to pre-empt a welfare situation developing among light lamb. &#163;10 per lamb will be paid. It has to be clear to the farming industry that this is a one-off scheme&#151;it will not be repeated next year&#151;so decisions have to be based on that in terms of breeding plans for next year.

 Our policy on the transport of live animals is rigorously to enforce the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 and to negotiate for the highest possible animal welfare standards on an EU-wide basis. We are currently pursuing this objective in EU Council Working Groups on both the EU Directive on the protection of animals during transport and the Regulation on the standards for vehicles used for the long distance transport of livestock. But where possible, we believe that meat, rather than live animals, should be transported over long distances.

<a name="11015w76.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 We understand that the results of a study by the University of Wales at Aberystwyth into metal levels in river sediments deposited on floodplains in Swaledale have not yet been published. However, from the information so far available it appears that the lead levels found are similar to those found in previous studies in this area, where elevated levels of lead are sometimes found as a result of natural geology and historical mining activities. This is well known in the area and has been the subject of advice to local farmers in the past which has proved effective. Farmers can minimise risks to livestock from these deposits by simple good husbandry practices, to minimise the ingestion of soil by animals as they feed. The Food Standards Agency's standing advice is that these measures should also be effective in minimising any risks to consumers of foods produced by animals in these areas. The Veterinary Laboratories Agency have recorded no increases in livestock health problems that could be linked to the recent flooding.
<P>

<a name="11015w76.html_para1">A new European Commission Regulation ((EC) 466/2001), setting maximum limits for lead and cadmium in food and due to come into force on 5 April 2002, will introduce limits for cadmium in offal for the first time in the UK, and a lower limit for lead in offal than the current UK limit. The Food Standards Agency will be carrying out formal consultation on these proposals later this year. In parallel, it will be consulting Government and other stakeholders on whether any further guidance to farmers may be appropriate to help minimise any risks that offal from animals raised in areas where elevated levels of lead in soil occur could exceed these new limits.
<P>

<a name="11015w76.html_para2">The Department will assess the full results of this study when they are available, seeking advice from the Food Standards Agency on food safety issues. A risk assessment will be completed, and all the appropriate public authorities will be involved in the consideration of the findings.

<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para0">In September we commissioned survey work to shed light on the economic impact of foot and mouth disease in selected rural areas. Around 40 per cent. of businesses in areas with widespread outbreaks of foot and mouth disease report being adversely affected, compared with 15 per cent. in areas with few or no outbreaks. Among affected businesses, 44 per cent. describe the impact as severe or very severe, with 21 per cent. reporting the loss of over half normal sales revenue between March and August. While most affected businesses report that they remain profitable, 13 per cent. report that an expected profit has turned to loss due to foot and mouth disease. However, two-thirds expect to be back to "business as usual" by mid-2002. We will publish the final report when it is complete later.

 For staff who have direct contact with the public, a set of relevant courses are offered in DEFRA's core training programme or locally. Staff identify their development and training needs with their managers using the Department's competence framework and undertake the appropriate training. In addition, at group level key skills are identified and staff trained accordingly.

 It is impossible to give a simple figure in answer to this question as diversification comes in many forms, not all requiring official approval or financial support from the Government. The Government do provide support for farm diversification, including aid made available through the Rural Enterprise Scheme (RES), part of the England Rural Development Programme. 365 RES applications involving farm diversification activities had been received this year by 31 August.

 No. This information was excluded from the version of the Arthur D.

The only customers specifically identified in the report, E.on of Germany and OKG of Sweden, had already publicised their commercial arrangements with the company.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w77.html_spnew9"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> The Settle/Clitheroe outbreak began in the middle of May. The Department's epidemiologists' initial assessment was that the outbreak was caused by infection established in sheep and/or cattle from the movement of people, vehicles etc. from an infected area. However, further epidemiological investigation of the cases making up this outbreak suggests that infection has been present in the sheep population in the northern part of this cluster for some time. Infection is now believed to have been spread to the area by sheep via untraced sheep from Hawes market, or untraced sheep from Longtown market or via an intermediary market, holding or dealer in which disease was not manifested clinically or in which clinical signs were not observed.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para1">This re-appraisal of the cause of the outbreak has not been influenced by the spread of disease down the Ribble and Aire river valleys. Following the initial introduction of infection, normal, seasonal sheep husbandry activities resulted in infection being transmitted to cattle making infection in the area obvious.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what information she has collated on the susceptibility of deer to foot and mouth.  [5356]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w77.html_spnew38"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 All cloven-hoofed animals, including deer, are susceptible to foot and mouth disease. Wild deer tend to show mild or inapparent disease, resembling the disease in sheep, although some species (eg roe deer and muntjak deer in the UK) may be severely affected.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para3">Deer can be carriers of the foot and mouth virus, and could transmit foot and mouth disease to susceptible livestock during the clinical stages of the disease. However, the Department's current veterinary risk assessment indicates that the risk of wild deer playing any significant part in the spread of foot and mouth disease is very low. There are therefore no plans at this stage to control wild deer populations, although as more 



<P>

information becomes available about the epidemiology of the disease in areas where there are wild deer, the risk assessment will be updated.

[5354]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w77.html_spnew40"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Although none of these animals and birds is susceptible to foot and mouth disease, any of them could, in theory, play a role in spreading disease mechanically by moving contaminated material from one premises to another. However, there is no direct evidence of such spread in the current outbreak. The mechanical transmission of the FMD virus by rats and birds was the subject of research in the late 1960s/early 1970s. The risks were considered to be negligible if not zero.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para4">In relation specifically to geese, a veterinary risk assessment has been carried out on the risk of migratory geese spreading foot and mouth disease. The conclusion of the assessment was that the risk of spreading FMD virus was "very low". The assessment may be found on the DEFRA website at: http://defraweb/footandmouth/ disease/risks/risk12.htm.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if ring vaccination for foot and mouth actively was considered by her Department in the first week of the epidemic.  [5265]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w77.html_spnew41"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Vaccination against foot and mouth disease remains an option that is kept under continuous review. Ring vaccination is one possible approach, which aims to control the spread of infection within and outside an infected area. It reduces the amount of virus circulating in the area, as the vaccinated animals will be less infectious.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para5">We did not ring vaccinate at the start of the outbreak because it was apparent that the virus had potentially been spread across a wide area, owing to the large number of movements that had taken place before the first case of foot and mouth disease was identified. This made ring vaccination an impractical option.

 MAFF provided the Post Office with general advice on the precautions they should take in the first few days of the outbreak. Detailed guidelines were subsequently drawn up on 12 March for all delivery companies. These guidelines were checked by veterinary staff, and the Post Office. A final version of the guidelines was sent to the Post Office on 25 March and placed on the Department's website on 10 April.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w77.html_spnew45"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 An NFU representative with a farming background was involved at every stage of producing the biosecurity video which was distributed to all livestock farmers. He worked in collaboration with the production team, providing advice on the visual content, checking the script and making any changes necessary, and reviewing the 'rough cut' and final version of the video tape. The final version of the biosecurity video had the NFU's stamp of approval. The NFU representative in the Joint Communication Centre in London also had input in the cover letter to farmers which accompanied the video, signed by Chief Veterinary Officer, Jim Scudamore.

 Analyses have been completed for the first 1,903 infected farms, and epidemiological investigations continue on the most recent cases to determine the source of infection and method of spread.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para10">Short distance aerosol spread cannot be distinguished from other causes of local spread within 3 km of infected premises, which accounts for 79 per cent. of cases. In these cases there is often a number of possible means of spread such as using common facilities, contaminated roadways and movement of people and farm vehicles. In addition, however, 107 cases have been specifically associated with lorry movements or movements of people.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para11">In the latter part of the epidemic, transmission by vehicles, other inanimate objects and people have predominated.

 Further to my letter of 6 August to the hon. Member, which is available in the Libraries of the House, I confirmed that a contingency plan had been drawn up and would be refined in the light of new developments. Detailed planning has continued to address the possibility of any resurgence of disease in Yorkshire. A revised version of the contingency plan was prepared in September.

 A claim form signed by the owner, the valuer (if applicable) and departmental official who attended the valuation is submitted to the local animal health office where initial scrutiny of the claim is carried out. A record is kept of all claims submitted and copies of the form are retained. The claim is then sent to Page street HQ in London where it is processed for payment, except for payments under the Cumbrian 3km cull which were sent direct to the DEFRA finance unit at Alnwick.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para19">At Page street all claims are checked for arithmetical correctness and to ensure they are correctly signed by valuer, owner and departmental official. The number of animals claimed for the dates the animals were valued and slaughtered are checked against centrally held records and any discrepancies resolved.

The reason for the checks is to ensure the Department pays the correct amount of compensation for the right number of animals slaughtered to the rightful owner of the animals.

 DEFRA/MAFF received over 2,100 compensation claims in total as a result of the 3km cull. Around 200 farmers were initially paid for less than the total number of animals shown on the valuation. This was because of differences between the number of animals valued and the number shown as collected.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para21">Farmers who were not paid their full valuation were told that the reduction was an interim measure to allow us to pay them something and they were given an opportunity to make representations and submit additional information to allow us to reassess their case.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11015w77.html_spnew62"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> Community legislation does permit the importation of meat and meat products from certain countries where foot and mouth disease is endemic but only where the disease is restricted to specific areas. Imports are only permitted from parts of the country that are free of disease or under conditions that ensure the meat does not represent any health risk. These provisions are in line with the recommendations of the Northumberland Committee following the 1967 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para22">All meat and meat products imported from third countries must be accompanied by veterinary certification, which includes confirmation that the meat is derived from animals which have been subjected to an ante-mortem inspection during the 24 hours prior to slaughter in order to confirm, among other things, that the animal shows no signs of foot and mouth disease.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para23">If there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health such as foot and mouth disease, Community legislation allows us to ban imports of meat from all, or parts, of the country concerned. Recent examples include Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Swaziland, Uruguay and Zimbabwe, and within the EU, France, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para24">All meat and meat products imported into the UK from third countries must enter at designated UK Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) where they are subject to veterinary inspections. All consignments are subject to

<a name="11015w77.html_spnew63"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The previous Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend (Mr. Brown), announced on 8 May a range of measures amounting to &#163;15.4 million, made up of: &#163;10.4 million for an enhanced Farm Business Advice Service (FBAS) offering up to five days of free business advice for farmers whose livestock have been slaughtered under the foot and mouth control measures; &#163;2 million in grant aid made available under a new round of the Agricultural Development Scheme, to improve marketing performance and competitiveness of sectors affected by foot and mouth; &#163;3 million for a targeted trade development and market campaign, made available through Food from Britain who will co-ordinate their campaign with the Countryside Agency, Meat and Livestock Commission and others with an active interest.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para25">FBAS is a free and confidential service which is provided by an experienced farm business adviser and is available to any farmer in England who has had stock compulsorily slaughtered as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak. We have sent a letter to all farmers in this category.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para26">An adviser will review the farmer's business and arrange for an environmental evaluation to be conducted by an appropriate specialist. The adviser will then help them prepare a whole farm recovery plan which will help farmers to develop new income opportunities and access the range of other support measures available to them. Advice is also provided on re-stocking.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para27">The Government's long-term strategy for the future of the agriculture industry aims to facilitate the development of a sustainable, competitive and diverse farming and food sector within a thriving rural economy that advances environmental, health and animal welfare goals. The independent Policy Commission announced on 9 August will look at the future of food and farming and advise us on how to achieve this.

 The number of abattoirs has been in decline for a considerable number of years. It is recognised that abattoirs have experienced much disruption during the foot and mouth disease outbreak. However, identifying the impact of foot and mouth disease would be extremely difficult, especially before the outbreak has run its course.

 The OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) sets out the criteria for regaining disease-free status. To regain our disease-free status (without vaccination), we must be able to declare that there have been no outbreaks of disease for three months; that no vaccination has been carried out for at least 12 months; that we have not imported vaccinated animals; that all regulatory measures for the prevention and control of foot and mouth disease have been implemented and that we have documented evidence of an effective system of surveillance in operation.

<a name="11015w77.html_spnew68"><B> Mr. Morley: </B>

<P>
<a name="11015w77.html_spnew69"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Once foot and mouth disease has been eradicated, we will continue to be vigilant, in order to prevent a recurrence of the disease.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para29">Imports of meat and meat products into the United Kingdom, as into other member states of the European Union, take place within the framework of European law. The UK imports livestock under EU or national rules only from countries or areas officially recognised as being free from foot and mouth disease.

<a name="11015w77.html_para30">The control of meat and meat product imports into this country involves the inspection of commercial imports at border inspection posts, controls on personal imports and 



<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2001 : Column: 1115W</I><P>
action in shops and other food premises against sales of illegally imported food. The Government are taking action in all of these contexts to build on existing controls.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para31">Where farms have been culled due to foot and mouth disease, certain rules apply before restocking can take place to minimise the risk of recurrence of the disease. Alternatively, if the farmer does not wish to restock at once, restrictions are lifted four months after the full and final C and D, subject to a final inspection. If it has not been possible to complete a full C and D to DEFRA's satisfaction, 12 months must elapse after the preliminary C and D before restocking can take place.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para32">Biosecurity measures are also vital in helping to prevent the spread and resurgence of foot and mouth disease. As part of the ongoing campaign to provide timely and accurate information and advice to all concerned we have mailed biosecurity guidelines, leaflets and letters and placed adverts in local, national and specialist publications. In addition, local veterinary inspectors have contacted their clients to discuss biosecurity and other aspects of the disease.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para33">The Department has contingency plans to deal with all notifiable exotic animal diseases, including foot and mouth disease. These are regularly updated and tested by the state veterinary service.
<P>

<a name="11015w77.html_para34">The Government in addition have announced two independent inquiries to look into the lessons to be learned from the current outbreak of foot and mouth, and a public commission to examine how the Government can create a sustainable, competitive and diverse farming and food sector which contributes to a thriving rural economy while at the same time advances environmental, economic health and animal welfare goals.

<a name="11015w77.html_spnew74"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The timing of receipt of money depends on the speed at which the business, which is being grant aided, can complete the relevant action. Thirty-six businesses have already been grant aided to a total of &#163;342,000, and 26 businesses are still in discussions with advisers.
