<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what representations he has received on the closure of Ashford International Station on the weekend of the France <i>v</i>. England rugby match in Paris; and if he will make a statement.  [26888]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 My understanding is that the possible closure of Ashford over this weekend has yet to be confirmed, and that, currently, the station is scheduled to be open on Saturday 2 March, although possibly closed on the Friday and Sunday. These timings are provisional and therefore subject to change.
<P>

<a name="20131w01.html_para0">Although occasional weekend closures are an inevitable consequence of the essential work for the channel tunnel rail link (CTLR) currently being undertaken at and around Ashford, the timing of this particular closure, if confirmed, is particularly unfortunate. I therefore propose to raise the matter with the company building the link, Union Railways.
<P>

<a name="20131w01.html_para1">The CTLR project itself remains on time and on budget and when section 1 opens in 2003 the people of Kent will of course benefit from improved international rail services on a purpose-built high-speed line that will free up capacity on existing track.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what steps he is taking to simplify the process by which a wind turbine deployer may achieve planning consent in a commercially viable time-frame.  [29284]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 We already promote a positive approach to planning for all types of renewable energy projects. We have initiated the preparation of regional renewable energy assessments to encourage a more strategic approach to planning for renewable energy at regional and local levels, which will help to facilitate planning permission for individual proposals.
<P>

<a name="20131w01.html_para2">Our Planning Green Paper published on 12 December 2001 includes proposals to deliver faster and more responsive planning decisions across the board. One element of this approach is to encourage developers to discuss proposals with local people and local planning authorities before applications for planning permission are submitted. I strongly commend this to those seeking permission for wind turbines and other renewable energy projects.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what his estimate is of the average change in annual revenue available for financing investment in Birmingham's housing revenue account as a result of the Government's rent restructuring proposals, based on <i>(a)</i> the continuation of the current subsidy system and <i>(b)</i> the abolition of the council tenant's tax.  [30353]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Local authorities are responsible for setting their own rents and budgets&#151;including the resources to be devoted to investment&#151;based on local priorities and other factors. There is no council tenant's tax.

[30391]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 On the basis of the definition used for the purposes of best value and Audit Commission Performance Indicators for 2000&#150;01, the average annual management cost per dwelling for all local authorities in England was &#163;654. The average for all metropolitan

[30350]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The estimated housing benefit cost over three years to be contributed from Birmingham city council's general fund is &#163;17.14 million.
<P>

<a name="20131w01.html_para3">The estimated Exchequer contribution to housing benefit cost for Birmingham tenants if transfer of the local authority housing stock to registered social landlord goes ahead is &#163;63.63 million over 30 years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what assessment he has made of the effect on the level of road accidents, broken down by type of <i>(a)</i> accident, <i>(b)</i> injury and <i>(c)</i> victim, of the operation of (i) mandatory and (ii) advisory 20 mph limits.  [30326]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 TRL research on urban speed management methods published in 1998 (TRL Report 363) found only an average 1 mph drop in speeds and no discernible accident reduction in accidents in 20 mph limits using only signs. Advisory speed limits are not normally approved in England and Wales. However, the more successful 20 mph zones that use self enforcing traffic calming features achieved average speed reductions of around 10 mph which produced a 70 per cent. reduction in child pedestrian accidents and a 48 per cent. reduction in child cyclist accidents.

responding to shoreline pollution following marine pollution incidents, and in carrying out that response. Since the beginning of 1998, my Department has received representations concerning the introduction of a statutory duty on coastal local authorities to plan for or undertake shoreline clean-ups following marine pollution incidents from: Aberdeenshire council, Ceredigion county council, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, Devon county council, Dumfries and Galloway council, Dundee city council, Fife council, KIMO (Kommunenes Internasjonale Milj organisasjon), the Local Government Association, Pembrokeshire county council, Purbeck district council, Shetland Islands council, South Ayrshire council and the Tyne and Wear Emergency Planning Unit. This is a subject which falls within the scope of the Cabinet Office's ongoing review of "The Future of Emergency Planning in England and Wales", and specifically that review's proposal that existing emergency planning legislation be replaced with a new statutory duty for emergency planning, and my Department has made an input to that review. The result of the review is awaited.
<P>

<a name="20131w03.html_para2">The information requested about coastal local authorities which have implemented contingency plans on a voluntary basis has been placed in the Libraries of the House, in the form of a list compiled by my Department's Maritime and Coastguard Agency, using data collected in January 2001 (and which are being updated presently). Information about the amount of funding which local authorities have requested to cover the implementation of plans to undertake shoreline clean-ups following marine pollution incidents, and the amounts which local authorities have spent on setting up plans to undertake shoreline clean-ups following marine pollution incidents and on cleaning up shorelines following marine pollution incidents, is not held centrally. No specific grants have been made covering the implementation of shoreline clean-up plans following a marine pollution incident. My Department's Maritime and Coastguard Agency does, however, annually provide training courses for local authority officers on oil pollution contingency planning and response, and shorter courses on oil spill response, at no cost to the local authorities involved.

 Development by the Crown, including Government Departments, does not require planning permission.

The developing Department must serve a Notice of Proposed Development on the local planning authority. If the local planning authority objects to the proposal and the objections cannot be resolved by negotiation, the developing Department must refer the proposals to the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions for his determination.

 The Highways Agency 2000&#150;01 annual report will be published today under the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1921. In the year, the agency met all but one of its eight ministerial targets, missing the final target by only a very narrow margin. The agency also managed its expenditure within its budget, resulting in a very small underspend of 0.6 per cent. A copy of the report will be placed in the House Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement about the Merseyrail passenger franchise.  [33078]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Merseyrail franchise operates on a network of lines which are almost entirely separate, physically and operationally, from the rest of the national rail network. The current franchise expires in February 2003. Merseytravel (the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive and Passenger Transport Authority) has brought forward proposals to take Merseyrail services outside the franchising process operated by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), leaving the way open for Merseytravel to offer a local concession (in effect, similar to a franchise) for these services. Having discussed the proposals in detail with both the SRA and Merseytravel I have it in mind to support this approach which will provide local control over this unique local network and will help bring much needed improvements for passengers.

<a name="20131w05.html_para0">I accordingly intend, after consultation, to seek the House's approval to an Order under the Railways Act 1993, which will enable the new arrangements to be given effect. In the meantime the SRA will continue to work with Merseytravel on the future of these services.

Under section 54 of the Act, local authorities have powers to execute works which appear to be urgently necessary for the preservation of unoccupied listed buildings. The Secretary of State also has powers under section 54 of the Act to authorise English Heritage to carry out such repairs on her behalf. No other agencies have statutory powers concerning listed buildings.

 The over-30-months scheme (OTMS) delivers some &#163;240 million per annum in payments to beef and dairy farmers. Farmers will have incurred losses arising from additional costs of keeping cattle, delays in sales receipts and, any differences between prices actually received and those which would otherwise have been obtained. However, there are no statistics available to identify the number of cattle that entered the OTMS scheme as a result of movement restrictions and therefore it is not possible to quantify any losses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Since launching the national waste strategy in May 2000, the Government have set demanding statutory targets for the recycling and composting of household waste for each local authority, increased the landfill tax and consulted on a system of tradable landfill permits in order to achieve the diversion from landfill required. It has also set up the Waste and Resources Action Programme to help create stable and efficient markets for recycled materials and products, with funding from the Government and the devolved Administrations of around &#163;40 million over three years.
<P>

<a name="20131w07.html_para1">Following the waste summit held on 21 November, which considered what more needs to be done to ensure effective delivery of the strategy, the Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) have begun their study to review Waste Strategy 2000. The study is assessing what extra instruments, changes to targets or regulations, or additional funding may be required to ensure that the strategy is delivered effectively and that we are able to develop more sustainable waste management.
<P>

<a name="20131w07.html_para2">The PIU will be consulting with key stakeholders through the study. Further details about the study are available on the PIU website at www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/ innovation.

 Revised estimates of farm income, output and productivity of agriculture during 2001 were published on 31 January. These confirm the increase in farm incomes forecast last November and indicate a modest rise of 13 per cent. (11 per cent. in real terms).
<P>

<a name="20131w07.html_para3">This increase is due to improved prices leading to higher values of output for milk, potatoes and horticulture outweighing lower values of output for cereals and livestock. Incomes are forecast to show a further rise in 2002 as the volume of cereal production returns to more normal levels and the industry starts to recover from the effects of FMD.

 I am announcing today the introduction of TB movement restrictions on certain herds with overdue TB tests. The herds affected are those in annual test frequency parishes that have missed the six and 12 month tests carried out after the lifting of movement restrictions put in place after an earlier TB incident. A veterinary risk assessment has shown that these have been historically more at risk of being infected with TB than herds with other types of TB test. The measure is expected to affect up to 1,250 herds mainly in the south and west of England.
<P>

<a name="20131w07.html_para5">In addition we are introducing additional checks on herds that have been reformed after FMD. These herds will be TB tested at 12 and 24 months after the normal TB check test at three months after restocking.

 The Rural Enterprise Scheme (RES) is one of the new grant schemes in the England Rural Development Programme which was launched in October 2000. It is delivered on a regional basis by DEFRA's Rural Development Service (RDS). Expenditure on the development and administration of the scheme in 2001&#150;02 was forecast to be around &#163;2 million. The final outturn figure is likely to be lower because a significant number of RDS staff were diverted temporarily on to foot and mouth disease work.

 By the end of the century there will be half a million tonnes of radioactive waste. Some of it will be potentially dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years. Deciding the best way to manage it is one of the greatest environmental challenges we have ever faced. The Government and the devolved Administrations published the consultation paper "Managing radioactive waste safely" on 12 September. We propose a programme of national debate and research, leading to scientifically sound decisions on the long-term management of radioactive waste which inspire public confidence across the UK. In the meantime radioactive waste is safely stored, and rigorously controlled by regulators including the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency.

Assuming a uniform rate of arising, then the arisings of high and intermediate level waste in the last 12 months would have been about 3,100 and 80 cubic metres respectively. Intermediate level waste is produced at locations too numerous to list; they are predominantly nuclear licensed sites but also include many hospitals and small users of radioactive sources.

 The Government's waste strategy sets national targets to recycle or compost at least 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005, at least 30 per cent. by 2010 and at least 33 per cent. by 2015. Annual composting targets have not been set for 2002 or the following five years, but statutory performance standards for household waste recycling and composting have been set for each local authority under the Best Value process for 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06. The achievement of these will deliver the first of the national targets in 2005.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w09.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The Government's policy for reducing methane emissions are set out in the UK's Climate Change Programme, copies of which are in the House Libraries. A range of policies has been introduced which is leading to reductions in methane emissions. A key policy is the increased collection of landfill gas for use as energy, an important aspect of the Waste Strategy and the EU landfill directive. Emissions are also falling from other sources including the agricultural sector, coal mines and the natural gas distribution network. Methane emissions are currently projected to fall by about 45 per cent. below 1990 levels in 2010.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w09.html_spnew6"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Under the Kyoto Protocol, the UK has a target to reduce emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases by 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008&#150;12. The six gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride. The Government have an additional domestic goal to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. Further targets have not been set for the other greenhouse gases. The UK's climate change programme, published in November 2000, sets out a range of policies and measures that we estimate could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 23 per cent. by 2010.

 The Continuing Survey of Roads Goods Transport recorded that UK registered HGVs transported food, animal feed and drink (totalling 354 million tonnes) a total distance of 4,437 million kilometres within the UK at an average length of haul of 128 kilometres. Such vehicles account for around 95 per cent. of all freight moved by road. This includes the domestic part of any trips that start or end in a foreign country, and excludes food, feed and drink transported by foreign-registered HGVs.

 The only sizeable farmed game industry in the UK is the deer (venison) industry. In the main, Government help for that industry has come in the form of funding R&D. The Government have funded deer related projects since 1988, the most recent being a three year project, costing &#163;178,000, looking at low input systems for venison production. For the future, R&D in the deer sector is likely to concentrate on sustainability and the comparative environmental cost of farming deer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The UK played a leading role in drafting many aspects of the Water Framework Directive during and after its presidency of the European Union 1998. The directive will help ensure protection and improvement of our inland and coastal waters for the benefit of generations to come, thereby contributing to sustainable development.
<P>

<a name="20131w10.html_para1">The Directive introduces a common approach to environmental objectives for all groundwaters and surface waters within the Community as well as a common implementation method, based around the principle of river basin management.

<a name="20131w10.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the differences are between current methodology employed to map nitrate vulnerable zones and that used when nitrate vulnerable zones were designated in 1996.  [31177]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Identification of discrete area nitrate vulnerable zones as presented under Option 2 of the current consultation paper "How should England implement the 1991 Nitrates Directive?", published on 20 December 2001, has required assessments of the status of several different types of water bodies.
<P>

<a name="20131w10.html_para2">For surface waters, the primary differences between current and past methodology are that the proposed designations are the result of the application of a more robust statistical methodology used to assess nitrate concentrations, coupled with the use of a more extensive water quality sampling network. Following the European Court of Justice (ECJ) judgment in 2000 that we failed to fully implement the nitrates directive, we were required to cover all waters, not just those used for drinking water supplies. The entire Environment Agency GQA monitoring network is now used. Statistical assessments of nitrate concentrations have been based on a minimum of five years of data, compared to a single year of data in the past. For the first time, trend-analysis has also been used to cover the requirement to protect those waters which may be subject to unacceptably high nitrate pollution in the future.
<P>

<a name="20131w10.html_para3">For groundwaters, the 1996 designations of groundwater NVZs were based on monitoring data taken from Public Water Supply boreholes and delineated by groundwater catchments. Following the ECJ judgment, we were required to ensure that the new methodology identifies all groundwater vulnerable to agriculturally- derived nitrate and not just the catchments (zones of contribution) for Public Supply Wells. This was accomplished by combining a statistical assessment of groundwater data with a groundwater vulnerability model derived from an examination of the risk factors associated with land use, rainfall, soil and geological characteristics. The spatial distribution of nitrate values from the monitoring network was used in conjunction with the vulnerability map to define nitrate vulnerable zones.
<P>

<a name="20131w10.html_para4">The nitrates directive also requires designation of nitrate vulnerable zones draining into estuarine areas which have been adjudged to be eutrophic and where a significant proportion of nitrogen arises from diffuse agricultural sources. Such areas are identified in England under the proposals for Option 2 for the first time.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Measures required under the nitrates directive are also "basic" measures which must be included in "programmes of measures" under article 11 of the water framework directive. These programmes of measures have to be published in draft by December 2008 as part of proposed comprehensive River Basin Management Plans.




<P>

<P>

<a name="20131w10.html_para5">Action required under the nitrates directive will also therefore contribute to meeting environmental objectives set by the water framework directive. These objectives are due to be met by 2015.
<P>

<a name="20131w10.html_para6">DEFRA published a consultation document on 20 December 2001 setting out options for implementing the nitrates directive, in order to comply with a European Court of Justice judgment issued in December 2000.

<P>
<a name="20131w10.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reason the methodology for mapping groundwaters in relation to proposed nitrate vulnerable zones has been changed from that applied on nitrate vulnerable zones designated in 1996.  [31178]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Identification and designation of groundwater nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) in 1996 was based on monitoring data from Public Water Supply boreholes. Following the European Court of Justice judgment that we have failed to fully implement the nitrates directive, we were required to extend the methodology to cover all groundwaters, not just drinking water supplies. The Environment Agency therefore used in addition to all available private borehole monitoring data and developed a modelling methodology, calibrated to best fit available borehole monitoring data, to identify vulnerable groundwaters. Further details are in Annexe A of the current consultation document "How should England implement the 1991 Nitrates Directive?" (PB6269) published on 20 December 2001.

 At its spring meeting in April the World bank will submit a paper on achieving the millennium development goal of universal primary education by 2015. This will analyse progress to date since the Dakar Forum and lessons learned, examine the costs of meeting this goal and make recommendations for obtaining the additional financing required. We are consulting the bank about the preparation of this paper.
<P>

<a name="20131w11.html_para10">The World bank has a critical role in supporting countries as they seek to give priority to education, and primary education in particular, within the overall context of their poverty reduction strategies. We have not yet seen increased bank funding in support of "Education for All" since Dakar. We hope that at the spring meeting, bank governors will deliver a strong message in support of greater bank effort in education. We believe the bank, together with other international development banks and development agencies, should increase the resources committed to helping reforming government deliver universal primary education.

 The Government give priority to helping poor countries develop sustainable education systems to deliver high-quality primary education to all their children. DFID's education strategy paper, "The challenge of universal primary education", sets out our overall approach and three-fold strategy for delivering this goal. Our recent paper "Children out of School" identifies the different circumstances of children who are not in school and proposes an eight-point plan of international action for accelerating progress towards the target of universal primary education for all by 2015. Copies of both papers are available in the Library of the House.

 Children may be at risk from many forms of forced labour. Protection and rehabilitation in their former or new communities needs to be adapted to their particular circumstances, whether they are former bonded labourers, child soldiers or victims of trafficking.

 Concern has been expressed about child trafficking and slavery in a number of regions, including Gabon, Togo and Benin and other parts of West Africa. The Government are strongly committed to the elimination of child slavery and all forms of abusive or exploitative child labour. We are supporting the efforts of governments, working with our European partners and international bodies such as UNICEF and the International Labour Organisation, and voluntary agencies such as Anti-Slavery International, to end these practices, both in domestic and export industries.

 Combating sexual exploitation of children is part of a wider set of issues related to the vulnerability of poor people to the interests of the sex industry and national and international traffickers. It is an international problem requiring co-ordinated action. DFID's goal is to eliminate the poverty and social injustice that may lead to such abuses. Much of our focus is on reducing the risks of young people being recruited into the industry. With other Government Departments, we are supporting the efforts of Governments and international agencies to strengthen social protection policies and justice systems in line with the international treaty framework covering these issues.

<a name="20131w12.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2002]:</i> The amount of payment owed to individual providers is held as commercial in confidence. The ILA programme was closed on 23 November, not suspended. At the date of closure the total value of learning confirmed on the ILA Centre system was &#163;14.8 million. Payment of &#163;3.5 million for confirmed learning was made on 20 December to 1,383 learning providers, which is 91 per cent. of those who had confirmed learning up to 21 November. 136 provider claims with a total value of &#163;11.3 million are held while complaints and concerns about the learning delivered are investigated.

<a name="20131w12.html_para2">We have as a matter of priority carried out work to finalise checks of providers' claims made between 21 and 23 November to enable further payments to be made. The total amount of these claims is &#163;4.65 million, of which &#163;2.23 million was paid to 1,241 learning providers last week. This represents 94 per cent. of those who had confirmed learning by 23 November. A further 84 provider claims with a total value of &#163;2.42 million are held while complaints and concerns about the learning delivered are investigated.

<P>
<a name="20131w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Retaining good teachers within the profession is key to continuing to raise standards in schools. Our research has consistently shown that workload is a significant factor in influencing teachers to leave the profession. That is why we have asked the School Teachers' Review Body to consider the findings of the recent PricewaterhouseCoopers study that we commissioned into reducing teachers' workloads. The STRB will report to us by the end of April this year and we have already announced the piloting of 30 school work force pathfinders to test out innovative solutions to reducing work load and bureaucracy in schools. In addition, we made &#163;33 million available in 2001&#150;02 directly to schools in those parts of the country where problems are greatest to fund local recruitment and retention initiatives. We have recently announced a further &#163;44 million for 2002&#150;03. More than 3,500 teachers will also receive assistance to purchase homes in areas of high price or demand as part of the Government's &#163;250 million starter homes initiative. We have also announced our proposal to accept the STRB's recently announced recommendations, including a further above inflation pay increase of 3.5 per cent. for all teachers and that good, experienced, teachers should in future be able to receive a &#163;2,148 pay increase on crossing the threshold after five years instead of seven.

 Decisions about the individual placement of children with special educational needs and the pattern of provision to provide for their needs are determined locally. In promoting the inclusion of children with special educational needs the Government have sought to ensure excellence and choice. Greater inclusion does not mean it will be harder for parents whose children have a statement to secure a place for their child in a special school. Where appropriate local education authorities should name a special school in a child's statement. The Government have underlined that there is a vital and continuing role for special schools. We are encouraging and supporting special schools to become outward looking centres of excellence, their staff working in partnership with their mainstream colleagues.

 There are no powers or circumstances under which an Entry Clearance Officer may delay unnecessarily the implementation of an appeal decision made by an immigration adjudicator. However, there are a number of steps in the appeals procedure following an adjudication. Implementation is not instantaneous. There are circumstances in which an Entry Clearance Officer can refuse entry clearance subsequent to a decision by an immigration adjudicator to allow an appeal against refusal of entry clearance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on spending within the budget on the Nimrod MRA4 programme; how much liquidated damages the MOD is seeking for the project's delay from BAE; what alternative means of delivering MRA4 capability are being considered; and how much longer the project is expected to be delayed.  [30285]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w16.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The budgetary data being sought by the hon. Member are contained in the Ministry of Defence's Major Road Project Report 2001 under section 2&#151;"Project Costs", including information on the forecast receipt of liquidated damages. As to the question of further delay, the Major Project report also noted that the Department was engaged in discussions with BAE Systems over the incremental delivery of the MRA4 capability. These discussions are close to being finalised with the company. Until the negotiations have been completed, it will not be possible to be definitive about the impact, if any, on delivery.
<P>

<a name="20131w16.html_para0">There are no viable alternative means of delivery the MRA4 capability. Prior to selecting the MRA4 option, an investment appraisal was conducted that considered a full range of alternatives. The findings were conclusive and confirmed the requirement for MRA4. This view has not changed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on what grounds his Department dismissed the issue of retired officers or their widows who have continued to pay tax incorrectly on retired pay awarded since 1952 on the grounds of disability attributable to or aggravated by service in 1997.  [31462]

<a name="20131w16.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 As I explained in my statement in the House on 23 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 891&#150;902, with regard to tax exemption of Army attributable pensions, the error was uncovered by a retired Army pensioner, Major Perry. Our records show that Major Perry first raised the taxation of his service invaliding pension in December 1997. He then went through two stages of appeal at higher levels and at each his arguments were rejected. It was only when he made a further approach that the error was recognised. The issue turned on whether only Service Attributable Pensions were tax exempt or whether, as in Major Perry's case, Service Invaliding Pensions should also be exempt. At the initial appeal stages, the position with regard to the law was misinterpreted and the difference in practice between the Army on the one hand, and the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force on the other, had not become apparent. It was only in 1998 that the correct legal position was recognised and action to remedy the error put in hand. The point at issue was not straightforward. The error should, however, have been recognised when Major Perry first raised his concerns and I can only reiterate our apology to him and those other Army pensioners or their spouses affected.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w16.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Barker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) if he will make a statement on the investigations his Department has undertaken to ascertain the reasons for incorrect calculation of taxation under the relevant legislation of retired pay awarded to Army officers since 1952 on the grounds of disability attributable to or aggravated by service;  [31463]
<P>
<UL>(2) what steps his Department is taking to identify retired officers and their widows who have continued to pay tax incorrectly on retired pay awarded since 1952 on the grounds of disability attributable to or aggravated by service; and if he will commission an independent inquiry on this issue.  [31465]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w16.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has already reviewed the files of retired Army personnel and Army widows who had been in receipt of an invaliding pension; this involved some 20,000 files. When we identified the error in 1998, we provided information to ex-service and war widows' associations, who responded positively to our request to advertise the error to their members. We do not believe that there are many service personnel or their widows or widowers who have not been identified. None the less, we are keen to ensure that none has been missed. We have therefore provided details to help individuals identify if they might be affected on the MOD website. We intend to undertake national publicity shortly and we will use our service journals and other material which has a wide veterans' readership to ensure maximum coverage of this issue.
<P>

<a name="20131w16.html_para1">I do not intend to commission an independent inquiry on this matter.
<P>

<a name="20131w16.html_para2">The original error which allowed the taxation of Army attributable service invaliding pensions occurred in the early 1950s. At this distance, we would not expect all the relevant files to have been preserved and the Army personnel concerned will have retired and in many cases be deceased. Given the major changes to the way in which pensions are administered, over the period, I would also not expect there to be lessons of current relevance. I have, however, asked officials to assess whether there are any other pensions areas which may be similarly affected.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether widows of those who have died from asbestos-related diseases will be allowed to claim relating to pre-1987 matters; how many claims he expects to be submitted; and if he will make a statement  [31144]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w16.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Claims from widows of former service men whose husbands died after being exposed to asbestos before 15 May 1987 would be barred from pursuing a claim by section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947. This legal restriction does not apply to widows of former civilian employees of the Department.
<P>

<a name="20131w16.html_para3">The legal standing of section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 has been challenged in the High Court in the case of Matthew <i>v.</i> Ministry of Defence on the basis that section 10 is incompatible with the European convention on human rights. Judgment was handed down on 22 January 2002 in favour of the claimant, but the matter will now proceed to the Court of Appeal. Until such time as a higher authority has ruled upon the case, the Department's position concerning the settlement of claims predating the repeal on 15 May 1987 of section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 remains unchanged. The Ministry of Defence is not able to predict how many claims may be submitted if a court of higher authority rules against the Department.

<a name="20131w16.html_para4">A war pension and associated benefits is however available for the widows of former service men whose death was attributable to their service. Such pensions are administered by the War Pensions Agency.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what recent discussions he has had with his US counterpart on <i>(a)</i> the identification and treatment of and <i>(b)</i> compensation for Gulf War illness; and if he will make a statement.  [31485]<P>

<P>
<a name="20131w16.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Neither my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence nor any of his ministerial colleagues have had such discussions. However, the Ministry of Defence's Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Unit has a full time Gulf Health Liaison Officer based in Washington DC, working with the US Military Veterans Health Co-ordinating Board and its subcommittees. Both directly and through the liaison officer, the MOD maintains close links with the relevant US authorities, including the executive office of the President, the Department of Defense, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Veterans' Affairs on all issues surrounding the complex issue of Gulf veterans' illnesses.
<P>

<a name="20131w16.html_para5">No-fault compensations for UK service personnel disabled as a result of their service is provided through the War Pension Scheme (WPS). The WPS applies to all those who have served in the UK forces and is administered by the MOD's War Pensions Agency (WPA). As at 31 December 2001, the WPA had received 1,264 claims for war pension in respect of Gulf veterans' illnesses, of which 1,086 had resulted in an award. Veterans may also be eligible for an Armed Forces Pension Scheme occupational pension and, if they have been medically discharged, this is supplemented by

A revised incentivised cost-sharing arrangement has recently been agreed with the dockyard owner, DML, for the overall project.

Each facility will be commissioned and the necessary approval obtained from the nuclear regulatory authorities to meet this programme. There is no question of a particular facility being used without the appropriate regulatory approval.

Member states have offered national capabilities for potential EU-led operations and are now working together within the European Capabilities Action Plan to address the remaining shortfalls. The funding for any initiatives emerging from this process will be a matter for the member states involved.

 The European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) aims to enhance the ability of European nations to perform crisis management operations. The potential need for such operations remains. Many of the capabilities required by the Headline Goal would also be highly relevant in a military response to international terrorism.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w20.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 I am pleased to say the work of the Tax Law Rewrite Project continues to enjoy widespread support. In particular, the project's first Bill, on capital allowances, which received Royal Assent last March, has been well received by the tax community as a great improvement in clarity and accessibility.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w20.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Salmond: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many pages of tax law have been published since the inception of the Tax Law Rewrite Project; and of that number, how many have been drafted as part of the Tax Rewrite Project.  [31625]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w20.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Tax Law Rewrite Project began work in 1997 on rewriting direct tax legislation. Since that time approximately 2000 pages of Finance Act legislation has been enacted, covering both direct and indirect taxes, some of which incorporate the rewrite approach. In addition, the project's first Bill, on capital allowances, which received Royal Assent last March, runs to 333 pages. The aim is that the project's second Bill, concerning employment, pension and social security income, will be published in draft later this year.

 The original estimate was that it would take about five years to rewrite the main primary legislation on direct tax.

When enough evidence was obtained the perpetrators would be arrested. However, an unavoidable consequence of this investigative method was that unrecoverable arrears of duty could build up during the course of the investigation.

This was headed by John Roques, an ex senior partner of Deloitte and Touche. The report contained 65 recommendations to improve controls and the way that fraud is tackled in Customs. Mr. Roques concluded that there are circumstances where it is constructive and useful to observe the fraudulent movement of goods.

 In line with standing arrangements between the solicitor's office of HM Customs and Excise and the Attorney-General, a monthly schedule of 'sensitive' cases was generated within the solicitor's office and sent to the Attorney General's office on 14 March 2001. A number of cases which involved London City Bond were included as entries in this schedule. The Attorney-General wrote to the solicitor's office on 5 April 2001 asking for fuller details of these cases. A comprehensive note was prepared and sent to

<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w22.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Figures for the last 10 years are not available. Outward diversion fraud resulted from Single Market changes, which were only introduced from 1 January 1993. Customs investigated around 130 cases of outward diversion fraud between 1994 and 1998. After 1998 as a result of enhanced controls and the subsequent introduction of a strategic approach to countering fraud, patterns of fraud changed. It would not be in the public interest to reveal how many investigations into this type of fraud are in progress as this would assist fraudsters in evaluating the risk of perpetrating such frauds.

 A key approach of the Customs National Investigation Service (NIS) to tackling diversion frauds between 1995 and 1998 was to allow fraudsters to move goods from excise warehouses while under observation. When enough evidence was obtained the perpetrators would be arrested. The co-operation of warehousekeepers with Customs' investigators was an essential part in this approach. As they could have become liable for duty on these consignments, some of these warehousekeepers were given either explicit or implicit indemnities against liability for the duty evaded. In some cases the NIS conducted retrospective investigations, ie after the fraud had been stopped. The Villiers case was a retrospective investigation.
<P>

<a name="20131w22.html_para8">This investigative approach was examined by John Roques in his report on the Collection of Excise Duties in HM Customs and Excise. Mr. Roques concluded that there are circumstances where it is constructive and useful to observe the fraudulent movement of goods but made a three part recommendation on the subject of indemnities (Recommendation 30). This was accepted by Customs. Clearly defined authority levels for risking revenue were introduced in November 2000. A copy of the Roques report which includes the Government's response has been laid in the parliamentary Library.
<P>

<a name="20131w22.html_para9">Hauliers played a key role in a number of diversion frauds. In some cases the hauliers were the principals behind the fraud, in others they played a lesser though still essential role. Where the haulier was not the principal, Customs would attempt to identify the principals in order to put as complete a case as possible before the courts. It is ultimately for the courts to determine, on the evidence presented, the respective roles of the defendants.

 Available data are shown in the table. Figures are collected in respect of self-harm (which covers all acts of self-injury, however serious) and self-inflicted deaths: there is no separate definition of "attempted suicide". Figures in respect of self-injury from 1998 and in respect of self-inflicted deaths for the entire period are age related rather than location based because many young offenders are not located in Young Offender Institutions (YOIs). The definition of self-harm and recording practices are under review.

<P>
<a name="20131w24.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 A proactive strategy is in place to reduce suicide and self-harm in prison and make prisons safer for all who live and work there. The strategy target areas of greatest risk, recognising that prisoners under 21 years of age are especially vulnerable, whether or not located in Young Offender Institutions (YOIs). Feltham YOI and Eastwood Park, which holds young women offenders, are among five prisons selected as pilot sites for the installation of safer cells, first night support centres, crisis suites and cells that enable staff to monitor at risk prisoners. Other initiatives, which focus on the early period in custody, include physical improvements to reception and induction areas and removal of ligature points.
<P>

<a name="20131w24.html_para7">The Prison Service is bidding for funds to provide an extra 860 safer cells in 16 YOIs. The under 18 age group will additionally benefit from the Prison Service's joint working with the Youth Justice Board, which is investing &#163;1 million this financial year on safer cells. Work is also in hand on developing an effective cell sharing assessment tool; developing peer and outside support schemes suitable for young people; reducing violence and bullying; and improving identification and assessment of at risk young people and their care plans.

During 2001 such cases were on average dealt within three-four months. Regrettably at present it is taking up to eight weeks to decide new straightforward applications due to the exceptionally high number of new applications received during 2001, especially in recent months; and process changes that are being introduced to improve our longer term performance. We are working to reduce this timescale to three weeks or less as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="20131w24.html_para9">The asylum decision target for 2001&#150;02 is to make 60 per cent. of initial decisions in new substantive cases within two months of the date of application. We intend to publish provisional figures indicating progress over the first half of the year with the quarterly asylum statistics bulletin on 28 February 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 8 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 786W, on women prisoners, <i>(a)</i> for what crimes the 169 female prisoners were committed to prison in Wales, <i>(b)</i> how many had reoffended, <i>(c)</i> in what prisons they were placed and <i>(d)</i> how many spoke Welsh as their first language.

<a name="20131w25.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The table of the 169 women committed by courts in Wales and who were in the prison population on 30 November 2001, shows a breakdown by <i>(a)</i> offence and <i>(b)</i> establishment. Data on whether or not these women have been imprisoned after a reconviction are collected, but would take a few weeks to process. I shall therefore write to my hon. Friend with the information. Data on the languages spoken by prisoners are not collected centrally, and so cannot be provided.

It aims to deliver this by enhancing the delivery of economic prosperity, safe communities, high quality schools, decent housing, and better health to the poorest parts of the country.

 The pensions education campaign promotes the Government's aim to combat poverty and promote security and independence in retirement for future pensioners.

 Entitlement to Retirement Pension arises when a person attains pensionable age but to be entitled they have to make a claim. They can put off claiming their pension to earn increments. When they claim, each part of the pension is increased by about 7.5 per cent. for each full year of deferral.
<P>

<a name="20131w26.html_para14">Currently the maximum period for deferral is five years but from April 2010 there will be no time limit and the incremental rate will increase to about 10.4 per cent. for each full year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what actions he is taking to improve access to financial advice tailored to the needs of individuals contemplating taking out stakeholder pensions.  [31840]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w26.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Stakeholder pensions are a straightforward, good value, flexible product which need to adhere to certain minimum standards. These minimum standards mean that for many people less advice is necessary than that needed for personal pensions. For example the minimum standards will mean all stakeholder schemes should offer a good basic deal, and the simplification of tax rules means a single tax regime for all defined contribution pension schemes.
<P>

<a name="20131w26.html_para16">As a part of the minimum standards, all stakeholder pension scheme providers are required to provide, within the charge limit, information about the scheme and additional explanatory material. This will help individuals to decide whether a stakeholder scheme would be a good option for them.
<P>

<a name="20131w26.html_para17">We recognise that some people will need further advice. The Financial Services Authority (FSA), which regulates promotion and advice, has produced 'decision trees' to help individuals work through key questions on whether or not to join a stakeholder scheme, without necessarily requiring full individual advice. It has issued a consultation paper this month explaining how it proposes to keep them accurate and up-to-date.
<P>

<a name="20131w26.html_para18">In some cases there may be a need for individual- specific advice. Scheme providers may give this advice within the charge. It is also open to scheme providers to charge an additional fee for individual advice, or for individuals to seek advice, for a charge, from an independent financial adviser.

<i></i>[holding answer 24 January 2002]: The process of designing the new Jobcentre Plus service has focused on creating an environment that offers improved customer services, more pleasant working conditions and enhanced staff safety.
<P>

<a name="20131w27.html_para5">In designing both office layout and the service experienced by customers, the emphasis has been on eliminating the waiting times, queueing and referrals between offices, which can cause customer frustration and, very occasionally, confrontation. Evidence from the ONE pilots and from other countries suggests that such an approach has a direct and positive bearing on levels of disruptive customer behaviour.
<P>

<a name="20131w27.html_para6">The new model of service being delivered in Jobcentre Plus offices involves increased telephone contact facilities, booked appointments, dedicated floor managers in every office, nominated personal advisers, swifter benefit assessment while customers look for work and a major investment in IT to help in the jobsearch process.
<P>

<a name="20131w27.html_para7">Full risk assessments have been carried out in every Jobcentre Plus office and all of their individual recommendations implemented. In addition to security guards, where these have been recommended, safety measures implemented as a result of risk assessments include installation of closed circuit TV cameras and monitors, provision of discrete safety alarm systems, controlled segregation of staff areas via coded door locks and design of office layout to maximise safety.

 The importance of ensuring staff safety has underpinned the development of Jobcentre Plus at every stage. The improved customer services and environment of the new offices are both designed to reduce frustration among the small number of potentially aggressive customers. This has been underpinned by substantial investment in enhanced security measures such as CCTV, safety alarms and an improved security guard specification.
<P>

<a name="20131w27.html_para8">Full risk assessments were carried out in every office before the service opened to the public in October. Enhanced security measures identified as necessary by those assessments were implemented without exception.

<a name="20131w27.html_para9">All of the initial risk assessments are now being individually reviewed to take into account each office's experience of delivering the new service in practice and any additional recommendations will be implemented in full.

The reaction of staff and customers to the new offices has been overwhelmingly positive and the level of recorded incidents of unacceptable behaviour extremely low. New-style Jobcentre Plus offices will be rolled out nationwide over the next four years though no decisions have yet been taken as to when offices in Teesside will be redesigned. As part of the implementation of the new style Jobcentre Plus offices, trade unions and staff will be consulted on delivery plans and safety arrangements and full risk assessments will be undertaken in each office as has been the case in the Pathfinder offices which are already open.

<a name="20131w28.html_para1">The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union has regrettably taken strike action against plans to deliver Jobcentre Plus services from a predominantly unscreened environment. PCS asked their members in the Benefits Agency field organisation and the Employment Service to take strike action on 12 and 13 December 2001. In Teesside all Benefits Agency and Employment Service offices remained open to the public on these days.

 The Listed Places of Worship (LPW) Grant Scheme is largely being funded by the Treasury. This Department has been asked to make a small contribution to the costs of the scheme. We have asked English Heritage to help us meet this commitment, which they have chosen to do through the redirection of &#163;2 million in grant in aid from the Joint Places of Worship (JPOW) Scheme. Initial estimates are that the LPW scheme could be worth up to &#163;30 million per year. There is no cap on the scheme; all listed places of worship that meet the criteria will receive a grant.

 There is no specified maximum time or distance that patients might be expected to travel to a coronary care unit. Our aim is that in time the national health service should be able to offer all heart patients fair access to the surgical and other specialist services they need in a local unit and within an acceptable time. This is why we have developed a national strategy to expand the capacity to perform heart operations.
<P>

<a name="20131w30.html_para5">This capital investment programme means that we are investing &#163;230 million in 12 schemes to provide new and bigger heart surgery facilities.
<P>

<a name="20131w30.html_para6">In addition we have announced the patient choice scheme which means that from July appropriate patients who would otherwise have to wait more than six months will be able to choose to be treated in a different hospital so that they get treatment more quickly. This may involve travelling further, but only if the patient decides that is what they want to do.

 The creation of Essex health authority from 1 April 2002 is part of the national programme of implementing shifting the balance of power encompassing changes to the national health service at national, regional and local level. Taken together these changes will release &#163;100 million of savings from reducing bureaucracy.

<P>
<a name="20131w32.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department does not hold information centrally on the number of pay beds in the national health service. Laing and Buisson, who publish reviews on the independent healthcare sector, estimate that as of mid-June 2001 there were approximately 3,000 pay beds in the NHS, around 1,400 of which were in dedicated private patient units (PPUs). The remaining 1,600 beds were in ordinary NHS wards.
<P>

<a name="20131w32.html_para4">There are no national estimates on the income and related costs of pay beds in the national health service. Each NHS trust is responsible for ensuring that the income received for pay beds covers the direct costs involved plus a contribution towards overheads.

The Department does collect gross income information under the headings of 'non-NHS private patients' and 'non-NHS other'. No information is available on a net basis. 'Non-NHS patients' includes all income received and receivable for patient care services from private patients. 'Non-NHS other' includes a number of sources such as prescription charges in trusts, Road Traffic Act income (1996&#150;97 only), amenity bed charges, income from overseas patients which are not covered by reciprocal agreements and income from the capital hip care Centre (from 1998&#150;99).

Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes), <i>Official Report</i>, column 69W, what recent studies his Department has commissioned, undertaken and reviewed concerning the use of private finance within the national health service; and whether these demonstrate that the private finance option is better value for money when compared to the publicly funded alternative.  [31458]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w33.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department internally reviews all private finance initiative projects through the business case approval system as laid out in the Department's capital investment manual. To be approved, the business case must demonstrate that, overall, the private finance option is value for money when compared to the publicly funded alternative, the public sector comparator, and that it provides improved facilities for the national health service. NHS trusts are required to monitor performance throughout the lifetime of the PFI contract.
<P>

<a name="20131w33.html_para0">Because of PFI, eight major new hospitals have opened and another 15 are under construction, representing capital investment in the NHS of over &#163;2 billion.
<P>

<a name="20131w33.html_para1">The Department has commissioned no external studies into the use of PFI in the NHS.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health which NHS hospitals in England and Wales use <i>(a)</i> Cidex and <i>(b)</i> Gluteraldehyde as a disinfecting agent; what assessment he has made of the safety implications for staff and patients of its continued use; and if he will make a statement.  [30879]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w33.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2002]:</i> It is common practice within national health service hospitals to use chemicals to disinfect medical devices such as flexible endoscopes, and some surgical instruments where the device cannot be decontaminated by conventional methods which employ steam at high temperature. The most common chemical used is Gluteraldehyde, of which Cidex is a brand name. Information on which chemicals are used at individual hospitals in England is not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="20131w33.html_para2">Gluteraldehyde falls under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations and is subject to strict control and continuous monitoring at local level. An annual risk assessment is required of how this substance is being used in the clinical setting. Where operating procedures suggest that exposure risk from inhalation is high, there is a requirement under the Health and Safety at Work Act to undertake environmental

<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w33.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2002]:</i> Responsibility for the processing of data relating to patients at the Whittington hospital rests with the hospital, subject to guidance issued by the Department.

<P>

<a name="20131w33.html_para7">A "Keep Warm, Keep Well" campaign operates in England each winter which provides free booklets for the public and special literature for health professionals; a telephone helpline, and advice on how those most in need may apply for grants (such as the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme&#151;a scheme providing grants for comprehensive packages of insulation and heating improvements for those most vulnerable to cold-related ill health); advice on benefit payments; as well as the health benefits of keeping warm.

 <i>[holding answer 30 January 2002]:</i> The available information is given in the table. The figures are taken from the results of the Health Survey for England for 2000, the latest year for which figures are available, in which 6,201 adults aged over 25 were interviewed. The Health Survey for England provides estimates of the underlying population figures but because of small sample size it is not possible to represent the figures as a number of the total population.

 <i>[holding answer 30 January 2002]:</i> Officials from the south-east regional office have attended project board meetings on the new community hospital at New Forest primary care trust on four occasions between November 2001 and January 2002. Representatives of the health authority attended on three occasions during the same period. Representatives of the primary care trust also attended the health authority board meeting in December 2001 where the new hospital was discussed.
<P>

<a name="20131w34.html_para0">Formal commitment to revenue funding from primary care trusts is a mandatory part of the outline business case (OBC) and full business case submissions. These will not be approved unless it is included. The current Lymington Project has not yet had its OBC approved, although the levels of revenue funding agreed with Southampton and South West Hampshire health authority for the earlier project are included within primary care trust's commitments.
<P>

<a name="20131w34.html_para1">All appropriate guidance and support will be provided to the New Forest primary care trust throughout this process.

 The information requested is given in the table. The latest available information is for the year 2000&#150;01. Current waiting times for these operations will vary according to the hospital and consultant the patient is being treated by and the clinical priority of the patient.
<P>

Waiting time statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and waiting times for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment at a given point in time and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the waiting time as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<P>

Data for 1997&#150;98 are adjusted for both coverage and unknown/invalid clinical data; 1998&#150;99 to 2000&#150;01 figures are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<P>

<a name="20131w34.html_para3">This internal review was made available to&#151;and was overtaken by&#151;the independent investigation carried out by John Roques into the collection of excise duties (the results of which were published in July 2001 as CM 5239). As a consequence there are no plans to publish it.

<a name="20131w35.html_wqn0"><B> Helen Southworth: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he intends to consult on perceived abuses of defamation procedures.  [33183]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20131w35.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor has today written to the Law Commission asking them to undertake a scoping study to consider whether there are any problems arising from the use of intimidatory tactics, such as gagging writs and gagging letters. A copy of the terms of reference for this work has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The Law Commission will produce a short paper by the end of March 2002. It will also undertake some preliminary work with a view to a possible further scoping study on defamation and other issues arising from publication on the internet.
<P>

<a name="20131w35.html_para0">Concerns over gagging writs were originally raised during the passage of the Defamation Act 1996. The Government subsequently announced that they intended to consult publicly on the perceived abuses of defamation procedures. We have since reconsidered the scope of the project, in the light of the rapidly developing case law in the field, to ensure that it deals aptly with all relevant areas of concern, including those raised by advances in electronic communication.
