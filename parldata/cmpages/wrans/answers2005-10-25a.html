<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51025w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Defra has overall policy responsibility for flood and coastal erosion risk in England, funds most of the Environment Agency&#039;s flood management activities (including for flooding from the sea) and provides grant aid on a project by project basis to local authorities for their coastal defence improvement projects. Defra does not build defences, direct the authorities on which specific projects to undertake nor in general specify the materials and techniques to be used.

<p>
<a name="51025w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The Government encourage authorities to consider a variety of options when considering solutions. A key point is that authorities should work with natural processes wherever possible and the use of beaches to absorb wave energy is a widely used &quot;soft&quot; technique. However, Defra does not hold information centrally on the various other techniques that might be in use and I regret that I cannot answer the question in more detail without incurring disproportionate cost.

Residual life is currently considered to be between 25 years and 1,000 years for different sections. There are secondary defences in place for the defences of lower standard which provide a minimum of 40 to 60 years residual life.

Under current EU law, as agreed by EU member states, the only legitimate grounds for narrowing the geographical scope of an approval to prevent cultivation in a defined zone are the production of clear evidence that the GM crop involved poses a particular risk to the specific area in question. In the Austrian case, the European Court of Justice found that Austria had not demonstrated the existence of any such risks to the region of Upper Austria.

To date, 36 UK products have been registered so far including Stilton Cheese, Cornish Clotted Cream and West Country Farmhouse Cheddar. A further 21 applications are being considered. Although this is lower than some of the southern European member states who have a much longer tradition of using geographical indications and, arguably, a structure and culture of production more attuned to their protection, it does compare well with quite a number of other member states.

 The UK, together with other EU and G8 countries, has been working on solutions to the problems of illegal logging and the associated trade in illegally harvested timber for several years. This work, much of it supported by funding from the Department for International Development (DFID), has sought to understand the severity and scale of the problem, and also the consequences of possible solutions in order to inform policy development. Most relevant research is displayed on the independent website run by the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House and supported by the Department for International Development (DFID): www.illegal-logging.info

<a name="stpa_27">It is difficult to make exact measurements of the scale of illegal logging and estimates must be based on indirect data. The Government have therefore contributed to an international study on discrepancies in trade statistics, co-ordinated by the International Tropical Timber Organisation, as well as specific studies of the scale of illegal logging in Indonesia and NW Russia. These studies combined trade data with techniques such as remote sensing, and have also looked at the consequences of illegal logging for the economies of the countries concerned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51025w03.html_para15">
<a name="stpa_28">The Government have also led on research to evaluate potential solutions. These studies have looked at the compliance with WTO rules of possible trade measures, the applicability of anti-money laundering legislation, and the role of improved due diligence by the financial community in evaluating forest sector investments. Studies of the impacts on markets of measures currently being implemented to tackle the problem, for example the UK&#039;s public timber procurement policy, are currently under way&#151;and these indicate that our policies are effective, not only in changing the market here, but also in improving enforcement in timber producing countries.

<a name="stpa_45">The Government take the issue of child welfare and safety very seriously. We believe we need to make safeguarding everyone&#039;s business. Encouraging all organisations to have good systems and clear guidance in place forms a vital part of this. Local and national guidance for safeguarding and promoting welfare of children is based upon the provisions set out in the Children Act 1989 and the Children Act 2004. We are currently consulting on the Government&#039;s main guidance &#039;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; which sets out the overarching systems and roles that different agencies play in keeping children safe.

<a name="stpa_48">The 2004/05 PE and School Sport Survey of schools in School Sport Partnerships found that cricket was the second most popular sport (behind football) for which schools had formal links with sports clubs, with 46 per cent. of schools having links with a local cricket club. The survey also found that 85 per cent. of schools provided cricket for their pupils, either in lesson time or after school. This was the sixth most popular sport provided in schools. Copies of the results of the survey have been placed in the House Libraries.

 Delaying to 2025 the introduction of a normal pension age (NPA) of 65 for members of the Teachers&#039; Pensions Scheme would not reflect Government policy or be consistent with the principles agreed at the Public Services Forum. Those principles provide for NPA 65 to be introduced for new entrants as soon as practicable; and the pension terms of existing members to be discussed in scheme specific negotiations. The estimated net present value of the savings arising from reform of the public service schemes is expected to be around &#163;13 billion over the next 50 years.

<a name="stpa_55">Savings to the Exchequer from introducing NPA 65 from 2025 have not been estimated and could be done only at disproportionate cost.

 My Department does not collect the number or nature of confiscated items taken from school pupils.
