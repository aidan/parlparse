<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="81022w0001.htm_para10"><a name="08102249000111">There are no current plans for Health Ministers to meet with the food supplements industry. The FSA meets regularly with the food supplements industry to discuss issues relating to food supplements, including the work on setting maximum levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="81022w0001.htm_para11"><a name="08102249000112">We have been advised by the FSA that member states were not consulted by the European Commission before the commencement of the Commission&#146;s impact assessment exercise in summer 2008. The FSA has met with the contractor appointed by the European Commission to carry out the work and provided details of United Kingdom stakeholders who could provide the data on the food supplements which are currently being marketed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="81022w0001.htm_para12"><a name="08102249000113">The FSA has not made an assessment of the options put forward in the European Commission&#146;s impact assessment exercise and their impact on specialist manufacturers and retailers and consumer choice. An assessment of the likely impact will be made when the specific levels being proposed by the European Commission are available. These will be set out in European Commission proposals, which are currently expected in January 2009, on which the FSA will consult fully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"><a name="81022w0001.htm_para13"><a name="08102249000114">In advance of the Commission publishing its proposals, an ad hoc technical working group comprising a small number of member states has been established which met for the first time on 15 October 2008. A further technical working group meeting has been suggested for late November 2008 and it is envisaged that the outputs of these meetings will then be reported back to all member states at a full working group meeting, a date for which is yet to be advised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="81022w0001.htm_para14"><a name="08102249000115">A meeting was held on 11 April 2008 between officials from the Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man Governments and those of the FSA, MHRA and Ministry of Justice. Officials representing the Government of Jersey indicated that a major update of food safety legislation was under way in Jersey and that both the Food Supplements Directive and the Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation are to be implemented as part of this exercise. Discussions at official level regarding the implementation of the legislation in Guernsey are ongoing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="81022w0001.htm_para15"><a name="08102249000116">The MHRA has written to the Government of Jersey to begin discussions with them on the implementation of the Medicines Directive 2001/83/EC. During 2007 and 2008, the MHRA has had written discussions and a series of meetings with the Government of Guernsey over the implementation of the Medicines Directive. The MHRA believes that Guernsey&#146;s proposed medicines law will receive Royal Assent in the near future. The MHRA will continue to assist the Government of Guernsey in the development of the additional legislation required for implementation of the Medicines Directive.</p>

<i> [holding answer 13 October 2008]: </i>During 2007-08, the busy message was played to 29 per cent. of call attempts to the child benefit helpline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"><a name="81022w0004.htm_para3"><a name="08102249000560">Service levels on the child benefit helpline have been affected over the last 12 months by a variety of different factors. These include increased customer demand and longer call handling times following the introduction of enhanced security arrangements after HMRC&#146;s data loss in 2007. When the number of callers is high, as it has been on the child benefit helpline, calls are more likely to go unanswered with a higher number of busy messages played. Customers who cannot get through on their first attempt often use the rapid redial facility on their telephone to make numerous successive calls and this rapidly increases the number of unanswered calls and busy messages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_391"><a name="81022w0004.htm_para4"><a name="08102249000561">HMRC&#146;s latest contact centre customer survey, covering March to August 2008, shows that over 91 per cent. of callers were satisfied with the service they received from the child benefit helpline. The Department has, however, developed plans to further improve the service provided on the helpline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"><a name="81022w0004.htm_para5"><a name="08102249000562">These plans include allocation of an extra 50 advisers to the helpline by the end of the year; improving links between contact centres and the child benefit processing office to provide a better customer service; providing a set of automated messages on the helpline to enable callers to get basic relevant information about child benefit without needing to wait for or talk to an adviser and directing customers to the newly improved child benefit content on the HMRC website, which includes an improved payment date tracker. These measures will reduce the number of busy messages played to customers and enable more customers to speak to an adviser more quickly, should they need to.</p>

Most cases seen today are attributable to infection picked up abroad or reactivation of infection in older people who contracted the infection before the introduction of milk pasteurisation. Despite the low risk there are robust controls in place to protect public health. These include regular testing of cattle herds and early removal of test reactors; cattle movement controls; a cattle tracing system; slaughterhouse inspections; controls on meat and milk; and occupational health controls. DEFRA works in liaison with a number of Government Departments including the Health Protection Agency, Department of Health, Food Standards Agency and Health and Safety Executive, to help protect the public from contracting infection caused by <i> M. bovis</i>.</p>

Revisions to the draft strategy are being made to reflect the results of the consultation, after which the revised draft will be discussed with key stakeholders.

This involves a review of the 30 restricted areas in existence around the English coast to protect juvenile bass. The first stage of this process has just been completed, involving questionnaires being sent to Sea Fisheries Committees and the Marine Fisheries Agency in coastal regions of England, to identify whether amendments to the existing areas, or new areas, are needed. Full consultation with stakeholders will take place in the new year once the results of the first stage of the process have been assessed.</p>

 The military regime is determined to maintain its hold on power regardless of the cost and suffering of the people of Burma. The junta's &#145;Roadmap to disciplined democracy', including a new constitution and elections planned for 2010, is designed to entrench military rule behind a facade of civilian government. The process excludes the opposition and meaningful participation by the ethnic groups. Fundamental rights are consistently ignored. Over 2,000 political prisoners remain in detention, including opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and other pro-democracy leaders. Ethnic minority groups have been methodically marginalised. Against this backdrop, we will continue to do all we can to generate international pressure for a peaceful transition to democracy and respect for human rights in Burma. In particular, we will continue to give our full support to the UN Secretary-General and his efforts to break the current deadlock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_452"><a name="81022w0011.htm_para1"><a name="08102251000715">The humanitarian situation is of serious concern across the country. One third of the country&#146;s population lives on less than one third of a dollar a day, 10 per cent. do not have enough to eat, half of Burma's 20 million children do not complete primary school, and 70 per cent. of the population is at risk from malaria. The protests of August and September 2007 were sparked by this ever increasing poverty, and people's deep frustration with the economic and political failures of the Burmese regime. Relief aid for those affected by Cyclone Nargis, which struck Burma in May, is now getting through with greater co-operation from the Burmese regime than it showed in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. However, as many as 300,000 people remain highly vulnerable. The UK is committed to supporting the post-Cyclone Nargis relief effort and remains the biggest bilateral donor, contributing &#163;45 million. UK aid for Cyclone Nargis is delivered through the UN, Red Cross and international and local non-governmental organisations to ensure that relief supplies are properly distributed to cyclone victims and do not benefit the regime.</p>

 The Cuban Government retains tight control over information about their prisons. It is therefore difficult to put an exact figure on the number of political prisoners. Four prisoners of conscience were conditionally released during 2007 and subsequently exiled to Spain. However, Amnesty International consider, in their latest 2008 report, that there are at least 62 prisoners of conscience currently in Cuba.</p>

This is consistent with reporting we have received from our embassy in Havana.</p>

 The issue of Western Sahara, while not discussed within the context of Advanced Status, remains an integral part of the political dialogue between the EU and Morocco. Western Sahara was discussed during the EU-Morocco Association Council on 13 October.

The EU further stated that UN Security Council resolution 1813 provided an appropriate framework for future discussions within the UN and called for every effort possible to resolve this long-standing conflict.</p>

 From December 2004, the standard interest rate (SIR) used to calculate support for mortgage interest payments in income support, income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance and state pension credit was changed to respond to changes in the Bank of England base rate. The SIR is the Bank of England base rate plus an additional 1.58 per cent. This is more representative, transparent, easier to understand and easier to administer than the previous method, which was based upon an average of building society interest rates. The additional 1.58 per cent. recognises the fact that lenders&#146; interest rates are set at a higher rate than the base rate and to ensure that no-one lost out when the method of calculation changed.</p>

of the average building society interest rate. Nor does it need to lay regulations to change the SIR. As soon as the Bank of England announces a change which triggers a move in the SIR, action is taken to amend the relevant departmental computer systems. This has reduced the implementation time by approximately four weeks compared to the pre-December 2004 arrangements. Changes are normally implemented in about five weeks from the Bank of England&#146;s announcement.</p>

1. Pension credit replaced income support for people over 60/minimum income guarantee in 2003-04. Figures include spending on men aged 60 to 64.<br>
2. The main reason for the decline in the payment of widow's and bereavement benefits from 2002-03 is due to changes in the criteria for receipt of the benefits. Widow's benefit is now closed to new claimants, who now receive a bereavement benefit instead. In addition, persons in receipt of widow's and bereavement benefits now receive state pension on reaching state pension age. Previously, persons in receipt of widow's benefit continued to receive this benefit on reaching state pension age and did not receive a state pension. Also, a declining mortality rate means a slight reduction in the numbers claiming these benefits.<br>
3. Over 75 TV licences expenditure is on a UK basis, and was introduced in 2000-01.<br>
4. Christmas bonus comprises of contributory and non-contributory payments and includes all payments made including a small amount to people not of pension age.<br>
5. Carer's allowance replaced invalid care allowance in 2002-03. Consistent estimates of payment of the benefit to pensioners are only available from 2003-04.<br>

 Tackling pensioner poverty continues to be one of this Government's key priorities. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_495"><a name="81022w0015.htm_para1"><a name="08102264000316">The Government have introduced a number of measures to help older people out of poverty. In 1997, the poorest pensioners lived on around &#163;69 a week, today pension credit ensures that no-one needs to live on less than &#163;124.05 a week (&#163;189.35 for a couple). We have successively raised the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit at least in line with earnings in every year since its introduction, and the value of the safety-net we provide for the poorest pensioners has increased by over a third in real terms since 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_496"><a name="81022w0015.htm_para2"><a name="08102264000317">We have made good progress in tackling pensioner poverty. Between 1998-99 and 2006-07 the number of pensioners in low income in the UK has fallen from 2.9 million to 2.1 million (measured by 60 per cent. of contemporary median income after housing costs.)</p>

<p><a name="stpa_497"><a name="81022w0015.htm_para3"><a name="08102264000318">Our commitments in the Pensions Act 2007 to continue to uprate the pension credit standard minimum guarantee at least in line with earnings over the long term, and to reintroduce the earnings link to basic state pension from 2012, or by the end of the next Parliament, will help secure the gains we have made into the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_498"><a name="81022w0015.htm_para4"><a name="08102264000319">We will continue to strive to ensure that older people are aware of, and take up their entitlements through initiatives such as: using sophisticated data matching to identify those who may be entitled to, but not currently receiving, benefits; home visits for vulnerable customers; local and national advertising and media campaigns; a simple and straight-forward claim process; and ever closer working with partner organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_499"><a name="81022w0015.htm_para5"><a name="08102264000320">In addition to pension credit we have increased winter fuel payments to &#163;200 for households with someone aged 60-79, and &#163;300 for those with someone aged 80 or over. We will be making an additional payment for winter 2008-09 of &#163;50 for households with someone aged 60 to 79 and &#163;100 for those with someone aged 80 or over. Since 1997, we have also introduced free eye-tests, free off-peak bus travel for pensioners and free television licences for over 75s.</p>

 Addressing pensioner poverty has been one of the Government's key priorities since 1997. The number of pensioners in relative low income has fallen from 2.9 million in 1998-99 to 2.1 million in 2006-07. Pensioners are less likely to be in poverty, as measured by relative incomes after housing costs are accounted for, than the population as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_500"><a name="81022w0015.htm_para6"><a name="08102264000323">Maximising the take-up of benefits is crucial to tackling poverty levels. Since pension credit was introduced in 2003 the number of pensioners in relative low income has fallen by around 500,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_501"><a name="81022w0015.htm_para7"><a name="08102264000324">We are making every effort to ensure that people are aware of and claim their entitlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_502"><a name="81022w0015.htm_para8"><a name="08102264000325">We have simplified the claim process to make pension credit easier to claim. Customers no longer need to sign and return their pension credit claim forms, claims can be made entirely over the phone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_503"><a name="81022w0015.htm_para9"><a name="08102264000326">This autumn 2008, we are introducing a measure which will enable claims to housing benefit and council tax benefit made over the phone with pension credit to be forwarded directly to the local authority without the need for a signature&#151;this is a significant simplification to the claim process and should benefit thousands of pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_504"><a name="81022w0015.htm_para10"><a name="08102264000327">In February 2007, an additional question was introduced in the pension credit application process to identify relevant caring responsibilities in order to invite the customer, where appropriate, to claim carer's allowance using a new, shortened, claim pack specifically designed for people of pension age.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income data.<br>
2. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. The reference period for Household Below Average Income figures is single financial years. Three survey year averages are given for each of the regions as robust single year estimates cannot be produced because of volatility in estimates. This will mean the Great Britain and United Kingdom totals will differ from the single year estimates published in the &#147;Households Below Average Income 1994/95-2006/07&#148; report.<br>
4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#147;Households Below Average Income&#148; series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &#145;equivalised&#146;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living. Median incomes are used as the national average in the publication.<br>
5. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br>
6. Figures have been presented on both a Before Housing Cost and After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Cost they are.<br>
7. Number of children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 children.<br>
8. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

The bulk of the funding remains within the overall local government formula grant settlement. Additionally, the Department for Transport provides a special grant totalling &#163;212 million in 2008-09 based on generous assumptions around fares, pass take-up, extra journeys and additional costs.

 The 1998 Transport White Paper, &#147;A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone&#148;, established a programme of de-trunking to allow the Highways Agency to concentrate on the operation of a strategic road network that links the main centres of population and major transport hubs. The programme enables local highway authorities to set priorities for routes that primarily serve local needs, and supports the Government&#146;s aim to devolve more responsibilities to local communities.</p>

 The information requested on arrests is not available centrally. Information on arrests held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform is based on aggregated quarterly data collected at police force area level covering persons arrested for recorded crime (notifiable offences) by gender, specific age groups (under 10,10-17,18-20, 21 and over and unknown), ethnicity and by main offence group only. The collection does not record whether DNA profiles were added to the National DNA Database (NDNAD) at the time of arrest.</p>

There are currently arrangements in place at selected ports to benchmark performance. The three ports referred to in your question are using a 45 minute (non-EEA) and 25 minute (EEA) queuing time as such a benchmark. This is the maximum wait time in which we aim to process passengers and in turn informs staff deployment, as well as informing considerations on further investment. We are clear that the averages are well within these benchmarks but will continue to work on reducing the occasions where those figures are exceeded.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 October 2008]:</i><i> </i>The police use of Taser is limited to trained officers in accordance with Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) guidance. That guidance is clear that Taser use is currently restricted to authorised firearms officers (AFOs) where a firearms authority has been granted in accordance with criteria laid down in the ACPO Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms. In addition AFOs are able to deploy Taser in operations or incidents where the use of firearms is not authorised, but where they are facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use force to protect the public, themselves or the subject. A trial of the deployment of Taser in 10 police forces to specially trained police units not composed of firearms officers, for use when facing similar threats of violence, is currently being evaluated. The use of Taser in the trial is subject to the authority level of the appropriate authorising officer, thus placing it at the same authority level as for a firearms incident.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) has provided &#163;250,000 in direct humanitarian aid to Cuba through the International Red Cross for shelter material and water filters for some 40,000 people. In addition, the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO) has announced a relief contribution of &#8364;2 million, of which 17.5 per cent. is funded by DFID. The United Nations Relief Agencies have mobilised $8.6 million for relief and rehabilitation works in Cuba, $1.6 million of which is funded by DFID through the UN. However, the UN remains in negotiation with the Cuban authorities on full access and co-operation in order to use that money. We also understand that the Cuban Government has received offers totalling $30.5 million from a number of countries to assist with their reconstruction and emergency response efforts following the impact of the recent hurricanes.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) has made no advance budget support payments in support of the food crisis this year, since those countries most affected by the crisis are not currently budget support recipients.

Health and educational services are under severe strain and the economy has been severely affected by crossing restrictions. Since the ceasefire began in June there have been some improvements. For example, projects to repair sewage treatment facilities have restarted and fuel supplies to the Gaza power plant have increased. However, the overall flow of humanitarian supplies, commercial goods and people into Gaza has only improved marginally.</p>

Due to falling incomes and continuing rises in food prices, people in the west bank now spend 56 per cent. of their income on food. Movement and access restrictions continue to hold back economic growth and to affect the daily life of ordinary Palestinians. In August, the United Nations counted 630 physical obstacles such as roadblocks and checkpoints in the west bank. This is almost 68 per cent. higher than when the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access was signed.</p>

 Widespread violence continues to cause large-scale displacements and restrict humanitarian access. Across Darfur, over 270,000 have been newly displaced so far in 2008. In September, fighting between government forces and rebel groups in North Darfur displaced tens of thousands and hindered humanitarian access. In the last two weeks, militia attacks have increased in South Darfur, displacing thousands. The World Food Programme (WFP) expects that it will not be able to reach 450,000 intended beneficiaries with food aid in September.</p>

 The Teachers&#146; Pension Scheme is unfunded, so when benefits fall due for payment they are met from Government revenues. There is no actual pension fund or deficit.

 Teachers themselves are best placed to decide how to personalise their teaching and to select appropriate interventions from a range of approaches and support mechanisms. The Department will publish practical guidance on personalising learning for school leaders, School Improvement Partners and teachers in November. The Assessing Pupils&#146; Progress (APP) materials provide teachers with an effective tool to help them form robust judgments about pupils&#146; progression through national curriculum levels and sub-levels. Teachers are able to see a pupil&#146;s relative strengths and weaknesses and it is this diagnostic potential of APP, linked to clear routes for progression through the levels, which enables teachers to personalise teaching to address pupils&#146; strengths and weaknesses, and so support them to make the best possible progression.</p>

 There are provisions in the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 to simplify the current system for enforcing unpaid employment tribunal awards in the county court. Once implemented these provisions will allow the applicant to go straight to enforcement rather than through registration at a county court. Additionally, for the first time, the award will be registered on the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines. Inclusion on this register, which is often consulted by banks, building societies and credit companies when considering applications for credit, may make it more difficult for defaulters to obtain credit and therefore provides an incentive to pay the sum due. This provision will ease the burden on the recipients of tribunal awards and it is intended to implement this provision in April 2009.</p>
