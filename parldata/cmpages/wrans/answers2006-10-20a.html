so as to introduce the new regime. The Communications Act 2003 is

secured funding to reduce racial harassment. The local Racial Equality
Council is delivering this work on the CSP&#146;s
behalf.</p><p><a name="06102045000816">The police
have a dedicated Public Protection Unit dealing with domestic violence,
predatory offenders and serious child abuse. With probation and other
partners, they also participate in a multi-agency public protection

violent crimes are investigated by the CID in the Basic Command Unit,

reported.</p><p><a name="06102045000817">Milton

several teams and gain experience in areas of law relevant to the Home

sensitivity, complexity or novelty of an issue, specialist legal advice
is obtained from members of the bar (who are selected from a panel
appointed by the Attorney-General), from solicitors in private practice
(drawn from a list of firms approved by the Treasury Solicitor) or from
lawyers in other Government Departments.</p><p><a name="06102045000825">All lawyers

Recording (NSIR), which is being implemented by police forces during
2006-07. This is in addition to notifiable wildlife crimes, which
continue to be recorded under the National Crime Recording Standard.
This standard recording of all wildlife crime and incidents represents
a significant step forward as previously only the recording of a

receiving a state pension are entitled to carer's allowance if they
satisfy the usual conditions of entitlement. However, since both
benefits serve the same purpose of providing a measure of income
replacement, they cannot both be paid in full. In practice, the state
pension takes precedence as the contributory benefit and is paid in
full while only the balance of any carer's allowance is paid if it
exceeds the state
pension.</p><p><a name="06102045000886">Although this
often means that carer's allowance is not paid at all, since 2002 the
underlying entitlement to the benefit gives access to the carer's
additional amount of &#163;26.35 a week in pension credit and to the
carer premium of the same amount in income support, housing benefit and
council tax benefit.</p>

Bradshaw:</b> On 11 October, there were six vehicles carrying
14 consignments of calves (totalling 1,167 animals). The consignments
were destined for Belgium, France and Spain and spent between nine and
a half and 15 hours at Dover
port.</p><p><a name="06102045002224">The ship's
departure was delayed for a number of reasons. Its sailing from Dover
was originally delayed due to the late arrival of a vehicle. The vessel
then had to leave its berth to accommodate another ferry and, on its
return, had to wait for the tide to rise sufficiently for the loading
ramp to be used. At Dunkerque, a further delay was caused when the
pilot was diverted to other essential duties. On return to Dover, staff
from the State Veterinary Service (SVS) re-examined the animals to
check their condition before departure. Before this check could be
completed, the vessel had to leave berth again to accommodate a ferry
before the calves could finally be loaded and the ship could
depart.</p><p><a name="06102045002225">All the calves
were considered to be unweaned. During the morning, SVS staff at Dover
considered that they needed to be fed and offered liquid. However,
there is no staging point in the south east and no facility within the
port to make up warm milk formula. No single UK staging point could
take all the animals so the vehicles were sent to the nearest suitable
staging

Howells:</b> A number of studies have investigated the
linkages between the illicit and the legal economies in Afghanistan.
The World Bank Country Economic Report "Afghanistan: State Building,
Sustaining Growth and Reducing Poverty" and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Selected Issues Paper 2006: "Macroeconomic Impact of the
Drug Economy and Counter-Narcotics Efforts" suggest that the opium
economy is a major source of investment in durable goods, housing,
construction and trade. Income generated in the illicit sector fuels
higher consumption (spending) in the economy, creating more demand for
locally produced goods and imports. However, they also emphasise that
the negative effects of the opium economy&#151;insecurity, diminished
respect for the ruleof law and weak state
institutions&#151;undermine the investment climate and reduce the
prospects for equitable and sustained growth. Furthermore, a large part
of the income generated by exporting opium is invested abroad by
traffickers, which is effectively &#145;capital flight&#146; out of
the country. The IMF and the World Bank conclude that, in economic
terms, the drug trade causes more damage than benefit to the Afghan
economy. It is worth noting since 2002 the growth of the licit sector
at double digit rates has meant that opium as a share of total economic
activity has declined from nearly 40 per cent. to just over 25 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06102045002343"><b><a name="61020w0013.htm_spnew565"><a name="06102045002848">Mr.

Reliable electricity supply is being restored. The telecommunications

pay and rank review is underway, aiming to reduce the current top-heavy
structure and raise police salaries in order to attract the best
candidates. An international conference on border management and police
was co-hosted by Afghanistan and Germany in Qatar in February. It
endorsed the findings that replenishment of the Law and Order Trust
Fund, used to partly fund police salaries, was critical to the success
of police pay and rank reform. We support this finding and the valuable
work that the international community, in particular Germany and the
US, are putting into police training and

review of the Afghan Government National Solidarity Programme (NSP)
assessed in detail women&#146;s inclusion in the Community
Development Councils (CDCs) that had been established under the

women&#146;s participation in the processes of community
decision-making and project implementation, and limited allocation of
project funds for women. Slow progress in the area of women's
participation was attributed mainly to cultural opposition. In some
cases only small and unsustainable projects for women were accepted by
the communities. However, gradual change is occurring as the NSP gains
community
acceptance.</p><p><a name="06102045002355">In
response to the review, DFID has endorsed the recommendation for more
effort to be placed on improving women&#146;s participation, but this
has to be done gradually to ensure communities do not respond
negatively. DFID has also endorsed the recommendation that, where
necessary, female-only CDCs can be created. Those female-only CDCs that
have already been established have become a forum for discussion on
other relevant issues (health, domestic violence, literacy, etc.) that
women could not discuss openly before in some mixed gender
CDCs.</p><p><a name="06102045002356">One

monitors the levels of violence and conflict related deaths. The
numbers of deaths cited in the UN Human Rights Reports are taken from
Iraqi Ministry of Health figures. Maintaining records of civilian
deaths in Iraq is ultimately a matter for the Government of Iraq and we
believe they are best placed to monitor the situation. In many conflict
situations it would be impossible to make a reliably accurate
assessment either of the civilian casualties resulting from any
particular attacks or of the overall civilian casualties of a conflict.
This is true in the security conditions that exist in Iraq. It is
unlikely that an independent body could gain better access than the
Iraqi Ministries, including the Ministry of Health, which collates
information from some 180 hospitals across the country.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61020w0013.htm_wqn8"><a name="06102045000168">Lebanon</h3><p><a name="06102045002379"><b><a name="61020w0013.htm_spnew589"><a name="06102045002872">Andrew

Benn:</b> I have been asked to
reply.</p><p><a name="06102045002392">On 20
September, the Quartet (EU, UN, US and Russia) met in New York and
endorsed the continuation and expansion of the Temporary International
Mechanism (TIM) for a three-month period, and agreed to again review
the need for such a mechanism at the end of that
period.</p><p><a name="06102045002393">The EU had
already expanded the TIM in response to the G8 statement of 16 July.
The scope was widened to include more of the poorest Palestinian
Government workers. Workers in the medical sector, PA employees who
earn less than 2,000 New Israeli Shekels a month, pensioners, and
recipients of welfare from the Palestinian Ministry of Social Affairs
have received allowances through the TIM. This totals 98,000
recipients. Their allowances help them to continue working, to provide
their families with a modest income and help to inject money into the
Palestinian
economy.</p><p><a name="06102045002394">In the light
of the serious humanitarian situation in the Occupied Palestinian
Territories, the EU is considering how further to expand the TIM.
Officials discussed the issue in Brussels on 10 October. The plans
currently under consideration would increase the number of recipients
of TIM allowances considerably while maintaining the rigorous auditing
procedures that have been applied so far. The World Bank is expected to
provide support to the water, sanitation and electricity sectors and to
deliver essential medical supplies in
November.</p><p><a name="06102045002395">As I
reported to the House on 9 October, the UK has committed a total of
&#163;9 million to the TIM. Of this, &#163;3 million is for
allowances to the poorest Palestinian Government workers; &#163;3
million is for essential medical supplies and &#163;3 million is for
water, sanitation and electricity. I intend to allocate a further
&#163;3 million to the TIM as the need for further funding arises.
This is in addition to the UK&#146;s contribution to European
Community support. European Community support to the Palestinians in
2006 totals more than &#8364;340 million. This is considerably more
than the European Community has given on average in recent
years.</p><br>

Government of Sudan should also agree to a UN force in Darfur. It is
not true that this would violate Sudan&#146;s sovereignty. The
African Union itself has consistently called for a UN mission in
Darfur. The international community has made clear its full respect for
Sudan&#146;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. A UN force would
be in Darfur to help implement the peace agreement and restore peace
and security so that people can begin to rebuild their
lives.</p><p><a name="06102045002422"><b><a name="61020w0014.htm_spnew621"><a name="06102045002904">John

McCartney:</b> In September 2006, a UN panel of experts
reported the recruitment of child soldiers by parties to the conflict
in Darfur. Recruitment of child soldiers is a breach of international
humanitarian law and explicitly prohibited by article 24 of the Darfur
Peace Agreement (DPA). We have regularly made clear to the Government
of Sudan that we expect it to uphold the commitments it has made under,
in particular, the convention on the rights of the child and its
optional protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict. We
have also told the Sudan Liberation Army and Justice and Equality
Movement that the recruitment and use of child soldiers is wholly
unacceptable and in contravention of their obligations under the Abuja
Security protocol of 8 November 2004, which commits both movements and
the Government to stop recruiting children as
combatants.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61020w0014.htm_wqn7"><a name="06102045000176">Tom
