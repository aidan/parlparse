Primary and Secondary codes replaced codes for Care and Mobility and more fine detail was introduced with respect to disabling condition. Prior to October 2008, there were fewer than 50 categories for disabling condition, but now there are over 500. This information is available for statistical analysis from November 2008.</p>

 As set out in the recently published Digital Britain White Paper, the Government recognise that building out a Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) infrastructure which meets the needs of broadcasters, multiplex operators and listeners, including improving the quality of the signal, will require additional investment. However, the Digital Radio Upgrade programme, alongside the proposals on co-location and licence-renewals, will offer significant cost-savings for commercial broadcasters, some of which must support investment in improving coverage.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice when he plans to respond to the Ninth Report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights of Session 2006-07, The Meaning of Public Authority under the Human Rights Act HC 410; for what reasons he has not yet responded to the report; and if he will make a statement.

 My noble Friend the Baroness Ashton of Upholland, then Minister for Human Rights, wrote to the hon. Member following the publication of the report in question. She explained that the Government could not at that point fully address the issues surrounding section 6 of the Human Rights Act until the implications of the judgment in YL <i> v.</i> Birmingham city council were known. The Government have since legislated to overturn the principal effects of that judgment through section 145 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008, and are also committed to consulting further on the scope of the Human Rights Act. We believe those of the issues raised in the Joint Committee&#146;s report that remain relevant following these developments can best be addressed in that context.</p>

As to form and content, the 2000 Act indicates that these statements of accounts should comply with requirements which may be prescribed by regulations made by the Electoral Commission. Since 2008, the commission has been working with political parties to agree standard requirements for statements of accounts. The commission has stated that it will continue to discuss the issue with the parties, with the aim of achieving improved transparency while imposing the minimum necessary burden on parties and their staff, many of whom are volunteers.</p>

 The feasibility of deep maintenance upkeep work, such as refits and docking periods, being carried out to the Invincible Class aircraft carriers at HM Naval Base Clyde was considered as part of the Naval Base Review. It was assessed that as the berths at Faslane were designed to accommodate submarines further work would be required to make them suitable to accommodate the heavier aircraft carriers. In addition, there are insufficient waterfront facilities, such as for equipment storage and ship's company living accommodation, available to allow deep maintenance work to be carried out there. However, other maintenance work such as that carried out onboard the ship by its company and which does not require the vessel to be berthed for a significant period of time, can be carried out at the naval base.</p>

 It is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the average cost of installing a kitchen in a service family accommodation property, as the cost will depend on a number of variables.

 I was delighted to award Kent county council (KCC) a Beacon Award for its work on Olympic and Paralympic legacy earlier this year. This award recognised the council&#146;s clear vision and determined approach to games legacy and its programme of bespoke 2012 projects across the county, and Ashford is part of the supporting county partnership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="90709w0008.htm_para2"><a name="09070994001400">The Kent Co-ordinating Group for the 2012 games, on which Ashford borough council is represented, plays a key role in this partnership and aims to derive the maximum benefits from the games for the county. It has set up nine task groups to co-ordinate action across Kent on: arts; communications and media; economic development and regeneration; schools and young people; sport; tourism; transport; and volunteering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="90709w0008.htm_para3"><a name="09070994001401">Kent has already made good progress with its Olympic and Paralympic legacy in these areas through initiatives such as the Kent School Games which in 2008 had 30,000 participants from over 500 schools including those in Ashford. In terms of Paralympic legacy, KCC has increased its disability sport associate officers network to cover 15 of the 19 summer Paralympics sports and two of the four winter sports. Kent also has the highest sign up in the South East (SE) of England for the Get Set School Programme and businesses registered for Competefor, the London 2012 brokerage system. Steps have also been taken to raise awareness of the importance of tourism, leisure and hospitality businesses to the Kent economy in the lead up to the games through initiatives such as the third successful &#145;Kent's Big Day Out&#146; event to be held each year in the run up to the games. This year&#146;s event held on 28 March 2009 saw over 17,000 vouchers offered to participants for free entry to 143 venues across the county including in Ashford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="90709w0008.htm_para4"><a name="09070994001402">It is also pleasing to see that there are a broad range of initiatives and programmes across the SE associated with building a legacy from the games. The SE currently has nine projects that have been awarded the Inspire Mark of which four are in Kent. There were around 70 events held in the SE during Open Weekend which launched the Cultural Olympiad in September 2008, of which, around 10 were in Kent. To celebrate London officially becoming host to the 2012 games handover events were held in the SE on 24 August 2008. Ashford played a significant role in these celebrations hosting a Free Swim day to mark the raising of the Olympic Handover Flag.</p>

 We estimate that around 75 per cent. of the Department for International Development&#146;s (DFID) committed expenditure in India will be spent primarily in rural areas. This includes both our national level programming and our support to the state governments of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. DFID ensures that the programmes we support are designed to particularly help the poorest and most excluded groups, such as scheduled castes and tribes.

I can confirm that almost all of these additional inspectors have teaching experience, as this is one of the key criteria for selection to the role. However, there is a very small number who were former lay inspectors under the framework for inspection that was known as section 10, superseded by the current framework in September 2005. In the former framework, each inspection team included a lay inspector who was fully trained as an inspector, but had no previous experience in teaching or school management. Their purpose was to bring a lay person&#146;s view to the inspection process. A few of the most experienced of them have been employed by RISPs as additional inspectors.</p>

1. School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>
2. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DFES. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. Each table represents a change in source. From 2002-03 school based expenditure is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE). For 2001-02 and earlier years the expenditure is calculated as lines 1 to 12 less lines 29, 30, 35 and 37. This differs from the old Net Institutional Expenditure (NIE) calculation only in the treatment of meals and milk which is no longer excluded and no adjustments for balances are now made. This is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table 3 for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 and from the RO1 form previously.<br>
3. The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil. From 2002-03 onwards only the schools element of these categories is included and this accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the 2002-03 total. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>
4. Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within each sector and are drawn from the DFES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>
5. Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place during the mid to late 1990's and those LAs that did not exist either pre or post LGR are shaded out for those years.<br>
6. Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br>
7. The 1999-2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance. Consequently LAs where there entire pupil provision were educated in GM schools will show a unit cost of zero prior to 1999-2000.<br>
8. Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999-2000.<br>
9. School based expenditure in LA maintained nursery schools was not recorded in 2002-03 and comparable figures are not available for 2003-04 onwards.<br>
10. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10. Cash terms figures as reported by local authorities as at 30 June 2009.<br>

<p><a name="stpa_475"><a name="90709w0021.htm_para2"><a name="090709112000484">The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) currently encourages schools to make use of contracts and frameworks that have been competed in the market place across a range of products and services. Where arrangements for specific categories of spend have not been addressed by DCSF, a school will be directed to an appropriate collaborative contract or framework which may be owned by the local authority, OGC or some other public body.</p>

 We want all children to have an equal chance to succeed, but children from disadvantaged backgrounds need extra support from their school to make that a reality. The current formula for the distribution of the dedicated schools grant includes an element to recognise the pressures faced by those local authorities with high deprivation. For 2009-10 the DSG included &#163;3 billion for deprivation.</p>

The aim of the review is to develop a funding formula which distributes resources in line with relative need, recognising the different costs of educating particular groups of pupils and providing education in different areas. Our aim is to support schools and LAs in raising the educational achievement of all pupils and narrow achievement gaps, particularly those from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_480"><a name="90709w0022.htm_para4"><a name="090709112000879">As part of this review we are investigating how best to provide funding for additional educational needs (AEN) and have commissioned research to investigate such issues as the different types of AEN in terms of level of incidence and severity; the best measures for identifying pupils likely to under-achieve and the potential role of financial incentives in tackling deprivation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_481"><a name="90709w0022.htm_para5"><a name="090709112000880">The review is ongoing and it would not be appropriate at this stage to pre-empt its outcome. We expect to go out to consultation on proposals for a new funding formula in early 2010, after which proposals will be further developed in the light of the consultation responses.</p>

 Initial details of our plans for the roll-out of a &#145;licence to teach&#146; were set out in our White Paper &#145;Your child, your schools, our future&#146; published on 30 June 2009. In setting up specific arrangements, we want to build on the best elements of the existing registration arrangements for teachers but place more emphasis on a teacher's record of professional development and practice.</p>

We envisage that, as with current registration arrangements for teachers, the &#145;licence to teach' will follow the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and any qualification, for example a Post Graduate Certificate in Education, that a teacher may have attained as part of their initial teacher training.</p>
